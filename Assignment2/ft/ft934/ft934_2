FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Faulty assumptions about Turkey's
attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OSMAN STREATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Gardner may be right in his assessment of Theodoros Pangalos and
the Pasok government in Greece (The FT Interview, December 22). But when he
crosses the border into Turkey, he makes assumptions which are either untrue
or out of date.
The latter is certainly the case where he talks of Turkey aspiring to
membership of the European Union. Turkey is now ambivalent in its attitude
to the Union, not only because of its growing role in central Asia but also
because the EU is in many ways doing more for Turkey by way of apology for
keeping Turkey out than it would if it allowed Turkey in.
As for 'historic Greek-Turkish enmity', there is no such thing - in Turkey.
Many a traveller has commented on the absence of any anti-Greek sentiment in
Turkey, and contrasted it with the outpourings of anti-Turkish bile in
Greece.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Tide of gloom starts to ebb: There is reason to believe that
European economies are bouncing back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to be glum about Europe.
Overall output in the continent's 19 advanced industrialised countries is
thought to have fallen this year for the first time since 1975.
Western Europe's jobless total is rising inexorably. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris forecasts that 22m, or 11.5
per cent, of the region's labour force will be out of work in 1995.
Unemployment, now about 10.7 per cent, has more than doubled in the 18 years
since the first serious recession of the postwar years.
Business and consumer confidence is weak. For most, the long upsurge of
prosperity of the 1980s is a distant memory. So is the age of political
miracles that brought the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of
communism just four years ago.
With few exceptions, Europe's political leaders appear exhausted. Their
governments are deeply unpopular and, saddled with rising budget deficits,
incapable of pump-priming economic recovery.
Yet 1993 may turn out to be the year in which Europe's fortunes turned.
Although it will be remembered for recession, currency crises and
lengthening dole queues, 1993 is ending more positively for the members of
the European Union and their immediate neighbours.
The economic fundamentals have improved. More important, the sense of drift
has stopped. Businesses, governments and the European Commission have woken
up to the remorseless increase in competition worldwide. Britain's two tough
budgets this year, the 'Standort Deutschland' debate in Germany and the Bonn
government's subsequent conversion to the doctrine of more work and less
leisure, plus the Commission's white paper on Growth Competitiveness and
Employment, are symptoms of a change of mood.
More telling is what is happening in businesses in the UK and on the
continent. Companies are becoming leaner and meaner. The spectre of
competition from the newly industrialising countries of east Asia has made
the US practice of 'downsizing', with heavy job losses, respectable in
Europe. Trade unions are for the most part quiescent and in some cases
willing to aid management rationalise operations.
This month's boardroom clear-out at Metallgesellschaft, the German
industrial conglomerate, after the discovery of large losses, was novel in
its ruthlessness. Even the long-running and baffling business soap opera
centring on allegations of theft and industrial espionage against Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the Volkswagen group production director, began
with a serious purpose when VW sought out the former General Motors director
to push through a cost-cutting revolution within the group.
Such trends are sure to intensify once this month's Uruguay Round accord to
liberalise world trade comes into force. The agreement, even before
ratification, could act as a spur to companies to invest and rationalise.
Over time, the Gatt accord should promote growth, with Europe standing to
gain more than most other regions of the world from freer trade. Computer
simulations from the OECD suggest that the Uruguay Round will add at least
Dollars 270bn in 1991 prices to world income in 2002. The European Union's
share is estimated at Dollars 71bn, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of the
region's gross domestic product, while that of the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) countries is put at Dollars 38bn or 6 per cent of
regional GDP.
The real benefits should be greater. Such computer calculations take no
account of the increased business confidence that should flow from freer
trade or the fact that this month's accord has been felicitously timed after
so many years of delay and frustration.
Several European economies have performed unexpectedly well in recent
months. Britain's recovery is firmly established. German gross domestic
product grew in the third as well as the second quarter. France appears to
have touched bottom. Trends in smaller economies such as Austria,
Switzerland, Ireland and Denmark have been encouraging.
The charts, showing relative unit labour costs in manufacturing, illustrate
how several big European economies (Germany is an exception) are more
competitive internationally than they were a year ago, while Japan has
suffered a substantial set back.
Short and long-term interest rates have fallen over the past year as the
Bundesbank has cautiously eased its monetary policy. The German 'repo rate'
is at 6 per cent compared with 9.75 per cent in September 1992, just before
the first European monetary crisis, which resulted in the exit of sterling
and the lira from the exchange rate mechanism. Since then, UK and Italian
short-term rates have roughly halved. France's short-term borrowing costs
have fallen close to German levels from about 14 per cent in the 1992
currency crisis and 9 per cent in late July this year before speculative
flows forced the August decision to widen the system's fluctuation margins
to 15 per cent.
Inflation in Europe is low, with the OECD projecting a deceleration for its
European members, excluding Turkey, to an average annual rate of 2.3 per
cent by the end of 1995 from about 3.1 per cent at present. Oil prices have
fallen in real terms to levels last seen before the first oil shock of 1973.
Large gaps between potential and actual output in countries such as Italy,
France and the UK suggest that home-made inflationary pressures will remain
subdued.
To be sure, there are risks. Given the political instability of the Middle
East, only the brave would bank on oil prices remaining at their present low
levels of less than Dollars 15 a barrel. In spite of the past year's falls
in nominal interest rates, real rates are relatively high. Some of the
optimism that propelled European equity markets to new peaks this month
could evaporate if German inflation proves more stubborn than expected and
the Bundesbank slows its cautious rate-cutting policy.
In some countries, tighter fiscal policies to combat swollen budget deficits
could weaken recovery. German GDP is widely expected to fall again in the
first half of 1994 as benefit cuts, higher petrol taxes, a wage freeze for
civil servants and increased pension contributions take DM60bn from
consumers. In Britain, voters have reacted less positively than financial
markets to Mr Kenneth Clarke's November Budget, which, with that of Mr
Norman Lamont in March, will cost taxpayers a cumulative Pounds 15bn to
Pounds 17bn in three years.
The fiscal legacy of the recession years in most countries, heavy household
debts in the UK and Scandinavia, the continuing need for businesses to
restructure to stay competitive, and consequent high unemployment will make
for a joyless recovery. There will not be much of a 'feel good' factor in
Europe in the years ahead.
Europe will seem to many of its citizens to be in recession long after
growth has returned, posing a real threat to incumbent governments. Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden go to the polls next year and political
upheavals cannot be ruled out.
But looking beyond 1994, there is a good prospect of steady, if
unspectacular, growth over a prolonged period with low inflation. Western
Europe may even be moving into what future generations will call a 'golden
age'. But it could take many years before it feels that way to its
inhabitants.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Cold comfort park: Euro Disney is hoping for a happier new
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most visitors to EuroDisneyland over the holiday period are there to see
Mickey and Minnie Mouse capering around the gigantic Christmas tree. Not
Alice Ross.
Mrs Ross is a woman with a mission. She is an accountant from Delaware, in
the US, and an investor in Walt Disney, the US entertainment group. Disney
has seen its shares fall sharply this year, owing to the losses it has
incurred on its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure
company that operates the EuroDisneyland theme park. Mrs Ross was spending
two days at EuroDisneyland to see what the problem might be.
'My Disney stock has been sinking like a stone because of this place and, as
I'm over in France, I thought: 'Why not rub a little salt in the wound?' '
she said. 'I'm looking into everything. Disney holds its annual
shareholders' meeting in Delaware. I'm going to tell Mike Eisner (the Disney
chairman) what I think.'
A belligerent shareholder such as Mrs Ross is only one of the problems
plaguing Mr Eisner and his colleagues. They will spend the festive season
putting the finishing touches to the proposals they will present next month
to Euro Disney's creditor banks. They hope to persuade the banks to save the
company from collapse by agreeing to restructure its FFr20.3bn (Pounds
2.3bn) net debt. The US group has warned the banks that, unless the
restructuring is completed by March 31, Euro Disney, which reported a net
loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, will be forced to close.
In the meantime, Euro Disney is hoping for a repetition of last Christmas,
when EuroDisneyland was buoyed by a surge of visitors.
More than 30,000 people visited the theme park on New Year's eve: well below
the record of 90,000 in September last year, but much better than its low of
5,000 one icy day last January. A successful Christmas and new year would
not only help to ease the strain on Euro Disney's cashflow, but would also
act as a timely demonstration to the banks that it might be worth saving.
EuroDisneyland's employees have done their best to deck it out in festive
finery. Ivy bells dangle from the lamp posts. Mickey and Minnie Mouse skate
across the Hotel New York ice rink. The strains of Christmas muzak are piped
all over the park. Even the barber shop quartet in the Main Street shopping
arcade has ditched its usual repertoire in favour of carols. At 5pm each day
one child is chosen to light the 20-metre Christmas tree.
The decorations alone had been enough to tempt Corinne Jillit, a public
relations executive from Angouleme in western France, to bring her
four-year-old son. 'The park looks so pretty at this time of year,' she
said. 'We'd rather come in the winter, when we don't have to queue to get on
the rides.'
Werner Muller, an engineer from Hamburg visiting with his six-year-old
twins, agreed. 'Friends who came here in August had to queue for two hours
just to get on the rides,' he said. 'At this time of year the kids don't
have to wait too long, just as well given the weather.' The cold was already
proving too much for other visitors. 'It's freezing,' said Willi Ramstein,
an Italian architect, who had come to the park during a business trip to
Paris. 'The park's great, but the weather's terrible.'
Jane Pritchard from south Wales said: 'You'd think they'd sell warm hats in
this weather.' Her companion added: 'Never mind, we'll go to the Florida
park next time.' 'It's sunny there.'
The souvenir shops were packed with festive memorabilia - a Winnie the Pooh
Christmas stocking for FFr125, a Mickey Mouse Santa hat for FFr30 and a
Goofy bauble for FFr29 - but no woolly hats.
As for Mrs Ross, her mission had only just started. But on her first
impressions, she seemed to agree with the other shivering visitors. 'They
should have built this place somewhere warmer.'

FT  29 DEC 93 / Paris pales besides Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA and SOPHIA DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have been to EuroDisneyland and to Tokyo Disneyland. The weather was good
for both visits, but it is easy to see why the French one is in trouble.
Queues are one thing. At EuroDisneyland, men barge and climb over barriers.
Two hours is not an unusual queuing time. In Tokyo, queues are shorter
because everyone waits their turn properly. EuroDisneyland needs more staff.
Getting food at Tokyo Disneyland is much easier and there is a bigger
choice, including kebabs and rice and sushi. Once in EuroDisneyland, we went
to get some tea and the queues were not moving. Our dad went to look at the
front. No one was serving. So we went to another cafe.
We do not think pickpocketing is such a problem in Tokyo. In EuroDisneyland,
we were in a 90-minute queue for Pirates of the Caribbean and our mother
thought she felt somebody touching her pockets. She turned round and the
lady behind said: 'It's just me.' But mum was sure she was a pickpocket. The
staff said that it just happens and that they were not going to do anything
about it.
In Tokyo, the staff smiled and gave us toys and sweets. The staff did not
smile very much at EuroDisneyland.
We think Tokyo Disneyland is cleaner. In EuroDisneyland, the boats in It's a
small world had mud in them.
There is more space in Tokyo Disneyland, 204 acres against 136 acres in
EuroDisneyland. We thought they were equally crowded, but Tokyo felt emptier
because everybody was polite.
We think Tokyo Disneyland is more enjoyable to visit, because we were better
treated there.
Laura (10) and Sophia (8) moved from Paris to Tokyo in September.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: From New Orleans to synthesizers - Jazz in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jazz fans have reason to be nostalgic and partisan: there really have been
golden eras when new and groundbreaking talent queued for a hearing. In the
1930s, swing was the thing; in the 1940s, bebop burst on to the scene; in
the 1950s the cool school opened, and in the 1960s and 1970s, free music and
then fusion marked the extremes of commerciality. If the 1980s are
remembered as the time bebop boomed again, alongside acid dance, what will
the 1990s come to represent? A consolidation of world beat in jazz, the
post-modernisation of bebop in the new chamber jazz or the return to basic
principles?
Well, 1993 seemed to encapsulate the lot. From the sepia-tinged New Orleans
beginnings to the synthesized way ahead, the history of jazz was personified
last year in the swinging Lionel Hampton Orchestra, the retro-classical
trumpet tones of Wynton Marsalis, the new world of improvisation in South
African Bheki Mseleku and the young urban angst of New Yorker Steve Coleman.
The annual migration to Europe of sax statesmen such as Sonny Rollins,
Johnny Griffin and Jackie McLean kept the movement in context while the Five
Blind Boys of Alabama, as well as Harry Connick Jr, reminded us that 'jazz'
can still deliver more fundamental pleasure.
Who will light the way in 1994? For this critic at least, a glow of pleasure
lingers from saxophonist David Murray's summer visit. The tidal energy and
burning ideas which powered the trio through his own neo-bop compositions
surpassed almost anything else on offer and his return is eagerly awaited.
Besides Murray, two other saxophonists who continue to illuminate new fields
of improvisation are Joe Henderson and Norwegian Jan Garbarek. Though one
blows warm and the other cold, they share the authority and inner peace
which gives their different sounds an embracing sense of purpose.
For sheer excitement and exoticism, pianists like Don Pullen and Randy
Weston set the standard for 1994. Weston, the beatnik's role model,
continues to fleck his rich weave of Afro-jazz with Middle Eastern colour,
to intoxicating effect, as seen at the Royal Festival Hall. Even Ahmad
Jamal, who once provided the airy framework for Miles Davis' early
recordings, is finding a more dense style and the vaulted arches of the
Union Chapel last spring teemed with the splintering chords and interlinking
quotes borne by the surging Jamal pulse.
In contrast to the channelled exuberance of contemporary piano-led groups,
the Paul Motian school of jazz has cultivated a kind of speccy and earnest
introspection. This has been most noticeable in guitar players, exemplified
by John Scofield. Last year the young fogeys of jazz were gently teased by
guitarist Bill Frisell's cranky dissection of American composers from Ives
to Madonna at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Back at the Union Chapel, as part of
the new expanded London Jazz Festival, the jazz intelligentsia were
exercised by the intricate workings of master guitarist Jim Hall, one of the
most original yet underrated jazz musicians around today.
Thoughtful and reflective music like Henderson's and Hall's will
characterise the 1990s - unless their minor scales are sidelined by the
pianists.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: Happily, some triumphs stick in the memory -
Television in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that 1993 was the year when ITV went down the drain, liked what it
found, and stayed there; and when the BBC was preoccupied with
administrative tribulations - the agonies arising from 'Producer Choice',
anxiety over the government's attitude towards the licence fee, the position
of the Director-General who was found to be neither on the BBC staff nor
paying tax in quite the expected manner - it is astounding how many good
programmes there were.
Of course boo-boos, stumers and downright dogs appeared in the usual
quantities. ITV piloted an Anglicised version of that inimitable American
comedy The Golden Girls and, even though we told them that shifting the
action to Sussex and trying to get people such as Wendy Craig to deliver New
York wisecracks in Surbiton accents was a disaster, they persisted and made
a series called Brighton Belles. Then, when it bombed, they had to pull it
out of the schedules.
BBC2 mounted a live 'animal watch' series called Nightshift in which the
degree of wild eyed enthusiasm from the presenters was in inverse proportion
to the amount of activity among the animals. When the pitch of the voices
approached that of hysteria it meant the foxes and badgers had gone to
sleep, and you could safely switch off before the scene cut to some murky
garden where nothing was happening. There was approximately the same amount
of interest in what Channel 4 decided would be the next big spectator sport
after darts (whatever happened to televised darts?) and sumo wrestling
(whatever . . . ). In the event, World Chess: Short v. Kasparov proved
marginally less interesting than watching blancmange set.
Happily, however, it is mainly the pleasures and triumphs which stick in the
memory, and although recent programmes come most readily to mind  - in
drama, for instance, To Play The King and The Buddha Of Suburbia from the
BBC and Cracker from ITV - you find when you go back through the lists that
there have been treasures throughout the year. Staying with drama, Channel
4's Lipstick On Your Collar was not Dennis Potter's best series, yet there
were several set piece musical numbers including 'Unchained Melody' and
'Blue Suede Shoes' which I would happily watch over and over again.
The performance of Honeysuckle Weeks as 12-year-old Kitty in BBC2's Goggle
Eyes, adapted by Deborah Moggach from Anne Fine's book, should win an award
from somebody: she made the emotions of a child whose mother finds herself a
new man vivid and touchingly funny. In Lady Chatterley on BBC1 one of the
Redgrave clan, Joely Richardson, set a trend in getting her kit off which
was followed later in the year by cousin Jemma Redgrave in The Buddha Of
Suburbia. However, it was not so much the female nudity in Lady Chatterley
which caused the fuss.
So many female viewers offered up hymns to Sean Bean's bottom, that they
were rewarded in the autumn with a reprise when Bean stripped off again for
A Woman's Guide To Adultery on ITV which wins the Dunkley Naff Drama Of The
Year Award. In 1993 political correctness was more evident than ever on
British television, so it was a good job it was women ogling a male
posterior and not the other way about. Unfortunately Ken Russell never found
quite the right approach or tone for putting Lady C on television, so apart
from the usual British fuss over the human body it turned out to be a
non-event.
Once again there were very few original single television dramas, though
late in the year BBC2 screened a 'Performance' series offering several
impressive examples of theatre plays, including Fiona Shaw's Hedda Gabler.
Among the few single dramas that did turn up, Roddy Doyle's adaptation of
his own book, The Snapper, on BBC2 proved outstanding. Directed in Dublin by
Stephen Frears it brought to the television depiction of Irish life a degree
of humanity which is almost invariably missing from the Irish material we
normally see on television.
Honours for the best British serial drama of the year must be fought out
between Granada's Cracker, with Robbie Coltrane playing the drinking,
flirting, gambling police psychologist; and BBC1's Between The Lines, also a
police series, which so obviously stood out even though it did not manage to
sustain the pace, tension, and overall brilliance of the opening series. It
did still manage to combine splendid exterior entertainment with interior
political and social sinews in a manner that is not often achieved on
television, and very rarely beyond a single series.
The drama of the year, however, was not British but German. Having given us
Heimat in 1986, a great pantechnicon of a series about several generations
of life in rural Germany which you might have thought was a once in a
lifetime effort, Edgar Reitz excelled himself this year with The Second
Heimat: A New Generation. Presumably the longest finite drama series ever
made for television - excluding soap operas, in other words - this extended
to 13 two-hour episodes and told the story of modern Germany from the early
1960s. It was intelligent, consistently well acted, charming, provocative,
informative, occasionally infuriating in its dedication to modern music,
and, once you were properly involved, utterly engrossing. In north west
London viewers sought out cassettes of missed episodes with the passion of
philatelists completing sets of stamps.
In another weak year for comedy the top series was, once again, Have I Got
News For You on BBC2. Most memorable of all their episodes was that in which
Roy Hattersley's place was taken by a tub of lard, a programme that proved,
thanks largely though not wholly to Paul Merton, to be much funnier than the
later programme when Hattersley finally turned up in person.
At the year's end only two brand new comedy series seem worth recalling:
Chef on BBC1 with Lenny Henry playing, and occasionally over playing, a
prima donna cook; and Goodnight Sweetheart, also on BBC1, starring Nicholas
Lyndhurst as a television repairman who finds a time warp in a London
alleyway (it does not affect anyone else) and regularly travels back to a
pub in the era of the London Blitz. Absolutely Fabulous would walk off with
the laurels but for the fact that 1993 brought us only a repeat screening of
last year's series. The second series will be with us in spring 1994, thank
goodness. The failure of the new ITV companies to produce even a single
nominee for 'Best Situation Comedy' was rightly emphasised by presenter
Jonathan Ross in this month's British Comedy Awards.
Once more the arts-and-culture series of the year was Without Walls on
Channel 4 which has now succeeded in making all its competitors look
old-fashioned if not downright tatty. From Rory Bremner on Dame Edna to a
series on the effect of drugs upon the arts ('The Art Of Tripping'), from
'Diana Sex Goddess' to the sociology of the Rolls Royce, the series has led
the way and set the pace. BBC1's Omnibus gave us a marvellously mischievous
programme from Kriss Rusmanis on the truth about orchestral conductors; and
the best single arts documentary of the year was Sheree Folkson's
fascinatingly contrived investigation of Gericault's painting, 'The Raft Of
The Medusa' in BBC2's series Every Picture Tells A Story.
The documentary prize must go to Thatcher: The Downing Street Years,
provided there is a separate wildlife category to allow an award for
Attenborough's Life In The Freezer, a magnificent BBC1 series on Antarctica
which, as Attenborough himself would be the first to concede, was made
possible by a big team of astoundingly hardy and inventive film makers. The
Thatcher programmes were unmissable not merely because the title role was
played with such ferocious egotism, but because the series as a whole
proved, perhaps for the first time, that as a tool of history television can
be as useful as books. It may even be superior, once the history in question
 -as in this instance - enters the period for which we possess a huge
archive of television news.
A special award for Striving To Tell The Truth About Aids On Television
Despite The Tunnel Vision Of The Industry's Politically Correct Agenda
Setters, would normally go automatically to Joan Shenton of the independent
company Meditel, the only person who, from the very beginning, has insisted
on keeping a level head and publicising the evidence, even when it does not
put haloes on homosexuals. This year, however, it goes to Barraclough Carey,
another independent production company, which produced The Plague, a
four-part series for Channel 4 surveying the entire history of Aids. The
last programme rather let down the rest, allowing an instinct for compassion
to overcome the necessary rigour of good journalism (it was weak, for
instance, on the true incidence of Aids in sub-Saharan Africa, on the
precise practices of the British haemophiliac who is supposed to have given
Aids to four women, and on the comparative global seriousness of the
disease) yet the series was still such a powerful, admirable and extensive
piece of work that it deserves the prize.
Speaking of good journalism, 1993 was the year when ITV carelessly and
stupidly abandoned This Week, First Tuesday and Viewpoint, three series
known for the seriousness of their approach and the high quality of many of
their results. Having been told repeatedly by the new men (yes, men) in ITV
not to whine for a golden past but to wait and see what was put in its
place, we have now begun to see - and very depressing it is.
There is one spark of hope. The Discovery Channel has announced that, having
shown a First Tuesday programme this month, it has now commissioned
Yorkshire TV to continue the series throughout 1994. I must admit that when
ITV began its systematic abandonment of grown up television it never
occurred to me that the satellite channels might step into the breach. Let
us hope it is the beginning of a major trend: it is high time satellite
television ended its reliance on American, Australian and British repeats
and began to put money into the origination of proper programmes.
No doubt that will take some time. Meanwhile it seems pretty clear that 1994
is going to be the BBC's year.

The thought of professional directors and choreographers going into
Wandsworth prison and drilling the inmates for a production of a big
theatrical musical would be peculiarly satisfying, whatever the title
involved.
When it happens to be Guys And Dolls with its cast of card sharps and con
men the idea becomes irresistible. Guys, Dolls And D-Wing (BBC2, 8.00) is a
documentary which records the process.
Given the speed with which stills photographers from the advertising
industry switch these days into directing Hollywood movies, it was a bright
thought to have David Bailey try his hand at directing a studio drama.
The result is Who Dealt? (C4, 9.30) a half-hour story about a woman, in a
game of bridge with her husband's friends, who begins to talk too much.
Hard to establish exactly how much has been edited out of Beeban Kidron's
account of prostitution in New York, but Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps And Their
Johns (C4, 11.10) is reckoned to be the most explicit programme of its sort
ever shown on British television.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: An ultra-violet 'Peter Pan' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some people may like Peter Pan at Sadler's Wells, though it should come with
a warning. This is not Peter Pan with dialogue, wit, symbolism and a story
that many of us admire. Nor is this the old Sadler's Wells that many of us
remember with affection. Scarcely a monument to a better yesterday remains,
save that the place is still in Rosebery Avenue. This is regimented,
educational theatre backed by the London Arts Board with the help of
Czechoslovakia.
Not the new republics of the 1990s, but the Czechoslovakia before the Berlin
Wall came down and when it made sense to do things in mime because there was
no guaranteed freedom of expression.
The Black Light Theatre of Prague's production is interesting, if you have
not seen the techniques before, for a few minutes because it has some clever
staging and visual effects. The coffee cups float up and down, brightness
falls from the air, the lighting is ultra-violet. It does not take long for
such effects to wear thin. If you can float one object, you can float
another, and another, and make a crocodile crawl across the floor in lights.
Twice is enough.
The Prague production makes the nearly always fatal mistake of seeking to
combine too many art forms in one: dance, music, visual show-off while
trying to tell a story. The dance is sometimes pretty. The music is varied,
but always banal - never fast enough to have zip, never slow enough to have
feeling: real old communist central Europe. The story is lost. The real
Peter Pan has some very good lines and intriguing psychology. It ends with
Mr Darling retreating into the kennel to which he had banished the dog on
the night the Darlings went out to dinner. In the Black Light version this
is omitted.
If you go to see, be sure to buy a copy of the programme, read it and keep
it. In terms of pretentiousness, it is a collector's item.
Sadler's Wells Theatre until January 8. (071) 434 0909

FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: Learning to read between the lines - A CV can be
economical with the truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Years ago, CVs were dry, formal documents. Without much attention to either
presentation style or self-aggrandisement, people simply reported rather
mundanely and factually their biographical details.
This quaint, unselfconscious approach has, in the same way as British party
political broadcasts, been taken over by the ad men, the publicity gurus and
the public relations people. Politicians have learned the meaning and virtue
of the soundbite and the impression of the Italian suit versus the donkey
jacket.
The US influence of 'talking up' nearly all personal achievements means
selectors must be pretty subtle when reading between the lines. Likewise,
the general public are now offered the benefits of CV consultants to improve
the way they come across. No life is too ordinary, no work history too
boring, no pastimes too menial to be considered unworthy of the image
treatment.
CV consultants are strangers whose job is to take the details of a rich,
varied and complicated life and precis it into a carefully thought-out and
laid-out page of A4. There are those who believe this is really money for
old rope and they can happily, confidently and money-savingly do it
themselves. After all, they argue, they know the life history facts and the
purpose of the CV best of all.
Psychologists call the task of CV consultants 'impression management'. It
means quite simply 'attempts to change, alter and shape the impression that
others receive'. Through variations in dress, vocabulary and possessions, we
all try to create a favourable impression of ourselves to selected others.
If we put in so much effort at the job interview, it makes sense to spend as
much, if not more, time and money on the CV.
As a consequence of the professional treatment, the most dreary and ordinary
individual with a frankly mediocre, even failed work history can look like a
success. No one, it seems, can fail to benefit from the skill of the
impression management professional. Read a peer's CV and the way he or she
describes a modest achievement or mundane duty, and one can see the benefits
of being economical with the truth.
While this may be good for the job hunter, CV-manship certainly presents a
problem for the selection and recruitment specialist. If all students are
Einstein-like geniuses, all workers are productive Stakhanovites, and all
entrepreneurs are neo-Bransons, how can one distinguish between them?
There are three important clues in the modern CV. First what is left out.
Beware the CV which ignores or fudges chronological order: people may prefer
to ignore long periods on the dole, a failed early career, an unwelcome
start at one level. All sorts of important information may be omitted in the
interests of the applicant.
Selectors should perhaps have a checklist of information they really need
and obtain it from the applicant if the CV does not provide it.
Second, there are the grand generalisations. 'My department had a Dollars 2m
(Pounds 1.3m) budget' does not mean the applicant was in charge of it.
'Co-ordinated and facilitated staffing issues' could mean anything.
Third, can the information be verified? The more difficult it appears to
check, the more likely that it is a fudge. Beware the colonial experience
where applicants held impressive-sounding jobs, even if they were genuine,
in some far-flung outpost where their skin colour and ability to speak
English ensured them senior positions. Names and addresses of organisations
on the CV help a great deal.
The paradox of CV-manship is that there may well be an inverse relationship
between the CV and person behind it. Over-egging the pudding - glossy
brochures with career histories spanning several pages - suggests the
cumulative attempts of desperate outplacement consultants. The greater the
flourish, the more the prizes, the quicker the promotion - the more ordinary
the individual.
The author offers a modest CV and is based at University College London.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: The intellectual organisation - What will
companies be like in the next century? In the first of a three-part series
this week, Charles Handy argues that the main challenge for employers will
be keeping and motivating staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES HANDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ironic, but just when capitalism has so clearly triumphed over
communism, we are seeing Karl Marx's great dream come true in a way which he
could never have envisaged.
In ten years' time, in most successful businesses, the workers will truly
'own the means of production' because those means will be in their own heads
and at their fingertips.
It is now widely accepted that by that date 70 per cent or more of the work
that we do will require brain skills not manual skills, and when that
happens, the cliche that our people are our greatest asset will acquire a
hard financial reality.
That is when we will take notice.
Already, many a business has a market value three or four times the worth of
its fixed assets. To call the gap 'goodwill' is to trivialise it. That gap
is the market's estimate of the worth of the intellectual property in the
business - not just its patent rights, brands and research in progress, but
the skills, knowledge and experience of its people.
When Microsoft briefly topped the charts earlier this year, the New York
Times commented that all there was to put your money on was 'the imagination
of the workers'. No one can truly own that imagination except the workers
themselves, and they can walk out of the door at any time.
The emerging importance of intellectual property, broadly defined, is going
to change many things beyond recognition.
When every business that pursues higher added value thinks in the ways that
financial service organisations, advertising agencies and consultancies
already do, and seeks to turn its intellect into profit, what was of
marginal importance will become commonplace.
Shareholders, for instance, can no longer be owners, in any real sense, of
other people's brains, but only investors or, more accurately, backers. The
short term will then, I imagine, feature even more, for who would take a
long-term bet on an organisation built on the imagination of its workers?
The short term will also dominate the minds of individuals. Once they
realise that they are the key assets of a business, they will be more
determined than ever to build those personal assets and to take them
wherever they will be most productive. Loyalty will be first to one's own
career, then to one's profession and only thirdly to the employer.
More and more people will pursue 'actors' careers', seeing life as a
sequence of roles in projects, sometimes within one large organisation or
hopping among several, or behaving as independents with a 'portfolio' of
roles.
Some will do this out of choice, seeing themselves as potential stars in
their bit of the world; others will do it of necessity, as organisations
pick and choose talents for projects and discard the ones they don't need.
Large parts of organisations could ultimately become a collection of project
teams, harnessing the intellectual assets around a task or an assignment,
rather as a consultancy company or an advertising agency does now.
To the individual, the organisation will offer, not the promise of a planned
career, but a series of opportunities which one's skill profile may or may
not fit. All the world will then, in a sense, be a stage: a sequence of
teams with a changing cast of performers, backed by a small continuing
production team.
That will not be an easy or a comfortable world, or even a very desirable
one, but the tide of technology and competition cannot be halted, oven if
you don't like the stuff it brings in with it. We must ride the tide, not
fight it.
The challenge for business will be to find ways to bind to themselves the
players on whom they can depend for the future.
Good conditions of work and employment will not be enough, for there will
often be comparable ones around the corner. To be a 'preferred employer' it
will be necessary to make the vital staff into quasi-partners, with more
share ownership and bonus schemes, so that they share the future of the
organisation, good and bad, and to invest at the same time in the constant
regeneration of their intellectual assets, despite the possibility that the
regenerated assets will leave.
It would not be unreasonable, for instance, to expect to invest the
traditional 10 per cent depreciation (or regeneration) allowance of both
time and salary in the education and development of each individual.
Keeping staff is one thing, working them efficiently is another. Project
leadership will become the key to corporate performance.
To build a cohesive team out of the requisite mix of different roles and
talents is never easy, as any theatre director will confirm. Hierarchy cuts
little ice with stars, for as their leader you have only as much power and
influence as they allow you.
Leadership in the world of people assets draws its power from the people
over whom it is exercised. It is a world where loyalty has to be earned from
the individual, not demanded. Do all this, and there is more. A collection
of project teams, no matter how well led and how well starred, is not in
itself an organisation. These teams have to be welded together to give them
the clout they need in the market.
The 'intellectual organisation' needs to be both small and big, local and
global, tight and loose. It needs, in short, to be federal.
Federalism is too little understood this side of the Channel and the
Atlantic. It is always unfashionable in monarchical or oligarchical regimes
because it is built on shared power, compromise and negotiation. Unfamiliar,
unpopular and hard to make work, it is nevertheless the way all
organisations are heading, because centrally-directed systems are too
expensive, too often wrong, too restrictive and too imprisoning for the
human soul. When that human soul is your key asset, you have to give it
heed. To do that, and remain efficient, is the leading challenge facing our
organisations.
The author has written many books on organisations and their futures. His
new book, The Empty Raincoat, will be published by Hutchinson in February.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: RSA inquiry to publish interim findings in
February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the beginning of this year the Royal Society for the encouragement of
Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) challenged a number of British
companies to take a fresh look at the role of business, its underlying
purpose, how it operates, how its performance is measured and its role in
society.
The original inspiration, according to the RSA, was a lecture by Charles
Handy (see article above) entitled 'What is a company for?'
The result was the establishment of the RSA's three-year inquiry -
Tomorrow's Company: the role of business in a changing world - backed by 25
participating companies ranging from Cable and Wireless, Cadbury and Unipart
to IBM, Manpower and National Westminster Bank. Their collective aim is to
look at the issues from the perspective of different stakeholders -
customers, suppliers, providers of capital, employees and community - and to
try to develop a shared vision of the future.
At the same time a network of more than 400 interested individuals - drawn
mainly from large and small businesses - was formed to assist the
participating senior executives in their task.
The RSA hopes to widen the debate in mid-February when the inquiry team
publishes its interim findings. The first major platform for discussing them
will be at the Tomorrow's Company National Conference on March 17 at the
West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. This occasion will be an opportunity for
the team to test its ideas in preparation for the final report, due to be
published in 1995.
For further information on the RSA Inquiry call Anna Gorely on 071-930-5115
and for information on the conference call Gay Webb on 0532-832600.

FT  29 DEC 93 / House sales 'to rise 15%': Homes more affordable than for
many years, says Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market recovery will gather pace next year, Halifax, Britain's
biggest mortgage lender, says today. It expects house sales to increase by
15 per cent in 1994 while prices could rise on average by about 5 per cent.
Halifax says in its new year forecasts that it does not expect measures
announced in last month's Budget, including further phased reductions in
mortgage tax relief, to inhibit the recovery. 'Houses are as affordable now
as they have been at any time in the past decade, and are probably as
affordable as they have been since the 1960s in many parts of the country,'
it says.
It adds that the average mortgage repayment as a percentage of male average
earnings has fallen to 22 per cent compared with a peak of almost 50 per
cent in 1989-90.
In spite of this the number of house sales in England and Wales was thought
to have risen by about only 5 per cent this year while average UK house
prices increased by about only 2 per cent.
Halifax expects the pace of recovery to accelerate next year as the general
economic recovery becomes more pronounced and fears of unemployment
diminish.
'We expect activity levels to rise by around 15 per cent in 1994, probably
in excess of 1.3m house moves in England and Wales,' it said.
That would compare with a low of 1.1m moves in 1992 and a peak of 2.1m in
1988.
Halifax expects sales next year to remain 'well below the 1.6m to 1.8m level
which was the norm for much of the 1980s'. It forecasts that further
improvement is likely to be modest with annual sales stabilising at about
1.5m and annual price inflation likely to remain in single figures for the
foreseeable future.
'Over a long period of history, house prices have had a fairly stable
relationship with earnings. We expect this to continue. The days of boom and
bust in the UK housing market are hopefully ended and we are seeing a return
to housing being safe if not spectacular investment,' it says.
Halifax forecasts that net mortgage lending will rise from Pounds 17bn to
Pounds 18bn this year to Pounds 21bn to Pounds 22bn next year.
Lending was expected to rise gradually by about Pounds 2bn a year through
the 1990s. This would still leave mortgage lending below the 1988 peak of
Pounds 40bn.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Bargain-seekers encourage retailers' new year hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bargain-seekers have flocked to Britain's shops for this week's winter
sales, continuing the pre-Christmas buying spree and encouraging retailers'
hopes of a buoyant 1994.
Travel companies said there had been a surge in holiday bookings. 'I would
guess we are 60 to 70 per cent up on last year on bookings for summer
holidays,' said Mr Russell Amerasekera of Thomas Cook.
At Liberty's store in London's Regent Street, whose sale began yesterday, Mr
Tony Salem, retail managing director, said: 'I've not seen anything like
this for at least four years.'
In London and other parts of the UK, stores coped with crowds, though
yesterday's snow held back sales in parts of the north of England. The
MetroCentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle upon Tyne, had 133,000 visitors on
Monday and almost as many yesterday. Sheffield's Meadowhall Centre said
Monday had been very busy, with people arriving at 8.30am for breakfast in
stores that opened early.
'A number of our stores reported record takes from the first sales day,'
said Mr Ron Woodman, MetroCentre's marketing manager. 'There's a move to
cash rather than credit.'
Shops had even sold plastic Christmas trees to Norwegians, regular visitors
to the north-east for winter shopping. Icelandic shoppers were also buying
heavily.
Mr Salem said overseas shoppers were now more in evidence, with a long queue
at Liberty's value-added tax refund counter for export sales.
At Selfridges, the department store in London's Oxford Street, Mr Tim
Daniels, managing director, said sales figures were better than expected, up
by around 10 per cent on last year. 'There seems to be a lot more confidence
around,' he said. As in other stores, menswear was particularly sought
after.
Mr Daniels, who is also chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said
other stores in the street, such as Marks and Spencer, had experienced
sizeable sales increases. 'The whole street is very strong.'
In Selfridge's porcelain and glassware department, the Villeroy and Boch
porcelain tableware section reported a threefold sales increase. The store's
audio section reported sales of mobile phones up sharply.
Like the retailers, Mr Amerasekera at Thomas Cook ascribed the rise in
business to a return of consumer confidence. But discounting also played a
part.
In spite of security alerts, shoppers yesterday streamed into Belfast for
the sales. Shops in central Belfast said business was brisker than for many
years. Travel agents reported particularly high demand.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Private-sector pay rises 'are continuing to slow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pay increases in the private sector are continuing to slow, says Incomes
Data Services, an independent pay monitoring body. But it adds that they are
still ahead of those in the public sector, where the government's 1.5 per
cent ceiling has held firm.
IDS says in research published today that many private-sector wage deals
recorded in the fourth quarter have been worth less than 2 per cent.
'This represents a further edging down from levels of settlements which were
already very low by the standards of recent decades,' says the report. IDS
records the size of pay settlements, but does not cover earnings, which are
higher because of bonus pay, overtime and other extras.
IDS says public-sector bargaining groups have settled this year within the
government's 1.5 per cent limit on the increase in wage bills. As a result,
public-sector wage levels have generally trailed those in the private
sector.
It says that two-thirds of pay deals reported from the private sector since
October recorded wage rises between 1 per cent and 2.9 per cent. In the
July-September quarter, two-thirds of private-sector settlements were worth
2 per cent to 3.9 per cent. While pay freezes remain uncommon - only three
were reported in the last quarter - just three wage deals were worth about 4
per cent or more.
IDS says: 'Most current settlements are still comfortably ahead of the cost
of living.'
The pay databank published by the Confederation of British Industry today
shows manufacturing pay deals averaging 2.2 per cent in the three months to
the end of November, compared with 2.3 per cent in the previous quarter. But
payrolls in manufacturing were up by less than 1 per cent in the year to
September, reflecting improved efficiency. Manufacturers cited inability to
raise prices and low profit levels as the main constraints on pay.
In the quarter to November, pay deals in services were down from 2.6 per
cent to a provisional 2.4 per cent.
The CBI said pay freezes of up to 12 months had been reported by a quarter
of manufacturers and one in six service companies.

FT  29 DEC 93 / MP slams managers' plans to buy pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday rejected charges of conflict of interest against
managers planning to stage buy-outs of pits they have been preparing for
privatisation.
Mr Kim Howells, Labour MP for Pontypridd, accused managers of enjoying an
unfair advantage because of their involvement in the run-up to
privatisation.
Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Howells, a former researcher for the National
Union of Mineworkers, said: 'There is an appalling conflict of interest
here. You cannot run (the industry) down and then offer it to management so
they can make profits themselves. A lot of people have suffered and a lot of
miners have lost their jobs.'
His comments came after Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said he would
not be surprised if some managers were interested in buy-outs. 'They know a
great deal about the business, its risks and its potential,' he said.
British Coal said the managers 'have been steering operations to make sure
supply matches demand and to make it competitive in a very harsh
marketplace. To conclude that the industry has been shrunk to make it easier
for the existing management to buy doesn't seem credible.'
A number of issues had still to be resolved before managers would be able to
mount buy-out offers, British Coal said. The precise split of assets between
the five regions named in the coal privatisation bill had still to be
decided. The issue of liability for mining subsidence and for health claims
from former miners has also yet to be resolved.
Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said his union would fight privatisation
'in whatever form it takes'.

FT  29 DEC 93 / North-south divide narrows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower house prices have led to a significant narrowing of house price
differentials between different areas of the country, says Halifax.
Prices in southern England, hit worst by the recession, are now only 15 per
cent above the national average compared with nearly 60 per cent higher in
1988. Northern prices are only 15 per cent below the national average
compared with 35 per cent lower five years ago.
The society said regional economies and unemployment rates had converged
during the recession, so it did not expect price differentials to widen
again as the housing market improved. Lower prices and falling interest
rates meant that the cost of buying a home had fallen substantially in every
region.
'For those in work, earnings have risen by more than 30 per cent over the
past four years so the Pounds 280 payment is a much smaller proportion of
earnings than it would have been in the late 1980s,' said the society.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Directors upbeat on jobs outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's Budget appears to have boosted optimism among directors about
prospects for their businesses in 1994 and may encourage them to increase
staff, the Institute of Directors says in its latest business opinion
survey.
Compared with October, the survey found a slight increase in overall
business confidence among a representative sample of 300 of the institute's
33,000 members polled in the last week of November and the first two weeks
of December.
However, while the Budget had little impact on their overall assessment of
the UK economy, those polled after November 30 were markedly more bullish
about taking on staff and on the outlook for their companies.
The institute said that 47 per cent of directors were more optimistic about
the economy in November and December than they were six months before,
compared with 42 per cent in October. The balance of those expressing more
optimism over those who were less optimistic increased to 32 percentage
points from 26 points in October.
Although the institute warned that businesses would not be able to assess
the full impact of the Budget until April, when tax increases take effect,
the Budget appeared to have made good impression the 221 directors
interviewed in December.
Altogether 61 per cent of those polled after the Budget were more optimistic
about the prospects for their own company against 52 per cent immediately
before the Budget and 56 per cent in October.
The balance of company optimists over pessimists increased to 53 points
post-Budget from 34 points immediately before, and 43 points in October.
The survey's answers on jobs showed a similar post-Budget rise, with the
balance predicting higher employment in their companies increasing to 37
points after the Budget from 19 points in the last week of November and 25
points in October.
Mr Peter Morgan, institute director-general, said the survey showed
'cautious but slowly increasing optimism about the economic and business
prospects for next year'.
He said low inflation and interest rates, falling unemployment and the
recent Gatt agreement to lower trade barriers made for an 'extremely
encouraging' outlook in 1994.
The institute's survey showed that volumes, orders and profits were
continuing on a gradual upwards trend with confidence above average in the
manufacturing and business services sectors.
The biggest preoccupation of directors over the next six months will be
maintaining and stimulating demand.

FT  29 DEC 93 / IRA greets peace pressure with bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA yesterday responded to British pressure to endorse the UK-Irish
peace declaration by mounting a low-level bomb attack on a police station in
West Belfast.
The attack, the third since the IRA ended its Christmas ceasefire with a
mortar attack on Monday, occurred around midnight when a small bomb was
thrown at a Royal Ulster Constabulary station on Springfield Road, west
Belfast. There were no injuries.
The bomb followed a warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
that the IRA would face a renewed security clampdown if it rejected the
declaration.
Unionist leaders yesterday accused the IRA of seeking to use low-level
violence to wring more concessions from the British government.
'This type of violence has been deliberately planned to show that they (the
IRA) are capable of very controlled terrorism - each unit seems to be doing
one incident in turn,' said Mr Sammy Wilson, a senior official of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party.
British officials in Belfast denied that they were prepared to make further
concessions, and insisted that the initiative now lay with the IRA. The IRA,
and its political wing Sinn Fein, are understood to be holding intensive
consultations with their members across the province about the response to
the peace declaration.
But with neither side prepared to make public concessions, and the IRA
reported to be increasingly split over the proposals, Sinn Fein yesterday
said it would be 'weeks, rather than days' before it issued a formal
response. Insisting that Mr Hurd's statement was 'counterproductive', Mr
Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein official, said it had not yet decided about the
declaration.
'We have not said 'no', but we have not said 'yes' either,' he said. 'We
will not give into this type of pressure from the British government,' he
said.
Local political sources yesterday said British officials were expected to
hold further meetings with republican sources over the next week for further
'explanations' about the peace declaration. A central issue is expected to
be IRA demands for political amnesty for its prisoners.
But in spite of fears that violence could undermine the peace process,
leaders from the Ulster Unionist Party and the nationalist Social Democratic
and Labour party yesterday maintained a cautiously optimistic tone.
It said: 'Given the knee-jerk nature of so much of Northern Irish politics,
it is probably encouraging that Sinn Fein is taking as long as they are.'
Meanwhile, Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, dismissed as 'absolute
bunkum' reports of a grassroots rebellion in the party over its leadership's
endorsement of the peace declaration.

BAe and Taiwan Aerospace, 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed
a deal in January 1993 to form a 50-50 venture to produce the RJ family of
75- to 115-seat regional passenger jets for assembly in Britain and Taiwan.
But talks stalled over financing and technology transfer to Taiwan.

<TEXT>
A second wave of civilians was evacuated from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital
besieged by Serbs, yesterday evening, agencies report.
The evacuees, mainly pensioners, war-wounded or mothers with children,
boarded three buses returning from an earlier shuttle to the nearby
Serb-held district of Lukavica. Most were to go to Split in Croatia, with
some going on to third countries. Other evacuees were to go to Serb
territory.
The long-delayed operation had been blocked several times by fighting along
the intended route or by bureaucracy. A month ago, the convoy was abruptly
cancelled when Bosnian Croats failed to provide promised buses.
An official from the city authorities who organised the evacuation estimated
that only about 1,100 of the 1,265 people on the list had actually left.
Sarajevo has been under siege by Serb forces since April, 1992. More than
50,000 residents have been killed or wounded by shelling and sniping since
the siege began.
The Socialists of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic failed to win an
overall majority despite a repeat vote in 45 constituencies in Serbia, party
officials said yesterday, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade.
The party said the new round had not substantially altered the outcome,
according to unofficial results. The first poll saw the Socialists returned
to parliament as the biggest party, with 123 of the 250 seats.

The government yesterday announced a Pounds 12m three-year anti-smoking

FT  29 DEC 93 / TUC wins more in court awards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress may have won more than Pounds
300m in legal awards for members last year, the TUC says in its annual
survey of union legal services today. The figure is higher than the 1991
level even though total union membership declined.
Most of the 123,000 legal cases taken up by unions in 1992 concerned
personal injury at work. Other issues included employment protection,
criminal injury, road traffic accidents, copyright and libel.
The figures do not include almost Pounds 20m won in compensation deducted by
the government in return for welfare benefits under the 'clawback' rules;
money gained through occupational benefit schemes, or cash won at tribunal
hearings over wrongful dismissal, sex discrimination and state benefits.
The survey covered 24 unions, representing almost three-quarters of union
membership. Those unions won a total of Pounds 228m, suggesting a total for
all unions of Pounds 310m.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Oftel to look for lessons abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, plans next summer to publish comparisons of telecom services in
Britain and those in the US and France, Andrew Adonis writes.
He will focus on short-comings in services available to UK consumers
compared with those in the two other countries.
Mr Cruickshank, who visited the US recently, is keen to find out why levels
of phone ownership among lower-income groups appear to be markedly higher in
the US than in the UK. 'I particularly want to direct our energies to areas
where regulation may be stifling innovation,' he said.
Mr Cruickshank recently visited several leading US operators including
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and was 'impressed' by the quality of
innovation.
Like the UK, the US has a broadly competitive regime for the provision of
telecom services. Oftel has chosen France because of its reputation for
providing advanced and efficient services even though France Telecom is a
state-owned monopoly.
Mr Cruickshank's US visit included discussions with politicians and the
Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, about the
terms for full competition between US and UK operators in each other's
markets.
The issue is set to be discussed at ministerial level by the US and UK
governments during the early months of next year.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Merchant finds fleece can be golden: An elaborate manoeuvre
which is used to evade wool marketing controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's drive to free commodity markets in the UK has led to the
abolition of all marketing boards except that for wool - and ministers are
coming under pressure to complete the process by getting rid of that as
well.
Those campaigning against the board have highlighted an elaborate manoeuvre
which allows foreign buyers to evade its UK monopoly on the purchase of clip
wool - sheep fleeces.
But officials argue that the board is necessary to protect small farmers by
guaranteeing them a market for fleeces, which are a by-product of sheepmeat
production on small farms, and to ensure that the maximum amount of wool
comes to market.
To avoid the British Wool Marketing Board's controls, Mr Aidan Walsh, an
Irish wool merchant, last year brought his lorries, staff and equipment from
his base in Naas in County Kildare to Perth. He bought 100 tonnes of wool
there, took it back to Naas and then shipped it back across the Irish Sea to
the Midlands.
Even with transport costs, he can sell wool in the UK more cheaply than
domestic merchants who have to buy through the wool marketing board.
In May, the Ministry of Agriculture abolished the system of guaranteed
prices it used to give farmers through the board. Buyers from outside the UK
had been exempt from the board's monopoly on the purchase and sale of clip
wool since 1981, and the ending of the guarantee scheme provided an
opportunity for them to take advantage of the exemption.
In Perth, Mr Walsh offered farmers 40p per kg for wool from blackface sheep,
rising to 50p over the summer. This is less than the board price, but it
pays over two years - 20p down and the rest the following year.
In July, the board won an interdict (injunction) in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh preventing Mr John King of the wool merchants J &amp; W Greig of
Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, from approaching the farmers because he is not a
foreign buyer.
Mr King said he was obliged to buy from the board at 81p a kg for blackface
wool, including the board's costs of 25p a kg.
'Let's say, for argument's sake, Mr Walsh's transport and other costs amount
to 20p a kilo, he can still undercut me when selling to a carpet
manufacturer in Britain by 11p a kilo. That is before my own costs,' said Mr
King.
'That is some discount. I do not mind Aidan Walsh doing this. It is just
that I want to do it myself.'
Mr King has lobbied MPs and Mrs Gillian Shephard, Minister of Agriculture,
arguing that the board should be abolished. 'The monopolies in eggs and milk
have been abolished, why is one being retained in wool?'
The ministry argues that most sheep come from small farms, often in remote
areas. 'The average clip is 500 kilos. Without the board, a lot of the wool
would not reach the market and would have to be imported.'
Mr Ian Hartley, deputy managing director of the board, said: 'There are
93,000 suppliers of wool in the UK and only 25 main buyers. You have to have
some form of marketing because most farmers are so small. It would not be
worthwhile them driving huge distances to deliver.'
He says every dealer apart from Mr King is happy to work through the board,
although he admits that it must lower its charges to 'well under' 20p a kg.
'Mr Walsh bought 100 tons from about 40 farmers. The total market in Britain
is 50m tons. Over 99 per cent of farmers are happy to deal with us. The
government wants to continue.'
Mr Walsh said: 'This year was a trial run. Next year I am going to set up
centres all over Scotland. I know others who are planning to set up in
England. The BWMB will break up eventually.'

FT  29 DEC 93 / Hints of progress at Cairo talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators hinted last night they were making
progress in their Cairo talks searching for a formula to unblock the Mideast
peace process and begin implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and
Jericho.
'The talks went very well,' according to Mr Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation team. An Israeli official said: 'They have
moved to the stage of wording but it still remains to be seen if the wording
will be final.'
At one stage Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa joined the discussions
between the PLO and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The talks, which
began on Monday night, are due to resume today.
The two sides have been deadlocked over who should control border crossings,
as well as over the size of the Jericho area to be handed over to
Palestinians and over security for Jewish settlers once Israeli soldiers
withdraw.
Under the peace accord with the PLO, Israel was to have begun moving troops
out of Gaza-Jericho more than two weeks ago, but deadlock in negotiations
has delayed implementation of the agreement.
Meanwhile, pro-Iranian guerrillas launched a wave of attacks on Israel's
security zone in south Lebanon, just hours after three Israeli air raids
killed two guerrillas.
Hizbollah fighters firing machineguns, anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs
attacked eight positions of Israeli forces and their allied South Lebanon
Army militia.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, earlier accused Syria of not doing
enough to prevent attacks by Arab guerrillas on Israeli targets in Lebanon.
Despite his accusation, there were signs of a thaw in relations between
Damascus and Jerusalem ahead of the summit between President Bill Clinton
and President Hafez al-Assad next month. US officials confirmed that
Damascus last week issued the first of 850 exit visas to Syrian Jews agreed
last month as a confidence-building measure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, is to question Home Office ministers
early in the new year about 28 Jamaicans refused entry to Britain on
Christmas day.
The Labour party said yesterday Mr Blair was concerned about the Home
Office's reasons for deporting 28 people who had arrived in Britain on
December 21 and were deported from London's Gatwick airport on Christmas
day.
The party said Labour MPs were particularly concerned about how the
Jamaicans were treated in Home Office custody, and the reasons why
immigration officials picked out the charter plane on which they had
travelled.
In Jamaica, the deportation was the subject of official concern, amid
indications that the authorities may file a protest to the British
government.
Some deportees informed the island's foreign ministry officials of their
experience, and Mr Paul Robertson, the foreign minister, met Mr Derek
Milton, the British high commissioner, to discuss the matter.
Jamaican foreign ministry officials said the government would consider
carefully the reports of those refused entry, and 'take whatever diplomatic
and political steps' it thought appropriate.
Some of those refused entry yesterday accused British immigration
authorities of 'naked racism'.
'They say that this is normal procedure for people coming into Britain,'
said one. 'When was the last time they did that to a plane load of visitors
from Australia or New Zealand?'

finding was disputed by the State Department but supported by all

FT  29 DEC 93 / First meeting for Saudi council
</HEADLINE>

   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is expected to take its first step towards more representative
government today when King Fahd bin Abdulaziz inaugurates the first session
of the 60-member majlis al-shura (consultative council).
The creation of the council, first discussed more than 30 years ago,
reflects the huge changes which have taken place in Saudi Arabia as a result
of its oil wealth and its central role in maintaining stability in the Gulf.
The council will initially play an advisory role, but could develop into the
main source of new legislation. Its 60 members, who were appointed in
September, have been drawn mainly from the professions and more than half
have advanced degrees from western universities.
They will debate issues referred to them by the council of ministers, headed
by King Fahd, but their recommendations will not be binding. Debates will be
held in secret and members will not be allowed to remove documents from the
council chamber in Riyadh.
The creation of the council has come at a testing time for the government,
with the fall in oil prices threatening plans both to bring the budget
deficit under control and to reduce the worsening current account deficit.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Council will fight bank on rate swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hammersmith and Fulham council in London said yesterday it would 'vigorously
contest' a legal action brought against it by Credit Commercial de France,
one of France's biggest banks, which is trying to recover losses it suffered
from interest-rate swap agreements.
The bank said the council had made 'fraudulent mis-representations' about
its power to undertake swap transactions in which two parties agree to
exchange fixed and floating-rate interest payments.
Hammersmith and Fulham was one of the most active players in the swaps
market which it entered 10 years ago, along with other councils, in an
effort to find ways around increasing government restrictions on raising
finance.
Councils generally swapped their fixed-rate liabilities for floating-rate
ones - in effect gambling on interest rates staying low - and were left
facing substantial losses when interest rates rose at the end of the 1980s.
The council denied misrepresentation. It said the legal action appeared to
be 'an attempt to enforce swap agreements which the House of Lords declared
to be beyond our legal powers'.
The French bank said the decision to sue followed a ruling this month by the
Court of Appeal, which upheld a High Court order that Islington council must
pay Pounds 1.14m to Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German bank.
The bank declined to specify the amount it was claiming, but said it sought
'to recover both sums it paid to Hammersmith and Fulham and losses it
incurred on matching trans-actions'.
It said the 1991 ruling by the House of Lords that local authorities did not
have the power to enter into interest rate swaps caused 'enormous losses to
the banking community as a whole'.
The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, some of
which they have sought to recover through restitution - reclaiming interest
paid to councils under the invalid swap agreements. Hammersmith and Fulham
said it had already settled several restitution claims.
The council said it was premature to speculate on the position of
council-tax payers if the legal action went against the council. So far, its
taxpayers have not faced extra bills as a result of the swaps as restitution
claims have been met from a special reserve.
The action by the French bank is the latest move in a long legal battle
between the banks and councils in which Hammersmith and Fulham Council has
played a prominent part. It was a participant in several test case actions
which have been settled out of court on undisclosed terms.
The council took part in a total of 550 transactions in the money markets,
mostly in the mid-1980s when it became involved in swap options and other
complex transactions. An independent inquiry in 1991 found that Hammersmith
and Fulham did not understand the market it had entered and had no way of
monitoring or assessing the risks involved.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Singh threatens to quit: The Indian market scandal report
that has upset the finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has been thrown into political and economic uncertainty by the
threatened resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and
principal architect of the country's wide-ranging economic reforms.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is under intense pressure to
reject the resignation of Mr Singh, who offered to quit late last week after
the publication of a parliamentary report into last year's Rs40bn (Pounds
856m) Bombay securities market scandal. MPs who wrote the report criticised
failings throughout the financial system and held Mr Singh responsible for
the shortcomings of officials entrusted with financial supervision.
The ruling Congress (I) party, leading Indian business figures and
newspapers and foreign companies dealing with India are all urging the prime
minister to keep Mr Singh in the government. Supporters of economic reform
said his departure would harm India's international reputation. Mr Bansi
Dhar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry, an employers' body, said: 'The resignation of Mr Singh would be a
jolt to the process of liberalisation.'
Mr Singh's resignation move was made public late on Christmas Eve, by which
time the Bombay Stock Exchange, the country's largest, was already closed.
It does not reopen until January 3. However, prices have fallen sharply in
out-of-hours deals.
The balance of opinion in Delhi last night was that Mr Singh's resignation
would be rejected. But much would depend on a parliamentary debate on the
scandal, due today and tomorrow. If his record comes under further attack he
may quit, even if the prime minister wants him to stay. Mr Singh may also
want to hear a whole-hearted statement of support from the prime minister,
who has yet to make any public comment on the resignation.
Mr Narasimha Rao's position is complicated by the fact that two other
ministers are also criticised in the report, both more seriously than Mr
Singh. But neither of these two men - Mr B Shankaranand, health minister,
and Mr Rameshwar Thakur, rural development minister - wants to quit.
Persuading Mr Shankaranand and Mr Thakur to go, while urging Mr Singh to
stay, will test even the wily Mr Narasimha Rao's political skills.
For 61-year-old Mr Singh such horse-trading could be too much to bear. An
academic economist and career bureaucrat, he dislikes dealing with the dirt
in Indian politics. Loyal as he is to the prime minister, he is even more
loyal to his own sense of honour. He feels deeply hurt by the scandal
committee's criticisms; probably nothing less than their withdrawal would
fully satisfy him.
He has said little about his resignation offer except that reform would
continue, even without him. His officials are busy preparing the 1993-1994
budget, due in mid-February, which is expected to contain a new tranche of
reforms, including measures to further open financial markets to
competition.
While a new minister could easily pick up the reins of budget-making in time
for February, Mr Singh's departure would damage morale in the ministry
because he is so closely identified with the liberalisation programme.
Finance Ministry officials have had to fight frequent battles with other
ministries to advance reform, and have relied on Mr Singh's support.
But what really matters - more than the person of the finance minister  - is
the prime minister's and the ruling party's commitment to reform.
In his first 18 months in office, Mr Singh achieved much because the
mid-1991 economic crisis, when India sought emergency loans from the
International Monetary Fund, was so serious that even the most conservative
Congress MPs accepted reform was necessary. Import duties were cut, internal
controls were partly liberalised and foreign companies made welcome for the
first time in over 20 years.
Mr Singh and his fellow reformers gradually moved closer to reforming the
core of India's economic weakness: its subsidy-pampered farmers, inefficient
bureaucracy and overmanned state-owned industry. But they have been forced
to hold back from really overhauling these vested interests, because they
include some of the Congress party's staunchest supporters.
For the past year, the prime minister has been unable to tackle these thorny
issues because of the political turmoil caused by the storming of the
Ayodhya mosque and the unrest which followed. But, although Mr Narasimha Rao
says he fully supports more reform, he has yet to demonstrate a willingness
to press ahead with politically difficult changes. Losing Mr Singh might
erode his will further.

FT  29 DEC 93 / HK markets shrug off Beijing snub

Hong Kong markets yesterday shook off a statement by China that it no longer
adhered to the 'through train' concept of Hong Kong politicians serving
beyond 1997, when Beijing is to assume sovereignty of the British colony.
The stock market's Hang Seng index posted its biggest one-day rise, taking
its increase for 1993 beyond 100 per cent.
In a statement on Monday, the Beijing government said it had hoped
transitional arrangements could have been made on the basis of the
principles of convergence with the Hong Kong Basic Law and through
negotiations with the British government.
'It is a pity that no agreement has been reached due to deliberate sabotage
by the British side,' it said.
The 'through-train' idea means legislators and local councillors were to be
allowed to serve their full terms, past the change of sovereignty.
China said all colonial laws on terms for elected local councillors and
legislators would be abolished on July 1 1997, take-over day. The
Legislative Council, the municipal councils and district boards should be
disbanded and reorganised under the Basic Law, the territory's post-1997
constitution, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said.
The statement followed the breakdown in talks over British proposals for an
extended democracy in the colony before 1997.
Governor Chris Patten pressed ahead and tabled what were called
non-controversial elements of the bill on December 15, after 17 largely
fruitless rounds of talks. This set off renewed attack from China.
However, observers see Beijing as keeping its options open and the statement
as China's latest tactical move in its war of words with Britain.
The Hong Kong government said the statement appeared to be in breach of
joint commitments to maintain stability and prosperity in the colony.
When the market reopened yesterday, the Hang Seng Index reached a record
high of 11,570.22, up 530.38 points. It was the biggest one-day rise
recorded on the exchange in point terms. The previous record, on December
16, was a jump of 394.40 points.
Brokers said foreign funds continued to pour into Hong Kong, stimulated by
the new highs on other Asian markets, including Singapore and Malaysia, on
Monday. The Hong Kong stock market was closed on Monday.
They said investors were undeterred by Beijing's statement as it was already
expected the legislature could be dismantled after the handover.

FT  29 DEC 93 / German bidder kept in Seoul rail contract race

South Korea yesterday said that it was extending negotiations for its
Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) high-speed railway project into next year, and
that it had asked a German consortium, which had appeared to have lost the
battle for the contract, to maintain its offer.
The statement seemed to be aimed at putting pressure on GEC-Alsthom, the
UK-French transport and engineering group, which is negotiating the
high-speed rail contract with the South Korean authorities.
GEC-Alsthom, which defeated a consortium headed by Siemens to win the right
to negotiate the contract in August, had expected to conclude the deal by
the end of this year.
Industry observers said that several sticking points remained in the
negotiations. These included the terms of technology transfer from the
UK-French group to its Korean partners, such as Hyundai Precision Industries
and Hanjin Heavy Industries.
GEC-Alsthom, which builds the French train a grande vitesse (high-speed
train), played down the implications of the South Korean decision. 'We
remain the priority bidder,' the company said, adding that an extension of
negotiations was normal in such an important contract.
'The Korean authorities are trying, perhaps, to increase the pressure on us.
That is logical in the course of negotiations,' the UK-French group said.
The extension of negotiations and the request to maintain its bid will,
however, encourage Siemens and its partners in the German consortium. 'Of
course we are still interested,' said an official from AEG, the engineering
group which is part of the German consortium.
The South Korean contract to build a high-speed line from Seoul to the
southern port of Pusan is regarded by the rival groups as a key strategic
project, which would leave the winner strongly placed in the international
market for high-speed trains.
The importance of the contract has prompted fierce competition between
GEC-Alsthom and Siemens.
The UK-French group was forced to cut its offer price by more than 30 per
cent in order to win the right to negotiate the contract.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Japanese PM sees upturn despite gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday predicted a
national economic upturn by next summer and brushed aside the latest rash of
gloomy indicators.
'Although pessimism is prevalent over the prospects for the economy, I take
a rather different view,' said Mr Hosokawa.
He was speaking four days after unveiling a six-point economic plan for
deregulation and tax reform, widely criticised by business leaders as
lacking substance.
Japan's jobless rate has continued to rise, edging up last month to 2.8 per
cent, a six-year high, and a tenth of a point more than in October. The
number of people looking for a job continued to rise, by 18 per cent
annually, while job offers fell by about the same rate.
As a result, the number of jobs per 100 applicants declined to 65 last
month, from 93 at the turn of the year. Job losses are worst among women -
where employment fell by 0.5 per cent over 12 months - farmers and
manufacturing workers.
The weak job market has been a continued drag on consumer spending, as shown
by a 6.9 per cent decline in sales by large retailers in the year to
November. The Tokyo consumer price index rose by a mere 1.3 per cent over
that period, as clothing and furniture stores offered big discounts and
companies cut entertainment spending.
However, the prospects for an increase in industrial employment look remote,
as shown by a 3.6 per cent year-on-year fall in industrial output last
month, marking a record 26 months of decline.
Inventories rose by 0.9 per cent from the previous month, suggesting that
companies still need to curb production in line with weak demand.
Orders received by Japan's 50 largest construction groups fell by 16.1 per
cent last month, from a year earlier, a slowdown compared with the 24.3 per
cent drop recorded in October. This was despite an 8.7 per cent rise in
housing starts, one of the few bright spots.
Japan's gross domestic product (total output of goods and services) grew a
revised real 0.4 per cent in 1992-93, after a 3.6 per cent gain the previous
year, said the Economic Planning Agency last week.
Gross national product (GDP minus net income from overseas production) grew
by a real 0.7 per cent in fiscal 1992-93, ended last March, after a 3.6 per
cent gain in 1990-91.
In nominal terms, GDP rose 2.1 per cent in 1992-93 after a 5.4 per cent rise
in 1991-92, and GNP rose 2.4 per cent.
Muramoto Construction, subject of Japan's largest post-war financial
collapse, has obtained court approval to restructure. The group filed for
protection from its creditors early last month, with debts of up to Y590bn,
after banks withdrew support. Muramoto's fate, caused by investment in
over-valued golf courses in the late-1980s, has led to the collapse of seven
suppliers.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Current account surplus shrinks by 20.6 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's current account surplus shrank by 20.6 per cent in the 12 months to
November, the first fall in six months. A finance ministry official said the
figures showed that export volumes were levelling off or declining, while
import volumes were steadily growing.
The fall, to Dollars 8.21bn (Pounds 5.47bn), was larger than most economists
had expected from the 5.4 per cent fall in the trade surplus, announced this
month. This was because services, not included in the trade account, swung
unexpectedly from a surplus of Dollars 1.1bn in November 1992 to a deficit
of Dollars 202m last month.
A fall in the yen's value against the dollar also played a part. In yen
terms, the current account surplus declined more steeply, to Y885.1bn
(Pounds 5.32bn), down 30.9 per cent from November last year.

A Japanese court has signalled disapproval of deals by companies to pay off
extortionists who threaten to disrupt annual shareholders' meetings.
The Tokyo District Court on Monday gave suspended sentences of five and six
months variously to four former officials of Kirin Brewery who were found to
have given Y46m (Pounds 276,700) to sokaiya (extortionists) this year.
Many such extortionists claim gang links (sometimes accurately), commonly
take a small stake in leading companies and threaten to ask embarrassing
questions at the annual meeting, unless the company pays them to stay away.
Company executives have been questioned about scandalous information
concerning them or about the conduct of the company. Meetings were stretched
to as long as 13 hours as executives faced query after query.
To limit the impact of the sokaiya, most Japanese companies hold their
shareholders' meeting on the same day.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Gelli bank holdings seized
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial activities of Mr Licio Gelli, controversial head of the secret
Italian Masonic lodge, P2, have come under the spotlight following the
seizure of more than L16bn (Pounds 6.5m) worth of bank assets held in his
name.
The assets were seized on Monday under a law permitting magistrates to do so
if they suspect the origin of a person's wealth stems from illicit
operations.
Mr Gelli is the subject of at least three separate criminal investigations.
Last year he was sent for trial for alleged links with the Mafia.
He has also been linked to some of the murkier episodes in post-war Italian
history including the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano and the death of
the banker Roberto Calvi. However, he has been able to carry on extensive
financial activities over the past decade.
The move against Mr Gelli promises to begin to lift the veil on the little
investigated activities of the Freemason movement in Italy and its suspected
connections with organised crime and with the far right and secret services.
Mr Lucio Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said
yesterday that Mr Gelli until now had clearly benefited from protection from
within the establishment. He also called for a thorough investigation into
those banks which had agreed to do business with him.
Rome magistrates claim Mr Gelli bought treasury bills and commercial paper
from various banks between 1989 and 1992 to the value of L16.4bn. In this
period his total declared tax income was L138m. Mr Gelli has denied any
wrong-doing.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Russian oil shares up for auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has opened an auction for shares in its biggest oil company, allowing
people to swap privatisation vouchers for a stake in oil producer
Surgutneftegaz.
More than 3.6m shares, each with a face value of Rbs1,000, are on offer in
the nationwide auction. Officials said this represented about 18.25 per cent
of the company's capital.
The auction closes on January 24, when the selling price of shares will be
set. Demand on the first day was not particularly strong, officials said.
Surgutneftegaz produced 42.5m tonnes of oil (850,000 barrels per day) in
1992, more than 10 per cent of total Russian output. But production is
expected to fall sharply this year.
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said yesterday that 'the bulk of
privatisation has been completed in the past two years' and that the process
was 'irreversible'.
President Boris Yeltsin has promised to continue a policy of economic reform
despite the nationalist victory at the polls. Last week, he authorised the
privatisation agency headed by Mr Chubais to designate insolvent enterprises
and open bankruptcy proceedings in arbitration courts.
This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead
with bankruptcies. But, since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in
March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully.
The presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the
bankruptcy law, but does not set deadlines or require published lists of
insolvent enterprises.

Bulgaria has ordered the Russian ultra-nationalist leader Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky to leave within 24 hours, saying he insulted President Zhelyu
Zhelev and endangered relations with its neighbours, Agencies report from
Sofia.
Mr Zhirinovsky, who arrived on Saturday, had described his Bulgarian friend
and adviser, Mr Svetoslav Stoilov, as the country's next president. He also
accused Bulgaria's neighbours, Greece and Turkey, of planning to conquer the
Balkans and described Romania as an 'artificial state'.
He was booed by angry Bulgarians when he placed flowers at a memorial to
Russian soldiers.
Jill Barshay adds from Moscow: Official results of Russia's December 12
general election, published yesterday, confirm the strong showing of
nationalist and former Communist parties.
In the lower house of parliament, or state duma, Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic party secured 64 seats, followed by the pro-reform Russia's
Choice with 58 seats.
Other results were: Communist party (48), Agrarian party (33), Women of
Russia (23), Yabloko (22), Party of Russian Unity and Concord (19), the
Democratic Party of Russia (14), other parties (33) and those with no party
affiliation gained 130 seats.

FT  29 DEC 93 / EU ministers wrap up agreement on packaging: But arguments
on recycling are set to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers across the European Union could soon be sorting through their
household waste to pick out bottles, plastics and other materials for
recycling, following an agreement reached by environment ministers before
Christmas.
The compromise agreement on waste recovery and recycling targets in the EU's
directive on packaging and packaging waste will have important consequences
for Europe's packaging and waste management industries as well.
It was reached after 18 months of wrangling between member countries and
lobbying by the packaging industry, which believed original targets in a
draft published last year were too severe.
The argument, however, is not over. The directive must be ratified by the
European parliament, and was opposed by ministers from Germany, Denmark and
the Netherlands, who were demanding tougher targets.
Germany is expected to campaign hard for amendments. After introducing the
most ambitious targets in Europe for waste collection and recycling two
years ago, it is already exceeding the proposed targets and has been forced
to export large quantities of packaging waste after its own recycling
industry proved inadequate.
The council of environment ministers agreed that within five years of the
directive's implementation:
Not less than 50 per cent, but no more than 65 per cent, of packaging waste
should be recovered rather than simply dumped.
A minimum of 25 per cent, and maximum of 40, should be recycled, with a
minimum of 15 per cent of each category of material.
Within 10 years, the council would have to agree a 'substantial increase' in
these percentages.
This is somewhat softer than the original draft, which called for 90 per
cent of packaging to be recovered within 10 years, with 60 per cent
recycled.
Moreover, some exemptions were granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal,
because of their geographical position on the fringes of the EU, and their
comparatively low consumption of packaging.
Ministers also agreed that member countries would be allowed to exceed the
targets, but only if this did not lead to a distortion of the European
internal market for packaging through those countries exporting the waste.
That means a German company, for instance, might be prevented from exporting
excess packaging waste to other member states, unless there was a bilateral
agreement with a country prepared to take it.
The compromise received a cautious welcome from packaging organisations.
Mr James Jensen, director general of the Packaging Federation, which
represents some of Europe's largest packaging companies, called it a
'victory for common sense'.
'What has emerged is a good balance,' he added.
Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the London-based
Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, was more cautious. She
said the targets were 'more realistic, more sensible', but the directive
faced a rough passage through the European parliament.
Mr David Veitch of Procter and Gamble Europe, a member of the executive
committee of the European Recovery and Recycling Association, said he was
pleased ministers had recognised the need to review the targets later,
according to the progress being made and available technology.
Reaction in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, has been predictably
negative.
Mr Hans Alders, Dutch environment minister, said the directive had been so
weakened it had 'nothing to do with the environment'. Mr Klaus Topfer,
German environment minister and architect of the country's environmental
legislation, said the agreement would set back progress on environmental
protection in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste.
'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental
tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' he said.
Germany already recycles 66 per cent of its paper, 55 per cent of glass, 48
per cent of tin plate, and 20 per cent of plastics, and has an overall
recycling target of 60 per cent by mid-1995. It says Europe as a whole
already recycles more than 25 per cent of its packaging material - if
figures for glass, recycling of which is well established, are included -
and so the new directive may be a harmonising measure, but is not
progressive.
But France and the UK, in particular, have complained that German waste
exports are undermining their domestic waste management companies, which can
no longer compete with cheaper waste paper coming across their borders.
'It was very clear to environment ministers in Brussels that the German
model needed to be scaled back to meet the concern of member states angered
by German waste exports,' said Ms Nacy Russotto, director of the Association
of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe.
Officials at the German environment ministry counter that Germany's waste
export problems are only temporary as two recycling plants in eastern
Germany are due to be functioning next year and will be able to recycle
nearly all the waste paper now exported to neighbouring countries.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Roof falls in on Spanish union ambitions: Government has had
to step in to save housing empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S largest and most belligerent trade union, the socialist General
Workers Union (UGT), has been embarrassed by the collapse over Christmas of
its housing and financial empire just a month before a general strike it is
leading against government reforms of the labour market.
Only the despised government, by making new credits available to the UGT
businesses, can keep them going and save the union from both financial
catastrophe and the anger of thousands of working class families who have
joined its co-operative venture to build new homes, mainly around Madrid.
Ministers and senior officials have been struggling to contain their delight
at the discomfort of the UGT's outgoing leader, Mr Nicholas Redondo, who has
led calls for the strike.
The government has clearly got Mr Redondo in an awkward position. One barely
straight-faced official said earlier this week: 'We make no connection
between the strike and the UGT's business troubles.'
Two days earlier, the government's official credit institute had agreed to
help keep total bankruptcy from the door of the holding company, IGS, with a
loan of Pta10bn (Pounds 49m). In return, the UGT has been forced to pledge
all its assets - including the Pta10bn property portfolio given to it and
other unions after the restoration of Spanish democracy in the late
seventies - as a guarantee.
IGS and its property co-operative, PSV, have gone into receivership after
paying off three big creditors with the help of the government loan. But
there are many others. Overall IGS owes more than Pta40bn and at the rate
IGS losses are running, the government loan, only Pta1.2bn of which is new
money, will not last long.
The affair, though not yet tainted with accusations of corruption, bears a
disconcerting resemblance to the collapse of Neue Heimat, the huge housing
group mismanaged and finally lost in 1987 by the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund
(DGB), the German union federation.
IGS and PSV were modelled on the DGB's business ambitions. The DGB was, in
fact, an early and short-lived partner in Unial, an insurance company set up
by the UGT to try to capture business from members in the early 1980s.
But at the time when Neue Heimat was collapsing around the heads of their
German cousins, the UGT leaders, and Mr Redondo in particular, let
themselves be persuaded that they should become the motor of a huge housing
programme for workers and created IGS and PSV along with a private company.
The union would supply home buyers and the private sector partner would
secure financing.
In 1988 IGS had plans to build 5,000 homes. That quickly swelled, along with
the UGT's sense of its own importance, to 20,000. IGS created a construction
and a mortgage company and a travel club for people who paid up to buy homes
or deposited money, in the hopes of getting a home, with IGS.
Estimates vary, but it is thought that between 20,000 and 50,000 people have
either begun paying or saving for UGT-provided homes.
Spanish unions have relatively few members but they were given great
property-based wealth and factory-floor power after the end of General
Franco's dictatorship. The UGT was also very close to the Socialist
government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez when it was first elected in 1982 but has
become a political opponent in recent years as government economic policies
have drifted to the right.
The explosion of speculative ambition at the UGT has a lot to do with the
hierarchical structure of the union and the detachment of the union
leadership from workplace issues. Union leaders see themselves as big
players on the national political scene but their isolation from power
recently has forced Mr Redondo especially to seek other ways of political
expression.
Providing cheap housing for the masses was one way of showing Spain (or
perhaps Mr Gonzalez) what he was capable of. General strikes - a success in
December 1988 and a flop in 1992, with plans for a third next month - are
another.
But it is all going badly. If the government is to be believed, the strike
on January 27 will not alter its determination to loosen the rigid Francoist
labour practices that make it cripplingly expensive to fire workers in
Spain.
The failure of IGS is probably the final humiliation circumstance will force
upon Mr Redondo, who is retiring in 1994. It was he who first propelled Mr
Gonzalez to the leadership of the Socialist party in 1974 while it was still
in exile. Now the two men do not speak.
Now, as angry IGS 'clients' clamour for their money outside IGS headquarters
in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez is sure to be working hard to wrest maximum political
benefit from the UGT's financial straits, by securing before January 27 the
savings and hopes of the home buyers who put their faith in the UGT.
A government-inspired rescue of IGS will not avert the planned strike but it
will nicely blur the picture that unions have drawn of him as a waster of
public money and a destroyer of dreams.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Russia to accelerate bankruptcy

<TEXT>
The Russian government has moved to speed up bankruptcies next year as part
of its economic reforms.
President Boris Yeltsin, who has promised to continue reform despite the
nationalist victory at the polls, has authorised the privatisation agency
headed by deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais to designate insolvent
enterprises and open bankruptcy proceedings.
This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead
with bankruptcies. But since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in
March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully.
Though the presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the
bankruptcy law, it does not set deadlines or require published lists of
insolvent enterprises. The decree must also be reviewed by the new
parliament.
Mr Chubais said he hoped for success in discussions on co-operation with
parliament's other main pro-reform bloc, headed by market economist Grigory
Yavlinsky, against nationalists and Communists.
Mr Chubais acknowledged yesterday that Russia's privatised companies had
changed little in the way they operated. 'It would be very naive to expect
that after the first day of privatisation a state enterprise would cut its
production costs four times and double its profits,' he said.
Communist Party member Anatoly Lukyanov, on trial for his role in the August
1991 failed Soviet coup, was 'almost unanimously' elected chairman of the
temporary co-ordination commission of the new parliament.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday turned the heat up in a dispute with
Japan over semiconductor trade, suggesting Japan was reneging on an
international agreement, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's undersecretary for international
affairs, said during a Cable News Network interview that Japanese companies
were still discriminating against US suppliers and it was time they stopped.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had earlier called for emergency
talks with Japan after a report of a new drop in Japan's purchase of foreign
semiconductors.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Japan bought 20.2 per cent of its
semiconductors from foreign sources, but the share fell for the third
quarter of this year to 18.1 per cent.
'This latest share number raises serious concerns regarding Japan's
commitment to fully implement the semiconductor arrangement,' Mr Kantor
said. The accord calls for Japan to improve its market share of foreign
semiconductors to an average 20 per cent.
Mr Kantor said a meeting next month would consider a joint plan to 'improve
dramatically foreign share and access' to Japan's market.
However, Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the Electronic Industries
Association of Japan's committee that monitors foreign semiconductors, said
yesterday that foreign chip suppliers' sales in Japan in the April-September
period of 1993 were up by 26 per cent, or Dollars 4.5bn, from a year
earlier. 'The market share figures do not fully reflect the efforts of
Japanese users,' he said.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Belgium bows out to applause: Widespread praise for
six-month spell presiding over EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Belgium prepares to hand over the rotating presidency of the European
Union to Greece on January 1, the coalition government in Brussels is
basking in praise for its six-month stewardship of the EU.
The European Commission said this week that the Belgian presidency had been
active and productive, a view generally shared among the permanent
delegations in Brussels.
Achievements include a delicate brokering role which helped to conclude the
world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; a deal
on the location of almost a dozen European institutions, including the
European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt; a share-out of development funds;
and much unglamorous but necessary work implementing the Maastricht treaty.
Belgium's performance defied predictions that its presidency would prove
ineffective because of a weak coalition government, linguistic divisions and
labour unrest.
Despite the regular presence of dozens of anti-riot trucks in Brussels in
the past half year, fears that the government might fall in the face of
opposition to its 'social pact' - the most ambitious austerity programme
since the second world war - proved unfounded.
As a founder member of the European Community in 1958 and one of the smaller
EU states, Belgium has become used to subordinating its own national
interests to achieve compromise. In this respect, says Mr Peter Ludlow, head
of the Brussels-based Centre for European Studies, Belgium's has been 'a
model presidency'.
Personalities count, too. Though occasionally irascible, Mr Willy Claes
proved an effective chairman of the general affairs council comprising EU
foreign ministers; and Mr Philippe Maystadt showed why he is one of the more
respected finance ministers in Europe.
Both benefited from the advice of Ambassador Philippe de Schoutheete de
Tervarent, Belgium's long-serving permanent representative to the EU.
It was Mr Claes and Mr de Schoutheete who helped to keep France within the
European fold during the Gatt trade talks, taking the sting out of relations
between Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and Sir Leon Brittan,
the chief trade negotiator.
Similarly, both men calmed down European parliamentarians and persuaded them
to compromise on a new accord governing the roles of EU institutions
post-Maastricht. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister,
and Mr Claes are also credited with buoying up a moody Mr Jacques Delors
before he delivered his white paper on growth and competitiveness to acclaim
at the Brussels summit this month.
Criticism of the Belgian presidency focuses on the less-than-smooth running
of second-tier EU councils such as environment, agriculture and research.
The 'green-leaning' Danes, Dutch and Germans were also unhappy about the
compromise on waste packaging which they argue will damage the environment.
Like its predecessors, the Belgian presidency proved unable to make real
progress in the Bosnian conflict. Talks this week in Brussels identified
some points of agreement; but Mr Claes was reduced to describing as
'pathetic' Bosnian Serb excuses for not reopening Tuzla airport to allow
resumption of humanitarian aid to starving refugees.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Ciampi says he is ready to leave office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, said yesterday he was ready
to leave office, having completed his government's mandate. The 73-year-old
former governor of the Bank of Italy also told a news conference he would
not stand in forthcoming general elections.
Mr Ciampi's comments are in line with promises made in May when he agreed to
be Italy's first non-elected premier this century. Then, he said his two
essential tasks were to obtain approval for an austerity budget for 1994 and
to complete the process of electoral reform. Both were achieved just before
Christmas.
However, Mr Ciampi was careful yesterday to point out that the decision on
the dissolution of parliament was out of his hands. 'This executive has no
authority to decide whether or not the current legislature should be
prolonged. . . This is in the hands of the head of state having consulted
with the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies.'
The timing of his departure has been complicated by intense backstage
political manoeuvring in the past few days. Originally, it had been expected
that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would announce the dissolution of
parliament in his end-of-year address, fixing at the same time a date for
early general elections in March.
This timetable had now been undermined by Mr Marco Panella, the Radical
leader, who just before Christmas managed to persuade many of the current
Christian Democrat-led majority in parliament to sign a motion of no
confidence. This was sufficient for President Scalfaro to postpone any
statement and arrange for a week-long parliamentary debate beginning on
January 12.
The aim of the no confidence motion was to prolong the life of parliament as
long as possible, perhaps as late as June with a new government installed to
replace Mr Ciampi. This would give more time for the disintegrating
Christian Democrats and other groupings to form a viable alliance to oppose
the electoral prospects of a coalition dominated by the former communist
Party of the Democratic Left.
President Scalfaro is reported against such a solution and the debate may
not be a formal no confidence motion if a number of Christian Democrats can
be persuaded to withdraw their support.
Nevertheless, Mr Ciampi in his closing days has been placed in an awkward
position in relation to the parties that have notionally been backing his
administration.

<TEXT>
Venezuela's central bank has said that gross domestic product shrank by 1
per cent in 1993, compared with real growth of 6.8 per cent last year and
9.7 per cent in 1991. The large oil sector grew in real terms by 3.4 per
cent thanks to large capital spending by PDVSA, the national oil company.
However, the rest of the economy contracted by 1.7 per cent, the bank said.
Inflation topped 45 per cent for the year, according to early estimates,
against 32 per cent in 1992.
The government's gross international monetary reserves now stand at Dollars
12.5bn, down 4 per cent from a year ago. This decline was quite small for a
year marked by the removal of an elected president to face corruption
charges, national elections earlier this month, a wave of bombings in the
capital and general political tension created by two failed coups in 1992.
The central bank estimated 1993 exports at Dollars 14.2bn, up slightly from
the previous year, and imports of Dollars 11bn, down 10 per cent from 1992.
The current account showed a deficit of more than Dollars 1.8bn, against
Dollars 3.4bn in 1992.
The public sector deficit was 3.6 per cent of GDP, an improvement on the 5.8
per cent deficit last year.

<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott, the Clinton administration's most prominent Russian
expert, was yesterday named deputy secretary of state, replacing Mr Clifton
Wharton, who was in effect fired last month.
The 47-year-old former journalist with Time magazine was a Rhodes Scholar at
Oxford University and a room-mate of President Bill Clinton, with whom he
has retained a close personal relationship.
Mr Talbott is a newcomer to government but, over the last year, he has won
the confidence of Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, in the
specially created portfolio of ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet
republics.
He will continue to exercise responsibility in this critical area of US
foreign policy, with his current deputy, Mr James Collins, former number two
at the Moscow embassy, becoming acting ambassador-at-large.
The elevation suggests that the newly modified US approach to reform in
Russia - in Mr Talbott's words, 'less shock, more therapy' - will remain in
place for the foreseeable future.
Mr Talbott was picked by Mr Christopher from a changing short list that
included several diplomats with more formal bureaucratic experience, among
them Mr Tom Pickering, ambassador to Russia, Mr Winston Lord,
under-secretary for Asian affairs, and Mr Morton Abramowitz, head of the
Carnegie Endowment, a Washington think-tank, but a critic of US policies on
Bosnia.
His appointment is expected to presage a further shake-up in the upper
reaches of the widely criticised State Department. Among the candidates for
early departure are Mr Samuel Lewis, head of the policy planning staff.
There was even speculation yesterday that Mr Talbott had emerged as a
prospective secretary of state in case Mr Christopher leaves during Mr
Clinton's first term.
Mr Talbott, partly because of his journalistic career and his familiarity
with Washington ways, is reckoned good at those aspects of the public
presentation of foreign policy in which the often dour Mr Christopher is
considered deficient.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Forerunner of European central bank is left homeless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Monetary Institute, expected to be established on January 1 to
supervise the move towards economic and monetary union, will lead a phantom
existence for the first six months of its life.
The EMI, forerunner of a European central bank, will be based in Frankfurt.
But its shareholders - national central banks from European Union countries
 -will take at least until the end of next month to decide where to house
the institute.
The provisional nature of the EMI's initial running arrangements symbolises
the faltering progress towards Emu after the emergency widening of
fluctuation bands forced by the summer currency crisis.
Governors of the 12 central banks will hold a formal inaugural meeting of
the EMI on January 11 in the rebuilt fifteenth century Frankfurt city hall.
At least until the summer, though, the EMI will be run from Basle,
headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements and the site of the
present 34-strong secretariat of the committee of European central bank
governors.
That means that Mr Andrew Crockett, who takes over as BIS general manager on
January 1, will 'cohabit' for several months in Basle with Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy, the EMI's president-designate, and the BIS's current general
manager.
Mr Crockett, at present the Bank of England's international director, was
selected in the autumn to succeed Mr Lamfalussy.
The EMI is looking for an office that will hold no more than 150 to 250
people. A larger site capable of housing a fully-fledged central bank has
been ruled out.
Although no budget for the EMI's first-year costs has been drawn up, central
banks are expected to face a 'nasty surprise' on the high cost of
refurbishment, according to one well-informed official. In particular, it
includes the task of equipping the chosen office for the task of holding
three simultaneous round-table meetings of European central bankers.
The EMI is expected to employ between 130 and 150 staff by the end of 1994,
many of whom will be seconded from central banks. Most will be economists
and statisticians.
The EMI will pool information about European financial developments, help to
harmonise monetary statistics and instruments, and host regular meetings of
European central bankers.
During the so-called stage two of the move to Emu, which begins on January
1, monetary decision-making will remain in the hands of national central
banks. Joint decisions on monetary policy will not be made until the
irrevocable fixing of exchange rates under stage three of Emu. According to
the Maastricht treaty, that is due between 1997 and 1999.
The EMI will take over some of the technical arrangements for running the
European Monetary System which are at present handled by the BIS.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Asian markets set records as Europe remains steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock markets in Europe and the US paused for breath yesterday but in Asia
the year-end rally in world equities continued.
Shares closed flat or slightly down in most Continental European markets but
edged into record territory on Wall Street in quiet end of year trading.
London markets were closed.
In Asia, four markets finished at record levels. The biggest gainer in Asia
was Hong Kong, where foreign buying pushed the market up 4.8 per cent to a
new record, on strong volume, despite a warning from China about political
reform. The Hang Seng index closed at 11,570.22, up 530.38 points, the
biggest one-day rise on record.
Highs were also set in Singapore, Bangkok and Karachi, with strong
performances in Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur. The previous day's trading had set
records in Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index rose 311.33 to 17,131.21, recovering half the
3.6 per cent it lost in the previous two trading days. Early today, the
Nikkei was up around 130 points at about 17,260 after the first hour of
trading.
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a further 0.8 points to
finish at 3,793.7.
In Germany, the DAX index touched a record intra-day high of 2,284.56 but
ended floor trading at 2,242.82, a drop of 0.5 per cent from Monday's close.
In later trading on the electronic Ibis system the DAX closed at 2,236.18.
After three days of new records, French shares finished lower yesterday,
with the CAC-40 index down 0.52 per cent. Shares in Spain lost all Monday's
gains and more, closing 1 per cent down on the day, because of concern about
Banesto. An interest rate cut in Belgium helped shares close 0.76 per cent
higher at a new record.
European government bond markets saw little activity, although the German
government successfully launched its new 30-year bond.
US Treasuries were steady above their lows, with the long bond down more
than  1/4 , to yield 6.233 per cent.
Sterling strengthened slightly in Continental trading. Against the D-Mark,
it ended at DM2.563, up from Friday's DM2.545. Against the dollar it
finished at Dollars 1.5065 in London, from Dollars 1.502 on Friday, and rose
to Dollars 1.508 in New York.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Tax rises will help sustain recovery, says government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday claimed that its Budget tax increases would help to
sustain Britain's economic recovery by damping consumer demand and
preventing an inflationary boom.
Speaking as shoppers flocked to post-Christmas sales, Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, said planned tax increases - which will
be equivalent to 7 pence on income tax in three years' time - will slow
growth.
But he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme there was 'no reason to believe'
the changes coming 'this year or in 1994 and 1995 will have any serious
adverse affect on the recovery'.
'What we have seen, quarter by quarter, is a recovery that has taken root
and been sustained - and the likelihood is that this will continue,' Mr
Dorrell said.
Without this year's two Budgets, people would have lacked confidence that
the UK economy had a sound financial base, he said.
'Because difficult decisions have been taken, we can have reasonable
confidence that the recovery will continue on the path set now for over 18
months.'
Mr Dorrell's view that the Budget will lead to steady growth is given some
support today by the latest bimonthly survey of business opinion from the
Institute of Directors and Halifax Building Society's end-of-year review of
the housing market.
Although the IoD reported only a slight increase in overall business
confidence in the two months between October and December, it found that the
November 30 Budget appears to have boosted optimism among directors about
prospects for their own businesses in 1994 and may encourage them to take on
more staff.
Halifax predicts a steady recovery in the housing market next year, with a
15 per cent increase in the number of people moving house and a 5 per cent
rise in house prices, but with no return to 'boom-and-bust' conditions.
While retailers yesterday reported their best winter sales figures since the
late 1980s, Mr Dorrell made it clear that the government was not interested
in stoking a consumer-led boom.
'What we do not want is a consumer recovery which gets out of control, which
leads to inflationary boom and balance of payments difficulties of the kind
we have seen in the past,' he said.
Mr Dorrell stressed that the government had acted to minimise the
disincentive impact of tax increases by not raising marginal rates of income
tax.
'We think it is important that people have a good reward when they go to
work and when they do well,' he said.
However, his upbeat view of the Budget was challenged by Mr Andrew Smith, a
Labour Treasury spokesman. 'When, come April, people have their pay slip in
one hand and a fuel bill in the other, they will see for themselves just how
hard the government is hitting them on taxation,' he said. Mr Smith said the
typical UK family faced extra taxes of Pounds 10 a week in 1994.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Top Spanish bank faces break-up as board is dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain yesterday dismissed the board of Banco Espanol de Credito,
the country's fourth-largest bank, raising the possibility that Banesto
might be broken up and its industrial empire shared among the rest of
Spain's big banks.
The central bank acted after market rumours of Banesto's imminent failure
sent its stock into free fall yesterday morning and started a run on
deposits in Madrid.
Trading in the stock was suspended at midday, with the price having fallen
about 7 per cent to Pta2,135 (Pounds 10.46).
Mr Alfredo Saenz, deputy chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, was named by the
Bank of Spain as Banesto's new chairman in place of Mr Mario Conde, the
former industrialist who took charge of Banesto in 1987. Mr Conde has tried
to persuade the authorities that Banesto, the most vulnerable of Spain's
large banks, could survive on its own.
Mr Saenz and four other directors - one each from Banco Central Hispano,
Banco Santander, Argentaria, the state-owned banking group, and Banco
Popular - took charge of Banesto late yesterday afternoon.
The threatened failure of Banesto and the removal of Mr Conde will be a
bitter blow to JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and its deputy chairman,
Mr Roberto Mendoza, who was recently named to the now dismissed Banesto
board. Banesto was the first investment of the Dollars 1bn Corsair banking
fund created by JP Morgan. Corsair owns nearly 9 per cent of Banesto. JP
Morgan also acted as an adviser this year to Banesto during the raising of
nearly Dollars 700m in new capital. Yesterday, the US bank said Corsair
planned to maintain its position.
Mr Alfredo Pastor, the deputy economy minister, said a Bank of Spain
inspection at Banesto had found a much larger equity deficit than
anticipated.
The results of this inspection had been studied by Mr Luis Angel Rojo,
governor of the Bank of Spain, and senior staff just two weeks ago. Urgent
talks had taken place with Banesto about ways to shore up its finances.
Mr Pastor said no decision had been made about Banesto's future. 'The
intervention today is the end of a long process,' he said. An inspection in
1992 had detected gaps in Banesto's finances but the central bank and Mr
Conde had agreed upon a timetable to raise new equity and to rebalance the
bank's loan portfolio. But, Mr Pastor said, 'the situation in 1993 has
worsened' even though Banesto raised more than Dollars 1bn in capital
through share sales and disposals.
A central bank statement said: 'Banesto's current situation obliges it to
take restructuring measures that cannot be undertaken alone and which
require the support of the whole banking system.' It said it had acted in
order to guarantee the liquidity of Banesto.
It had been assumed that the money raised with JP Morgan's help this year,
plus the proceeds of the sale of a banking subsidiary to Deutsche Bank, had
raised Banesto's equity levels above ratios demanded by Spanish and European
authorities.
The Banesto group reported losses of Pta5.7bn (Pounds 27.9m) for the first
nine months of 1993.

<TEXT>
Amdahl, the Californian mainframe computer manufacturer, expects to report a
fourth-quarter loss of more than 35 cents a share - greater than Wall
Street's expectations, writes Martin Dickson.
The company, which has been suffering from a downturn in the mainframe
market and does not have other products to fall back on, said unit volumes
had increased in the fourth quarter over the low level of the third quarter.
However, margins had declined because of pressure on pricing and a shift in
sales mix towards smaller, dual processor systems.

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Unilever steps up race for ice
cream group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is offering
FFr1,420 a share for the 15 per cent of Ortiz-Miko, the French frozen foods
company, that is listed on the Paris stock market.
The Anglo-Dutch group earlier this week mounted a FFr1.9bn (Dollars 327.9m)
offer for control of Ortiz-Miko, a family-run company and a force in the
French ice cream market, where it is best known for its Miko brand.
The announcement of the terms of the public offer marks the second phase of
the deal. The first phase, disclosed on Monday, involved Unilever offering
to buy 75 per cent of Safral, the company that owns 85 per cent of
Ortiz-Miko.
Mr Vidal Ortiz, chairman, has not yet announced whether he will sell his 24
per cent Safral stake. Completion of the deal would turn Unilever, already
the world's largest ice cream manufacturer, into the market leader in
France.
However, Ortiz-Miko yesterday revealed the full extent of its financial
difficulties. It warned it would make a loss in the current financial year.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Lean times for Britons who eat for their country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Christmas Day, Mr John Smith, the British Labour party leader, his wife
and three daughters will be tucking into the finest turkey dinner the Holy
Land can provide as guests of Mr and Mrs Andrew Burns, the British
ambassador and his wife, in Tel Aviv.
For the Burns, like many of the Foreign Office's 217 heads of posts abroad,
regard entertaining, however festive, as work; and few diplomats - ever
mindful of esprit de corps - have been tempted to follow Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, who cancelled his Christmas party for the press - a
less-than-lavish affair of mulled wine and cold mince pies at Number 11.
Even so, ghosts are looming over the feast. Not only has the FO been
squeezed in public spending rounds, but the devaluation of the pound after
its exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September has taken its toll
on the spending power of British posts abroad.
Ambassadors and their spouses - who receive an annual entertainments
allowance - are reporting a pinch this year and are steeled for further
parsimony. But there are still good reasons for dining to remain, as Lord
Palmerston put it, the soul of diplomacy.
Lady Fall, the wife of the British ambassador in Moscow, held six parties
this season. They included a buffet-and-sketches event for staff, two
children's parties (for the British community and children of Russian staff)
and a dance for the Russian staff.
As she spends in three currencies - roubles, dollars and sterling - her
costs are a 'nightmare' to control. She economises by serving 'Australian
bubbly or Spanish fizzy', keeping champagne for 'special occasions involving
the French ambassador'. 'We know we're heading for a crunch but it hasn't
come yet,' she says. 'This city is very frustrating and parties are good for
morale.'
Mrs Sarah Burns also regards Christmas as a time of official
morale-boosting.
She has given a children's party at which her husband played Santa; a carol
party - at which the prize exhibit was not the plum pudding but a large ham,
smuggled in from one of the only shops in Israel with a bootleg stock of
pork; and tonight a carol party which will end up in Manger Square in
Bethlehem. As for expense, 'the annual budget has been cut and we won't
personally be quite so lavish', says Mrs Burns. 'But a turkey is a turkey.'
She feels, however, that most economies are already in place, even though
she has provided meals for 4,000 people in her first year in the post.
'Everything is accountable. I wish I'd done a hotel management course before
becoming an ambassador's wife,' she says.
In Washington, Lady Renwick is spared such worries by a social staff and a
streamlined diary. She is simply giving a large children's party and a
buffet dinner for 250 people (embassy staff and British press).
All those lunches and dinners mount up fast, and the Foreign Office is under
continuous pressure to cut costs further. Total annual expenditure on
diplomatic service hospitality in 1992-93 was Pounds 7m, up from Pounds 5.7m
in the previous year and Pounds 3.5m in 1975-76.
Diplomats, however, are adamant that spending on what they call the
'entertainments workload' delivers value for money, and helps boost British
exports and interests.

FT  24 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: Sinterklaas fights back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'm spending this Christmas, again with my friend Jean-Peter. He is from
Luxembourg and is still active in DGXXII in the European Commission and is
now in charge of the programme for new policy initiatives.
'Take a look at this editorial,' he said, flinging a recent copy of the
Dutch financial paper, NRC-Handelsblad, over to me.
'Hmm,' I said. 'Santa Claus fights back.' It was all about the rearguard
battle 'Sinterklaas', or St Nicholas, had launched against the encroachments
of Father Christmas. The two are not the same, it seems. The article
complained that today in Dutch shopping centres you hear 'Jingle Bells' in
place of 'Zie ginds komt de stoomboot'.
I said I wasn't really surprised, but Jean-Peter was impressed. 'You see
they've got a point. Should the Gatt round have included St Nicholas as a
cultural exception? NRC says he doesn't need a subsidy - 'a man enough to
trust in his own strength.' Hmm. I wonder.'
All this, it seems, is grist to Jean-Peter's new think-tank which is working
towards the European Policy Innovation and Reformulation Colloquium to be
held next March in Hilversum. He asked me for my ideas. I recalled the news
conference given by President Mitterrand at the end of the G-7 Tokyo Summit
in July. He had argued in favour of bigger handouts to developing countries.
I thought he was right because of French demands for a preference
communautaire. In other words the poor needed help because markets in Europe
were closed to some of their exports. When I asked the French leader if
there was not a contradiction here, he replied that if there was it was
'purely formal'.
Jean-Peter smiled. 'Yes, we've been thinking about that sort of thing here.
The French policy could provide a major boost for everybody if implemented
properly. It is the concept of the 'purely formal' contradiction that we
find particularly useful. A lot of circles can be squared if you look at
them through the right prism.'
I confessed that this was lost on me. But Jean-Peter said his colleagues had
been inspired by a series of television programmes about Margaret Thatcher's
time as prime minister. 'We have the Thatcher countervailing cost and tax
tariff structure in place just ready to go.'
Apparently the commission had been impressed by Thatcher's arguments for a
Community Charge, or what the British call poll tax, as a new source of
local government revenue.
'We saw Lady Maggie on that TV programme. The poll tax could have worked.
'Nigel Lawson had the solution,' she said, 'in his own hands. But he would
not come up with the money to make it work.''
So Thatcher had achieved a Euro-breakthrough. If something costs too much,
you raise a tax to pay for it and if that tax is too high you get the
ministry of finance to subsidise it. If necessary by raising a new tax.
'As Mrs Thatcher noted, that was the solution finally chosen in Britain  -
the standard rate of value added tax was raised to help pay for the Council
Tax. Brilliant but too late to save Lady T unfortunately.'
But unemployment was, of course, the real problem and Jean-Peter was
absorbed in ideas for cutting it. 'A lot of people have been thinking
productively on this subject. France encourages a four-day week, Volkswagen
has a 29-hour week already and the German economics minister, Gunter
Rexrodt, suggested doubling the annual holiday to three months. What we are
aiming at, initially, is the 28-hour week, Europe-wide.'
'And if things get worse?"
'Then the 20-hour week would come in. But actually we are doing something
really interesting, path-breaking in fact, in this area already. We're
putting some money into a new French film that incorporates job sharing.
It's called Le Monde est Ronde.'
Who's in it?
'Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu. At least they are for four days a
week.'
'And the other day?"
'We've got Josianne Bidochon out of retirement. She has not been in anything
since 1962 and is actively seeking work. And then there is Pepe La Frite who
is on a youth training scheme.' I gasped at this idea. 'It's quite absurd.'
'You fail to understand anything at all. Work sharing can work at every
level. Look at the England football team - you 'need' only 11 players. But
in a period of four years England managed to give jobs to 60. That's the way
ahead - it should be compulsory for everybody. To achieve a level playing
field.'

FT  24 DEC 93 / Enigmatic Christmas cards: Dominic Lawson is tired of
receiving greetings from strangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year I finally managed it. I sent out no Christmas cards, except to my
immediate family. For years I would vow not to shower friends and colleagues
with these garish tickets to nowhere. But then, as December dragged on and
my desk began to pile up with the cards that had been sent to me, I would
crack and rush out to the post office with belated reciprocity. This year,
my meanness has got the better of my social insecurity.
At some times the feelings of guilt have been sharper than at others. The
card carefully chosen by good friends, and painstakingly inscribed by their
three-year-old child, is a real choker.
At the other end of the spectrum is the card displaying a photograph of the
family of someone I scarcely know and with nothing but a printed message
inside. I am not a Christian but somehow the substitution in such cards of
the holy family with that of the sender's own has always struck me as rather
preposterous.
Operating at a different level of irritation are the cards from people who
think that a straight line with a couple of dots on top is a proper
signature. What makes it worse is the knowledge that this lazy hieroglyphic
is the result of the sender having to sign hundreds of identical cards in
one rushed signing session with a secretary standing by. Yet still I want to
know who this man or woman is.
We are entering here the murky world of the corporate Christmas card, sent
from office to office, from business contact to business contact. The
problem has been caused by companies which have allocated part of their
public relations budget to the purchase of thousands of such cards. Those of
us who have to buy our own Christmas cards, at about Pounds 1 each, cannot
compete with those who can simply ask their secretary to make another dip
into the stationery cupboard. They, of course, need not discriminate at all:
the choice for them is only whether to sign or not to sign.
The cleverest ones avoid even this brief moment of decision by embossing all
their cards with a facsimile signature. I will not reveal which head of one
of the royal houses of Europe does this on his Christmas cards because I
always have liked the look of his card on my mantelpiece and I would
therefore not want to offend His Royal Highness.
Of course if you are a King you need not use a surname. Which is just as
well for you: also on my list of Christmas cards to be sniffed at are those
from people who sign with their full name. If we are not on first name terms
why are we exchanging such fondnesses? Why, Virginia, why?
On the other hand, Virginia, I much prefer your studied formality to the
misplaced chumminess of the Churches' Media Officers, a strange ecumenical
ensemble which has sent me card signed personally by 'Eric', 'Patrick and
'Steve'. Fortunately the printed side of the card reveals that Eric is the
Rev Eric Shegog, the director of communications at Church House, so that is
one Christmas mystery solved.
And, who knows, perhaps I will at some time in the future meet and learn
much from the Rev Eric Shegog, and then his card will seem merely an
anticipation of fine friendship.
The same, I fear, cannot happen between me and the 'University of
Wolverhampton', nor between the 'Editor of The Spectator' and the 'Mersey
Partnership Team'. I feel we have too little in common, at this stage in our
lives. And who are you, anyway?
However, to those at the Grand Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, an establishment even
Sir James Goldsmith regards as something of an extravagant treat, I say
thank you for your lovely and unexpected Christmas card: and if you ever
care to ask me to stay one Christmas, I and my family would be delighted to
accept your kind and thoughtful invitation.
Yet among the shower of envelopes and other fruits of the forest there are
one or two cards missing this year. In particular, John Major's name no
longer appears in my Christmas card in-tray. Is it something I wrote? No, it
can't be. I am being properly punished for not sending a Christmas card to
the prime minister last year. And Christmas 1994 will obviously bring an
even leaner harvest. It serves Scrooge right.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Books that nobody wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week the acting books editor staged a sale for charity of all surplus
books cluttering up the books office. A new arts and books editor is
arriving fairly shortly, and will no doubt cut a swathe as soon as she
gathers her wits. In the meantime, we are rubbing along with an acting books
editor whose Christmas sale for charity was staged outside my office on
Tuesday afternoon.
News of the start of the sale was flashed across our screens. Next moment,
the space outside my office was filled with the strangest people: a
sprinkling of minor specialists, people from the prices rooms, people who
write about bonds, and people who sub-edit things.
From time to time I would lean out of my office and shout: 'Feminism and
Serial Killers are down at this end.' But that is not the sort of joke
calculated to succeed with people who write about bonds or spend their time
sub-editing things, so eventually I fell quiet and stared glassily at my
screen, unable to write a word because of the noise of people scrambling to
buy cheap Christmas gifts.
In the end, the acting books editor's sale raised Pounds 341, a
reverberatory sum considering the books on sale, which were clearly
unreviewable, if not, in fact, unreadable.
You should have seen the ones that were left. By nightfall, the remains of
the charity sale lay as bleached and as picked-over as the bones of a
week-old kill abandoned under a thorn tree on the red, volcanic plain north
of Mt Kilimanjaro.
They made me very sad. All that wasted labour; all those frustrated hopes -
books that nobody wanted, not even the authors' mothers, I shouldn't be
surprised. Some of these publications were provokingly out of date, which
may help explain why the acting books editor was never a prominent candidate
for the job of actual books editor.
Who could be surprised that there were no takers for The European Public
Affairs Update 1992, or The European Public Affairs Directory 1992, or The
European Community 1992: Annual Review of Activities, or, indeed, for Hollis
Europe: The Directory of European Public Relations and PR Networks,
1992-1993. The press release accompanying Hollis was headlined: 'Single
European market heralds bonanza of PR Opportunities'  - an unspeakably
revolting thought.
Some of the abandoned books had strangely beautiful titles, such as The
Third Man: The Life and Times of William Murdoch, Inventor of Gas Lighting,
by John Griffiths, author of eight other books, among them Modern Iceland
and The Science of Winning Squash.
Conversely, some of the business books were almost certainly doomed from the
moment someone in marketing approved or composed the title: eg, Wages and
Unemployment: A Study in Non-Walrasian Macroeconomics, the initial chapters
of which 'examine short-run macroeconomic equilibrium with nominal
rigidities within the framework of fix-price temporary equilibria' and the
concluding, or crescendo, chapters of which go on from there.
This being the FT, no one dared pay Pounds 1 for Bernard Arcand's The Jaguar
and the Anteater: Pornography Degree Zero, Arcand's concern, according to
the dust-jacket, being to 'elucidate the ways in which pornography is a
mirror of our modernity'. Nor were there any takers - this was more
surprising - for Talking Tough: The Fight for Masculinity, by Carol Lee,
which 'sheds much-needed light on the gulf between society's notions of
maleness and young men's pursuit of male identity.'
There were numerous rejected novels, including Vurt, by Jeff Noon, published
by Ringpull Press, set in near-future Manchester and starting like this:
'Mandy came out of the all-night Vurt-U-Want, clutching a bag of goodies.
Close by was a genuine dog, flesh and blood mix; the kind you don't see any
more. A real collector's item. It was tethered to the post of a street sign.
The Sign read NO GO. Slumped under the sign was a robo-crusty. He had a
thick headful of droidlocks and a dirty handwritten sign - 'hungry n
homeless. please help'.'
Made wretched by their abandonment, I have purchased each of these titles,
plus several more. Now I am wrapping them up. When it is dark tonight I
shall wander London's streets delivering them to certain people. They know
who they are. I have got a little list.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Oh Lord, give us next year our daily bread . . .: Every acre
of England is in an Anglican parish. But the Church is facing big money
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The distance between regular Church of England congregations and once-a-year
churchgoers will be greater than ever this Christmas. Occasional, seasonal
visitors will notice nothing amiss. The cribs and carols will still be in
place in more than 16,000 churches throughout the land, blending holiness
with homeliness in the secure Anglican style.
More involved members of the church, however, will be asking how much longer
it is going to stay like that. The church faces unprecedented financial
problems on such a large scale that they could permanently change its shape.
Within a few years, a century-long trend of insufficient candidates coming
forward for ordination has been reversed. The Church of England now has more
clergy than it can afford. Suddenly, all the R-words that became commonplace
in industry during the 1970s and 1980s - retrenchment, rationalisation,
restructuring, even redundancy - are being uttered nervously in clerical
circles.
The problem's seriousness is illustrated by the view of Dr George Carey,
Archbishop of Canterbury, that finance, rather than the divisive question of
next year's ordination of women priests, is likely to be the most
significant issue of his period in office.
Matters came to a head for the Church of England with a decline in the value
of the Church Commissioners' income-producing assets from nearly Pounds 3bn
in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year. Much of 1993 has been taken up with
investigation and painful debate over the commissioners' stewardship of the
church's assets and their devastating over-exposure in the property market.
An investigation found that the commissioners' assets committee had
compounded their problems by borrowing substantially to finance further
speculative property development, while failing to maintain adequate
managerial control. Bewildered members of the commissioners' board of
governors complained afterwards of having been denied information about
assets committee decisions.
The church has untangled the tragic cycle of events with impressive charity,
showing little of the collective desire for recrimination and scapegoats
that would have dominated the reaction of most institutions. Attention is
being concentrated on the consequences of the mistakes.
The Church of England has lived beyond its means for many years, relying on
the commissioners' investment income to finance the experience. Warnings
signs were evident in the 1980s as a new clergy pension scheme and other
costly, long-term commitments were taken on. Between 1981 and 1991, when the
retail prices index rose by 78 per cent, the cost of clergy pensions and
retirement housing increased by 226 per cent, and spending on church
buildings by 245 per cent. So the sharp decline in the commissioners' asset
values is not the single cause of the present problems; but it means
solutions must be attempted in an atmosphere of crisis rather than a more
gradual, planned way.
The commissioners pay for pensions and housing for retired clergy, and
contribute substantially to stipends. But the proportion of the stipend bill
met from their assets - 45 per cent in the early 1990s - will fall below 30
per cent by 1996. Some dioceses will receive still less.
It costs about Pounds 600m a year to run the Church of England. Last year
clergy stipends and housing cost Pounds 229m, worship and buildings Pounds
201m and administration Pounds 65m. Parishes generated the biggest slice of
income - Pounds 372m - and the Church Commissioners Pounds 161m. The decline
in the commissioners' investment income means an extra Pounds 50m a year
must be found elsewhere to meet running costs and pensions.
Churchgoers in the parishes are the only potential source of the extra
money. A 15 per cent increase in the Pounds 372m raised locally would
produce Pounds 55m and, if sustained annually, solve the problem. But the
church, like charities in general, has seen little real growth in voluntary
donations in recent years - they fell in real terms in 1990, and increased
by only 2 per cent above inflation in 1991. Getting an extra 15 per cent
from the parishes would be the equivalent of raising the entire voluntary
income of Oxfam each year on top of existing collections.
And, although there are signs that the rate of decline in church attendance
 -a social trend shared by the Church of England with other Christian
denominations throughout the post-war years - has slowed since the
mid-1980s, the church will be trying to squeeze more money from a diminished
base. About 1.1m people now attend Anglican churches regularly, compared
with 1.5m in 1970.
Some parishes will rise to the task of becoming self-sufficient, but in
doing so will expose a further problem. The Church of England may have
fallen on hard times financially, but it remains structured as a national
church in a very real sense. Every acre of England is in an Anglican parish;
its clergy are deployed around the country on a fair-shares basis related to
population and geography, and the church retains an elaborate central
decision-making and policy-developing structure. It maintains several
thousand schools; runs theological colleges; has responsibility for many
historic buildings and, through its boards and committees, contributes to
debates on religious and social issues.
In future, some parishes may have full-time priests - or continue to exist -
only if they can meet the costs locally. Moves in this direction are already
occurring in some dioceses. A consultation document in London, which plans
to pay its stipends without any Church Commissioners' support within ten
years, proposes that if a parish is unable to make an adequate contribution
to staff costs 'a careful assessment ought to be made concerning its
future.'
Unco-ordinated moves in this direction could have far-reaching consequences
for the nature of the national church. Parishes working hard to meet all
their own running costs would, influential figures such as Alan McLintock,
chairman of the church's central board of finance, believe, be reluctant to
contribute to the national 'head office' institutions that give the Church
of England so much of its distinctive character. Relationships between
clergy and congregations could change if priests felt wholly dependent on
their parishioners for continued employment. Vacancies would be filled on
the basis of available funding rather than priority needs, with clergy
skewed towards the suburbs and away from the inner cities and peripheral
estates which the church regards as important mission areas.
'Greater financial self-sufficiency need not mean the triumph of
inward-looking congregationalism,' Dr Carey told the church's general synod
last month. Such fears are, however, very much alive.
An alternative to such an every-parish-for-itself approach advocated by the
Rt Rev David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool - whose diocese includes many
relatively deprived areas that would find it impossible to meet full clergy
costs from local resources - is to encourage stronger church-going areas to
make more use of part-time, unpaid ministers, enabling inner cities and
other priority areas to retain substantial numbers of stipendiary clergy.
There are around 11,000 stipendiary clergy and another 2,000 non-stipendiary
ministers - ordained clergy who combine their ministry with secular
employment and do not receive a salary from the church. Increased reliance
on non-stipendiary clergy and lay workers is one probable consequence of the
financial problems.
The church does not set limits on candidates considered for ordination but,
says a new report by its Advisory Board of Ministry, it might become
necessary to restrict the number it can afford to pay. Those called to
ordination, says the report, should 'not themselves seek to impose
conditions as to whether their call is to stipendiary or non-stipendiary
work.'
Although the Church of England pays better than some denominations - a
Salvation Army officer starts on an annual Pounds 3,350, rising to a Pounds
3,990 maximum after 45 years - the financial rewards of the ministry are
modest by most secular standards. The average for a vicar is between Pounds
12,000 and Pounds 13,000.
Church leaders emphasise the need for appropriately motivated men and women
to offer themselves for ordination remains as great as ever. But today,
potential candidates are warned to set aside any notions of social standing
that may once have compensated for limited financial rewards.
Future clergy, says the Advisory Board of Ministry report, will find their
ministry very different from that of their predecessors. It will, it says,
'embody much of the insecurity and vulnerability that is characteristic of
our time.'
Canon John Stanley, a church commissioner and member of the general synod,
endorses this point. He says that declining church attendances, and the
increased secularisation of society, are leading to some clergy feeling
isolated, lonely and undervalued; he is concerned that worries about the
church's financial future will become an additional pressure on them.
Many clergy are worried that rushed solutions to the financial problems,
involving emergency cost-cutting against impossibly short timetables, could
spiral the church into local initiatives that would undermine its status as
a national church. Canon Stanley argues for a controlled response.
'I believe there is a danger of increasing the scale of the problem if
people rush at it too much,' he says. 'I know that raising individual giving
is not easy, but we must remember that if everyone gave Pounds 1 per week
more the problem would disappear. There is a need for a steady hand and
strong nerve.'
Church finances will be under further pressure next year when male priests
unable to accept women's ordination, leave and qualify for payments under a
compensation scheme. There are also dangers that the women priests issue,
allied to financial problems determining whether some churches close, could
upset the doctrinal ecology between the Church of England's high and low
church wings. Most of the defections of priests and parishioners over
women's ordination will be among Anglo-Catholics, while many of the parishes
proving most successful at raising money and attracting growing
congregations are evangelical.
One of the deepest concerns voiced by clergy and lay people is that the
church, shocked by the Church Commissioners' investment problems, might go
to the other extreme and be carried away by an obsession for budgetary
control.
'We cannot keep the Church of England alive by the contributions of
individual congregations alone,' says the Very Rev John Gladwin, Provost of
Sheffield cathedral. 'The Church Commissioners' originally obtained their
money from the reserves of the old cathedrals and bishoprics to help finance
the living ministry of the church. There is absolutely no point in solving
the problem in a way that enables the commissioners to balance their books,
and creates a sound pension scheme, but leaves no money to finance an active
ministry.'
Dr Carey told last month's synod that 'complacency and panic' were equally
out of place as a response to the financial problems. Nothing is more
certain, however, than that some will panic while others remain complacent.
For all its structure, much real decision-making in the Church of England
remains with individual bishops in 43 dioceses, while most of the clergy
hold their posts on freehold and cannot be moved against their will. In such
circumstances, steering a course of sound, rational management between the
twin rocks of complacency and panic will be unusually difficult.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
November. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the
month in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your
sale, and the balance will be your taxable gain or loss*. Suppose that you
bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them in November
1993 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985
figure of 1.484 gives a total of Pounds 8,904. Subtracting that from Pounds
13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 4,096, which is within the 1993-94 CGT
allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you
should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in November was 141.6.
*For shares sold on or after November 30, it is no longer possible to use
indexation to create, or to increase, a loss.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Glad tidings of insurance and joy -
If disaster strikes over Christmas, Bethan Hutton finds there's a policy for
just about every contingency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the first day of Christmas,
we all sat down to lunch;
But I soon felt
an ominous crunch . . .
As I was spitting out the sixpence, together with bits of shattered tooth, I
heard a strange sound and turned round to see a small, sparkly figure
floating in the air. 'I am the good insurance fairy,' she twinkled, and
waved her wand. 'Here is a magic dental insurance policy which will pay for
emergency treatment, even on Christmas day]' Then she disappeared but, when
I looked closer, I found a document on the floor.
On the second day of
Christmas, we opened some
champagne; But the cork
smashed some porcelain . . .
I was just sweeping up the pieces when the good insurance fairy appeared,
fluttering a sachet before my nose. 'Sprinkle this magic powder on the
floor]' she said. I did, and there sprang up a roll of parchment, labelled
Fine Art and Antique Insurance Policy - all my collection of Japanese
porcelain was covered.
On the third day of Christmas, cousin Wayne came round
to tea; But he tripped up
and said he'd sue me . . .
Just as I was shutting the front door behind him, the good insurance fairy
squeezed past and tossed me a tiny silver whistle. 'Blow this whenever you
need help]' she said. So I did, and a legal expenses policy flew through the
letter box.
On the fourth day of Christmas,
the tree began to fall;
And crushed Rover
chewing a ball . . .
As I picked up the 'phone to call the vet, the insurance fairy climbed from
the wreckage of the tree, brushing pine needles off her wings, and said: 'If
you say the magic words 'pet insurance policy,' all your veterinary bills
will disappear.'
On the fifth day of Christmas,
I drove to see a friend;
But a drunk driver
smashed my big end . . .
The car was a write-off. As I trudged home from the police station I heard a
familiar, tinkly voice by my side. 'Never fear, the good insurance fairy is
here', she said. 'Rub this magic lamp and see what happens.' So I did, and
suddenly a chauffeur-driven car pulled up beside me. 'Step in, ma'am,' the
driver said. 'It's all courtesy of your mobility protection insurance.'
On the sixth day of Christmas,
we saw a pantomime;
But came home to the
scene of a crime . . .
While we were out, someone had stolen all our Christmas presents, leaving
only a pile of wrapping paper. There was a rustling noise and the good
insurance fairy popped out from under a gift tag. 'Have this fan. It's
magic, of course,' she said. I waved it and a whirlwind swept away the
paper, leaving in its place a fully comprehensive household contents policy.
On the seventh day of
Christmas, gales raged around
our home; Wrecked a fence
and our garden gnome . . .
I was surveying the damage when the good insurance fairy landed with a
splash in the pond. 'Have you met your frog?' she asked, pointing to a
rather ugly green specimen sitting on a neighbouring lily pad. Before my
very eyes, it grew and grew and turned into a loss adjuster with a
clipboard. 'No problem,' he said. 'It's all covered under your garden
insurance plan.'
On the eighth day of
Christmas, the doctor came
to say; I had two
babies on the way . . .
My visions of financial ruin after paying for two of everything were
interrupted by a shimmering figure. 'If you make me their fairy godmother,
you can collect on a twins insurance policy - it will pay you lots of money
if two babies arrive at once,' the good insurance fairy promised.
On the ninth day of Christmas, we gathered round to sing;
But mice had chewed
every piano string . . .
'Oh dear,' said the good insurance fairy, inspecting the tangle under the
piano lid. But she waved her magic wand and, as she vanished, a
glitter-dusted musical instrument insurance policy appeared, propped on the
keyboard.
On the 10th day of Christmas,
I began to cough and choke;
As our thatched roof
went up in smoke . . .
A slightly singed good insurance fairy came and perched on my shoulder as
the firemen were packing up their hoses. 'This is a magic bean,' she said.
'Plant it outside your window.'
So I did and, within an hour, a flourishing vine had grown up. Its leaves
were the pages of a special thatched property insurance policy.
By the 11th day of Christmas,
I could take no more;
And collapsed on the
living room floor . . .
I came round to find the good insurance fairy hovering in front of me,
looking concerned, while to one side stood a gentleman in a white coat.
'Don't worry,' she whispered. 'My magic medical insurance policy will cover
even psychiatric treatment.'
On the 12th day of Christmas,
we were due to go away;
But I couldn't face a holiday . . .
I was regretting the waste of money when the good insurance fairy swooped
across the hospital ward. 'Cheer up,' she said. 'The cancellation section of
your travel insurance will cover everything.' Reassured, I fell asleep,
thinking warm thoughts about friendly, helpful insurance companies.
Then, on the 13th day of Christmas, an envelope arrived and, when I opened
it, there was a puff of black smoke. An evil-looking spirit emerged. 'I am
the bad insurance fairy,' she growled, and handed me a letter . . .
'Dear Madam,
We regret to inform you that, because your direct debit mandate was
incorrectly filled out, no premiums have been collected for your policies
and we were not on risk during the period December 25 to January 5
inclusive. Therefore, all your claims have been disallowed.
Yours faithfully, Celestial Insurance Company plc.'
The good insurance fairy had been a figment of my imagination - but all the
policies really exist, if you can afford them.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Calculating the cost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some new issues are made with (say) one warrant for every 10 shares
allocated, with only a price per share being announced.
When shares and warrants are sold separately and at different times, how is
the real cost of the shares and warrants calculated and indexed for the
capital gain/loss calculation?
The original cost can be apportioned between the shares and the warrants on
the basis of their respective market values (on the quarter-up basis) on the
first day upon which they are listed separately in the Stock Exchange Daily
Official List.
If need be, your tax office will tell you the apportionment factors for any
particular issue. Listed warrants are included in the definition of 'traded
option' in section 144(8)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992,
so they are exempt from the notorious wasting-asset rules.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance
for quoted shares), but bear in mind that it is not up to date because of
the Budget changes.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: How taxman finds out . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am aware that inheritance tax liability includes all gifts within the
seven years before death. But how does the Inland Revenue know? I am not
talking about deliberate evasion; but if I choose to draw cash out of my
bank account, or cash in some shares, and give the money away now and again,
how does the Revenue back-track on this if I die within seven years?
If you make a gift, this is treated as a potentially exempt transfer which
becomes fully exempt from tax once the period of seven years has elapsed.
There is no need to declare the gift when it is made but, should you die
within the seven-year period, it is necessary for the executors to declare
all gifts made within the previous seven years when applying for probate.
Therefore, each individual should keep records of gifts made so that the
executors can get hold of the information, if required.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No relief on share loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I quite understand that, from last month's Budget, losses can no longer be
indexed; but can you please advise on the following. Ward Group plc shares
were declared 'of negligible value' in July 1992 and I have not yet
established this loss. It is my intention to set it against gains in the
present year, 1993-94. Will I be able to index this loss to July 1992, or
even to October 1993 (the month before the new legislation became
effective)?
No, you will get no indexation relief at all. Had you submitted a negligible
value claim before Budget day, you could have got indexation relief up to
the month in which the claim was submitted; but we take it that when you
say: 'I have not yet established this loss,' you mean: 'I have not yet
submitted a negligible-value claim under section 24(2) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992'.
Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand,
London, WC2R 1LB, for a free copy of the Budget day press release IR28
(Capital gains: indexation allowance and capital losses).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: When tax demands follow a legal bill
 -Employees can get a costly shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With legal costs soaring, an employee whose company offered to meet his
lawyer's bill would be unlikely to look a gift horse in the mouth. But the
horse might turn out to be of the Trojan variety, concealing a platoon of
Inland Revenue inspectors armed with tax demands.
It is a well-established rule that payment of a worker's legal costs by his
employer is a taxable benefit. The key court case involved a director who
was charged with a serious motoring offence; had he been convicted, he
probably would have gone to prison. Since his company did not wish to lose
his services, it arranged for its solicitors to defend him. He was acquitted
and the company picked up the legal bill.
The Revenue then claimed that this should be taxed as part of the director's
income. He argued that, since the company's sole aim was to protect its own
interests, the Revenue had no right to tax him. But the law lords ruled that
the company's motives were irrelevant; the director had received a benefit
and was, therefore, liable to tax.
The amount on which the employee is taxed is the cost to the employer of
providing the benefit. Hence, it includes not just the lawyer's bill but
also value added tax (unless the company can recover it).
The factors which determine if that can be done were canvassed in a case
which arose out of the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster at Zeebruge
in 1987. The ship's operator, P&amp;O, and seven of its employees were charged
with manslaughter.
P&amp;O was advised that it faced a real risk of being found guilty of corporate
manslaughter, and that its fate probably hinged on whether the seven
employees were convicted. So, it instructed lawyers to defend the seven and
paid the costs of Pounds 3.5m.
Customs &amp; Excise tried to block P&amp;O's claim to recover the VAT of around
Pounds 600,000. It argued that the VAT had not been incurred by the company
in the course of its business. Even though the acquittal of the seven staff
members might have benefited the company, this did not mean that financing
their defence was a corporate objective.
The VAT tribunal disagreed. It noted that, had the seven been convicted, the
company could well have followed suit. Since a conviction for corporate
manslaughter would have done untold damage to P&amp;O's reputation, any steps
taken to prevent such damage were potentially of crucial importance to its
business
Although C&amp;E lost this battle, it will no doubt continue to deny VAT relief
 -and thus increase the employee's tax bill - in cases where the link
between the employee's legal position and the company's business is less
clear-cut.
Despite this gloomy picture, of legal bills invariably being followed by tax
bills, the Revenue recently announced a concession which will provide some
relief from this double whammy.
Under this, the taxman will turn a blind eye to the reimbursement by an
employer of legal costs incurred by an ex-employee who sues for compensation
for the loss of his job.
If the two sides have had their day in court, the employee will always get
away scot-free. On the other hand, where the parties have done their own
deal without resorting to litigation, the Revenue will relent only if the
payment is made:
Direct to the former employee's solicitor.
To cover only costs incurred in connection with the sacking.
Under a specific clause in the settlement agreement.
The Revenue's burst of seasonal generosity will be good news for vengeful
ex-employees, but there is no indication of a change of mind in relation to
legal costs in general.
Nevertheless, each case will no doubt be considered on its own merits; and
if you are, for example, a chancellor of the exchequer whose legal costs for
evicting a sex therapist have been taken care of, you might well stand a
sporting chance of staying outside the tax net.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Irredeemably attractive - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With most bond and equity markets continuing their strong rallies, and the
most optimistic forecasters starting to predict interest rates of 3 per
cent, investing for income will become increasingly difficult. If the
predictions are anywhere near accurate, income-seeking investors should give
careful consideration to bonds.
Irredeemable bonds - those with no fixed repayment date - such as permanent
interest-bearing shares (Pibs), preference shares and certain Euro-sterling
issues offer the highest incomes at present.
The table shows that some very high yields are available from Birmingham
Midshires Pibs, an issue from the country's 13th-largest building society.
We also highlight an issue from Britannia but there are several others,
details of which can be obtained from stockbrokers or other professional
advisers.
Professional investors assess the value of bonds by monitoring, among other
things, the 'yield spread': the difference between the yield of the bond and
that of comparable gilts. Despite the strength in price terms, it is
interesting to note that the spreads for many irredeemables are virtually
unchanged from the start of the year.
At the start of 1993, Britannia 13 per cent Pibs were offered at 11.42 per
cent compared with 8.78 per cent from long gilts (a spread of 264 basis
points), whereas now the Pibs are 9.08 per cent and the gilts 6.52 per cent
(a spread of 256 basis points). More important: in proportional terms, the
Pibs' yield is nearly 40 per cent greater than the gilt yield, having been
only 30 per cent at the start of the year.
Severe pre-Budget weakness in the price of preference shares led to a 7 per
cent post-Budget rally when the feared changes to advance corporation tax
did not occur. Many preference shares have made gains of 15 per cent during
the year.
There are, of course, risks involved with buying irredeemable issues. First,
they rank as one of the lowest creditors in the event of financial
difficulties.
Second, the capital value of your investment will depend on market forces
(ie, you can get back your capital only by selling the investment at
whatever price is available at the time). Thus if expectations for interest
rates or inflation rise, the value of your investment will probably fall.
A third concern could be demands from issuers to raise new capital through
these instruments.

This is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients direct; those
interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Charity begins at home - Bethan
Hutton suggests ways to help those less fortunate than yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So you bought Oxfam Christmas cards, put money in the carol singers' tin,
and are planning to offload all your ghastlier presents onto the local
charity shop. But is there still a nagging feeling at the back of your mind
 -prompted by yet another viewing of A Christmas Carol - that, in this
season of goodwill, you could be doing a little bit more?
If your new year resolution is to give a bit more to those less fortunate
than yourself, here are a few ways to make it easier (and get the Inland
Revenue to chip in as well).
There are three tax-efficient ways to give money to charity, depending on
how much you want to give and whether you want to make a long term
commitment or just a one-off donation. They are payroll giving (also known
as give-as-you-earn, or Gaye), gift aid, and covenants.
Most large employers operate Gaye schemes. You can give as little as Pounds
5 a month, and the maximum has been increased recently to Pounds 75 a month.
You can donate to several different charities and stop at any time you
choose. The money is deducted from gross income, which means that those on
basic rate tax would pay just Pounds 56.25 net towards a Pounds 75 donation,
and higher rate taxpayers Pounds 45.
Gift aid is designed for one-off donations. The minimum donation was
originally Pounds 600, then Pounds 400, and it was reduced to its present
level of Pounds 250 in the March Budget to make it accessible to more
people. There is no upper limit, and gifts made in this way are treated as
net of basic rate income tax.
This means a gift of Pounds 250 actually becomes Pounds 333 in the hands of
the charity, and higher rate taxpayers can claim back the 15 per cent
difference between basic and top rate tax, so a donation worth Pounds 333 to
the charity would only cost a higher rate taxpayer Pounds 200.
To ensure that tax can be reclaimed, you must fill out a form, which the
charity should be able to supply.
Gift aid, however, is not an appropriate scheme for non-taxpayers as the
Inland Revenue can ask you for the tax reclaimed by the charity.
While covenants are the longest established tax-efficent method of giving to
charity, they are the least flexible, too. They are a long term commitment,
designed to last at least four years, and you must make payments at fixed
intervals.
You need to fill in the standard covenant form, provided by most charities,
and set up a standing order or some other method of making regular payments.
Covenants are treated as net of basic rate tax, so the charity can reclaim
an extra 25 per cent from the Revenue, and higher rate taxpayers can reclaim
15 per cent of the gross amount for themselves.
You can choose whether your covenant is net or gross. If the former - say,
Pounds 10 a month - then the charity can recoup whatever the present basic
rate tax might be on that amount.
If gross, you would pay only Pounds 7.50 of that Pounds 10 at present; but,
if tax rates change, you might pay more or less. Again, covenants are not
suitable for use by non-taxpayers.
The Charities Aid Foundation*, which is itself a charity, operates an
account scheme for donors who want to spread their largesse between a range
of charities. You pay money into the account using one of the tax-efficient
methods - gift aid, Gaye or a covenant - so that tax can be reclaimed on
your donation, and you receive a set of vouchers resembling a cheque book.
The vouchers can then be given to any charity, for any amount you choose, or
you can set up standing orders to specific charities. This means that you
can take advantage of the tax breaks even to distribute small amounts of
money to a number of charities.
CAF charges a small percentage of your donation to cover administration
costs. It also offers charity gift vouchers, which enable recipients to make
a donation to the charity of their choice.
One way to give yourself a warm, charitable glow without any immediate
expense is to rewrite your will and include a few gifts of cash or goods to
charities.
Such bequests are free of inheritance tax and are an important source of
funding for many charities - so much so that many provide guidance on how to
make a will.
Affinity credit cards are not a highly efficient way to give to charity, but
every little helps. Affinity cards are ordinary Access or Visa cards which
pay your chosen charity a fixed amount - usually Pounds 5 - when first you
get the card, then donate 20p or 25p for every Pounds 100 you spend using
it.
To make a substantial donation this way, you would need to use the card
extensively. If you spend Pounds 500 a month on it, then at 25p per Pounds
100 the charity would receive only Pounds 15 over the course of a year. And
some cards charge an annual fee.
The Co-op bank, Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland
offer several affinity cards, but there are other operators. Ask your
favourite charity if it has such a scheme.
Some cards, such as the Visa issued by the Leeds building society, are
automatically charity cards, distributing money to a number of popular
charities.
It might be a little early to start thinking about next year's Christmas
presents but, in eight or nine months, the catalogues will be dropping
through your letter box again and, these days, you can buy far more than
Christmas cards from them.
Commercial activities, such as gift catalogues and shops, are making a
growing contribution towards funds for charities and some of them,
particularly those related to the third world and the environment, also use
these activities to further their aims by promoting trade and using
sustainable resources.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: How to give children a gift that
grows - Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at presents with long-term benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your children tear open their Christmas cards tomorrow to find that some
include Pounds 10 notes from godparents while grandmother has written out a
cheque for several hundred pounds. You also want to make them a cash gift.
Before they get too excited, warn them that you will be taking away most of
the money to invest for when they are older. They may not thank you now -
but should be grinning eventually when they see the number of noughts added
to the original gift. But there are several things you need to watch.
The tax position
Anthony Fraser, of independent financial adviser Fraser Marr, says that
before investing the money 'a sensible precaution is to document the source
and who it is for - by means, in the case of a grand-parent, of a simple
grand-parent gift letter. This is important to avoid an investment being
taxed as the parent's own, rather than taking advantage of the child's tax
exemptions and allowances.'
The provisions of Section 663 of the Taxes Act 1988 relate only to gifts
made by a parent to a child. This results in income derived from the assets
being taxed as though the income is the parent's (except where the income is
less than Pounds 100 in a tax year).
To get around this provision, Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward,
suggests a parent should invest in tax-free investments such as some
National Savings products and investments which produce no income - say,
zero dividend preference shares (see below).
'If you wish to gift money and place the proceeds on deposit, then a simple
'bare trust' could be the answer, provided you are prepared to lock away the
money until the child is 18 years of age,' Stillerman adds.
Inheritance tax is another consideration for parents wanting to make gifts
to their children or other members of the family. Up to Pounds 3,000 a year
can be given away without being considered a potentially exempt transfer (a
gift is potentially exempt because it will be liable to IHT if the donor
dies within seven years of making the gift).
You can also make a gift of up to Pounds 250 in any tax year to any number
of individuals without liability to pay IHT.
The Pounds 3,000 relief can be carried forward for one year only. So, if you
have not used up any of last year's exemption, you can give away as much as
Pounds 6,000 this tax year without risking IHT.
Regular gifts to members of the family may escape IHT altogether; this is a
much neglected provision. 'If your income less tax and your normal annual
spending leaves you with a surplus, then such gifts may be made out of this
surplus,' says Stillerman.
'If, for example, your income is Pounds 100,000 and your income tax bill
Pounds 35,000 each year, then you have Pounds 65,000 to spend. If you spend
only Pounds 50,000 a year, then there should be a surplus of Pounds 15,000,
and so you could make regular gifts out of income up to this figure.' But
the money must be given regularly and you should record clearly your
intention to make a regular gift.
Deposits
If you are opening a deposit account for a child, the table (provided by
Moneyfacts) shows a selection of those that yield the highest. Many can be
opened with Pounds 1. The highest minimum deposit is Norwich &amp;
Peterborough's HeadStart savings bond, which pays 6.3 per cent gross on
Pounds 250 to a maximum of Pounds 500,000. Despite its name, it operates as
an instant access account.
Skipton's Young Sovereign account is paying 6.5 per cent gross on a minimum
of Pounds 25 (maximum Pounds 3,000) and is also instant access. There is an
additional 2 per cent bonus (gross) if no withdrawals are made until
December 1 1994.
Children are entitled to their own personal allowance of Pounds 3,445, but
you need to fill in form R85 (available from banks and building societies)
to declare that the child is a non-taxpayer so that the interest is received
gross.
Investments
A low risk investment is the National Savings children's bond, although the
rate was lowered last week to 7.35 per cent compound per annum if held for
five years. Application forms are not yet in the post offices but you can
order one by ringing freephone 0800-868 700. The maximum holding of all
previous issues of the bond (up to and including issue E) is Pounds 1,000
but you can, in addition, hold Pounds 1,000 of the new issue F.
The children's bond is an investment which is particularly suitable for
parents giving to their offspring since it is tax-free (see tax position
above). Another idea for parents is to make use of the child's capital gains
tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 by investing in zero dividend preference
shares, which do not produce income. Zeros are one class of share issued by
a split capital investment trust. Since they do not pay a dividend, they
have first claim on the trust's capital when it comes to be wound up.
Robert Noble Warren, of Murray Noble, says: 'Zeros such as Scottish National
and St Davids are generally regarded as safe. Many zeros are on track to
produce 6 to 7 per cent per annum, and this should be tax-free in the
child's hands up to the child's capital gains tax allowance.'
Baby bonds are a long-term savings plan issued by friendly societies. You
can invest up to Pounds 18 a month (or Pounds 200 a year) on behalf of the
child in a tax-exempt fund, and the lump sum when the bond matures (after at
least 10 years) is also tax-free.
Tony Shepherd, of independent financial adviser Shepherd Associates,
recommends Tunbridge Wells Equitable's with-profits baby bond. 'The past
performance has been good despite relatively high charges usually associated
with low premium products, but future results may not be so impressive if
unit-linked performance is a guide,' he says.
Other longer-term investments are unit and investment trusts. According to
the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, the easiest way to
invest in units for someone under 18 is to establish a designated account:
you buy the investment in your own name but add the child's initials to
indicate who owns it.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies says the most usual way to
place money in such trusts is for an adult to act as a 'bare trustee' by
registering the shares in his name with the child's name or initials added,
to signify that the purchase is not for the beneficial ownership of the
adult.
If you are a parent and are investing your own money for the child, you
might wish to choose a low-yielding fund to minimise your income tax bill.
For those wanting capital growth and higher risk, Shepherd suggests such
collective funds as F&amp;C Smaller Companies, F&amp;C Emerging Markets, Murray
Smaller Markets, and Perpetual International Emerging Companies.
His recommendations for balanced growth and medium risk are Foreign &amp;
Colonial investment trust, Monks investment trust, and Perpetual
International Growth unit trust.
Fraser adds that a child might find it fun to have part of his money
invested in premiums bonds now that the jackpot has been increased to Pounds
1m.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: Lessons of a splendid time for gilts - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would think, from the fuss that has been made about the stock market's
performance in the last few months, that 1993 had been a particularly
fruitful year for equity investors.
In fact, the 20.6 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index from the
end of last year to the middle of this week is good but not spectacular. If
these gains are preserved until December 31, this will only be the tenth
best year since 1970, ranking below all but one of the years of the great
1980s rally.
The really striking performance by historical standards this year has come
from gilts. The FT Government Securities index passed the 100 mark for the
first time in years, and the FT-Actuaries All Stocks index of gilts rose
10.4 per cent, the highest figure since 1982 and one of only five
double-digit rises in nearly a quarter century. Gilts benefited from a
worldwide fall in interest rates - the long end of the US treasury market
apart - and from a belief that chancellor Kenneth Clarke's first Budget
represented a serious attempts to get the government's borrowing under
control. In the past month, gilts have delivered the best performance of all
the world's main government bond markets.
Still, when you take dividends and interest into account, equities retain
the lead for the year as a whole. The FT's latest Monday table, showing the
total return on all asset classes, gives a 22 per cent return on 7-10 year
gilts and a 28 per cent return on UK equities.
This comparison is a tribute to the traditionally generous dividend policy
of UK companies. It also tells us something important about the way
companies have weathered the recession. Though 1993's dividends were paid on
results ravaged by the recession, they stayed high: in fact, on S G
Warburg's estimates the market paid out 6 1/2 per cent more in dividends
this year than it did last.
You can interpret the grim determination with which British boards kept up
their dividends in two ways, optimistic and pessimistic. The optimistic view
is that if UK plc was still able and willing to raise dividends in the teeth
of the recession, it will be committed to keeping them growing in the years
to come. Steady dividend growth and low long-term interest rates will
provide a strong valuation underpinning for the market. That will help push
the FT-SE to the 4,000 mark that is being talked about as the next peak on
the horizon, now that 3,500 looks comfortably within reach.
The pessimistic case is that keeping dividends up has strained historical
ratios. Cover - the extent to which dividends are covered by earnings - has
dropped to around 1.5 or so, if you exclude the utilities, a figure that is
well below traditional levels. The normal pattern is that as the economy
recovers, profits rise sharply and cover is rapidly restored. But, as a
letter from a reader, A H Carter, of Kempsey, near Worcester, points out,
the low inflation rate which has contributed to low bond yields and this
year's stock market performance has another consequence.
He argues that lower inflation will cap prices. 'There are 1bn workers in
China and eastern Europe willing to work for under Pounds 2 an hour,' he
says, 'and they will be given the opportunity.' These factors will limit
profit gains. Cover will need to be rebuilt, so 'dividends may rise, but
only marginally.' His conclusion is that as interest rates fall, investors
will again become risk averse, and equity yields will end up higher than the
yield on gilts, as used to be the case until the 1960s.
Even without pushing the argument that far, Carter has a point. Is equity
enthusiasm based in part on a fervent belief in a free lunch? There are many
aspects of low inflation which are good for equities: falling interest
rates, a more stable business environment, and so on. But the supply-side
factors that hold prices down, including overcapacity and the growing
competition from low-cost producers, are not good for those companies
exposed to them.
The chart of the best and worst-performing sectors in the All-Share, shown
above, may be hinting at some of these forces. Not surprisingly, the best
performers are companies that stand to benefit most from low interest rates,
especially property companies and banks. In general, though, all the sectors
with specially strong performances this year benefit from being protected
from the price competition that has become endemic among manufacturers.
Down at the bottom of the performance rankings come sectors where pricing
power is under threat. Food retailers and manufacturers, for example, risk a
supermarket price war. The pharmaceutical companies that dominate the health
and household sector face a worldwide attack on drugs prices by governments
and health insurers. And the drinks companies' strategy of pushing up
margins to compensate for flat or falling volumes has run into problems this
year.
Perhaps the striking outperformance of smaller companies, shown in the other
chart, also owes something to this factor. Smaller companies, in general,
are better protected from the fierce winds of international price
competition than their larger rivals. And the second-tier stocks - those
represented by the FT-SE Mid 250 index - are dominated by utilities, with
regulated prices.
Even commercial television companies face greater competition, though you
might not think so from the performance of media stocks, up 33 per cent on
the year. The driving factor here, of course, has been the rush to merge,
leading to the hostile bid by Granada for LWT. As the industry switched off
its collective brain for the Christmas viewing season, the outcome of the
bid was still in doubt.
LWT's main defence manoeuvre - an elaborate attempt to merge with
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, then sell off the Tyne Tees franchise to Anglia -
seemed to be getting nowhere. That left the LWT board to appeal for
shareholder loyalty on the basis of an exemplary management record. Since
Granada's cash alternative is a low one, shareholders will mostly be
deciding on the basis of its offer of shares. They will have to make up
their minds whether they prefer the long-standing performance record of the
LWT team to the impressive recovery staged by the new men at Granada.
The City has been enjoying the week before Christmas, cheerfully playing the
traditional festive game of squeezing market makers caught short of stock
ahead of the holidays - a routine which contributed to yesterday's 40.8
point rise in the FT-SE 100 index, to a new record close of 3,396.5. During
the day, the index passed through the 3,400 level for the first time.
The week also saw a flurry of corporate news. Lasmo eased its debt problems
by selling a stake in the Liverpool Bay gas field to PowerGen. Together with
a clutch of other assets, this raised Pounds 123m.
Unilever strengthened its position in the ice-cream business - one of its
strongest sectors - by buying control of France's biggest independent
producer Ortiz-Miko. The company has 18 per cent of total French ice-cream
sales, giving Unilever the country's sales leadership, with roughly a third
of the market. The deal is valued at around Pounds 220m, a mouthful for most
companies but no more than a threepenny cornet for Unilever.
Perhaps the biggest corporate development, however, was the government's
announcement that it plans to open all British Gas's domestic markets to
competition. The shares had reached a record high of 360p last week, as
investors decided that the government was not, after all, going to break up
British Gas.
Though Tuesday's announcement confirmed that guess, the news of the
competition decision came as a nasty shock. The shares lost 10p on the day,
closing yesterday at 336 1/2 p, a fall of 20 1/2 p since last week. It was
yet another piece of evidence that even in the utility sector, price
competition is breaking out all over.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: A good news year - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just under 12 months ago, who on Wall Street could have imagined that the
stock market would be ending 1993 in such robust form and good humour? Share
prices are trading near record highs. The economy is growing at a faster
rate than expected and corporate profits are improving steadily.
Inflation remains unthreatening, which means domestic interest rates have
stayed close to 30-year lows. And the underwriting calendar is as busy as
ever at the end of what has been the best year in history for corporate debt
and equity issuance. Even the long-dormant mergers and acquisitions business
is thriving, with a strong year ending in blockbuster style with a planned
Dollars 5bn employee-led buyout of UAL, and what could be a winning Dollars
10bn bid in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications.
All this and record profits (bonuses, too) for the traders, bankers and
deal-makers who have oiled the wheels of the financial markets throughout
1993. At times, it seemed as if Christmas came every other week for Wall
Street in 1993.
The year, however, had some downs as well as many ups. There were periodic
attacks of anxiety over the direction of interest rates and the possible
revival of inflation, in particular during the autumn when prices of
government securities nose-dived and long-term bond yields rose sharply.
The stock market's nerves were assailed several times during 1993 by
President Clinton's peculiarly cliff-hanging style of making policy and law.
His last-gasp legislative victories over the administration's first Budget
and, later, the North American Free Trade Agreement may look like successes
now but, at the time, the votes were too close for the market's comfort.
Shock waves from overseas also washed ashore occasionally in New York. Trade
became a troublesome issue for the first time in recent memory because of
Nafta and Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), while turmoil
in foreign financial markets (especially the continued decline in Japanese
equities and fresh upheavals in the European currency markets) sometimes
took its toll on sentiment in the US. And political crises in Russia and
threats of conflict in Korea left US investors rattled at times.
Yet, the good memories outweigh the bad, as they should at the end of any
year in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen almost 14 per cent,
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 more than 7 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite
index nearly 12 per cent.
As in 1992, the main driving force behind rising share prices has been low
interest rates. For almost three years now, these have been persuading
investors to shift money out of low-yielding, short-term assets, such as
bank certificates of deposit and money-market funds, and into equities where
dividend returns and the potential for capital growth look more enticing.
The steadily improving economy, and solid growth in corporate profits, also
have helped to sustain stock prices. Then there was the unexpected boost to
share values from the return of merger mania. In several key industries -
media and entertainment (Paramount and QVC or Viacom); telecommunications
(McCaw Cellular and AT&amp;T, TeleCommunications Inc and Bell Atlantic);
healthcare (Medco Containment and Merck); and financial services (Shearson
and Smith Barney, Dreyfus and Mellon Bank) - factors such as technological
revolution, impending regulatory change and a search for efficiency through
consolidation forced a host of big companies into strategic unions.
If there was one drawback, it was the tendency among many companies to
finance their deals with equity, which led to some dilution of share values.
Finally, 1993 also has been a year in which the cream of the country's
managers have learned to respect the power of institutional shareholders and
investors. Among those ousted because of poor performance were John Akers at
IBM, Kay Whitmore at Eastman Kodak, Jim Robinson at American Express and
Paul Lego at Westinghouse.
And what of 1994? The view that the bull market has run its course, and that
rising interest rates will force a correction in over-valued share prices
early next year, is gathering support. It is a persuasive argument, but the
Christmas spirit should be strong enough to allow Wall Street to put aside
doubts about the future and enjoy the last few days of a remarkable year.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors regain that ring of
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a great year for UK stock market investors. But how did it match
up to our monthly director confidence ratio?
From January to June, directors showed little interest in acquiring their
own shares - indeed, the level of buying was, more or less, matched by
selling throughout that period. Historically, that is a fairly bearish
statistic.
Boardroom sentiment improved dramatically in July, though, with the buy/sell
ratio moving back up to 2.5/1. Shortly thereafter, the market moved out of
its 2,800-2,950 trading range and breached the 3,000 barrier. The only other
month when the buy/sell ratio hitched over 2.5/1 was November - and we know
how well the market has performed since the Budget.
Overall, the balance between buying and selling by directors continues to
provide a remarkably accurate indication of stock market trends, although
there were fewer wild fluctuations in the ratio during 1993 than in previous
years. That might be explained by the relative maturity of the present bull
market phase. Yet, many of the stocks that featured prominently last year
have re-appeared at various stages throughout 1993, and not always with the
same story.
Martin Sorrell's WPP was tipped widely as a prime beneficiary of increased
advertising spending during the year, so the bulls had a field day when he
bought 100,000 shares at 55p in January. The previous year, he had acquired
200,000 shares at between 34.5p and 39p. In September, the price hit 105p,
but Sorrell sold 850,000 at 92.5p in November and the price has fallen
since.
Richard Peskin, the high-profile chairman and managing director of Great
Portland Estates, a leading property group, has shown equally deft timing.
Peskin has long been critical of the stock market's reluctance to rate
property shares more highly, and he has sought equally consistently to
capitalise on this perceived valuation discrepancy by buying significant
chunks of his own stock. His largest purchase was a line of 500,000 shares
in December 1991, but he continued to buy throughout 1992 at prices as low
as 104p.
The subsequent performance of the property sector has proved him right, and
Peskin sold 750,000 at 225p three weeks ago. Many of his peers in the sector
also have found it difficult to resist the temptation to take profits in
recent weeks.
Tom Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Automated Security, is another
who has cause to celebrate 1993. In March, he sold 200,000 shares at 157p,
taking a handsome profit on the 173,000 he had bought in the previous year
at 85p. The third-quarter results announced in October revealed profits down
sharply, and the shares fell dramatically. Buffett seized the opportunity to
buy back, picking up another 250,000 at just 101p. That purchase already
seems been timed sweetly.
This finely-timed execution is usually shown by individual directors, but
there are occasions when the whole board deals just as effectively. In
April, nine directors of of insurance broker Steel Burrill Jones sold over
1m shares at 234p. In September, the company announced losses at the interim
stage, catching the market unawares.
The share price decreased rapidly and 10 directors bought a total of 125,000
at 144p. As a general rule, you should always be wary when directors sell
heavily at the top and then re-invest only a small proportion of their
proceeds, so Steel Burrill Jones will be an interesting one to watch.
The above are examples of two-way trading by directors, but many have
absolutely no inclination to buy back into shares they have sold. One such
would be Melvyn Marcus, deputy chairman of Queens Moat Houses.
When he sold 1.1m at 57p just days before the company entered its closed
period in February, there was little obvious sign of trouble. Subsequent
events, including the departure of Marcus, have shown that the company was
virtually insolvent and its fate now lies in the hands of the receivers.
Just as Marcus is in no position to sell more shares, even if he wanted to,
the three directors who bought stock in Erskine House in April are in a
similar position. Having bought heavily at around 31p, directors of the
troubled photocopier group made a killing only weeks later when they agreed
to be taken over by US-based Alco at the equivalent of 90p. Ordinary
investors can only marvel at this sort of conspicuous success.
Inevitably, while there are countless examples of directors making a
killing, there are also one or two occasions when their timing is a little
less than perfect. Probably the most unfortunate of these was Lord King's
purchase in Babcock International, where he is chairman. During two days in
July, King spent almost Pounds 150,000 acquiring stock at around 36p. The
interim results in October revealed recovery was not as advanced as had been
hoped, and he is still nursing a paper loss.
Doubtless, 1994 will continue to provide us with many more examples of
directors enhancing or protecting their wealth - and perhaps one or two
cases where they prove that they, too, are fallible.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets: So you want to get rich quick . . . - Frivolous
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time has arrived to give the fragile economic recovery a kick-start by
displaying the entrepreneurship on which the health of 1990s' Britain
depends. After studying personal finance developments of the past year, I am
setting up a subsidiary, Coggo Enterprises, to offer new products
exclusively to FT readers. The attractive range includes:
The Emerging Planets fund
China, Vietnam, and Tajikistan are old hat already. Serious growth investors
are looking beyond the emerging markets and towards the solar system. Think
of the tourist possibilities of Mercury, the sunshine planet. Calculate the
mineral deposits on Mars, the gas reserves of Jupiter and the refrigeration
facilities available on Pluto.
Serious profits will be made only by those who invest early. Send a cheque
now and we guarantee your money will be invested in the first interplanetary
stock market companies to be quoted. In the short term, of course,
opportunities will be limited, so no dividends will be paid.
The cut-price, fixed-rate mortgage
Just 1.99 per cent*. No, you are not dreaming. The lowest mortgage rate
since Ethelred the Unready defaulted on his castle repayment plan - and it
is fixed for a whole year. Conditional only on clients taking out an
endowment policy, personal pension policy, home contents and building
insurance, washing my car every Thursday and letting the firm's employees
use your house at weekends.
*APR 49.6 per cent.
The surefire personal pension
Why depend on your employer, or the stock market, for your pension? Simply
go out and sell personal pensions to other people and invest the healthy
commission income in your own pension plan. It is so easy that you can look
forward from the start to retiring in Barbados. We send you the whole
package, including completed fact-finds to save your clients all that
unnecessary paperwork.
Simply get them to fill out a direct debit and, to keep the regulators
happy, ask them to complete the following sentence in less than 12 words: 'I
would like to opt out of my government-guaranteed, index-linked pension
which has full death benefits because . . .'
The very, very high income fund
Dissatisfied with single-digit income plans? Not tempted by a measly 10 per
cent or so? The very, very high income fund guarantees to pay you an income
of 20 per cent a year over five years.
Yes, that's right. Your capital is returned in full and tax-free over the
five years. At the end of the period you might also, in certain
circumstances*, receive a lump sum equal to your original investment.
Minimum: Pounds 10,000 or the equivalent in any other currency. (At Coggo
Enterprises, we are not fussy).
*Only if England win the World Cup in 1998 and Arthur Scargill becomes prime
minister.
The warrants warrant fund.
Namby-pamby financial services groups have simply failed to provide
investors with products which have the right kind of risk-reward profiles
for today's go-go stock markets. The warrants warrant fund fills a niche.
It buys warrants, which entitle the holder to buy warrants, which in turn
entitle the holder to buy the capital shares of highly-geared split capital
investment trusts. If the stock market grows at a modest 25 per cent a year
until 2000, investors who put Pounds 1,000 in the fund will have a holding
equivalent to the GNP of Canada.
To protect investors against the down-side, we supply a ready-made writ so
you can sue the Bank of England for allowing the fund to exist when, as is
99.99 per cent certain, you lose the lot.
The Rockall umbrella fund.
The ultimate offshore product, which is out of reach of all the world's tax
authorities*. The Rockall umbrella fund has more than 400 sub-funds
(everything from Algerian bonds to Zambian smaller companies). You are
allowed as many switches between funds as you like in a calendar year.
Indeed, the more the better, since we get 2 per cent every time you make a
change.
*And of you, when you want your money back.
Critical reports insurance
Fed up with all those critical reports from regulatory bodies? Worried how
you are going to pay the fines? For a modest premium, our policy will
guarantee to pay off the fine and meet the regulator's costs. We will also
issue a standard press release saying: 'These problems are all in the past.
The people concerned have been dismissed. We are confident in the ability of
our staff to serve the public and in the attractions of our
endowment/personal pension/single premium policy' (delete where applicable).
(Select your policy from SIB, Lautro, SFA, Imro and Fimbra varieties. When
it comes to Consumers' Association reports and quotes from Jean Eaglesham,
you are on your own.)
If you wish to take up any of these policies, please send all cheques to the
Old Hacks Retirement Fund, The Big Yacht, Somewhere in the Caribbean Hiding
from the UK Regulatory Authorities.
Merry Christmas.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Entranced by the voice of an angel -
Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year was 1955, the place a large auditorium in Johannesburg, and the
occasion a concert featuring one of the world's most famous and highly
esteemed singers. It was her first in the country, and awaited with the
highest excitement: for, even in the postwar period before the
anti-apartheid arts boycott began to bite, South Africa was a somewhat
out-of-the-way place for the world's truly front-rank musicians. So when one
such as this soprano did arrive, the waves of anticipation tended to ripple
far beyond the small, confined pool of Johannesburg concert-devotees.
I was nine. I had already been exposed to the concert hall on a single
occasion a few years earlier (a piano recital offering inter alia some of
the Schubert pieces I was myself struggling to learn at the time - not a
great success, of which all I now recall is the discomfort of having to sit
still for an achingly long time in 'smart', scratchy, flannel trousers).
But the prospect of hearing a singing voice of this calibre seemed to perk
up even my artistically unenthusable parents. In turn this conveyed itself
to me; there was also something intriguingly exotic about the singer's name
 -much longer than the Johannesburg norm, Victoria to begin with and
something or other to do with angels at the end - which gave an attractive
tinge to my expectations of the event. (The stimulus of memorable names on a
child's imagination should never be underestimated.)
The concert itself I remember hardly at all in detail - I have, for
instance, no idea what she sang - and almost entirely in terms of its
general impact upon me: an awareness of something marvellous sweeping over
me that grew ever greater; a sense of disbelief turned to wonder that the
singing voice could be so powerful yet so joyously unforced, could go so
high and low, could sometimes move so fast and at other times hold itself so
long, quiet and steady; above all, a thrill at the way the sound seemed to
make itself part of the listener's very being.
Of the lady herself I have only a vague but treasured image, which has been
superimposed upon by the subsequent (adult) occasions I encountered her - a
dark-haired figure in a shining dress with a cape who smiled as though she
were the friend of every small boy in the hall, and made magic.
Indeed, magic it was: at some point during the evening I must have become
convinced that this singer was really an enchanted emanation of music
itself. In this parcel of suffused, inarticulate sensations I also trace the
belief, formed under her influence, that 'real' music, music that
illuminated your inner being in this way, had always to be sung music, and
that the art of such singing was a gift that only a few lucky people would
ever be able to practise.
Later on I came to learn that the last conviction was the most reliable  -
the others were gradually amplified, and corrected, by other inspiring
musicians, instrumentalists and singers with other kinds of voices and
personalities. But to this day I retain the feeling of an Aurora-like
awakening from sleep which the experience achieved in me.
Victoria de los Angeles, the singer in question, celebrated last month her
70th birthday. As (to judge from a recent series of Radio 4 interviews with
her) she remains a person of undimmed spiritual and emotional radiance, it
gives me peculiar pleasure to think that this small reminiscence may also
serve as a timely tribute and expression of private gratitude to a great and
glorious artist.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Shell-shocked by Cimino - Film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A seminal experience, announced the arts editor. Something that changed your
life and sparked your love affair with the art of your choice. Something
that made you what you are today. We journalists know this kind of piece. It
is the equivalent of being told by your employer, 'Here is a length of stout
rope, over there is a tree-branch.'
'Made me what I am today' - but what am I? And what film should be maligned
by being held responsible?
First I would have to subpoena two childhood memories, The Wizard Of Oz and
Prince Valiant. These made me fall in love with the experience of filmgoing.
The first sent shockwaves of delight through me by turning without warning
from black-and-white to colour: something I had no idea could be done either
in life or in cinema. The second film, in which Robert Wagner fought a bunch
of Arthurian baddies with nought but a broadsword and pudding-bowl haircut,
proved revelatory in the fact of being seen at a morning screening. My
parents took me to it in the West End. Aged eight, I could not believe that
bliss could start so soon after daybreak.
I must also record an adolescence devoted to Gothic cinema. Vincent Price
never knew how passionate a following he had among the students of Lancing
College, Sussex. We roamed the streets of Brighton in search of Mr Price and
Mr Poe. The Pit And The Pendulum, Tales Of Terror, The Haunted Palace -
these movies were succulently preposterous where others were portentous.
They soared to idiot heights and plumbed charnel depths. They taught us that
flimsy-budgeted, fly-by-night art could be as kinetic and imaginative as -
often more so than - the fatter, costlier products of the the world's dream
factories.
But if I must isolate and enthrone one movie, let it be a later one. Some
films are so powerful that they risk sending you out of the cinema rather
than holding you inside. As a child I fled Invaders From Mars in terror.
More recently Reservoir Dogs built up an atmosphere of evil so strong I kept
making a mental dash for the exit door. But I have never been dragged
through so many strong emotions, with such a merciless guiding intelligence,
as in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter.
I still believe that Cimino is a giant that Hollywood squandered rather than
 -usual version - a spendthrift egomaniac who half-bankrupted Hollywood.
Like Heaven's Gate, The Deer Hunter creates an entire community from the
ground up: something no other modern film-maker is capable of. The film's
Russian-American steel town is so well-painted, so densely characterised
that you can feel it, touch it, smell it. And when the film goes to Vietnam,
its fictionalised scene of psychological torture - the maligned 'Russian
Roulette sequence' - has a power on first viewing that leaves you almost
literally shell-shocked.
This is what cinema can do and should do: take you to a part of yourself and
your emotions you never knew existed. If The Deer Hunter was not the literal
truth about the Vietnam war, it was something more. It began by making the
cinema a window on the real world; then it turned that window into a
wound-opening into the American soul and the souls of all us.
In the years after its release and its multiple Oscar sweep The Deer Hunter
became politically incorrect. All the way from its demonisation of the
Vietcong to its supposed ill-treatment of animals, the movie became a giant
whipping boy for right-on thinkers. I know: I was there at the National Film
Theatre interviewing Cimino on stage on the day protesters threw
firecrackers among the audience.
No movie reaches greatness without offending someone. Such provocations are
the sign of a high-voltage imaginative experience wired to real events in a
real world. A short list of films that have been deemed politically
incorrect would include Birth Of A Nation, Napoleon, Battleship Potemkin, La
Regle Du Jeu and The Searchers. The Deer Hunter belongs right up there in
that company.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Bowled over by Beethoven - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody should doubt the importance of music-teaching in schools. My school
used to run regular trips to London for concerts and operas, usually one or
two a term. It was as much an excuse for an evening out as anything else,
but at least young minds came to associate music with having a good time,
which is no bad thing.
My first outing was to The Magic Flute by Sadler's Wells Opera, about which
I remember nothing except that Sarastro's priests were dressed in a gaudy
orange which I thought very tasteless.
The next trip made more of an impression. Indeed, it changed the direction
of my life. We went to the penultimate night of the Proms, an excellent seat
I recall, directly above the royal box. (It was possible to drop
sweet-wrappers down on to the crown below.) The main work was Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, which I had not heard before, and even the vagaries of the
Royal Albert Hall's acoustics could not dull the music's power (I distinctly
remember seeing the conductor finish the symphony and the promenaders jump
to their feet before I heard the final chord). The thrill and power of the
music left my head spinning. I went out the next day and bought my first
classical record.
The only comparable experience came years later. English National Opera had
put on a production of Massenet's Werther, then a rarity, for Janet Baker.
The first two acts seemed to me sentimental in just the way I had imagined
Massenet to be from the snobbish criticism he used to get in those days, but
the third act held me rivetted. As Werther and Charlotte circled each other
at their fateful Christmas Eve meeting, I was swept away with the intensity
of it to a world far removed from St. Martin's Lane.
Only when the curtain came down for the interlude did I regain my bearings.
My forehead felt cold and damp, so I lifted a hand to wipe the sweat from my
brow and was surprised to find bits of paper stuck to my fingers, dropping
on to my face. I had just ripped the programme to shreds. What the people
around me thought I do not know. Either they had been as engrossed as I was
or they were asleep. Unfortunately, given Massenet's lack of popularity with
British audiences, I suspect the latter.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Now you can tune into a Penguin - Spoken
Word
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Hello children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin . . .'
Anyone old enough to recall Daphne Oxenford's words at the start of each
episode of the radio programme Listen with Mother will have no trouble in
immediately placing Margaret Thatcher's reading of her book The Downing
Street Years (four cassettes, six hours, Pounds 14.99 HarperCollins
Audiobooks). The odd thing is that Thatcher's patronising 'I know what's
good for you' tone quickly becomes tiresome in the absence of those
manically staring eyes, inevitably absent on an audio tape.
Despite that, her recording could be the best-selling audio tape in the
run-up to Christmas; it has sold 17,500 copies since its October launch.
But that is a one-off. Of much greater importance in spoken word publishing
has been Penguin's launch into this highly competitive market in November,
backed by a Pounds 50,000 marketing budget. Penguin will not say how well
sales are going, but its decision to enter the audio book field is logical:
the UK spoken word market, currently estimated to be worth as much as Pounds
46m, is growing at some 10 per cent annually; book sales are shrinking for
all but the most commercially successful best-sellers; and Penguin has an
impressive backlist which converts naturally into a powerful spoken word
collection.
It has published 15 titles so far, including Derek Jacobi reading The Iliad;
Dirk Bogarde reading his own book A Short Walk From Harrods; versions of
Dracula, Madame Bovary, and Of Mice and Men; Hotel Pastis read by its author
Peter Mayle; and some Beatrix Potter tales.
The version of The Iliad (Pounds 19.99, nine hours on six cassettes,
abridged extracts) is everything Margaret Thatcher's reading is not. Jacobi
has become almost synonymous with Greek and Roman classical literature ever
since his television depiction of the Roman emperor Claudius. His reading
here is marvellous, evocatively distinguishing between characters, deploying
a wide tonal and rhythmic range for different events and moods. The only
quibble is that the abridged extracts are linked with a 'connecting
narrative' by Maria Tucci, whose slack American vowels sit most
uncomfortably with the crisp, clear authority of Jacobi. The largest market
for audio books is the US, and Tucci's superfluous presence can only be seen
as Penguin genuflecting towards that audience.
Claire Bloom reads Madame Bovary (Pounds 7.99, abridged, three hours),
another well-matched voice and subject, with Bloom's voice extending across
the full spread of Flaubert's shades of irony and cynicism. On the other
hand Richard E. Grant, who reads Dracula (Pounds 7.99, abridged, 3 hours),
cannot make up his mind whether the count should be rendered as a menacing
Transylvanian or a lisping Japanese sounding rather like Riuchi Sakamoto,
known for his central role in the movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence.
But Penguin's version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (Pounds 7.99,
three hours, unabridged), read by Gary Sinise, is superb. Sinise's gravelly,
nasally, occasionally snarling reading is a model of what can be achieved on
an audio book. He has a perfect grasp of the slightest change of pace in the
text; he can credibly and instantly switch character and alter his voice to
give what is almost a dramatic performance rather than a monologue.
Penguin's presence in the market is going to seriously dent the prospects of
some competitors. The Complete Listener, which specialises in unabridged
classics, has just brought out The Vicar of Wakefield (Pounds 18.00, five
hours, seven cassettes) but it sounds as though it was recorded in someone's
garden shed. It is going to be impossible to get away with that kind of poor
sound quality if Penguin and the other major publishers really push hard.
For besides superb recording quality, Penguin also has a very neat but quite
simple marketing idea; telephone sales. Each cassette contains a central
London number which can be called to order other tapes; that facility is
bound to be popular with the house-bound.
But other publishers are going to give Penguin a good fight. Cover To Cover
has just brought out a handsomely boxed set of Thomas Hardy's The
Woodlanders (Pounds 29.99, 10 cassettes, unabridged, 15 hours 25 minutes),
beautifully read by John Rowe. Others in the same series are Jane Austen's
Emma (read by Prunella Scales) and Northanger Abbey (read by Anna Massey)
and Far From the Madding Crowd (read by Stephen Thorne).
Penguin has chosen to abridge most of its audio books, unlike Cover to Cover
and some other publishers. The debate about full or edited versions will no
doubt rage forever, but the example set by The Woodlanders shows how
important a full version is. Hardy's descriptive passages could so easily be
cut to save time; but just as no-one would wish to read a slashed Hardy
novel, it is difficult to see why anyone would want to listen to a heavily
condensed version.
With a reader who is up to the task, and a text that is rich in subtle
movements, abridgement is butchery, as is to some extent established by
Penguin's chopped version of Madame Bovary, where character motivation is
often rather inexplicable, due to the condensing which has been made to get
it to fit into three hours. It's also a strange translation in places; why
render 'diploma' as 'school degree' unless it is to lead supposedly ignorant
US listeners by the nose?
The same can be seen even more strikingly by comparing two competing and
newly released versions of the same novel, The Choir by Joanna Trollope. The
HarperCollins version (Pounds 7.99, two cassettes, three hours, read by
Patricia Hodge) is almost incomprehensible at times, such are the elisions
made in the pressing need to cut text to fit a preconceived length.
Moreover, Hodge's enervated reading suggests a palpable disinterest in the
text.
By comparison the Isis Audio Books unabridged version (Pounds 19.99, six
cassettes, eight hours 30 minutes) not only does an infinitely better job of
situating character and building tensions, it is also read by Carole Boyd
(Linda Snell of the BBC radio serial The Archers) with real vigour and
verve.
A 'star' reader is not always a good bet; as Listen for Pleasure's (EMI)
abridged version of the Colin Dexter Inspector Morse novel The Way Through
The Woods (Pounds 6.99, two cassettes, three hours), read by Kevin Whatley,
demonstrates. It must have seemed a clever idea. Get Whatley, who gave
excellent value as Morse's sidekick Sergeant Lewis in the TV Morse series,
to make an audio book of a Morse novel. But it completely backfires. Whatley
has no modulation of voice, no sense of rhythm, and all characters and
incidents blur into one stream of porridge. Tring Audio Books runs into
precisely the same problems by getting George Kennedy - an excellent
Hollywood character actor - to read a butchered version of Moby Dick (Pounds
4.99, two cassettes, three hours). Kennedy cannot read to save his life;
just because he has a rich American voice does not mean he is the best
person to read a rich American novel.
The pro-abridgement camp - of which Penguin seems to be a member so far -
argues that listening to a book is not the same as reading it, so cutting is
not just legitimate but proper. A subsidiary argument is that people either
do not have or are not prepared to devote the time necessary for a complete
reading.
Neither argument holds water. Being read to is a much greater pleasure with
the full density of a good author's prose. As for considerations of time, a
good performance grips and entices; and nothing can save a bad one from
being quickly switched off.
A case in point is another Isis publication, Spike Milligan's Where Have All
The Bullets Gone? (Pounds 19.99, six hours 30 minutes), read by Spike
himself. To have cut this bravura comic performance would have been absurd;
and it is actually greater fun to have Spike deliver the text than to read
it flat on the page. The same is true with the Chivers Word For Word
unabridged version of Tom Sharpe's novel Porterhouse Blue, read by Griff
Rhys Jones (Pounds 16.99, six cassettes).
But for sparkling audio comedy the BBC, which thanks to its massive audio
output has about 50 per cent of the audio cassette market in the UK, still
leads the pack.
The BBC has just released a mini-collection called Canned Laughter,
including single cassettes of the radio comedy Radio Active - featuring a
peculiarly hirsute Angus Deayton on the cover - Knowing Me, Knowing You, and
The Nick Revell Show, all Pounds 5.99.
But who on earth will buy An Evening With Johnners (Listen for Pleasure, two
cassettes, two hours, Pounds 6.99)? Brian Johnston, cricket commentator and
after-dinner speaker, goes in for terrible puns and low jokes. A sample: 'I
once went into an Indian restaurant where they served up Boycott curry; you
still got the runs but more slowly.' Now an abridged version of that would
be a happy release.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: My hero with the pelvic thrust - Pop
Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a photograph in Picturegoer around 1956 which first caught my
attention: the sneer on the young man's face as he challenged the camera,
and then the body contorted from the waist down, with a guitar provocatively
tilting up into the imagination. I read that an Elvis Presley was causing
consternation in the US, with his pelvic thrusts. As a teenager I had found
my hero.
Then came the movies, standard boy meets girl stuff but enlivened with
ballads which seem so innocuous now, but were so full of forbidden fruit
then. 'Don't' was my favourite; then 'Teddy Bear'. I adapted them both for
the recorder, the only musical instrument known at school, and developed the
party trick of playing them through my nose, while singing.
Hearing the actual Elvis records was difficult. BBC Radio refused to
acknowledge the existence of this new phenomenon, the youth market. It still
believed that when a boy or girl left school at 15 or 16 they turned into
carbon copies of their parents in terms of dress, manners and leisure
interests. Students were different - they liked jazz.
But if the Light Programme was an Elvis Free Zone, Radio Luxembourg knew
differently. So through the crackle and the inevitable commercials for
Horace Batchelor's football pools system I got my Elvis fix. I even took my
enthusiasm to the pitch of writing a poem, 'Shake, Elvis, Shake', which is
thankfully obliterated from memory, apart from the couplet 'to reach a
fulfilment / in definitive movement'.
The love affair with Elvis did not survive the appearance of Buddy Holly,
and then the more intellectually challenging popsters, Bob Dylan and the
rest. I do not think I was ever that keen on Elvis's records after the first
year or so. It was what he stood for that changed my life. He transformed
the world as much as any person this century. From his success came the
modern music industry, fashion industry, entertainment industry; the 'me'
generation, sexual revolution, the universal wish for self-gratification.
Elvis never progressed beyond the spiritually poor, under-educated Southern
boy, just this side of white trash. But in the hands of Dylan and the
singer-songwriters that followed, the Joni Mitchells, Leonard Cohens, Paul
Simons, Jackson Brownes and hundreds more, a new art form, the art form of
the democratic age, of the youth generation, of the global market came
forth.
Much that followed, especially the crass commercialisation, and the kicking
down of all restraints, which opened the way for drugs, was awful and
dispiriting. But Elvis released the repressed energy and idealism of youth.
He marked the divide between Them and Us - Them, the old world, old values,
the snuffers out of youth. Us, the first wave of the new world, which within
a decade would completely sweep away the past. The Light Programme became
Radio One; pop pirates became commercial radio; the Beatles got their MBEs;
London Swung; the UK gave the world its voice. Presidents, Prime Ministers
and Popes got younger.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Falling in love with Mr Rochester -
Literature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I fell in love with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or rather with Mr Rochester - when I was 12. I used to talk with Mr
Rochester on the way to school. 'My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic
prayer are all nothing to you?' 'I am going, sir.' 'Withdraw then; but
remember, you leave me in anguish.' Years later, reading Muriel Spark's The
Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I discovered her adolescent character Sandy
chatting to Alan Breck, the hero of Kidnapped, and realised that generations
of bluestocking teenagers fantasise about literary heroes as others idolise
pop stars.
Jane Eyre was an overwhelming literary experience. I read it almost
non-stop, day and night, over 72 hours. It was the first classic novel that
I enjoyed and the one that suggested what literature was about. It is a
compelling story, but reading it, I suddenly saw that there is more to a
great book than a good yarn; that fine original language and the brilliant
artistic cohesion of form, words, images, create the pleasure of the text. I
re-read it obsessively, for the joy of its highly wrought language and
fevered emotional pitch. Charlotte Bronte's near Biblical cadences thrill
with romance. Jane Eyre is the perfect teenage novel.
Jane Eyre closed the door on children's books and opened up a brave new
world of Victorian fiction. Many people recall the frenzy of adolescent
reading - Graham Greene wrote of 'the missed heartbeat, the appalled glee,'
at a new discovery on the library shelf.
For me it was evoked by each Bronte novel, then by Pride and Prejudice, The
Mill on the Floss, Tess of the D'Urbervilles where romantic satisfaction was
denied - in Madam Bovary, say - I wilfully misread the book, inventing happy
endings or lovers of Rochester-like machismo and fidelity.
Indirectly, Jane Eyre sparked off many cultural pleasures. Its intense
vision was so enticing that it tempted a search for other ways of losing
oneself in an artist's imaginative world, in drama, opera. In museums, there
was the chance to seek Rochester or D'Arcy lookalikes among 19th century
portraits.
All this was a mixed blessing. While most teenagers in the 1970s were out
disco dancing, I was locked into Victorian England. It was a shock to find
that there was more to life than prim governesses, and that men were not
like Mr Rochester.
Yet I still find Jane Eyre a great love story, as consoling and satisfying
as Cinderella, the archetypal tale on which it is unconsciously based.
Cinderella talks to the wronged child in all of us, and makes us feel
special and redeemed; so does Jane Eyre.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Hooked by Holbein - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The whole trend of my education was academic, which I do not regret in the
least, but there rode with it the unquestioned assumption that its natural
end would be at the university. Art in the 1950s was at best a marginal
business, not a waste of time exactly, but most certainly a distraction were
one supposed capable of higher things. Even the history of Art was but the
stuff of those general discussion and appreciation sessions, set to broaden
and civilise the Sixth-Form mind a notch or two, but nothing more.
But I grew up in Windsor, and the Castle was always, even in term, a place
of regular resort. Out along the North Terrace, between the inevitable queue
for the Queen's Dolls' House on the one hand, and entry to the State
Apartments on the other, was no queue at all but only a sign to the Old
Master Drawings. A whispered request to the attendant and payment of the
necessary sixpence, or was it a shilling, and the cord was unhooked and I
was let through into the quiet gallery and its Claudes and Poussins, Sandbys
and Leonardos, above its Holbeins.
Those images of Sir Thomas More and his family, and the somewhat later group
centred upon the Court of Henry VIII, drawn to the life yet with an elegance
and economy that still takes the breath away across the centuries, are as
familiar to me as any. What is more to the point, they are the very first
that I ever recognised directly as true and profound works or art. I can
still see myself standing before them in the dappled sunshine that filtered
through the room that spring afternoon of nearly 40 years ago, and thinking:
well, there is more to life than the History of France under the Second
Empire, and more to Art than my Shakespeare text. There may not be better,
but there other things, other kinds, other ways.
The pick of those Royal Holbeins was shown at the Scottish National Gallery
through the summer, and comes to the National Portrait Gallery in London
early in the New Year. I shall go along again, of course, to say hello.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Captivated by the Bard and Burton -
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never mind about the hard words, I was told: there will be plenty of action,
a suicide and eight murders. I had been left in the charge of a female
cousin who had two tickets for a play which my parents told me they would
much rather go to than the comedy they had been invited to that evening.
My cousin explained anxiously that it was rather long, that it would not end
happily, but that there would be a sword-fight and a ghost. This, and the
fact that I had money to buy ice creams for both of us, induced a mood of
great solemnity.
But it did not prepare me for the magic of that cold autumn evening at the
Old Vic theatre 40 years ago. I was just 11 and the young Richard Burton was
being acclaimed as the remarkable new Hamlet. The audience was silent as
soon as he appeared, slim and powerful and in perfect black, restlessly
undermining Claudius's apologia for incest. By the time he strode forward to
the footlights, fixing his gaze on the gods for the great soliloquy, we were
all entranced.
Burton defied every one in the audience to savour every one of his words (as
he was to do much more aggressively in Look Back in Anger, and later as
Petruchio). To an 11-year old who had never before heard 'To be or not to be
. . .', his delivery said simply: 'Listen, I am going to tell you a great
mystery, in poetry.' What the words then meant, I have no idea. Looking back
through the veils of time, it seems I understood every one. But memory is
false: 'Who would fardels bear . . . the proud man's contumely . . . that
undiscovered country from whose bourn . . . Nymph, in thy orisons . . .'
Many hours with the glossary stand between me and that early innocence.
Yet it all made perfect sense, more in a way than many productions I saw
after long study of John Dover Wilson's What Happens in Hamlet and a
shelf-full of other explanatory works. This is not a trick of memory, for
although details decay a profound experience lives on.
It was an experience which not many people have these days, because, leaving
aside Burton's fiercely intelligent cadence, hardly anyone goes to Hamlet
now without first studying the text at school. So they miss the raw power
which Shakespeare exercised over the groundlings - the uneducated riff-raff
who stood in the open courtyard before the stage. They were no doubt quicker
than a 1950s 11-year old to catch the dirty puns ('Get thee to a nunnery' ie
brothel; 'Nothing . . . That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs'
etc, etc). But those groundlings must have had pretty much the same reaction
to the ghost.
Some people are a little embarrased by the ghost, but not I, ever since that
day. There was no messing about then with interpretations, allegories,
anachronisms or (as I once saw) a ghost in a greatcoat standing on a chair.
This one was completely real and terrifying: he rose pale and massive
straight out of the front stage amid billows of green smoke and eerie music.
The apparition explained everything: Hamlet's peculiar behaviour, his
despair and his determination all mixed up in wild and witty words, which
Burton delivered with supreme authority. And then, the sword fight . . . I
must not go on . . . but it was, I believe, superbly executed. Never, since,
have I been so sorry to see Hamlet die, nor felt so strongly the grim
exaltation of an audience facing up to the triumph of evil over good.
A more profound effect, though not realised until much later, was to
understand the power of imagination over facts, people and events. Producers
who try to 'explain' Shakespeare too often forget that, despite the amazing
complexities of his verse, he told a rattling good story which even a child
can enjoy; and that children, particularly, are thrilled by sonorous
language and tales of moral dilemma.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Fonteyn as Juliet was passion itself -
Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The performance that changed my life was a Fonteyn-Nureyev Romeo and Juliet.
Later, I saw yet finer performances of this ballet, and truer accounts of
Kenneth MacMillan's choreography. This one was, in fact, full of faults; and
I knew that at the time. Fonteyn was 56, and I could tell at once that she
was nothing like Juliet's 14. At times, in the ballroom scene, one could see
the strain, even pain, that the choreography sometimes caused her. I had
seen that Romeo twice before, and I could tell that she was sometimes
dancing revised choreography. And yet, and yet . . .
Fonteyn poured so much energy into being 14, that from the first I had to
suspend disbelief. I had never seen her before, and I was used to seeing one
or other of Nureyev's usual ways of treating his partners: either like
worthy competitors, or as if they were lucky to share the stage with him
(most other dancers). With Fonteyn, however, he showed nothing but a sense
of privilege. Humility in Nureyev] It was extraordinary.
One of the moments when they changed the choreography occurred when, during
the balcony scene, he kissed the hem of her dress. In MacMillan's
choreography, this is just a marvellous fleeting moment, snatched while
Juliet is rushing radiantly across the stage. Nureyev and Fonteyn, however,
played it for all it was worth; and I recall it now in such detail that it
is as if they played it in slow motion.
He knelt, took the hem of her dress as if it were the Holy Grail, and kissed
it like a supplicant. And she stood there, looking down at him in wonder, as
if this amazing gesture had changed her life forever. She stood there in
profile to the audience; then suddenly she raised her arms and held them,
stretched up above her head, looking straight upwards into heaven, as if
proclaiming her new joy into eternity. This was marvel enough, but it was
surpassed by what followed.
Suddenly, like a wave crashing, she brought her hands down. Down with the
music; down over her face; down over her neck; down over her body; down
until her arms were stretched down to the floor. And she still stood there,
looking before her in rapture. Around Covent Garden one could hear a gasp -
the kind of gasp I have only ever heard at Fonteyn performances. It was as
if we had seen passion itself break over her in tidal force.
There were other such astounding moments in that performance, but I did not
know that night just how my life had been altered. The next day, however,
and every day for the next six weeks, images of Fonteyn kept bursting in on
me: suddenly all I could see was some blinding vision of Fonteyn, Fonteyn,
Fonteyn. I have always loved the way that after images of physical movement
can come back and possess one, but never again has a performance so haunted
me. After that I had no choice. As Frederick Ashton liked to say about
seeing Anna Pavlova, 'She injected me with her poison; and there was an end
of me.'

My baptism in ballet had the effect, as Frederick Ashton said about his
first view of Anna Pavlova, of 'injecting the poison into my veins'. I was a
young schoolboy; it was 1943; we lived in Surrey and I had nagged my
parents, for reasons I now forget, to take me to the ballet.
Tickets were booked for a matinee by the Anglo-Polish Ballet. On the morning
of the performance I rose, feverish with excitement. Rather too feverish, as
it turned out, since I had a tendency to keel over and was lightly covered
with blisters. Chickenpox, of course. Adieu ballet.
Persistent, I nagged again, and was rewarded with a matinee in London to see
the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Bliss was there. How blue the lighting for the
second act of Swan Lake, and how beautiful Fonteyn. How fascinating the
designs in Comus, with the blaze of Helpmann's temperament commanding the
rout.
And then, how people laughed (at the ballet]]) at Helpmann in Facade. He
wore a natty pin-striped suit, red lined, was wildly be-ringed and even more
wildly funny in the Noche Espanol (a number alas now dropped from the
ballet). And Fonteyn, in a red sack dress, was turned upside-down without
losing her sweetly uncomprehending smile.
I was hooked. I didn't care that there was a notice in the programme telling
us where the nearest air-raid shelter was, and that in the event of a raid
we could (but, inferentially, shouldn't) leave the theatre - though please
do not disturb the rest of the audience. No-one ever did leave, and there
was no suggestion that the dancers would rush for cover. They stayed. We
stayed.
Thereafter my pocket-money could pay for a rail ticket to London on Saturday
afternoons, a glass of milk and a bun for lunch, and a seat in the pit for
matinees at the New and Prince's Theatres. In a world not without its
tensions even for a schoolboy, ballet - and the zest of the then Sadler's
Wells troupe - was an abiding joy. The red and gold disease, the mania - it
was in the Russian Imperial Theatres that the word 'balletomane' was coined
 -took hold.
I started to learn not only about dancing but about painting - the company
was in its golden age of stage decoration, with design by Edward Burra,
Oliver Messel, Leslie Hurry as the norm - and to enjoy unfamiliar music.
Constant Lambert, as musical director, regularly included orchestral
entr'actes in the programmes: even now I cannot hear 'La Calinda' from
Delius' Koanga or Lambert's Aubade heroique without being taken back to
war-time London.
Osbert Sitwell once declared that he was educated in the holidays from Eton.
The best part of my schooling was owed to those early matinees.

ONE MILLION MERCENARIES: SWISS SOLDIERS IN THE ARMIES OF THE WORLD by John
McCormack Leo Cooper Pounds 18.50, 224 pages
Despite its somewhat fatuous title - the actual number of Swiss who served
in foreign armies cannot be so easily calculated - this is an excellent and
absorbing study, albeit a brief one. Every precaution however should be
taken to prevent any copies falling into the hands of our present cabinet.
It contains too many hints on how to profitably privatise the military.
Given that Switzerland is now synonymous with watches, fine chocolate, the
Red Cross and the Geneva Convention, it comes as a mild shock to learn just
how warlike the Swiss of yore could be. Yet warlike they were. In the
closing decades of the 15th century and opening decades of the 16th, Swiss
infantry was invincible. Not only did it secure the independence of the
original cantons, but it wrecked Charles the Bold's attempt to transform
Burgundy into a European power; and it also played a not infrequently
decisive role in the Italian Wars of Charles VIII and Francis I.
Swiss prowess was based on the pike. A hardy mountain people unused to
horses, they had somehow to cope with cavalry attacks across the Alpine
lowlands. The pike square, sometimes caricatured as a hedgehog, provided the
solution. Used defensively it could withstand the charge of any cavalry;
used offensively, it could mow down opposing infantry.
In time the development of firearms and cannon undermined the pike. But by
then the Swiss had earned themselves an unassailable reputation, and for
more than three centuries most major European armies - but especially the
French - had their Helvetian contingents. And they made good soldiers. As
John McCormack records, so long as they were paid they could be relied upon
to perform well, sometimes brilliantly, in battle.
In many major European engagements, their contribution won the day. In
short, as mercenaries, the Swiss were the exception that proved the rule.
This had largely to do with an esprit de corps that, once established,
refused to die; and with a lack of opportunity to follow the noble
profession of arms within Switzerland's own borders. But as the mercenary
tradition evolved, so did the business. An estimated 0.2 per cent of the
Swiss population were employed as mercenaries at any given time in the 17th
and 18th centuries, their repatriated earnings and pensions accounting for 6
per cent or more of the gross national product.
The mercenary companies however were literally owned by their commanders,
who hired them out according to the terms of 'Capitulations' negotiated
between the Swiss Diet and foreign states. Over the years, 'Military
Enterpriser' families gained a stranglehold over Swiss politics and the
national economy.
Where McCormack fails in his otherwise impeccable inquiry is with regard to
the latterday exploitation of capital accumulated by these Enterprisers.
Hoffman-Laroche is anecdotally cited as a beneficiary, but it would be
interesting to discover exactly how many other Swiss corporations owe their
existence to hard currencies earned the hard way. The demise of Swiss
mercenary forces coincided with the growth of nationally conscripted armies,
following the French Revolution.
The interesting question, however, is whether the Swiss regiments would have
petered out in any case. The evidence McCormack assembles strongly suggests
that during the course of the 18th century the double burden of military
leadership and business management was too much for the captains. As profit
margins diminished, so they had to make savings where they could. Pay,
provisions, morale and discipline - in a word, effectiveness - suffered
accordingly.

SPIDER'S WEB: BUSH, SADDAM, THATCHER AND THE DECADE OF DECEIT by Alan
Friedman Faber Pounds 17.50, 455 pages
Although it is not immediately obvious, this is a book about foreign policy
at the end of the Cold War. True, Spiders's Web has nothing to do with
Russia, nothing to do with communism, and nothing to do with superpower
conflict; but it has everything to do with the persistence of a certain kind
of Cold War decision-making, and a certain set of Cold War assumptions, into
the present era.
The story told by Alan Friedman is the now familiar tale of massive,
high-tech, covert British and American arms sales to Iraq in the years
leading up to the Gulf War. The arms sales began in the early 1980s, when
Iraq was at war with Iran, Ronald Reagan was president, and covert
operations were not only acceptable but fashionable in Washington. This was
an era when patriotic secret agents were still expected to lay down their
lives for the American president or Her Majesty's Government, and any
foreign policy tool was acceptable if it furthered the cause of Western
democracy. Within that context, strategic support for Iraq made sense;
America was justifiably worried about Iran's influence in the Gulf, and the
use of secret arms sales to check Iran was neither better nor worse than the
use of secret arms sales to support UNITA in Angola, the contras in
Nicaragua, or any one of a dozen other causes of various degrees of merit
around the world.
Friedman believes that the policy was more dangerous than this, but that is
because he is able to see the arms sales in the light of the Gulf War,
because he knows how hard the American government had tried to hide the
truth about them since the Gulf War, and because he knows how carelessly
those pursuing the arms sales in the Bush administration ultimately became.
Relying on a select and highly secretive group of advisors, shockingly
ignorant of technical details President Bush, James Baker, his Secretary of
State, and several British government officials pursued the policy of
support for Iraq, including what amounted to support for the Iraqi nuclear
weapons programme, far longer than normal security considerations would seem
to dictate.
But why did they do it? partly out of a wholly legitimate desire for
influence in the Gulf; and partly out of a desire to increase trading
contacts between America and Iraq, and to thereby 'embrace Saddam in a
cocoon of moderation'; British and Italian officials who became involved did
so out of a desire to help their national arms industries. In Friedman's
account, it also sounds almost as if President Bush pursued the arming of
Iraq out of sheer arrogance, love of conspiracy, and a desire to play
important, secret games in the manner of his predecessors.
On the ground, the 'foot soldiers' had more mixed motives, and they are
wonderfully sketched. There is Fred Habosh, the washing machine salesman who
got hooked on arms sales and received a gold watch with a portrait of Saddam
Hussein in exchange; Frank Machon, the British security service's very own
lorry driver; Christopher Drogoul, who arranged loans for the Iraqis via the
Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and wound up in prison for
his efforts on behalf of American policy; and of course the men from Matrix
Churchill, who appear in this book as a small part of a much wider
conspiracy. Some of these agents sought to perpetuate arms sales and loans
for the sake of financial gain. Most, however, carried out their duties out
of patriotism - the sort of patriotism that had kept such people motivated
throughout the Cold War.
To Frank Machon, for example, the son of a British military intelligence
officer, the shift from driving politically dangerous cargo through Eastern
Europe to driving weapons to Iraq was confusing, providing 'none of the
clear policy markers' he was used to; nevertheless, he kept it up out of
faith in the British government's wisdom. it was only later, when that
government betrayed, threatened and harassed him that he went to the press
with a story about clandestine arms sales to Iraq. Indeed, most of the
sources for this book appear to be disgruntled former intelligence agents,
people who would have been happy to do the government's bidding and keep
silent, but who would not do so for the sake of arms sales to a Middle
Eastern dictator, or for the sake of governments which refused to stand by
them when trouble came.
This is an impeccably researched book, one which manages to tell several
interlocking stories at once. Friedman never loses the main thread of his
argument, and the expose is complete: It will be impossible, in the wake of
this book, to argue that the American and British governments did not
condone arms sales to Iraq, did not lend money to Iraq, did not create the
'Frankenstein' of Saddam Hussein whom they eventually had to destroy.
Friedman's achievement is especially remarkable given that he suffered from
some of the same sort of harassment as other bit-players in this drama. Yet
in the end, the whole episode looks not so much like a scandal, but rather
like an extremely costly and wasteful mistake. It was a policy which had a
purpose in one era but was pursued for too long into another, with the help
of arrogant officials who refused to take responsibility for their actions.
In the end, those in error preferred to deny the truth, control the damage,
and ruin the lives of those who had assisted them.

AMARYLLIS FLEMING by Fergus Fleming Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 293 pages
An affectionate family memoir. But what a family] Half-sister of Ian and
Peter Fleming, the cellist Amaryllis is the daughter of Eve (a widow who
never remarried because that would have meant losing a considerable amount
of money) by Augustus John. The child was born in 1925 and Eve passed her
off as an 'adopted' daughter, while the position of Augustus John - the
affair with Eve was not long-lived - was supposedly that of a dear old
family friend.
When, at the age of four, her mother told Amaryllis she was adopted, the
child believed the lie until she was in her early twenties. Her mother's
treatment of her tended to confirm the falsehood, for Eve was, by all
accounts, a dreadful, selfish parent. Extravagant in satisfying her own
whims, in other situations, she pinched pennies until they - and all around
her - screamed. One of Amaryllis's duties as a little girl was to take
wilted flowers, removed from the vases in Eve's grand house, and deliver
them to the deserving poor.
Both Eve and her deceased husband Val came by their eccentricity naturally.
Val's mother, the senior Mrs Fleming, was one of those rich eccentrics
considered delightful by all except their criminally underpaid and
overworked servants. Eve had at least one saving quality: she loved music
and when Amaryllis's talent was discovered, her mother encouraged her.
It is at this point that Fergus Fleming (nephew of his subject) is able to
write more interestingly. The book picks up as it describes the slow process
of becoming a serious cellist, the studies (and affair) with Pierre
Fournier, and further lessons with the dramatic Guilhermina Suggia (subject
of a great Augustus John portrait) and Pablo Casals, seen here very much in
his bedroom slippers. To the younger generations of music-lovers, Amaryllis
Fleming will be little more than a name, if that; for she made no commercial
recordings (at least none that have remained in the catalogue), and did not
have a spectacular career. She was, in her biographer's evaluation, 'a
musician's musician'. And yet, her intense life illustrates not only the
struggles of the musician's career but also the satisfactions.
Amaryllis was not just a performer: she was an explorer. Doggedly she
investigated the five-stringed cello, long obsolete, and after tireless
research and expense, managed to have one made to her exacting requirements.
Then she was finally able to play Bach's cello suites as she thought they
were meant to be played. She became passionately interested in the then
little-known baroque repertory, and she appeared chiefly as the guiding
member of the Parikian-Fleming-Roberts Trio; when its violinist Manoug
Parikian died in 1987, Amaryllis lost the will to perform. A by-pass
operation and then a stroke put paid to any idea of public appearance,
though she continued taking a few pupils.
In addition to talent, being a musician requires courage. This Amaryllis
evidently possessed to a remarkable degree. Fergus Fleming's biography makes
her life sound like a wonderful achievement; and despite a troubled heritage
and many setbacks, it also sounds like fun.

A PLAY OF PASSION: THE LIFE OF SIR WALTER RALEGH by Stephen Coote Macmillan
Pounds 17.99, 420 pages
The two facts we all know about Sir Walter Ralegh - that he laid down his
cloak so that Queen Elizabeth should not have to step in the mud and that he
introduced tobacco into England - are, as Stephen Coote's lively new
biography shows, false; or at best only partially true. The first was the
kind of thing he might have done - its theatrical panache was typical of him
 -but there is no evidence that he did. As for the second, tobacco was known
and even grown in England from the mid-16th century but by the end of it,
thanks to Ralegh starting a fashion for smoking among the smart set at
court, the whole of London was smoking. England became the biggest importer
and re-exporter of tobacco.
If Ralegh is the hero of the anti-anti-smoking lobby he is also the champion
of a number of other causes that are still alive. He was a great believer in
entrepreneurial expansion and in exploiting emerging economies in places
like South America. Ralegh nourished a lifelong dream of El Dorado, from
where he believed endless amounts of gold would accrue to his own capacious
pocket and the royal exchequer. The dream proved to be as illusory as the
later vision on the same lines of Verity Lambert and her colleagues.
Ralegh organised and participated in several explorations. His Discovery of
Guiana (what is now central Venezuela and the Orinoco basin) is one of the
key-works of Elizabethan voyage-literature. He was a pioneer of scientific
experiment surrounding himself with a group of men like the astrologer John
Dee, Richard Haklyut the younger, Thomas Harriot, Laurence Keymis. Coote
sees this remarkable set of Ralegh's friends who would meet and discuss
their findings at his London base of Durham House as being serious scholars
as well as Elizabethan adventurers.
Among his own observations Ralegh claimed actually to have seen those 'men
whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders' referred to by Othello. Indeed,
the whole of the Moor's 'story of my life' speech, with its account of
hairsbreadth escapes and exotic adventures, might have been compiled by
Ralegh from his own experience. Whether it was just such a catalogue of
wonderment, or sheer physical magnetism, that captivated Bess Throckmorton,
the Queen's 20-year-old virginal lady-in-waiting we do not know. But when
she encountered him at court where he basked in the queen's favour they fell
passionately in love and before long Bess was pregnant. They were then
secretly married. After the child was was born Bess returned to court under
her maiden name as if nothing had happened. Her deception was soon
discovered and both she and Ralegh were sent to the Tower by the irate
sovereign.
A diary shedding much light on these events kept by Bess's brother Arthur
was discovered by AL Rowse. His Ralegh and the Throckmortons (1962) remains
essential reading. But Ralegh was such a complex, fascinating figure that
there is certainly room for a fresh look at him as stimulating and
well-informed in all areas as this one. Coote shows just how much fight
there was left in him during his imprisonment; the final spell lasted 13
years well into the reign of James I.
Ralegh seems to have been reasonably comfortable in the Tower where he
continued to pursue his botanical interests. While living there he produced
his History of the of World full of subtle coded observations on Jacobean
politics and he also wrote verse. CS Lewis divided Elizabethan poetry into
Drab and Gold. Of Ralegh he wrote: 'Side by side with his Drab poetry we
find weak Gold: 'Methought I saw the grave' or 'Like truthes dreames' or
even (in 'What is our life?') a groping towards the metaphysical.'
He never abandoned his dream of real Gold - a far-away land full of gold
ingots to be gathered in and shipped home, and it was on the strength of it
that he secured his conditional release to lead a fresh expedition to
Guiana. This last voyage was the grandest folly and a disaster from the
start, undertaken after he had suffered a mild stroke while in prison. It
ended in the death of Ralegh's son Wat who accompanied him, and the loss of
many other lives. Somehow Ralegh manged to lead his depleted company home
where James, bowing to pressure from the Spanish ambassador, ordered a new
trial and Ralegh was condemned to death.
The account given here of his last hours, the power of his oratory beside
the block, is heart-rending. He kept the executioner waiting while he
addressed at some length a crowd that contained many of his peers. Coote
describes it all well but it really needs Placido Domingo with full
orchestral backing to re-create its grandeur. As one puts this engrossing
book down one one seems to hear the final chords mixing triumph with defeat.

COSMOS, CHAOS, AND THE WORLD TO COME by Norman Cohn Yale Pounds 20, 271
pages
At this time of year some of us feel the need for a wider perspective beyond
the all-invading tinsel and goodwill - for instance, something about
nativity myths and miraculous hero-births in other societies, where they are
also attended by animals and exotic princes and heavenly portents. Nothing
is more welcome than a cool draught of wise and intelligent scholarship
after so much sweet sherry. Cosmos, Chaos, and the World to Come is not
exactly about nativities, but it will do nicely.
Prof Norman Cohn is a British academic, now of ripe years, who wrote a
famous book called The Pursuit of the Millennium, which described the Middle
Ages phenomenon of a host of apocalyptic - millennial - European movements,
which believed that 'there will shortly be a marvellous consummation, when
good will be finally victorious over evil . . . the elect will thereafter
live . . . without conflict, on a transformed and purified earth'. (The
quotation comes from this new book.)
That trail-breaking volume started with the early Church and ended with the
Anabaptists: the expectation of an imminent transformation of the world gave
birth, of course, to political and secular as well as to religious
offspring.
What he now gives us is a similarly fascinating and lucidly explained
investigation asking where this extraordinary idea first came from: and so
he goes back into the mythology, as well as the history and theology and
literature, of pre-Christian societies.
Neither the Egyptians nor the Mesopotamians, for example, had any concept
that the world might be made perfect, nor had the Indo-Aryans: the common
element in their philosophies was that 'Cosmos' (ie 'order') had been
immutably established by the gods; that it was frequently threatened by
'Chaos' (ie destructive forces, enemies, evil), but in the combat between
Cosmos and Chaos a young hero - warrior, storm-god - was charged by the gods
to repulse Chaos and so win kingship. Prof Cohn guides us carefully, and
never tediously, through this particular interpretation of Ancient (in fact,
quite late) Near East mythology.
His thesis is that, in a major turning point in human consciousness, this
combat-myth was re-interpreted and transformed so as to prefigure a
prodigious final battle in which the forces of Chaos would be defeated once
and for all so that, in the later words of the Book of Revelation, there
would be 'a new heaven and a new earth'.
Cohn argues that it was Zoroastrianism that broke out of the Cosmos/Chaos
equation and turned the combat myth into an apocalyptic faith. Zoroaster,
who probably settled in eastern Iran some time between 1500 and 1200 BC, was
a priest without honour in his own country who became the first millennarian
prophet, preaching a faith that aimed 'to remove every form of disorder from
the world, wholly and for ever; to bring about a state in which Cosmos will
no longer be threatened by Chaos . . . In place of repeated but incomplete
victories we are promised a final and total one'.
The influence of Zoroastrianism on the Jewish exiles in the Babylonian
Captivity - Cohn maintains - was seminal, as was the Jews' own development
of monotheism. The very extremity of the Jews' defeat and humiliation at
that time paradoxically served to confirm their acceptance that Yahweh was
chastising his own Chosen People; the worse the disasters, the better they
could be seen as proof of Yahweh's righteous power, because he was evidently
punishing his People for not giving him their exclusive devotion (the theme
might serve for a Woody Allen film). Cohn concludes that 'the similarities
between Zoroastrianism and the notions one finds in the Jewish apocalpyses
are too remarkable to be explained by coincidence'.
There followed from this development such notions as the Resurrection,
Judgment, Damnation, the person of the Messiah, and the imminent 'coming of
the Kingdom'. The way was clear for the popular fantasies of
millennarianism, both religious and secular, which have littered the history
of the past 2,000 years and which are by no means dead today. There is still
a character in Oxford Street proclaiming that 'The End Is Nigh'.

BROTHER WOODROW: A MEMOIR OF WOODROW WILSON by Stockton Axson, edited by
Arthur S. Link Princeton University Press, 297 pages
It is hard to remember that in 1918-19 Woodrow Wilson was the toast of
Europe. Streets, boulevards and squares were renamed in his honour. Even the
defeated Germans pinned their hopes to the American president's 'Fourteen
Points'. After decades of intense and acrimonious debate, Wilson is now
mainly of interest to the academic establishment. This unique portrait of
the president, written by his brother-in-law and friend of 40 years, is of
general interest and should appeal to anyone interested in the 'human side'
of American politics.
It is a warm and affectionate yet frank and critical study of a reserved and
introverted man. This collection of descriptive, anecdotal and analytic
essays is brilliantly edited and annotated by the doyen of Woodrow Wilson
studies, Arthur Link. What makes the Axson memoir so important is not only
the sense of intimacy conveyed by one of the very few of Wilson's
contemporaries in whom this reticent man confided but the sharpness of
insight shown by the author, a life-long bachelor suffering from recurrent
bouts of depression and who lived on and off in the Wilson household.
Wilson was mentor, friend and companion to his younger brother-in-law. The
affection between them was deep and long-lasting. The highlight of the book
is the account of Wilson's presidency of Princeton University and his battle
to reform not only its curriculum and lecture system but the special
position of the socially devisive Princeton 'dining clubs' still in
existence today.
Axson was professor of English at Princeton during this time and his essay
is the best and fullest record we have of this key moment in Wilson's
pre-political life. In the ensuing campus battle, Wilson showed many of
those same traits that made him one of the great American presidents but led
to his ultimate defeat over the League of Nations, for which he had
sacrificed so much.
A natural leader, highly intelligent and administratively gifted, Wilson was
also dogmatic, stubborn and inflexible. At the height of the Princeton
conflict, passionately engaged in the pursuit of his educational goals, the
university president rejected any possibility of compromise and turned his
back on colleagues who opposed him. Wilson proved insufficiently politic to
complete his reform programme, too unwilling to take advice and too aloof
from his colleagues to outplay his conservative opposition.
As Axson describes his own and others' efforts to moderate Wilson's
unyielding approach, one has a foretaste of what happened in Washington in
1919.
Wilson has been a favourite subject for the psycho-biographers. Axson's
study of the president's father and his picture of Wilson's familial life is
as, if not more, perceptive than the best of these accounts. Axson's shrewd
character studies of Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan and other
contemporary politicians, his evocation of key political events, many of
which he witnessed, and the rich collection of personal and political
stories, comical as well as serious, convey a sense of immediacy no
historian can match. The fond but sharp assessment of Wilson's personality
in a final chapter is a beautiful piece of writing that seems to catch the
essence of a strangely elusive man.
There are few personal memoirs of Wilson; this is an exceptionally rich one.
To have such a valuable addition to the vast corpus of Wilsoniana, presented
in such a handsome and well-illustrated volume, is double bonus for the
reader.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Gardening: Essence of Austin and the English rose -
Gardening Books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gertrude Stein, ever the philosopher, rammed her message home. A rose, she
wrote in 1913, 'is a rose is a rose is a rose'. You can hardly fail to see
her point, but I cannot help feeling she was not a gardener.
For gardeners there have always been roses and roses.
For some, for example, the essence of a rose is the long pointed bud, the
often startling colours and the up-right habit of the Hybrid Tea. For others
this is near anathema. They will accept, maybe, the luxuriance of a
floribunda but really think a rose is nothing if it did not begin life as a
Gallica, Damask or Moss, or perhaps a Bourbon, China or Musk.
In the long, fashion-based debate about roses - fed for at least 200 years
by the dedicated work of rose growers and breeders - David Austin must have
an honoured place. For a full 40 years Austin has sought to achieve a new
class of rose. Now a sumptuous new book, David Austin's English Roses
(Conran Octopus, Pounds 18.99, 160 pages) - together with the evidence in
his own nursery and in increasing numbers of gardens across the land - show
that he is well on the way.
True, as he is careful to acknowledge, his roses are not yet accepted by the
World Federation of Rose Societies as a new class. But, he clearly hopes, so
distinct is the English Rose from its predecessors or progenitors, that it
will merit this distinction.
The essence of Austin's English Rose is that it combines the beautiful form,
gentle colours and rich scent of the old roses of the 18th and 19th
centuries with the repeat-flowering, vigour and disease-resistant qualities
of the modern hybrid teas and floribundas.
Put like that it sounds as though it was simple to produce these new roses.
But, in one of his most fascinating chapters (strangely relegated to the
book's end) Austin tells how 'in a typical year we cross-fertilise 30,000
roses to produce approximately 50,000 seedlings'. These are progressively
reduced and selected and probably cross-bred again until, at the end of
about eight years 'we hope to have five or six good roses that will form new
varieties for commercial introduction'.
One of these varieties, 'of a warm pink colouring and strong and upright
growth,' was introduced in 1988 and called Financial Times Centenary, to
mark that event. Austin does not reveal its precise parentage, but his book
includes a splendidly detailed and illustrated catalogue of about 60
varieties ranging from the apricot pink Ambridge Rose to the 'Gallica-like'
crimson rose William Shakespeare and the 'almost indestructible' Wife of
Bath.
There is much else besides in Austin's delectable work, from a history of
the rose to tips on pruning, to make it a must.
A good compliment to Austin's book is Gardening With Old Roses. Written by
New Zealand authors Alan Sinclair and Rosemary Thodey, it is published in
the UK by Cassell (Pounds 16.99, 185 pages). While the historical,
descriptive and 'rose care' sections are adequate, the chapters on the use
of roses, companion planting and so forth are especially good, as are the
photographs.
I found another Cassells publication, The Complete Book of Roses by John
Mattock and others (Pounds 20, 208 pages), less satisfactory. However, it
does cover hybrid tea and other modern roses; it is more comprehensive than
the New Zealand book (although less well-illustrated), and it has a good
chapter on rose breeding. My next two books, if not quite in the same league
as Austin, describe a type of gardening which relies heavily on the rose
breeder's craft. Create a Cottage Garden - Recipes for Borders, Beds and
Containers (Michael Joseph, Pounds 17.99, 189 pages) employs a contrived
format. Its author, Kathleen Brown, devises 'recipes' for planting schemes -
for example, The Scented Tunnel or the May Queen Arbour or a Cheerful Shady
Porch and then gives a list of 'ingredients' followed by descriptions and
instructions under headings such as site, scale, plan (for planting), method
and after-care. But if the drawings (no photographs) are rather twee, there
are plenty of roses and many ideas especially useful for beginner gardeners.
Wendy Lauderdale's Garden at Ashtree Cottage, by contrast, has photographs
(by Andrew Lawson) almost as luscious as those of Clay Perry for David
Austin. Lauderdale's tale (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, Pounds 14.99, 128
pages) is of a National Trust-owned cottage to which she moved in the early
1980s when both house and garden seemed 'folorn, neglected and unloved'.
What I liked especially are the photographs taken at precise points in the
garden at different seasons. I know I am not the only amateur gardener to
find it hard to visualise in spring what one's planting scheme will look
like in full summer or autumn - let alone in winter.
Which leads me to declare an interest. In 10 years of having my own garden,
I have come to believe increasingly that if a garden looks good in the
winter, making it look good for the rest of the year is a relatively easy
task. And making a garden look good in winter cheers you up, for it takes
you through not just the gloomiest, coldest months of December, January and
often February but the fag end of autumn and the grey days of early spring
as well.
Yet where are the books on winter gardening? With the noble exception of
Rosemary Verey's excellent The Garden in Winter (published in 1988 by
Frances Lincoln) they are very hard to find. I can claim no credit (for I
have long taken issue with him on his early addiction to conifers) that my
brother, Adrian Bloom, has produced a volume to help fill the gap. Winter
Garden Glory (Harper Collins, Pounds 14.99, 144 pages) is subtitled 'How to
get the best from your garden from Autumn through to Spring', and while it
does make considerable use of various conifer species to increase winter
interest, it covers much else.
Evergreens, grasses, winter flowering or berrying or bright-stemmed plants
and trees and early and late bulbs can all enhance the garden in winter and
lift the spirit, whether they be in grand or structured planting schemes or
in containers in the backyard.
There are lots of good photos, detailed planting plans and a plant directory
in Winter Gardening Glory too. How could I not commend it?

FT  24 DEC 93 / Property: Is there a Dingley Dell left in England? - Gerald
Cadogan, in search of an old-fashioned Christmas, has been turning to
Pickwick Papers for home-buying inspiration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where do our back-to-basics political leaders find guidance for an
old-fashioned Christmas? Not from a Church abandoning its time-hallowed
prayer book. Nor from the monarchy, where family values are clouded. But
they could turn to Charles Dickens' account of Christmas at Dingley Dell, in
Pickwick Papers, the icon of Victorian Christmas.
Not that Pickwick is Victorian at all. The first monthly part came out in
April 1836, when William IV was king and Dickens only 24, and the last in
November 1837 when the 19-year-old Victoria had been queen for just a few
months.
Nevertheless, Dingley Dell is enshrined as the ideal mid- 19th century
Christmas, linked in our imaginations with trees, cards, crackers and
presents, which are all post-Pickwick.
The Christmas tree reached Britain only when Prince Albert, of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, brought the idea from Germany. Dickens called it 'that
pretty German toy' and liked 'its multitude of little tapers'. But a
Pickwickian Christmas has to be icy.
When Dickens was a boy, the Thames froze and there were frost fairs, and
sliding and skating as at Dingley Dell, where Pickwick fell through the ice.
At an old-fashioned Christmas there must be hot wassail to drink; games,
singing and dancing; mistletoe to kiss under, and a large fire. The
highlight of the Christmas Eve party at Dingley Dell is the ghost story of
the sexton Gabriel Grub and the goblins. Christmas Day starts with oysters.
Church receives a single sentence. 'Mr Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep:
while Mr Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from wordly matters by the
ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew.' Then a
'substantial lunch' with 'strong beer and cherry brandy' leads to an hour on
the ice.
Is there a wintry paradise now around which the snow wraps a cocoon of
good-heartedness? If it has turned cold, Fryers House in Braughing Friars in
Hertfordshire, a traditional, timber-framed house on offer from Mullucks
Wells for Pounds 315,000, has a large natural pond that is ideal for skating
and is close to the house if anyone should fall in.
For tobogganing, try the South Downs in Sussex, if you do not find them too
steep. (As a boy, I broke my arm on a sledge in Sussex.) In the middle of
the downs at East Dean near Chichester and Midhurst is The Thatched House of
brick and knapped flint, which Jackson-Stops is selling for Pounds 265,000.
It also has a ghost, who knocks on the front door in the early morning. A
hundred years ago two flint knappers lived in the house and took turns to
wake each other up at 5am. The ghost has even appeared at the door as a tall
man in black cloak and wide hat.
In East Sussex Old Rectory Cottage is at the foot of the downs, in
Folkington near Eastbourne (Strutt &amp; Parker, Pounds 275,000). And mid-county
at Fulking, also by the downs, Nettledown Cottage is the place for a
get-away-from-it-all Christmas. Stock up with food and drink, as it is at
the end of a long Wenceslas-taxing farm road. Joint agents are Humberts and
Fox &amp; Sons, and the price is Pounds 395,000.
The Christmas fire at Dingley Dell would fit into the 12ft wide fireplace
and bread oven of Abbotsford, 17th century, thatched and full of beams, near
Thorverton in the valley of the river Exe north of Exeter. Stags offers it
for Pounds 125,000. More expensive is the Northmoor estate in the valley of
the river Barle on Exmoor, where large herds of wild red deer suggest
Christmas. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Exeter, is selling it in lots for
around Pounds 640,000 in all.
A Dickensian-sounding name is one of the attractions of Bleke House, a
Regency property on the edge of Shaftesbury in Dorset, with views over
Blackmore Vale (Savills, Pounds 245,000).
Restoration House near the cathedral in Rochester has real associations with
Dickens. It is a large 16th-17th century house with carved ceilings and
grand fireplaces, and is listed Grade I. Here Charles II spent his first
night in England on returning to take the throne in 1660. Its name became
Restoration House.
Dickens used it as Satis House in Great Expectations where Miss Havisham
lives frozen in time, the cake for her never-to-be wedding overhung with
cobwebs and sitting on a yellowed tablecloth.
Great Expectations begins at Christmas time, without the cheer of Dickens'
earlier Christmasses. The escaped convict, a 'fearful man, all in coarse
grey, with a great iron on his leg', catches young Pip among the graves at
the side of the church porch and frightens him into stealing not only a file
from his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, but brandy, mincemeat
and a pork pie from Mrs Joe.
At the end of the book Satis House is for sale in lots. The house was to be
sold, gutted for building materials, and pulled down. Luckily that has not
happened. But it needs a lot of money for restoration, 'far more than the
usual Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000', says Robin Tillett, of Knight Frank
&amp; Rutley, in Tunbridge Wells. The asking price is Pounds 250,000. It has a
good-sized garden. Inside it does not look changed from how it appears in
Country Life photographs in 1924. Further information: Fox &amp; Son, Haywards

FT  24 DEC 93 / Travel: A safe, content Club Med virgin - Michael
Thompson-Noel in a village of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I wouldn't be surprised if some time next century millions of people lived
in villages modelled on the Club Med principle. Bright, shiny living space
surrounded by exotic greenery. Excellent food. Non-stop sport, for the
sportingly inclined - although none of it compulsory. Young and personable
minders. Night-life every night. And the happiness and sense of safety that
come from being cocooned in an environment from which the realities of the
outside world are strenuously excluded.
Until last September, I was a Club Med virgin. I had not visited a single
Club Med village, though there are enough of them about, from Morocco to
Malaysia, Mexico to Mauritius. If you had stopped me in the street and asked
me what I thought Club Med signified, I would have said that I imagined it
attracted the bronzed and the beautiful: swingers in their 20s wearing
spangled g-strings with nothing on their minds but water-sports and sex.
I would have added that I thought that most Club Med villages comprised
palm-thatched huts set by a lagoon and that a Club-Med holiday was a
relatively expensive one.
I would have been almost entirely wrong.
For a start, the average age of Club Med guests (says Club Med) is 38. Some
Club Med villages attract a younger clientele than others. But the three I
visited last September - all in Morocco: Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Agadir -
were not in this category. The average age of those present was almost
certainly over 40.
Swingers in spangled g-strings? Well, perhaps one or two. Most people seemed
quite normal. The clientele was predominantly French - one Frenchwoman with
whom I played tennis in Marrakech was on her 22nd Club Med holiday - but
there were also plenty of Italians, Germans, Scandinavians and other
Europeans, plus a sprinkling of British - even a few Americans. Perhaps the
British worry that the Club Med atmosphere will prove oppresively Gallic.
But it doesn't; so they shouldn't.
Palm-thatched huts? Some Club Med villages are built next to lagoons. But
this palm-thatched business is a figment of my imagination. What impressed
me most about my visit to the Club Med establishments in Marrakech,
Ouarzazate and Agadir is that Club Med is, above all else, a hotel operator
of the utmost professionalism.
There is nothing formulaic about Club Med properties, which offer marked
differences in style and atmosphere. In Marrakech, the Club Med property is
very much an enclave, sheltered by high walls, close to the old city. In
Ouarzazate the Club Med property is not an enclave at all but a small and
modern-looking hotel built on a bluff with spectacular views across the
valley of the Oued River. In Agadir, the Club Med 'village' is a large
resort-hotel of considerable style and comfort built parallel to the beach.
Expensive? Not at all. The key, as always, is value for money. As Club Med
itself says: 'You may think that Club Med costs more than average, but . . .
bear in mind that many all-in package holidays are seldom as all-in as they
appear and people often end up spending almost as much again on extras.
'Club Med, however, really is all-inclusive. Apart from bar drinks,
excursions and other optional extras, our prices include full board, meals
with wine, insurance, sports tuition, return flights and transfers (unless
you make your own travel arrangements), children's clubs, evening shows and
nightclubs. Your choices become a matter of inclination, not a series of
purchasing decisions.'
All perfectly true. For instance, Club Med offers excellent sporting
facilities, especially for water-sports, tennis and golf. (Green fees are an
extra). In Agadir, playing tennis at the club's immaculate sports ranch, 5km
from the village, I unluckily tore a calf muscle while playing in a
tournament.
With great stoicism, I got aboard the shuttle bus and returned to the
village where I received prompt medical attention. I was on crutches for
three days. There was no charge for this attention, and the nurse told me
that Club Med's insurance would cover things if, back at home, any mischance
stemming from the injury should happen to cramp my lifestyle.
For 1994, prices per adult per week for those travelling from Britain start
at Pounds 495 all-in (Marrakech), Pounds 605 (Ouarzazate) and Pounds 659
(Agadir). The company has a special brochure for Morocco. You can combine a
stay in Marrakech with one in Ouarzazate by travelling via Paris. And long
weekends can be booked at the Agadir and Marrakech clubs - three nights,
Thursday-Sunday - with next year's prices starting at Pounds 351 per adult
in Marrakech and Pounds 416 in Agadir.
Considering what you get, these prices are extremely competitive. Obviously,
the further afield you travel, the greater the charge, but a glance through
Club Med's 1993-94 winter sun brochure reveals plenty of attractive deals.
Examples: seven nights in the Maldives next month, Pounds 1,320 per adult;
in Guadeloupe, Pounds 1,257.
There is also a Club Med skiing programme featuring 19 hotels in France,
Switzerland, Italy, the US and Japan.
Was there a downside to my holiday in Morocco? I can recall only one. In
Ouarzazate and Agadir, swimming towels were provided free; in Marrakech,
not. At the sports ranch in Marrakech where you go to do your swimming, I
had no choice but to pay Pounds 25 for an especially unluxurious towel,
which pleased me not a lot.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Travel: The bloody path to Colombia's Lost City - Nick
Skinner ventures where even the conquistadors feared to tread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK SKINNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grave robbers who pioneered the route to Ciudad Perdida, Colombia's Lost
City, called, it the 'Green Hell.' They hated the swarms of biting flies,
venomous snakes and daily torrential downpours. Following their footsteps
through the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, it is not hard to see what they
meant.
The sierra, the highest coastal mountain range in the world, rises to a
height of nearly 19,000ft just 26 miles from the Caribbean near the port of
Santa Marta. Thick rainforest covers the wet northern slopes where the
ancient Tairona civilisation built Ciudad Perdida. Unless you can use a
helicopter, fighting your way through is the only way to see the city.
The mountains are scarred with deep valleys that make travel, even on foot,
extremely hard. When we were not scrambling up one muddy path or sliding
down the next, the incessant afternoon rains ensured we were ankle-deep in a
quagmire. The intense tropical heat and high humidity made almost every step
feel like a major achievement.
So impenetrable is the sierra that even the iron men of the Spanish conquest
scarcely ventured in, allowing life for an estimated 11,000 Kogui Indian
inhabitants to continue virtually unchanged.
The Kogui possess probably the best preserved pre-Colombian culture outside
the Amazon, and still maintain a rigid theocracy. For them the sierra is the
Heart of the World, a protective wall of jungle cutting them off from the
20th century. The fertile but inhospitable mountain fortress has allowed
them to maintain their independence while other tribes suffered centuries of
persecution at the hands of the conquistadors.
The Kogui claim to be the direct descendants of the Tairona, some of the
best goldsmiths of ancient America, who began work on the Lost City around
600AD. The city had grown to a metropolis of 2,000 people by the time it was
abandoned after the conquest, and the ruins remained hidden in thick jungle
until grave robbers arrived in 1975.
The robbers kept the find a secret until feuding led to a murder at the
site. The authorities were called in and Ciudad Perdida, the largest
archaeological find in the Americas this century, was flung violently back
on the map.
It is fitting for a country so steeped in bloody history that one of its
greatest archaeological treasures should have been unearthed amid murder and
theft. Equally fitting is that one of the two routes to the city was until
recently a drug route.
Both paths, the 80-mile round trip taken by the grave robbers and the drug
runners' 50-mile short cut, are fast becoming as much of an attraction as
the Lost City itself. We took the shorter route, which required five rather
than six days' walking.
The first night was spent at one of the impoverished peasant farms en route
and the other nights in hammocks hung from simple jungle shelters. The
hammocks were surprisingly comfortable, and we rocked to sleep to the music
of night insects as fireflies flashed in the trees.
At first light our guides woke us to a usually inedible breakfast of arepas
 -fried maize flour patties - before leading us through rainforest in which
creepers and air plants hung from giant trees while the mass of emerald
green undergrowth was broken here and there with passion fruit, banana and
coffee trees.
Battling through this botanical wonderland for seven hours a day is hard
work. But there can be few rewards more welcome than emerging from the
forest, sweating and aching, to plunge into one of the cool rivers which
cross the path.
The rivers crash down from the glacial heights of the sierra to the
Caribbean through a series of spectacular rapids and waterfalls. Strewn with
granite boulders, they could have been in Scotland were it not for the
overhanging creepers and dense vegetation.
High above in the forest canopy birds kept up a constant chorus,
tantalisingly hidden in the foliage; below, huge butterflies and deadly (but
thankfully shy) coral snakes were seen.
It was with relief that we arrived at the icy waters of the Rio Buritaca,
unscathed except for insect bites, to start the final crossing to Ciudad
Perdida. Across the swirling waist-deep water the moss-covered steps leading
to the city appeared as if from nowhere, only to disappear again up the
thickly-forested slope.
The 1,260 steps to the city are treacherous, many having been washed away by
centuries of tropical rain. The stairway was a tough final endurance test.
But just as our legs told us we could go no further, the path widened into
the broad ceremonial staircase which leads through the heart of the city.
The thatched wooden homes of the Tairona have long gone. All that remains is
the vast series of circular terraces on which they once stood. The site,
3,600ft above sea level, is criss-crossed by a network of tiny paths which
can still be followed for miles into the jungle.
On a high ridge in the centre of the city stand the majestic platforms once
used for public meetings and ceremonies; now, helicopters occasionally land
on them. Jungle presses in from all sides and still covers most of the city.
Even in those parts which have been cleared, the tallest trees remain, an
eerie reminder of the jungle's supremacy over man's work.
Archaeologists have found few clues about life in the city or why the
Tairona left. Even the city's original name is a mystery. But it is believed
to have been abandoned in the early colonial period following battles with
the Spaniards and the spread of European disease. Researchers have found
little gold, and the grave robbers who have long since sold their finds are
no longer keen to discuss them.
The only other people who may know - the Kogui - are also keeping quiet.
They are a deeply private people who just about tolerate walkers but do not
want to discuss their history. To them, archaeologists are no better than
grave robbers: both groups defile the tombs of their ancestors.
Dressed in coarse cotton smocks, they walk the paths of the sierra regarding
modern man as their younger brother, spiritually immature with little
respect for the environment or history of their mountains.
Sitting high on a ceremonial terrace watching a toucan flit from tree to
tree it is easy to see why the Kogui want to preserve their isolated world.
While biting black sand-flies left bleeding wounds and the steep jungle
paths tested our endurance, the view from Ciudad Perdida was of a pure,
natural world of bright birds and waterfalls, as fresh as the day the
Tairona left.
Nick Skinner travelled independently to Bogota from where he flew with
Avianca to Santa Marta. He found a guide through the city's tourist
information office, and bought a package that included guiding, food and
portering of everything except clothes and personal belongings. Helicopter
tours with Aviatur can be booked through travel agents or at the airport.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Motoring: Another vintage year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never mind the recession that has blighted sales of new cars in every
European country except Britain. This year's vintage crop of new models
looks like being followed by an equally bountiful one in 1994.
When the Detroit motor show opens in a fortnight, Saab will unveil
three-door, fixed-head coupe and two-door, convertible versions of its
well-received new 900 five-door. There will be a choice of three engines: a
155 horsepower 2.3i, a 175 hp V6, and a 190 hp two-litre turbo. British
sales start next spring and prices will be announced nearer the time.
Saab was astonished by the success of the present soft top, based on the old
900. Although introduced as a limited edition seven years after the original
900 was launched, it took off like a rocket and is still selling well.
A proper four-seater with a realistic boot, it has a power-operated top that
disappears completely and a glass rear window with defroster. But the new
one will be even better and promises to be a best-seller among convertibles.
The big Vauxhall Carlton (Opel Omega outside Britain) saloons and estate
cars are being replaced early in the new year. Their successors - Omegas,
whether badged as Vauxhalls or Opels - retain rear-wheel drive and will be
in British showrooms next spring.
Omegas will major on safety and security. Most will have airbags for drivers
and front passengers and remote dead-locking of the doors, plus an
immobiliser with 69 bn combinations; enough, one would think, to defeat even
the highest of high-tech thieves.
Petrol engines (all multi-valve) will be a 136 horsepower, two-litre
four-cylinder, and a pair of V6s - one a 2.5-litre producing 170 horsepower,
the other a 210 hp three-litre. The veteran General Motors 2.3-litre,
four-cylinder diesel is being replaced by a BMW-sourced 2.5-litre,
six-cylinder with turbo-charger and inter-cooler.
This engine - which is expected to be used also in a coming Range Rover
replacement - puts BMW's 3-Series and 5-Series diesels ahead of the pack at
present. In the Omega, there is a 'drive-by-wire' electronic link between
accelerator pedal and engine.
Omega diesels, meanwhile, will provide tough competition in the executive
class, especially when fitted with optional automatic transmission and
air-conditioning. BMW, initially most reluctant to sell diesels in Britain,
has been amazed to find them taking 12 per cent of sales, with eager buyers
on waiting lists. Vauxhall expects 15 per cent of Omegas sold in the UK to
be diesels.
Another important newcomer, due for launch on mainland Europe in January and
soon afterwards in Britain, is the Renault Laguna. Although this successor
to the 21 is a five-door hatchback - Renault pioneered this concept 30 years
ago with the R16 - the Laguna looks like a saloon, with a distinct family
resemblance to the larger Safrane.
Ford's Probe sports coupe, which comes to Britain in March, will be the
first American-built Ford to be sold in the UK in any volume for more than
70 years. An elegant 2+2, it began life as a Mazda and has done very well in
left-hand drive markets.
Is it a belated replacement for the Capri? Not really. That evergreen was an
inspired shuffling of Cortina components.
The Probe is far more sophisticated and pitched rather up-market of the
Capri. Front-wheel driven, it may have 2.5-litre V6 or two-litre,
four-cylinder, multi-valve engines of 163 and 115 horsepower respectively.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: Skiing every day for a year - can it be done? -
Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skiing a Himalayan glacier in the middle of the night might sound like
madness - or smack of unnecessary bravado. But it is going to be vital
during the Financial Times Round the World Expedition if we are to ski every
day and still make it from one resort to another.
Our expedition timetable is littered with logistical problems, such as how
to get from the Himalayan slopes to Tokyo via Delhi on a hot May morning so
that we can ski the next day. But once Lucy Dicker, my skiing companion, and
I decided to ski for 365 consecutive days, such difficulties became
inevitable.
Skiing every day is a tall order, but if necessary we will ski first thing
in the morning, then travel all day and all night, and again the following
day to reach our next resort. We will certainly be skiing every morning
before we leave a resort in case an accident or road blocked with snow
throws us off schedule.
We are not trying to ski every resort in the world, nor to ski in a
different resort on each day - even if we had skied every known slope in the
southern hemisphere, there would still have been a gap while we waited for
the snow cannon to start churning out the artificial variety in Colarado or
Vermont.
So we have settled for skiing every day - but not necessarily in a different
resort.
Cross-country skiing will only be permissible in an emergency; skiing on
grass will only be tackled as a last resort; if our Tahiti connection
between Santiago and Auckland fails to materialise, we might even have to
waterski.
Readers can become involved too, as we will be taking altimeters,
speedometers and mileometers to keep a record of our progress and provide
data which will form the basis of reader competitions with prizes including
magnums of rose champagne, ski holidays and ski clothing.
Some people who are aware of our skiing odyssey, which begins in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, on January 1, believe we are on a hiding to nothing. Others
are profoundly jealous as we embark on what one colleague has described as
the 'world's longest freebie'. Both may be true.
Miss Dicker prefers to think she has joined an expedition straight out of
the pages of a Boy's Own adventure book. Born in the south of France, she
has been a staunch Anglophile since she moved to Britain 21 years ago. She
has thrown caution to the wind and given up her job to share this adventure.
With her Provencal flair and efficiency, Lucy has borne the brunt of the
planning. No doubt we shall endure our normal share of problems, ailments
and disagreements: even during the planning stages, Lucy and I have made
blunders and enjoyed a few rows. One resort - Bridger Bowl in Montana - has
even been taking bets on whether Lucy and I will be speaking when we arrive
there in February.
During the next year we shall struggle breathlessly in the mighty Himalayas,
weave our way down the busy slopes of the Japan Alps, gaze in wonder at the
awesome Canadian Rockies, marvel at the remote wilderness of the Andes, hear
the squawk of Crimson Rosellas in the snow-clad eucalyptus trees of the
snowy mountains in New South Wales, and ski among the seagulls amid the
maritime peaks of the New Zealand Alps.
The idea to ski the world grew out of an article I wrote for Vogue a few
years ago when I invented a maiden aunt, Charlotte, and, with the help of an
imaginary legacy, skied the world.
Prompted by the thought of spending my forthcoming 50th birthday somewhere
exotic, we thought we might as well spend the whole year on skis.
Originally, I would have spent my milestone birthday in February in Bruce
Mound (unkindly dubbed Pimple Horn by a colleague) in a remote part of
Wisconsin. I was curious to see it because of its unusually brief vertical
drop: 200 feet from top to bottom.
But we decided that Bruce Mound might have proved to be an anticlimax:
instead we will be in Summit County, Colorado, skiing the likes of
Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin, which together
form the Ski the Summit area.
The grand finale - if we make it - will be at Jackson Hole, where the
resort's chief executive, John Resor, is preparing a welcome party at his
ranch on January 1, 1995.
The telephone number for FlexiSki, featured last week, should have read
071-352 0044.
Next Saturday: Arnie's first expedition report, plus reader competitions

FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The things they said
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I used to quite like turnips. But now my wife refuses to serve them. Graham
Taylor, former England manager.
There probably were three countries in the world who would have caused us
logistical and security problems - Iran, Iraq, and England.
Alan Rothenberg, chairman of the US World Cup organising committee counts
his blessings.
They will be remembered mostly as a dirty side. That is sad for them but
they deserve it. Some of their play has been beyond the conventions we obey
and I feel sad about the damage they have done to rugby's image. Will
Carling, England captain, on the All Blacks.
It is comic. We have millions and millions of athletes. Primo Nebiolo, head
of the IAAF, on the threat by US athletes to boycott the Stuttgart World
Championships over prize-money.
Anybody good enough to win one already has one. Michael Johnson, US
sprinter, on the IAAF's offer of a Mercedes for each winner.
Pete Sampras on why he walks around court with his head down: I'm looking
for money.
I never thought the day would come when I would be paid to wear sports gear.
Ryan Giggs on his Pounds 300,000 deal with Reebok.
I used to think the construction industry was bent but I was shocked by what
I saw in other football clubs. Football seems to be bent from top to bottom.
Luton chairman David Kohler.
As the manager of the national team you know that, apart from the
chancellor, you'll probably be the most hated person in the country. Ossie
Ardiles on why he does not want to manage England.
They've been loyal to me. When I came here they said there would be no money
and they've kept their promise. David Basset, manager of Sheffield United.
What else am I going to do, be a nuclear scientist? Mike Tyson on his plan
to resume boxing when he is released from prison.
Parachuting has become almost too safe. We are taking the fun out of the
sport. Kevin McCarthy, instructor.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The winners in the money game - In sport, many of the
1993 records were set at the bank. Peter Berlin looks at the year's big
names and numbers
</HEADLINE>

It was the year of the big pay day. It was the year Linford Christie was
paid Pounds 100,000 for a meaningless 100m race with Carl Lewis.
It was the year Lennox Lewis won the WBC world heavyweight title the smart
way, without throwing a punch and became Britain's highest-paid sportsman.
He earned Pounds 3m for beating Frank Bruno, who appears more often in panto
than in the ring, and Pounds 6m for defeating Tony Tucker, who ought to
follow Bruno's example. Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe shared Dollars
15m when they fought for the WBA and IBF titles. Lewis and Holyfield may
split a far larger purse in 1994. The winner will then try to hang on for
the biggest pay-day of all when Mike Tyson's six-year prison sentence ends.
French police found FFr250,000 buried in the garden of the mother-in-law of
Christophe Robert, a Valenciennes player. Robert said the money was a bribe
to lose to Marseilles. Marseilles became the first French club to win a
European trophy but was then thrown out of this season's Champions Cup and
Intercontinental Cup.
The New Zealand Rugby Union said it would try to provide its top players
with Pounds 30,000 a year and the Welsh Rugby Football Union and Swansea
found a job for Scott Gibbs who was talking of turning professional.
But in the year of the big cheque, the biggest earners in men's and women's
sport left the stage.
Monica Seles won Dollars 2.6m in 1992. She was on the way to passing that
total when, at a tournament in Hamburg in April, she was stabbed by Gunther
Parche, who wanted Steffi Graf restored to number one in the rankings. The
injury required one stitch but damaged the shoulder muscles of Seles'
playing arm. Parche received a two-year suspended sentence. Seles has not
played since. Rumour surrounds her: is she psychologically scarred? Is she
using the injury as an excuse to allow her battered knees to recover? Is she
secretly turning herself into a serve and volley player? Seles plans to make
her comeback in January at the Australian Open.
Michael Jordan who earned an estimated Dollars 36m this year. retired 'for
now' in October.
In June, Jordan led his 'supporting cast', the Chicago Bulls, to its third
consecutive National Basketball Association title. In August, his father,
James, was killed, apparently while being robbed. Then Jordan's gambling,
frowned upon in US sport, became the subject of investigation after a golf
partner wrote a book dedicated to the size of Jordan's bets.
For a man whose greatest quality was his willingness to take responsibility
on court when the spotlight was most intense and who is paid an estimated
Dollars 28m a year to be the public face of, among others, Nike, Gatorade
and McDonald's, life under the unrelenting scrutiny of the US media seemed
to have paled.
Even though Jordan is not playing, the Bulls are said to be paying Dollars
3.9m of his contract this season. It means that, under the complex NBA
complex rules, the Bulls would be able to play Jordan should his competitive
nature draw him out of retirement.
The biggest stocking filler of all was announced this week. In the US, Fox
Network won the television rights to the National Football Conference,the
older of the National Football Leagues' two divisions. CBS had broadcast NFC
games for 38 years, but could not match the Dollars 1.56bn (Pounds 1.06bn)
four-year bid by Fox, seen as a down-market interloper by its rivals. This
may ring a bell with UK soccer fans, but then the largest shareholder in
BSkyB is Rupert Murdoch who owns Fox. He makes an unlikely Santa Claus.

This has been an excellent year for English football. Ask any club bank
manager. The national team failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Only
one British club, Arsenal, is still in a European competition. But by any
commercial measure it has been another good year. For English football the
recession never happened.
Since the old first division split from the lower three divisions in 1992 to
form the Premier League, the Premiership clubs have exploited their
marketing opportunities with unprecedented efficiency. Meanwhile, the jilted
clubs of the Football League have more than made up for lost revenue. Even
England's elimination from the World Cup provides clubs with an opportunity;
one commercial director said he believes some of the money earmarked to
sponsor the England team in the US will be redirected to club football.
Before 1992 all four divisions were covered by a Pounds 44m four-year deal
with ITV. In 1992 the Premier League signed a five-year contract worth
Pounds 304m with BSkyB and the BBC. Meanwhile, the Football League signed
one of its own with ITV and this year its broadcasting revenue is Pounds
8.9m. The sponsors have followed. In 1992 the four divisions shared Pounds
2m from Barclays Bank. This summer the Premiership signed a Pounds 12m,
four-year deal with Bass, the brewers, and the Football League signed a
contract worth Pounds 1.5m per annum with Endsleigh Insurance, to give it
total sponsorship revenue of Pounds 2.7m a year.
The clubs have coped well with the demands of the Taylor Report on ground
safety, chiefly because they have found someone else, the Football Trust, to
foot the bill. The Football League clubs have spent Pounds 75m on ground
improvements, 75 per cent of which has been grant aided. The number of seats
in the three lower divisions rose from 293,000 in 1990 to 455,000. By next
season, when fans at Premier League and first division grounds must all be
seated, England and Wales will have the largest collection of modern stadia
seating 20,000-plus outside the US.
Clubs in the lower divisions have until 1999 to meet more lenient
conditions, but their costs are daunting - estimated at Pounds 200m by the
Football League - especially if the national lottery bites into the pools
companies' income and the Pounds 45m a year they pay to football, Pounds 37m
through the Football Trust.
More seats mean increased revenue: the cheapest seats at English grounds
cost as much as 50 per cent more than a standing ticket. The fans are paying
more and more, yet attendances climbed in every season from 1985-6 to
1992-3, from 16.5m to 20.66m, and are up by 8 per cent in the Premiership
and by 3 per cent in the Football League this season. Most clubs have also
installed executive boxes and upmarket catering facilities to increase
revenue further.
The old army of working -class fans, which would fill English football's
uncovered terraces in all weathers, has gone the way of the cloth cap. The
football fan has long since moved to Essex and only now is English football
catching up with him and his wallet. The question is whether the clubs,
having moved upmarket, dare abandon their 'pile them high, sell them cheap'
approach to fixtures, drop some of their shoddier competitions and play
fewer league games to trim their destructive fixture lists.
In part, the smaller clubs are thriving by accepting their second-class
status. Clubs wear their commercial status on their shirts. Smaller teams
are sponsored by district councils, local building societies and radio
stations. The top Premiership teams are sponsored by national beer brands or
international electronics goods companies, investing in teams with national
or international profiles. These clubs have been the biggest financial
winners.
In 1989 Liverpool were on their way to the league title, turnover was Pounds
4.77m and profits Pounds 145,000. In 1993 the club was mid-table but
turnover was Pounds 17m and profits Pounds 1.6m. Between 1990 and 1993,
Manchester United's turnover rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 25.3m.
United's aim is to match Barcelona's reported turnover of Pounds 60m.
The key is Europe. If United win the league they will gain a bye to the
divisional stage of the revamped European Cup and at least six matches
against Europe's best teams. This season ITV paid Pounds 1.3m to screen
United's four early-round matches in the European Cup. Next year ticket and
TV revenue at each home game could add up to Pounds 1m. United will use the
cash to augment a large, highly-paid squad of players - topped by the
British record signing, Roy Keane, bought for Pounds 3.75m, paid an
estimated Pounds 6,700 a week.
For the moment, the biggest clubs are being helped in this by another
growing source of revenue: individual sponsorship for their most exciting
players. This year Ryan Giggs of United signed a Pounds 300,000 contract to
wear Reebok boots. He can expect to stay with Reebok for his entire career.
Things will become interesting when the desires of his two paymasters no
longer coincide.
For now, as the club chairmen and their sponsors, accountants and bank
managers gather in the hospitality lounges of England's football grounds
over Christmas and look out on the executive boxes and luxury seats filled
with more accountants, bank managers and sponsors, the toast will be for a
New Year as prosperous as the old one.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The Chinese puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In September the sporting world orbited around Beijing. In part this was
predictable. The long campaign to host the 2000 Olympics was a battle
between the pro and anti-Beijing factions. At the vote in Monte Carlo on
September 23, Beijing lost to the white-bread candidate, Sydney, 45-43.
The explosion of records set by Chinese women runners in Beijing over the
preceding fortnight may have been calculated to win votes by confirming
China's emergence as an athletic power. Instead they brought accusations of
cheating. As Linford Christie said: 'The world of athletics has gone mad.
Everyone thinks everyone is taking drugs.'
On September 8, Wang Junxia cut 42 seconds off the women's 10,000m record.
On September 11, Qu Yunxia won the 1,500m in record time. Wang, second, also
beat the old record. On September 12, in the 3,000m heats, Zhang Linli broke
the world record, then Wang broke the new record by nearly 10 seconds. The
next day she broke that record by six more seconds.
The wins were greeted with disbelief. 'Here is a 20-year-old coming out of
the blue. It goes against everything in athletics. You train to progress and
get better. There is no progression with the Chinese. It doesn't make
sense,' said Lynn Jennings, three times the world cross country champion.
The Chinese runners are members of a team coached by Ma Junren. Ma's army
often runs a marathon a day. Ma's regime emphasises posture and diet, which
includes caterpillar fungus tonics and soft-shelled turtle blood.
Distance running has been largely free of drugs because bulk steroids hinder
sprinters. Runners need to increase their blood's ability to carry oxygen.
One way to do this is to train at altitude. Ma's athletes do a lot of this.
But many have sought other explanations. Some suggest blood doping. Blood is
drawn from the athletes and stored. Before a race the blood is re-infused,
increasing the concentration of blood and its capacity to carry oxygen.
Others worry that the Chinese are using a synthetic hormone developed for
kidney dialysis patients which stimulates the creation of red blood cells.
It may be that the Chinese have learnt from the old Eastern bloc: the art of
selecting athletes at a young age. Since China has one fifth of the world's
population such an approach would inevitably yield results. The logical
first target would be the softest set of athletics records, in the events
with the shortest history and low numbers of world class participants:
women's distance running.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: From Big Bang outwards -
Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC2 starts its usual coverage of the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures,
given this year by theoretical physicist Professor Frank Close. He starts
from the Big Bang and works outwards (2.50pm).
Then there is Richard Strauss's last opera, Capriccio, again on BBC2,
starting at 7.15pm. Kiri Te Kanawa plays the countess in a story about words
versus music in opera.
Or if you simply want to lie back and giggle weakly at the antics of silly
foreigners, there is yet another of those compilations of commercials which
have become so familiar in programmes fronted by Chris Tarrant and Clive
James. This one, called Carrott's Commercial Breakdown 3, is of course
presented by comedian Jasper Carrott.
Mainly, however, the schedules are packed with old movies: 18 of them on the
four main networks alone. Several of the American works are worth watching.
The first occurs as early as 8.55am: Bachelor Knight, known in its homeland
as The Bachelor And The Bobbysoxer, is a 1947 comedy with Myrna Loy, Cary
Grant and Shirley Temple. Another comedy, Speedy, though 20 years older and
silent, is by general consent one of the best works by Harold Lloyd (3.15pm
C4).
Born On The Fourth Of July (9.50pm BBC2) is Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning
film, based on a true story, of a young man who volunteers for Vietnam, is
wounded, paralysed, and joins the anti-war movement. In Horse Feathers, the
Marx Brothers are at Huxley College and the high point is a football game
against a rival university. One of their best (1.15am C4). Red River is a
John Wayne cowboy film all about cows; a classic western (1.35am ITV).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Fashion: Best foot (fetish) forward - Imelda Marcos had a
shoe hoard which shocked the world. But, says Brenda Polan, some women
understood why . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The young woman in the wine bar was furious. Shoes were the problem. She
had, she told her friends, searched and searched and not a shoe shop in
London had anything for sale that she wanted to buy.
They were full of platforms; hideous, ugly, clumping, frightful, unsexy,
horrid platforms. Nothing nice, she reiterated, as she gazed fondly at her
well-polished spike-heeled courts, amid mutters of passionate agreement from
the friends. One began to fantasise about a lynch mob teetering into
London's stores to demand nice shoes. Lots of them.
Shoes can arouse strong passions. When the democratic masses liberated
Imelda Marcos's formidable wardrobe in the presidential palace in Manila,
they were deeply shocked by her 3,000 pairs of shoes.
For the Filipinos, and for the world, those shoes became the symbol of greed
and excess. But, as puritans, moralists and right-thinking people exclaimed
in disgust, some remained silent. Many women could understand Imelda. After
all, some knew that their own closets were crammed with shoes. Given
Imelda's ill-gotten resources, who is to say that they too would not have
managed to accumulate a similar number? Some women have a shoe thing. It is
not really a guilty secret. It is just that talking about it tends to cause
men a disproportionate amount of distress. But among themselves certain
women are open about their shoe habits.
'I'm a shoe fetishist,' says Elaine Paige, the singer. 'I have a real fetish
for shoes,' says TV personality Gloria Hunniford defiantly. 'I have a mega
fetish about shoes,' explains Ulrika Jonsson, a television presenter. 'I'm a
shoe fanatic,' is how designer Edina Ronay puts it. 'I'm a complete
shoeaholic,' jokes actress Kate Hardie.
'I've got about 25 pairs, not counting dancing shoes,' says Darcy Bussell,
the ballerina. 'I have about 50 pairs,' says actress Tara Fitzgerald. 'About
100 pairs,' guesses Gloria Estefan, singer.
'I own about 200 pairs,' says Belinda Carlisle, also a singer, without
hesitation. 'Let's just say,' says Charlene Tilton, a former star of Dallas,
'that I understand Imelda. I have a whole wardrobe full of high-heeled
shoes.'
Greta Garbo once bought 70 pairs in the same style (but several colours).
Marlene Dietrich, who had hers made to measure by Ferragamo, reckoned that,
since a pair were worn out after two outings, a replacement had to be
ordered immediately. Why, when women can be infinitely cautious and
restrained when buying clothes, are they so inconsistent where shoes are
concerned?
There are several practical explanations. Unless a shoe is made-to-measure,
it is unlikely to fit perfectly. Those of us whose feet do not chance to
match a manufacturer's last, are engaged on an endless quest for comfort.
Given a co-operative sales assistant, a woman can try every shoe in the shop
in the time it takes to wriggle into three clothes outfits in a cramped
changing room. And she does not have to address the fact that a dress size
10 no longer appears to accommodate her hips. One's shoe size remains
reassuringly constant.
Then there is the fashion imperative. Or, as the shoe designer, Manolo
Blahnik, puts it: 'A fine shoe is an essential part of fashionable dress. It
can provide an accent to an outfit - whether witty, solemn, provocative or
simply elegant. Dress designers know that the right shoes are a crucial
ingredient to a successful look.'
And the wrong shoes can wreck an outfit. As fashion changes its proportions,
every element of dress changes. The woman in the wine bar was wearing a
tight mini skirt and a jacket with square shoulders. She had decided to pass
on long skirts and the soft, slender outline of 1993, the look which demands
clumpy shoes and looks frumpy with spike-heeled court shoes. So she was
right about her needs.
Few of us are so impervious to fashion's swings. Most of us have clambered
aboard a pair of platforms. So, to a certain extent, women's shoe hoards
represent the detritus of their journeys along fashion's meandering highway.
Not so much a problem of rampant acquisition as one of never throwing away.
And yet there is more to it than that. When pressed, some women admit to
never wearing, indeed to never having worn even once, a high proportion of
their hoard. Pressed to show and tell, these women will tenderly unwrap
delicate, pointy-heeled confections of shiny leather, softest suede, satin,
grosgrain, leopardskin print, brocade or lace, all in deeply impractical
colours and adorned with bows, buckles, sequins, gilt or embroidery.
Women can use shoes to express (and then hastily banish to the back of the
cupboard) a fantasy self. This self is simultaneously ultra feminine,
fragile, refined and a total vamp.
Not that these shoes are the stuff that true shoe fetishists' (always male
and usually masochistic) dreams are made of. They do not have to be. For
reasons that psychiatrists, psychologists and fashion historians are all
unable to fathom, the female foot and its shoe are erotically charged.
When, in the 1970s, William A. Rossi had a stab at solving the problem in
his book, The Sex Life of the Foot and Shoe, he concluded that there were
several factors at work. The intrinsic sensitivity of the feet (toe-sucking
apart, has anyone tickled yours recently?) makes them an area of sensuality.
Then there's Sigmund Freud's argument that the foot is a phallic symbol.
There is also the way high heels affect the wearer's gait and posture,
emphasising the hips and buttocks, arching the back, thrusting the bosom
forward, lengthening the leg, tightening the calf muscle and focusing
attention on the ankle.
Fragile ankles and small feet are feminine and, in terms of dress, anything
which reinforces gender differences is sexy. Unfortunately, nowadays most
women have comparatively large feet and sturdy ankles.
Perhaps the endless quest for shoes is, in fact, the endless quest for
ideally feminine feet and ankles.
But there is a new element. The female executive's 1980s 'power' uniform was
incomplete without her high, high heels.
As she strode out, hips swinging, she felt in control, autonomous, truly
powerful. There is no rule that says you cannot invest an old accessory with
new symbolism and then feel undermined when the symbol is snatched away from
you.
Significantly, when the Michael Douglas character in The War of the Roses
decided to whip his uppity wife into line, he invaded her punctiliously
ordered closet and, leering horribly, sawed the heels off all her many
shoes.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Fashion: Nights of languor, luxury and discomfort - Shops
are full of exotic nightwear. It's glamorous, but can you sleep in it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you had a good trawl through a posh nightwear department lately? If so
you may wonder what kind of lives the buyers of such garments lead. Very
different, I feel sure, from life chez moi. Sad, really, how underprivileged
it makes one feel.
Here, in their beautiful profusion, are folderols to gladden the eye of any
potentate: garments so wondrous, so exquisite, so vertiginously priced, that
it would take a potentate to pay for them. But where are the potentates in
my life? Nowhere to be seen, that's where.
Take (if you have Pounds 500 to spare) the pure silk softest rose-pink
negligee, photographed right. Delicately, palely, ravishingly seductive,
these are night-clothes waiting for Cecil B de Mille and his cameras, for
smooth-browed suitors, for intimate little suppers of champagne and caviar,
for standing about in looking lovely but they are not - perish the thought -
garments conducive to a good night's sleep.
But this does not mean they do not have a role. These are garments to keep
some dreams alive, garments for the wives men wish they had, and just
possibly for the wives they did once have, and most of us are given
something like it at one or other of the Christmasses that punctuate our
lives.
Mine, a specially winsome turquoise silk number, edged with exquisite lace,
spends most of its life beautifully folded in tissue paper in a bottom
drawer. I am never quite sure why I do not wear it more often but I suspect
it may have something to do with the fact that it cannot go near the
washing-machine and it takes a good hour and a half to iron.
Nightwear like this comes loaded with nostalgic references. It reeks of
leisured evenings, of discreet help lurking in the background, of carefree
distancing from domestic tribulations. It reminds us of those soft, sensuous
pre-Lycra days, when nightdresses were made of fabrics that draped and fell
and swished most satisfyingly.
Modern technology has produced materials that ape this kind of luxury very
effectively - even when you know that it is not really silk you can hardly
tell the difference. Not surprisingly, the place to find some of the best of
the lookalikes is our chief knicker supplier (Marks and Spencer) but even
grand emporia, such as Harrods and Harvey Nichols, offer good selections.
So beguiling is some of the nightwear that it is not surprising that the
boundaries between what was once thought suitable only for the bedroom and
what could appropriately enter the ballroom have blurred.
One of the most frequently spotted evening dresses this season has been a
floaty M &amp; S nightdress. Worn with leggings underneath (to preserve not just
modesty but give it the fashionable layered look and an air of mystery) and
some of Philippe Model's fabric shoes, it can look wonderful.
Some nightwear has got quite terrifyingly modern. Dolce e Gabbana, has
produced a whole collection that is almost entirely - I ask you - black.
Harrods, which has as comprehensive a department full of nightwear as you
could hope to see, has gone big on designers this season and says that it
has, in retail-speak, 'been walking out of the department'. This is
something of a mystery to me, for if I had been unloading the delivery van,
I would have dispatched it straight to separates (casual). There were some
sporty-looking double-trousers (the top half of the trousers stops halfway
down and longer length trousers peek out below) all in a tough sweatshirt
material. I daresay that customers are finally taking that endless perky
advice to think laterally and are wearing it down to the gym.
Some people's idea of boudoir chic revolves around the biggest most luscious
white towelling robe of all (mine did until I had a close encounter with a
health farm). Egeria, I am reliably informed, is the Rolls-Royce of white
towelling robes. Soft, thick and luscious, Fenwick of 63, New Bond Street,
London W1, says it sells masses of them all year round, even at Pounds 215 a
time.
Even more luxurious and imbued with the understated sexiness that menswear
often confers on women, is a pure soft cashmere dressing-gown. Pringle does
them in a host of colours, and though at Pounds 747.50 they are even more
expensive than the rose pink silk, they do at least keep you warm. For those
spending long weekends in draughty country houses it may well be a necessary
investment (save on BUPA and the central heating).
If those prices send you into a tailspin then a good troll through a store
such as Fenwick will produce plenty of less expensive solutions to the
search for a little night glamour. M &amp; S has done its customers proud this
winter. It offers classic pure silk cream pyjamas - very Katharine Hepburn -
at Pounds 60 a pair and a matching beautifully plain long silk wrap for
another Pounds 60.
For those who aim for a clean-scrubbed, wholesome look rather than
world-weary glamour, tartan could be the answer. It does look effortlessly
chirpy. At Harrods, the tartan nightshirt featured in its catalogue and
selling at Pounds 49 has been one of the winners of the season. M &amp; S
(again) has a big selection of checks and tartans. For a more sportif sort
of look there are red-based tartan pyjamas at Pounds 25 and a matching
dressing-gown at Pounds 35.
Of course, if all she wants is something comfortable to go to sleep in, then
it is hard to beat a capacious T-shirt. But let her buy that for herself - a
T-shirt under the tree is not, I think, conducive to a harmonious festive
celebration.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Excellent day for exercise -
Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This looks like an excellent day for some exercise, a long game of bridge, a
trip to the cinema . . . almost anything rather than watching television. If
you simply have to watch the box it may be worth switching on at 3.15 for
Movie Crazy, part of Channel 4's Harold Lloyd season. This one is a talkie,
said to be Lloyd's best, though his great films were all silent. He plays an
aspiring actor who is 'discovered' as a comedian while auditioning as a
great lover.
BBC2's opera this afternoon, The Queen Of Spades, was recorded at
Glyndebourne in July 1992, the last before the old theatre was demolished.
Set in St Petersburg at the end of the 18th century, it tells of the love of
Herman, a young officer, for Lisa, granddaughter of the old countess, once a
gambler known as the Queen Of Spades, who is supposed to know the secret of
winning at cards. It is tragic, of course (4.10pm).
Channel 4 offers a radical re-telling of the Cinderella story called Prince
Cinders. In this 30-minute animated version, the persecuted sibling is a
boy, and the bullies are his big hairy brothers. Prince Cinders is small and
scruffy and on the night of Princess Lovelypenny's birthday disco is moping
about at home with his jeans all messed up by his brothers, when a dirty
fairy falls down the chimney . . . well, you get the picture (7pm).
Having Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer present the entire evening on BBC2 in the
form of an At Home With Vic And Bob (7pm) is one certain way of ensuring
that I will not watch. Had these two latterday sub-Goon figures not been
involved I would have been tempted to watch the Dad's Army Christmas Sketch,
repeated at 7.40 for the first time since 1972; and Mike Leigh's 1976 drama
of embarrassment, Nuts In May (9.35).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Begin and end with films -
Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For me the day will begin with one old movie and end with another, both on
Channel 4. Wings (1.25pm) is a 1927 silent, famous for its aerial
photography. Richard Arlen and Charles Rogers play young men who join the US
Army Air Corps during the first world war, and there is the added attraction
of Clara Bow as an ambulance driver. This was the first winner of an Oscar
for Best Picture.
Animal Crackers, part of C4's Marx Brothers season, their second film, was
made only three years later, yet it seems to inhabit a different world. This
is the one where Groucho plays Captain Spaulding and tells Margaret Dumont
'You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, which doesn't say much for
you.' (12.45 am).
Conductor Claudio Abbado told television director Christopher Swann: 'I
would like you to make a film of my Peter And The Wolf recording using those
Spitting Image puppets.' So Swann did. Thirty puppets, many life size, were
created by Roger Law, and the voices are provided by Roy Hudd, who plays
Prokofiev, and the members of Theatre de Complicite (4.25pm BBC2).
That is followed by the new plasticene animation film The Wrong Trousers,
'starring' Wallace and Gromit, the creations of animator Nick Park (5.20pm).
That in turn is followed by Porgy And Bess (5.50pm), a three-hour recording
of Trevor Nunn's highly-praised 1986 Glyndebourne production.
The Harmfulness Of Tobacco is a dramatisation of a Chekhov short story.
Edward Fox plays a harassed husband who, while giving a boring speech,
begins to reveal his inner feelings about his home life (8.30pm C4).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A healthy backlash against vulgarity -
Philippa Davenport reports that cookbooks published in 1993 have been
leaner, fitter - and a good deal more appetising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major will be pleased to hear that, in cookbook circles at least, there
is already a return to basics. This year, I have received far fewer than
usual of those with acres of gratuitous technicolour pictures and overblown
copy. In a healthy backlash against vulgarity, things are looking leaner,
fitter and a great deal more appetising. To call this the year of in-depth
probes into single foods could sound a mite worthy, joyless and dull. In
practice, it is quite the opposite.
A Celebration of Soups, by Lindsey Bareham (Michael Joseph, Pounds 16), is
an outstanding book; I would live happily on the recipes it contains. The
Bread Book, by Linda Collister and Anthony Blake (Conran Octopus, Pounds
19.99), is splendid stuff, too. I wrote about both when they were published.
The new edition of Jane Grigson's Fish Book (Michael Joseph, Pounds 20) is
compulsive reading. She was working on it shortly before she died and it
incorporates additions and updates to nearly two-thirds of the original.
Also, you can find your way around it much more easily now that the entries
are alphabetical. Her greatest gift, perhaps, is the way she makes you feel
you are sharing an experience together.
Ices, by Caroline Liddell and Robin Weir (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 18.99),
is far-ranging and thorough. Sub-titled 'the definitive guide,' it is just
that: a magnum opus answering nearly all the questions you ever wanted to
ask about ice-cream. I say 'nearly' because nowhere does the book tell me
how to make those intriguing iced petits fours sometimes offered in
restaurants - a scoop of sorbet barely larger than a mothball, enrobed with
chocolate.
The reason, the authors say, is that these can be made successfully only
with a commercial freezer. They know the answer but there was not room to
publish it. And, anyway, after five years of research, they had enough
material to write a book three times the published length.
Another simple title, another comprehensive volume: The Rice Book, by Sri
Owen (Doubleday, Pounds 20). This is probably the most handsomely produced
cookbook of the year. Nice size, good paper, a clean typeface and layout,
plus attractive black and white drawings on the cover and inside by Soun
Vannithone.
The recipes are as sound and clear as Sri Owen's fans have come to expect.
This collection encircles the globe but - unsurprisingly, given her
background - it is the Indonesian recipes that excite the most. What really
grips me, though, is the first 100 pages tracing the history and future of
rice - its varieties, nutrition, production, and the myth and magic
surrounding the grain. Facts are presented eloquently and the layman is not
blinded by science.
We learn that in Louisiana and New South Wales, germinated seeds are sown by
low-flying aircraft straight into fields levelled by laser-controlled
scrapers. Swamp or deep-water rices thrive in flood conditions near river
mouths, able to grow 10-15 cm a day to keep pace with rising water levels.
The unfurling of the flowers, 70 or so on a single panicle, sounds magical
indeed. Rice pudding will never taste the same again.
Nigel Slater has produced another winner in Real Fast Puddings (Michael
Joseph, Pounds 9.99). I am not sweet-toothed but the morning this one
arrived, when I should have been concentrating on something else, I kept
sneaking back to it. Slater has great flair for flavour combinations and he
talks much sense. The book is snappy and fun.
Sophie Grigson, Jane's daughter, is another invigorating young writer. Eat
Your Greens (BBC Pounds 15.99) is tailor-made for those who like to centre
their meals on vegetables rather than meat or fish. Some recipes are rooted
in tradition, others are surprising, possibly appealing more to young and
adventurous palates than hidebound oldsters.
Rena Salaman's Greek Food (HarperCollins, Pounds 16.99) is gentler in tone
and slower in pace. This appeared first as a paperback original in 1983 and
has long been out of print. Now in hardback for the first time, it seems as
fresh and evocative as ever. The original and charming line drawings are
retained while the text is enlarged pleasingly, revised thoroughly and
includes extra chapters cut from the paperback.
Gift market books have grown up this year. They were always small hardbacks,
decorative and unlikely to burn a hole in your wallet. Now, some are real
cookbooks in miniature, tasty little mouthfuls with which to woo a new
audience into buying other, larger volumes of an author's work. Positively
desirable are Anna Del Conte's very pretty quartet Gli Antipasti, La Pasta,
I Risotti and I dolci (Pavilion, Pounds 5.99 each) and the Jane Grigson
collections: 50 Soups and 50 Desserts (Michael Joseph, Pounds 6.99 each).
Above all, 1993 strikes me as the year of the paperback cookbook. Seldom has
there been such a large and enticing crop of titles by top authors available
simultaneously at such affordable prices.
Particularly irresistible are Arabella Boxer's Book Of English Food (Penguin
Pounds 9.99); Entertaining All'Italiana and Secrets From An Italian Kitchen,
both by Anna Del Conte (Corgi, Pounds 8.99 each); Jane Grigson's English
Food and a compilation, The Best Of Jane Grigson (Penguin, Pounds 12.99
each); Margaret Visser's The Rituals Of Dinner (Penguin, Pounds 9.99); and
MFK Fisher's With Bold Knife &amp; Fork (Pimlico, Pounds 8). Classics all.
Young writers are well represented with A Feast Of Flavours, by Annie Bell
(Corgi, Pounds 5.99); Sophie's Table, by Sophie Grigson (Penguin, Pounds
8.99); and Real Fast Food, by Nigel Slater (Penguin, Pounds 5.99). This trio
would make a marvellous starter library for any young cook about to set up
kitchen. Shaun Hill's spirited Quick &amp; Easy Vegetable Cookery (BBC) also is
excellent.
Because good eating begins with good shopping, all cooks would do well to be
armed with Henrietta Green's Food Lover's Guide To Britain (BBC, Pounds
9.99) and Glyn Christian's New Delicatessen Food Handbook (Good Food
Retailing Publications, Pounds 9.95). But the Christian book is let down by
bad production. The pages are trimmed atrociously, print and paper are poor,
and Boyd-Harte's illustrations are ruined by crude reproduction. The text,
however, is well-researched, wide-ranging, and written neatly - often,
entertainingly.
After years of a culinary love affair with Italy, I find myself seduced once
more by Gallic charms. Marie-Pierre Moine's stylish Fast French
(Conran-Octopus, Pounds 15.99) boasts eminently cookable, eminently edible
recipes. Mireille Johnston's Cookery Course Part 2 (BBC) provides delicious
back-up for her engaging television series.
Jeanne Strang's Goose Fat &amp; Garlic (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 9.99) is relaxed and
richly inspiring. Strang has spent part of each year for the past 30 soaking
up the pleasures of south-west France. The place, the people, the food and
the way of life come warmly through every page of her vivid and affectionate
portrait.
Here is country cooking of the first order, the sort of foods I love best.
This is the home of the goose, the duck, the pig, of prunes, truffles,
mushrooms, chestnuts, walnuts and game. The more I dip into the book, the
more addictive I find it.
Finally, I rejoice in the offerings of a publisher I have not seen before:
Seriph, which has brought out Cooking With Pomiane and Cooking In Ten
Minutes (Pounds 7.99 and Pounds 5.99 respectively) both by Edouard de
Pomiane. He is an utter delight. You would have to be dull of soul not to
have your spirits and appetite lifted by him.
Pomiane can be brilliantly practical. He is deft, witty, to the point. His
lightness of touch is a salutary reminder that good food can be taken too
seriously. Cooking should be fun.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Everything you need to know about Alsace -
Although fewer wine books than usual were published this year, Edmund
Penning-Rowsell recommends several that he feels merit bookshelf space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crop of new wine books this year is smaller than usual. Perhaps this
reflects the fact that wine bookshelves are over-crowded already.
Perhaps, too, publishers have realised that even many frequent drinkers of
fine wines are less interested in exploring their background than might be
expected, even though this would add to their appreciation.
In The Wines of Alsace (Pounds 14.99, Faber), Tom Stevenson has compiled,
rather than written, an encyclopaedic tome on this leading French wine
region. Although imports to the UK have more than doubled in the past 10
years, they account for only 5 per cent of Alsace's total exports.
The book is constructed on a large scale. After the usual chapters on
terroir, grape varieties and vinification, there are descriptions of each of
the 118 wine villages, followed by detailed accounts, with maps, of the 51
grands crus. The appellation adoption that began in 1983 remains a source of
controversy.
There are substantial chapters on named sites and varying styles of wine and
the people concerned. The author discusses the wines of each grower. (He
regards Trimbach's Clos St Hune as not only the outstanding Alsace Riesling
but also one of the world's greatest white wines.) So many individual
properties in the area make more than one type of wine that the number
assessed is very large.
If the reader's thirst for information has not been slaked, there are
assessments of vintages back to the Dark Ages, charts, tables and statistics
 -such as the number in the population speaking the local patois (75 per
cent). But the visitor to one of the most attractive of France's wine
regions can select the relevant information without difficulty.
Beaujolais vies with Alsace as France's most pleasant wine region; it is
more rural and its lower mountains are more accessible. Beaujolais, by
Michael Bullet (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 24.99), is essentially a picture
book by the region's highly professional photographer, Pierre Cottin.
The author's text is supplemented by a former grower, Louis Brechard, and by
Comte Henri de Rambuteau, the owner of Chateau des Granges who died before
the book was published. It provides compelling reasons for visiting
Beaujolais and trying its early-maturing, easy-to-drink wines.
With walking holidays in France increasingly popular, it is appropriate to
associate them with wine. Nigel Buxton's Walking in Wine Country France
(Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, Pounds 20) covers the eight main wine areas, from
Alsace to the Languedoc. Full-page maps are accompanied by the relevant IGN
map numbers for the walks themselves.
Each has an introductory section, followed by the author's own experiences
on his walking tours, with a closing section on the region's wines. It is
well-produced but essentially for advance planning, as its large format and
weight would make it unsuitable for the rucksack.
Jane MacQuitty's Champagne and Sparkling Wines (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds
8.99) and Roger Voss's Port and Sherry and Other Fortified Wines (Mitchell
Beazley, Pounds 8.99) both derive from the publisher's pocket wine series
and have been expanded and updated into comprehensive, critical guides.
Indeed, their range, particularly MacQuitty's, describe world production of
wines once associated with a single area. Only a a third of her book is
about champagne, and more than 50 Italian wines are listed, while many
fortified wines are now made in the New World.
For champagne alone, Don Philpot's The Champagne Almanac (Eric Dobby
Publishing, Pounds 7.99) provides a compact alphabetical guide to every
champagne house, with statistics, its label illustrated and notes on the
varieties each markets.
Bob Thompson is a respected senior writer on US West Coast wines and his
Wine Atlas of California with Oregon and Washington (Mitchell Beazley,
Pounds 25) is a useful addition to this publisher's series of wine atlases.
In addition to 36 district maps, the history and details of grape varieties
and climatic variations are given for a series of wine-growing districts.
All the vineyards of any significance are described under the controlled
appellation, American Viticultural Area (AVA), with notes on the quality of
each.
The section on Oregon and Washington is no less detailed. Washington
produced its first wine, a Gewurtraminer, in 1967 and Oregon the first Pinot
Noir in 1972. Travel information is provided throughout and every opening
has an illustration.
Grapevine, by two well-known wine writers, Anthony Rose and Tim Atkin
(Headline, Pounds 5.99) is a compendium of more than 2,000 mostly
recommended wines in one or other of 24 supermarket and off-licence chains,
arranged alphabetically, quality marked out of 20 and with value marked by
pound signs.
The wines were tested between last May and September, so a proportion is
likely to go out of stock as 1994, which it covers, progresses. Nevertheless
the breadth of selection is impressive and the comments on each wine
succinct. But its claim to be 'the complete wine buyer's handbook' for next
year cannot entirely be maintained, as the independent private merchants'
wines are not included.
Moreover, although some Bordeaux and Burgundy wines are listed (mostly the
less expensive), it is not quite fair to write that they have 'rested on
their laurels for so long that they've forgotten what their customers want
to drink.'
In both regions, and particularly Bordeaux, very large investments and
technical advances have been made in recent years, accounting partly for
their cash-flow problems - and, after all, they produce some of the world's
finest wine.
Robert Parker needs no introduction and the third edition of his The Wine
Buyer's Guide (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 30) first published in 1989, has
now increased the number of wines assessed to more than 7,500 in a tome
weighing more than 4lb.
His notes on estates, smaller growers' wines and vintage assessments are
highly apposite but his ratings are regarded widely - at least on the
eastern side of the Atlantic - as over-precise, for the development of the
finer wines may be irregular.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: And then there were the peas . . . -
Restaurant correspondent Nicholas Lander reflects on the high and low points
of a year's eating out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER

<TEXT>
The most exasperating experience: trying to book a table at Quaglino's in
London's West End.
Having tried, and failed, many times to get through by telephone, I called
personally at Quaglino's a month before I wanted a table. I was ushered to a
woman who, having kept me waiting, eventually turned the bookings register
to the date I wanted. Even upside down, I could see there was only one
reservation for the night in question. I requested a table for 8.30pm but
they did not want to please me, the customer, but to fill the restaurant
when it was at its most quiet. She did offer me a table - but only at 6.30
or 11. I declined.
The most depressing culinary experience: lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand.
This was not, I assure you, because of the location or the service (although
the wine waiter took at least 10 minutes to find the bottle we had ordered),
but because of the peas.
This might sound petty but it is not meant to be. Simpson's is a great
British institution, a wonderful place to take overseas visitors (I know of
one French restaurateur living in London who makes a point of taking all his
French friends there). With the renaissance of British produce and cooking,
it is a potential flagship for all British restaurants.
When I sat down to lunch there late in November, I had no compunction in
ordering their daily special, steak and kidney pudding served from the
trolley. But, aside from the disappointing texture of the pudding and the
undercooked boiled potatoes, I was surprised that instead of serving an
inventive winter vegetable - parsnip chips, braised cabbage or carrot puree
 -along came peas.
Fresh peas in summer are wonderful; but in mid-November, and for this number
of customers, they can only be tinned or frozen. Consequently, they were
dreadfully bland, reminding me instantly of miserable school lunches.
Rather more significantly, they would give any overseas visitor the clear,
but false, impression that British cooking had not improved at all.
The most exhilarating gastronomic experience: Olivier Roellinger's cooking
at Cancale, Brittany, northern France.
Any weekend with a slightly sceptical wife (mine) in an unknown hotel in an
area where the rain fell consistently from Friday morning to Sunday
afternoon could end in disaster. But the view from our bedroom window across
a bay full of oyster beds to Mont St Michel was so wonderful that it was
sufficient compensation.
The bonus was Roellinger's superb handling and cooking of fish and
vegetables from local fishermen and growers, and his treatment of the
distinctive pre-sale lamb which grazes on the salt marshes.
It reinforced a growing impression that although British chefs are offering
value as good as their French counterparts in the middle of the market, the
finest French chefs (of whom there are only a handful) are still in a class
of their own at the very top of the culinary tree.
My biggest omission as a restaurant correspondent: not to have visited
enough British restaurants outside London.
This has been almost entirely because of family commitments which have kept
me in London, but it is an omission of which I am all too conscious.
It is not just because, as a Mancunian, I am aware of the perceived (and
often real) pro-London bias in the media. (Several weeks ago, when I wrote a
story on the top 30 young British chefs, we asked Christopher Chown from
Plas Bodegroes in Pwllheli, Wales for a photograph. He was amazed - only
London chefs, he felt, were featured in the national press.)
I also feel an obligation to readers outside London, and to overseas readers
who visit the UK but may not want to spend too much time in the capital.
More importantly, I believe strongly that restaurants outside London have
had three difficult years. Many have done well to survive. Those which
flourish have done so only by trimming prices and margins and, in what are
invariably small family businesses, their own pay packets.
There could be worse to come. A recent editorial in Hotel &amp; Caterer, the
restaurant industry's trade magazine, predicted a difficult 1994 as a result
of the tax changes in the November Budget. It estimated that typical
middle-income restaurant-goers would find their available spending money cut
by up to Pounds 100 a month in 1994 - and that this would have wide
repercussions for the eating-out market.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Music to suit all tastes -
Christmas Eve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Above all today there is music: for traditionalists and those who still
truly enjoy Christmas, Radio 4 provides its live relay, as ever, of The
Festival Of Nine Lessons And Carols from King's College, Cambridge on Radio
4 at 3pm. (Incidentally, for those who regularly inquire 'Why can't you buy
a radio recorder to tape programmes while you are out?' the answer is that
you can: Argos sell a good cheap version, and there are more expensive sets
elsewhere.) There is an entirely different 60-minute television programme
offering Carols From King's on BBC2 at 6pm with 13 Christmas songs and just
four readings.
For lovers of the rock/soul/Tamla sound, Channel 4 offers an hour each of
Tina Turner and Diana Ross: Tina Turner, What's Love Live (9pm) recorded in
California during her US tour this summer; and Diana Ross, The Lady Sings
recorded in a nightclub setting in New York (11.05pm). Given the way the
divas are now being marketed, it will be interesting to see how the ratings
for Turner and Ross compare with BBC2's The Sorceress, with Kiri Te Kanawa,
(9.30pm). The popular New Zealander sings seven Handel arias.
The South Bank Show offers an excessive 90 minutes on Cliff Richard, saying
that 'for the first time he has allowed a documentary crew into his life
with unlimited access' (10.20pm, ITV); and for middle-aged ravers still
proud of their virtuosity in the last dance craze that was actually taught,
C4 provides the same astonishing amount of time for Twist (7pm).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: A grand animation - Christmas
Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you like the animated animals in the electricity commercials you may want
to see A Grand Day Out (5.35pm, BBC2). This began, astonishingly, as Nick
Park's graduation film when he was a student at the National Film School in
1985. The moment his work arrived in the public domain, Park was pursued for
commercials and other work. His first film, Creature Comforts, won an Oscar.
A Grand Day Out 'stars' Wallace, the inventor, and his dog Gromit, who
appear again in Park's new work, The Wrong Trousers, which is shown
tomorrow.
That is followed by the first television screening of Christopher Gable's
new production of A Christmas Carol for the Northern Ballet Theatre. Music
is by Carl Davis, performed by the BBC Philharmonic and the Wakefield
Cathedral Boys' Choir, choreography by Massimo Morricone, designs by Les
Brotherston, and the dancers include Jeremy Kerridge, Matthew Madsen, and
Fergus Logan.
Swan Song, a 30-minute dramatisation of a Chekhov short story (C4 at 8.30pm)
was shot in two days for Pounds 12,000 by Kenneth Branagh at the Criterion
Theatre in London, it stars John Gielgud as an old actor who, after his
farewell performance, thinks back to his great Shakespearian roles.
BBC2 provides a rare television showing for Bunuel's engrossing 1967 film
Belle De Jour. Catherine Deneuve at her most beautiful plays a bored middle
class housewife who decides to occupy her daytime hours by working in a
brothel. As ever, it is hard to know where reality begins and ends. Some of
the imagery is extraordinarily erotic, though the women-and-cruelty
fantasies begin to look a bit questionable (10.55pm).

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Make it easy on yourself - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does anyone manage to avoid last minute Christmas shopping? Often, I find,
there are presents as well as foods to buy on Christmas Eve. There are
parcels to wrap, maybe cards to write, the tree to decorate, stockings to
fill, and lots of culinary preps to be done for the morrow.
It can easily become my least favourite day of the year.
If the cook is to remain sane Christmas Eve menus must be kept as easy as
possible. Yet such is the pace of activities that our need for edible fuel
is considerable.
Lunch and tea tend to be pit-stop affairs with people coming and going at
different times so self-service is probably best.
The obvious choice for lunch, and hard to beat, is lashings of good hot
soup, made at an earlier date and squirrelled away in the freezer. Good
breads and a first crack into the Christmas stilton will complete the meal
with walnuts and jugs of crisp celery, and, finally, maybe a bowl of
clementines.
By teatime various members of the family, usually scattered countrywide,
begin to gather under one roof. So tea should be a proper welcoming tea with
crumpets and drop scones and fruit breads that everyone can toast for
themselves in front of the fire.
Dinner will probably be late. The menu should signal the beginning of the
festivities. Yet it is best to avoid very luxurious foods or too much of a
blow-out. Enough of that tomorrow. Besides you may want to stay awake for
the midnight service.
A modest yet appetising menu might start with potted shrimps, be followed by
a dish of pork then one of rice, both of these last two taking their cue
from Scandinavian Christmas customs.
CHRISTMAS EVE PORK (serves 5-6)
Pork (and goose) are the meats with which Christmas is celebrated in
Scandinavia. This fragrant dish of pork is one of the easiest I know. The
raw ingredients are simply packed into a pot and slipped into the oven. No
need to preheat the oven.
In fact, if you plan to be out all day, you can set the automatic oven timer
so the meal will cook itself in your absence and your homecoming will be
greeted by a comforting whiff wafting from the kitchen. Serve the pork with
lots of mashed potatoes to soak up the flavoursome gravy, and a clean green
salad of bitter leaves on the side.
2 lb boneless belly of pork rashers; 1 dozen prunes; 1 smallish onion; 2 fat
garlic cloves; plenty of thyme, preferably fresh lemon thyme; 3-4
tablespoons each of chopped coriander and flat leaf parsley; a small corner
of chicken stock cube; 2 or 3 butter papers; 1 tablespoon tarragon or white
wine vinegar plus enough unsweetened white grape juice to make  1/2 pt
liquid in total.
Lightly butter a large shallow dish that will take the pork in a single
layer. A Le Creuset buffet casserole is ideal. Cut each rasher of pork in
half. Leave the rinds on. They will enrich the texture of the gravy
deliciously, they will be meltingly tender by the end of cooking and are
good to eat.
Lay the pork jigsaw fashion in the dish, squeezing the prunes into the gaps.
Scatter the thyme leaves and the finely chopped garlic over the meat. Season
well with salt and pepper. Add the crumbled stock cube and veil the whole
lot with the onion, sliced as paper thin as you can.
Pour on the liquids, which should come almost level with the top of the
meat. Lay the butter papers directly on top. Cover with a well fitting lid
or double thickness of tightly crimped foil.
Place the dish in a cold oven, turn it on to 300`F (150`C) gas mark 3 or
just under and cook for 3 1/2 -4 hours.
A little longer will do no harm providing the temperature is low and the
dish is well sealed. When it is ready the meat should be so tender that even
the toothless would rejoice in eating it.
CARDAMOM CREAM RICE PUDDING (serves 6)
Rice porridge and rice puddings of various sorts, some hot, some cold, are
favourites at Christmas throughout Scandinavia.
Tradition calls for a whole shelled but unblanched almond to be buried in
the pudding to bring special good luck to whoever finds it. My version is
cold and creamy and I have scented it with lemon and cardamom.
Most shop-bought fruit jellies are too sweet and too stiff for my taste.
Home-made redcurrant is what I use here. Cranberry, sour cherry, rowanberry
or spiced crab apple jelly should also be good. How much you will need
depends on the surface area of the glasses in which the pudding is served.
2 oz pudding rice; 1 pt milk; the seeds from 6-8 cardamom pods crushed to a
powder; the finely grated zest of 1 large lemon; 1 tablespoon sugar;  1/2 pt
double cream; 2-3 tablespoons extra milk or yoghurt (optional); 1 shelled
but unblanched almond; a jar of tart fruit jelly.
Scald the milk with the cardamom in a heavy based saucepan. Trickle the rice
into the milk and cook fast, stirring continuously, for 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every now and then,
until the grain is soft and swollen and has absorbed most of the milk.
Stir in the citrus zest and sugar, and stand the rice pan in a bowl of cold
water to speed cooling.
When the rice is cold, spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the surplus milk from it
onto the cream. Or if the grain has absorbed all its cooking liquor, stir a
splash of extra milk or a little yoghurt into the cream.
Whip the cream softly and fold the rice into it. Spoon the soft and creamy
amalgam into individual glasses, slipping the almond into one of them in
obeisance to Scandinavian Christmas custom.
Barely melt some jelly and spoon a little of it gently over the top of the
rice to cloak it with scarlet - or to cloak it with gold in the case of
spiced crab apple jelly. Chill until shortly before serving.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A test for ports at under Pounds 10 a bottle -
Jancis Robinson sniffs a bargain - with some help from her friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know that vintage port is a relative bargain at the moment, what with
Oddbins offering 1977s for just Pounds 22.99, but can any decent port be had
for less than Pounds 10 a bottle?
To find an answer 35 very different wines were summoned for inspection by
myself, Edmund Penning-Rowsell and Giles MacDonogh, fellow Weekend FT drinks
writers, and Richard Mayson, author of the prizewinning book Portugal's
Wines &amp; Winemakers.
Out of some consideration for our teeth and brain cells, we excluded the
most basic ports, those labelled Ruby and Tawny and selling for about Pounds
5 to Pounds 7.
The two chief styles of port represented were Late Bottled Vintage (LBV),
wines from a single year bottled at about five years old, together with the
category which has been called, with considerable hyperbole, Vintage
Character.
This term is likely to be outlawed within a few years in favour of Premium
Ruby, for these ports are not at all like Vintage port but are essentially
Ruby given a few more years' wood ageing.
There was enormous variation in quality between different shippers'
bottlings, and buyers' own labels (the latter by no means necessarily
inferior to the former).
Although the leading brand Cockburn's Special Reserve was perfectly
acceptable, if relatively expensive, some Vintage Character wines were vapid
 -not a quality normally associated with port.
Mayson suggested that a good regular Ruby such as Smith Woodhouse (Pounds
5.99 Oddbins) can offer more unadulterated fruit than these supposedly
superior versions. These ports are made typically from bought-in wines
rather than from the produce of the shippers' own vineyards.
The LBVs were in general a more satisfactory group costing perhaps only a
pound more per bottle, although very few of them bear much resemblance to
true vintage port, and too many taste like superior Ruby.
Thanks largely to a number of deals struck especially for Christmas,
however, it is possible to find genuine wood-aged Tawnies (as opposed to the
commercial blended Tawnies that are mainly young Ruby with a dash of white
port) at less than Pounds 10, although it is clearly asking too much to
expect great finesse and 10 years in cask for a tenner.
We also tasted two Crusted ports (blends of different years bottled so young
that they throw a deposit in the bottle) and even managed to find one
genuine Vintage port, a special offer bargain from Majestic.
Only the Crusted ports need decanting, although LBVs from Niepoort and
Churchill may have some sediment as they are not subjected to the same
filtration regime as other LBVs.
The most interesting port of the lot was the vintage, Offley Boa Vista 1982;
the other bargain was Sainsbury's Vintage Character; the best Vintage
Character was Churchill's; the best LBV was Graham's LBV 1986.
The wine about which we disagreed most strongly (Richard and myself in
favour, the others against) was Niepoort Senior Tawny.
Quady's Californian riposte to port (called Starboard and sold by Majestic
for Pounds 8.99) was preferred by most of us to the majority of Vintage
Character ports, although Richard Mayson found it rather too sweet.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: For Christmas, an irreverent priest - A
crumbling colonial hotel in Macau gave Kieran Cooke an unrepeatable lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The monsignor was rolling a string of spaghetti unenthusiastically onto his
fork. 'The worst part about being in Rome was the confessions. The smell of
garlic. It would knock you over. And the sins were so boring - I was
expecting far more spice. It was very disappointing. I thought the Italians
had more imagination.'
He put his head back and laughed uproariously. There is nothing more
irreverent than an irreverent priest.
We were starting Christmas dinner in the darkened dining room of the Bela
Vista hotel in Macau, that strange postage stamp of Portuguese territory
stuck on the rump of China. It was 1978.
Manuela shared our table. She was on her way to see her daughter in Tokyo.
One day, the daughter had arrived home in Rome to say that she was going to
marry Yoshi, her judo teacher.
The daughter had become a black belt but the marriage had hit the canvas.
Manuela was taking a couple of days in Macau to brace herself before coming
to grips with the judo instructor.
The monsignor once supervised marriage annulments in California. 'They're
very modern over there. They would come looking for annulments not only on
the grounds of physical non-consummation but saying the marriage was
psychologically non-consummated as well.'
Another frenzied laugh, like a happy horse rising on its hind legs.
The other diners looked on curiously. Portuguese men with blazers hung
elegantly on their shoulders endeavoured to prise open bread rolls. Jewelled
ladies hacked away at pieces of ancient mutton.
The Bela Vista is now a tasteful, if expensive, rest house. Back in the
1970s, it was a crumbling colonial pile, with Russian-style plumbing and
shocking electrics. Once, staying in one of its rooms with sinking bed and
heavy, southern European furniture, I pulled the curtain closed. It fell
down on top of me, filling my lungs with the dust of Portuguese explorers.
People visited the Bela Vista because it was different. It was famous for
its magnificent view over the Pearl River estuary - and its truly diabolical
food. The owner, a corpulent Portuguese colonial who drank vast quantities
of white port, laboured hard at serving up the inedible. The coffee was
especially famous - the best purgative in the east.
At opportune times, as in the middle of Christmas dinner, the owner would
have full-blooded arguments with his wife. At least, one assumed it was the
wife. She was never seen. We called her the V-bomber: all you heard was a
high-pitched whine and then a crash as porcelain hit the wall.
Manuela was asking the monsignor about the Pope. The monsignor had done time
at the Vatican as a papal diplomat.
'He's pleasant enough.' A priestly pause. 'But all this talking in 46
languages and running around the world kissing the tarmac - I prefer my
popes a bit more dignified. Behind high walls. Only appearing to say
something momentous occasionally.'
We tried to identify what vegetables had been served. Whatever they were,
they had met with an accident somewhere along the way.
The monsignor liked the pope's conservatism. 'If it was me - which it never
will be - I'd go back to the Latin mass. We need more incense, more candles,
more mystery.'
The dining room had plenty of mystery. The lighting was on the blink.
The waiters were a central feature of the old Bela Vista. It didn't matter
if the lights were on or off, they always bashed into the tables, upsetting
soup spoons between bowl and mouth or causing forks to become lodged in ear
lobes.
Their average age was well over 60. They were the only Chinese I have ever
heard use the word 'Chow'. They all had much-mended, starched, white
uniforms.
If you so much as paused between mouthfuls, your plate would be whisked
away. Meals were over very quickly - no bad thing considering the quality of
the cuisine.
'What's that?' asked Manuela. A waiter had, rather unsteadily, set down a
flaming dark mass in the middle of the table. 'Christmas pudding?' I
suggested. There was a pop and a tired wheeze, like the air going out of a
balloon. The pudding shrank to an eighth of its size.
'It's a miracle,' said the monsignor. We didn't touch it.
There was a miracle of sorts. Someone produced a round of rich Portuguese
cheese. The blue-blazered men, their elegant ladies and all of us dug in.
The owner, satiated after another high-spirited kitchen encounter, lit
candles and brought round the port. A very scratched fado record was
playing. Eyes were wetting.
'Do you know,' whispered Manuela, 'I once knew a young, very handsome
English seminarian in Rome. He decided to give it all up after studying for
years.'
'Sex again, I suppose?' sighed the monsignor.
'No, not that at all,' said Manuela. 'He came to my house one morning with
such a look on his face. I will always remember it. Resigned yet contented,
as if he had finally discovered the essence of something.
'He said he'd been walking through the early-morning market. He had gone
past the flower stalls and then through all the piles of fresh vegetables.
'He stopped and looked around. There and then, he decided that he could not
go on with his studies. He said the vegetables had done it.'
The monsignor roared.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A last-minute escape from the sprouts - Giles
MacDonogh is still hoping to make his escape from a traditional British
yuletide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are just a few more hours to go and I still don't know where I shall
spend Christmas. The important thing is to escape the traditional yuletide
in Britain: arid turkey surrounded by little chipolatas and gassy Brussels
sprouts; the dessicated ham; the oily smoked salmon; and that final
explosive envoi in the form of a Christmas pudding licked by blue flames of
brandy.
I called a friend in Dublin. I had had this dream about spiced beef and
Guinness. He was more than ready to help: 'Great] We'll go to somebody
else's house and drink mulled wine and then back to the family for the first
arguments. There'll be turkey and ham. I can't think for the life of me
where you got this crazy English idea about spiced beef. Then we will have
the most boring vegetables imaginable; they are as often thrown at people as
eaten, but that doesn't matter because we'll all be hammered by lunch time.
'Not much gets eaten at all.' No. On second thoughts, Dublin sounds too much
like home.
There is always Paris, but apart from the reveillon there is little really
Christmassy about December 25 in northern France. It seems to hinge more on
the season than the day. I do remember with nostalgia, however, Decembers in
the rue du Buci market in Paris: the profusion of furred and feathered game
hanging from the butchers' awnings: pheasant, partridge and duck; and the
great hairy haunches of venison and wild boar. Then round the corner in the
rue Dauphine, the long queue outside Coesnon's tiny shop, waiting to buy
foie gras terrines and little boudins blancs.
Even in France the ugly bird has made progress; replete with chestnut
stuffing it is beginning to displace the more traditional leg of lamb as the
centrepiece at the Christmas lunch. One should have thought lamb a more
pascal dish; when the meat is young and tender. What the French and Spanish
eat at Christmas is hogget: half way to mutton.
The chief advantage of the Latin Christmas, however, is that the shops stay
open for the morning and there are even restaurants doing a brisk trade. In
Paris, outside the main brasseries on the boulevards, the oystermen work
overtime to prepare baskets full of bivalves for hors d'oeuvres.
Neighbouring Belgium doesn't seem to be quite right either: a compromise
between Teutonic goose-eating and the international turkey which has come in
on the back of Nato and the EU. The meal is polished off with what a friend
calls 'a revolting buche de Noel surmounted by a little, pink Jesus looking
for all the world like the famous Manneken-Pis']
Spain is nothing special: 'We just eat a lot more of everything,' said a
Spaniard. 'More lamb and more sea bass; and lots and lots of turron.' I felt
a nasty jab in my stomach as I though of the indigestions borne of turron.
Provence has more Christmas feel to it. Fish is favoured: grey mullet with
olives, or salt cod and cauliflower; cardoons and the 13 Christmas desserts.
These include nougat, quince paste (in those cases where the quince trees
survived the 1956 frost), dried figs, dates and fougasse biscuits.
The best of Latin Christmasses are to be found in Italy. In the north there
are sweet things. Last year I received a pannetone from Gucci and was
disappointed when I opened the packet not to find a pair of brogues. But
pannetone can be a mite dry. Elsewhere, in Emilia Romagna, there is pane di
Natale: a rather flatter version of the Milanese pannetone. The meaty side
of the feast is not so special, although in Bologna they make big tortellini
from different meats and at the new year, the cotechino sausage is served
with lentils to represent the money that will come rolling in over the next
12 months.
For an individual Christmas Rome would be a good bet. Here eels are eaten
before you go on to gorge yourself on a capon. Capons cannot be produced in
Britain where draconian legislation exists to protect the cock's prowess. In
many ways this is a pity: a good capon knocks the feathers off a turkey and
it is a more traditional Christmas bird.
I once spent Christmas in Vienna. We had a huge lake trout instead of the
muddy carp on Christmas Eve, served with a thick beurre blanc. The next day,
after the Nelson Mass at the Augustinerkirche, I was given a Christmas
Bockbier by a friend from the Vienna Philharmonic. Later a big vodka-martini
was put into my hand. By the time the goose appeared I was well and truly
'hammered', to use my Irish friend's word.
You find a similar scheme of things across the Inn in Germany. In her
Berliner Kochbuch aus alten Familienrezepten, published by Weingarten, Maria
von Treskow draws a pretty picture of a traditional Berlin Christmas. The
shops filled with Pfefferkuchen from Thorn; toffeed almonds from Konigsberg;
Baumkuchen from Cottbus; or Stollen from Dresden. Pomerania used to produce
the smoked goose breasts and the shops were filled with carp. The last
Kaiser was particularly fond of carp cooked in beer after which he favoured
Christmas pudding doused in schnapps. The main feature of the Christmas
lunch was a big, white, larded goose, also from Pomerania. Those from Poland
were thought to be scrawny: the goose was stuffed with apples and sultanas
and served with red cabbage and boiled potatoes.
The sad thing is that most of these places are not what they were and, I am
told, that one is more likely to find turkey these days.
In the east the Russians tried to stamp out Christmas and replace it with a
New Year's Eve feast. In the old days Christmas Eve was a fast day, the last
day of Advent and that was why Central and Eastern Europeans were stuck with
carp. The devout Russian ate ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and clear
borscht followed by stuffed carp; on the day there was a Teutonic goose
followed by koutia: my white Russian correspondent informs me this is 'quite
revolting' - a blend of barley, honey and dried fruit.
Paradise may well be in Scandinavia. The Danish solution sounds Germanic:
goose with apples and a rice porridge which conceals an almond. Whoever
finds it has the right to a present - a pink marzipan pig - a sweetmeat
which made the fame of Lubeck and other Baltic ports, at least as far as
children were concerned.
In Sweden there was a copious Smorgasbord. A great mustard covered ham is
the centrepiece and the table should be presided over by a boar's head.
There are lots of different herrings, collared brawn, meat-balls, and
lutfisk - stockfish or ling dried, split and slaked in lime. One of the
oddest things is dopp i grytan: a big pot of ham broth into which Swedes dip
wort-flavoured bread.
Across the border in Norway there are even better things such as dried
mutton ribs cooked over birch branches served with potatoes and mushy peas.
It is washed down with aquavit and beer. The greatest incentive of all,
however, is the dark reindeer meat culled in Lapland in the north. This is
served with a game sauce flavoured with goats' cheese and crushed juniper
berries.
On balance I think Norway is the ticket.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vintage Character
Churchill's Finest Vintage Character, Pounds 9.80, Lay &amp; Wheeler of
Colchester, Windrush Wines of Cirencester, and Eaton Elliott of Alderley
Edge. Seriously concentrated wine which shows every sign of being capable of
getting even better with its deep colour and very firm structure. A cheaper,
not 'Finest' version is also in circulation.
Sainsbury's Pounds 5.95 Croft makes this bargain. Another solid wine,
simpler than Churchill's.
LBV
Tesco LBV, 1986, Pounds 6.69. A bargain in this bumptious peppery port
bottled by Smith Woodhouse, from the Symington stable also responsible for
Dow, Graham and Warre.
Graham's LBV 1986, Pounds 9.45 and up. Unanimous enthusiasm for this lively,
spicy wine; mellow but with a punch. Rather fruitier than the 1987 at the
moment.
Graham LBV 1987, Pounds 9.95 and up. Very deep colour, well balanced, lively
and ready. The 1986 is just Pounds 8.89 from Morrison's supermarkets in
northern England. The many other stockists, who are generally moving from
the 1986 to the 1987, include: Safeway; Thresher; Waitrose; Averys of
Bristol; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester; Andrew Weir of Luton and Caves de
Bacchus of Leicester.
Niepoort LBV 1987 Pounds 9.75 Bibendum, London NW1. A bottle of perfumed,
ripe black cherries which would benefit from longer in bottle.
Other Ports
Offley Boa Vista, 1982 vintage, Pounds 9.99, Majestic. From a special parcel
of fine bargain ports (including many a fine vintage port), this is a snip,
and by no means an apology for the style. Lovely perfume with chocolate and
prune flavours. Drink now, or better still, keep.
Dow's Crusted, bottled 1987, Pounds 9.95. Waitrose (Pounds 10.45 Safeway)
The next best thing to vintage. Powerful.
Sainsbury's 10-year-old Tawny, Pounds 9.95. A perfectly acceptable light,
smooth, fully mature, wood-aged port. Delicate with a slightly harsh finish.
A keen price from Quinta do Noval.
Niepoort Senior Fine Old Tawny, Pounds 9.75, Bibendum, London NW1.
Distinctive, vigorous wine. Giles found it unattractively reminiscent of
dill pickles.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Rise and shine to Fred Astaire
 -Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You will look in vain for anything of much merit in matter of dance on
television this Christmas. Amid the slough of despond of the listings, there
are a few programmes which aim for a dance audience: BBC TV has made a
recording of Northern Ballet Theatre's oh-so-winsome dramatisation of A
Christmas Carol, (BBC2, Christmas Day), and earlier in the afternoon there
is A Tribute to Rudolph Nureyev (BBC2, Christmas Day), a repeat of a
documentary, followed by a showing of Paul Czinner's film of Kenneth
MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet with Fonteyn and Nureyev.
It is a very mixed blessing: you can see the original cast of all the
supporting roles, but Czinner's cinematic style was stuffy, and Fonteyn and
Nureyev were among the worst interpreters of the lovers ever seen at Covent
Garden. (The chance to film Lynn Seymour in one of her grandest achievements
 -the role made for her - was, of course, missed.)
Apart from this miserable list - nothing. No doubts as to what the
independent stations' policy is towards elitist and snobbish old dance. BBC2
will show Holiday Inn (Christmas Eve) with Fred Astaire at 8.10am on (don't
forget to set your alarm clock - and again on Sunday for the immortal Fred
in The Barkleys of Broadway at 8.25am).
And a perfectly tiresome holiday to all those who concocted the TV
schedules.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: The war only one side wants to
win - Schedules are littered with repeats and films, comedies are stretched
to breaking point, viewers have finished their spending. And the critics
switch off for Christmas . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
Reveal that you are a television critic and the reaction, as often as not,
is: 'Oh you poor thing, you must be awfully busy during Christmas.'
Over the years you learn to nod sadly with a shrug and the hint of a
suffering smile which says, because this is what you are expected to say:
'Well yes, it's not the bed of roses it may seem, Christmas is the TV
critic's busiest season.'
In fact this is a lie.
While the general public may use television at Christmas as a way of
avoiding the need to talk to Auntie Gertie, thus pushing up the week's
per-capita viewing figure to the highest of the year (more than 33 hours in
1992) the critic heaves a sigh of relief and switches off for the duration.
What can the critic possibly write about the 17th screening of The Snowman?
The 42nd version of Nine Lessons And Carols? The 19th repeat of Genevieve?
Well all right, you may say, but it isn't all repeats and old movies - there
are only 700 films on over Christmas (most on the satellite of course: a
mere 235 turn up on the BBC, ITV and Channel 4).
What about all those 'special' programmes they make for Christmas? Most of
those are dire and not, in any case, the sort of things a serious critic
would ever want to spend time on.
Ask a comedy writer to step outside the bounds of his normal 30 minute
package and write a 90-minute Christmas special and he (and his partner, or
even she and her partner, though female comedy writers are still rare) will
go to pieces.
Can you remember a single Christmas special which did not feel desperately
stretched and which was not clearly inferior to the normal weekly episodes?
It is a truism, endlessly repeated by those in the business, that the
essentials of comedy are pace and timing.
Give the writers three times their usual quota of time and they behave as
boxers would if you put them in a 45-foot ring: they don't know how to use
the unaccustomed space. Their rhythm goes, they look weak and lost.
All the most interesting parts of television stop for Christmas: original
drama series, documentaries, current affairs, even the news programmes are
truncated, presumably because of the bizarre belief among broadcasters that
'nothing happens' when Parliament has risen, and the courts are taking a
rest from their onerous five-hour days.
Experience proves that the incidence of news events continues and may even
increase during the Christmas holidays, but those who run television have
never noticed this.
On Christmas Day BBC1 reduces its normal news bulletin by 66 per cent, and
at ITV they not only do the same, they also slip the programme back to
7.50pm which is, of course, what the ITV chiefs would like to adopt as
standard practice, if only the Prime Minister and others would stop making
such a fuss.
If we are honest about it, Christmas is a period when television, much of
which is an undemanding medium at the best of times, slithers down within
itself and becomes even more undemanding.
Consequently viewers who do not wish to slump on the old green sofa in an
alcoholic stupor for three days - or in some homes now anything up to 14
days - are reduced to musical extravaganzas such as The Sorceress with Dame
Kiri Te Kanawa (BBC2, Christmas Eve), the few movies which are genuinely new
to television such as BBC1's box office hit Ghost (Christmas Day), and the
occasional tempting oddity such as Nick Park's new plasticene-animation
short The Wrong Trousers (BBC2 at teatime on Sunday).
If this downbeat version of Christmas television is accurate, you may say,
why all the fuss about the ratings 'war'?
Why should the broadcasters be so keen to win the battle not so much of the
Titans but of the Munchkins?
The answer, an open secret inside the industry, is that only one side really
wants to win.
That side is the BBC, and because their will to win is so much greater than
ITV's, they almost invariably do win.
For ITV, Christmas is a financial paradox: the ratings battle begins at
precisely the moment when the buying of time by advertisers goes into
vertical decline.
Come the evening of Christmas Eve, the public has spent and overspent its
Christmas budget, the shops have shut, and the population is preparing to
remain behind closed doors for three days.
Which commercial broadcaster in his right mind is going to waste his best
programmes fighting for viewers at the very time when the advertising
bonanza has ended and commercial breaks are reduced to a succession of ads
for summer holiday brochures?
What would be the point of holding back Prime Suspect 3 for the Christmas
holiday when you could be showing it on December 19 and 20 at the very time
when the public, in a panic, is thinking 'Must go out tomorrow and buy some
more food/drink/presents for the siege'?
ITV did, of course, screen Prime Suspect 3 earlier this week, it was packed
with commercial breaks which were chock-a-block with Christmas goodies, and
when the viewing figures appear in the new year no doubt we shall discover
that ITV won the ratings battle exactly when they wanted to.
However, their sulky 'Can't win, won't win' attitude over the Christmas
holiday is surely not going to bring them many friends.
Between 6pm on Christmas night and 3am the following morning they are
showing four American movies - National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Field
Of Dreams, DOA and Airport III) - a documentary about an American song
writer (Dreaming Of A White Christmas) a half-hour programme providing 'the
latest movie news' dominated by American items (Cinema, Cinema, Cinema), and
that 10-minute news bulletin from ITN.
Visitors from Pittsburgh and Peoria should feel very much at home. To
describe this as a cynical cop-out would seem to be pitching it a bit high.
It is a disgrace, though nothing more than we have come to expect from ITV
during 1993. And the prognosis for ITV in 1994? A steady decline.
Happy Christmas]

FT  24 DEC 93 / Television and Radio Review: Porgy and Bess bring mixed
emotions - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera features more prominently than usual in the 1993 end-of-year
television timetable. A wider range of it than usual, too: from the
elaborate confection of dance and song entitled The Sorceress (BBC2,
Christmas Eve), with music taken from Handel's opera Alcina and Kiri Te
Kanawa personifying the eponymous mistress of magic arts, to Gershwin's
Porgy and Bess (BBC2, Christmas Sunday) represents an interesting and,
indeed, artistically ambitious span of operatic material.
The Porgy, directed by Trevor Nunn and based on his celebrated 1986
Glyndebourne Festival production, should have been one of the highlights of
the festive-season viewing schedule. For the vast majority of viewers, who
will not have seen the show either at Glyndebourne or in its recent brief
transfer to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, it may well be just that.
At least almost all of the unforgettable original principals - Willard White
and Cynthia Haymon in the title roles, Damon Evans (Sporting Life), Gregg
Baker (Crown) and Marietta Simpson (Maria) - were retained; as a record of
their marvellous, heart-wrenching performances the film retains a basic
value.
But alas, some badly misguided decision-making went into the planning of the
film, the results of which (on the evidence of an advance video sampling)
betray themselves in just about every frame.
Most misguided idea of all was to re-mount the production - on, it seems, a
rather slender budget and an exiguous notion of set-design - in a studio and
then have the vocal contributions mimed: what we hear on the soundtrack is
actually the equally celebrated 1989 EMI studio recording of the
Glyndebourne Porgy, conducted by Simon Rattle.
The deadening effect of the dubbing, of singer-actors not directly involved
in the singing part of the job but simply mouthing their words, is
undeniable and, indeed, unavoidable. Anyone who recalls the spellbinding
immediacy of the Glyndebourne experience would be well advised to rely on
memories and skip the whole relay.
By contrast, the films of Puccini's Fanciulla del West (C4, Christmas Day),
Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades (BBC2, Monday) and Strauss's 'conversation
piece' Capriccio (BBC2, Tuesday) are taken from live productions. While this
may seem a cop-out in terms of confronting the two media - the
musico-theatrical and the televisual - it has in these three cases ensured
that the three shows are put across with their basic qualities intact.
The Puccini, with Domingo and Barbara Daniels, comes from the New York Met;
the Tchaikovsky is another recent Glyndebourne enterprise, a magnificently
creepy modern re-thinking of the terrifying masterpiece; and the Strauss,
again with Kiri Te Kanawa, is a John Cox staging from the San Francisco
Opera.
Also worth noting for the new year weekend: La Traviata, filmed at the
Fenice, Venice, the theatre where Verdi's opera was premiered (BBC2, New
Year's Eve); and a re-run of the remarkable, endlessly fascinating
conversations that in 1968 the BBC filmed between Maria Callas and her old
friend and longtime admirer Lord Harewood (BBC2, New Year's Eve and New
Year's Day).

FT  24 DEC 93 / How Aladdin helped build a castle - but lost out when it had
to be reconstructed: Barry Riley enters the Cave of Gatt and a gripping
story unfolds - but will it end happily ever after?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, where the wind is bitterly cold
and the rain often lashes down from a grey and sullen sky, a Magic Kingdom
once grew out of the damp farmland. Its fairy castle turrets rose towards
the sky and its walls resounded to the sounds of happy crowds and fireworks.
But the magic faded and the Kingdom lost its power, and the allegiance of
its millions of subjects waned. This is the story of its rise and fall.
There were moguls from the west, from the Holy Wooden Empire of the
Clintonians. One was a man called Eisnar, rich and powerful, his wealth
expanded by his almost unlimited options. He was already a Grand Vizier in
his native land but he vowed to conquer other parts of the earth where his
market share was low compared with the local entertainment product. So he
came east and journeyed in search of the treasures which he believed were
hidden there, in particular in the Christmas video market.
In the course of his travels he seized literary gems, especially those in
which there was no longer any copyright, such as Beauty and the Beast and
Jungle Book, and turned them into animated wonders which all the world
flocked to see. But still he did not rest content, because there was
resistance to his ambitions and a bigger share of the multimedia leisure
spending market could still be gained.
So the cunning Eisnar drew up a scheme for a new Magic Kingdom and printed
it in a special prospectus and on the cover he painted a picture of a pink
castle. And he pinned it up on walls and inserted it into local newspapers
and waited for local gamblers and traders.
Sure enough, he did not have long to wait before Aladdin, a local merchant
and investor, came looking for Eisnar. 'I find your scheme very attractive,'
he cried. 'Before long it will be paying out great dividends. Please let me
invest.' (In real life, of course, people do not subscribe to prospectuses
with pink castles on the front, but remember, this is a fairy story.)
Thus an elaborate contract was drawn up and partnerships in the scheme were
granted to Aladdin and many of his friends. And Eisnar raised his hands and
issued the command for the Magic Kingdom called EuroDisney Resort to be
created out of an empty landscape. Such was his power that it was done.
But soon the mighty Eisnar began to become angry. The returns were slipping
below budget. The local people began to become restless under his rule and
to protest about his 'cultural imperialism' as they called it. He needed to
increase his power. But only Aladdin could help him to achieve this.
Therefore he promised the greedy Aladdin that he would increase his
dividends, but only if he helped him in a special mission. They journeyed
out into the wilderness and came to a spot at Geneva, where the mountain
lake feeds a mighty river between many high banks.
'This is the entrance to the Cave of Gatt,' Eisnar announced.
'I cannot enter, but you can. Do not be afraid. The Cave extends almost for
ever, some say as far round as Uruguay, but you do not need to go far. Just
inside the entrance you will find the Magic Lamp. I need it for my
audiovisual industry. Bring it to me as quickly as you can. Beware of this,
however: you must ignore the other riches within and must return by December
15.'
At this, his voice became harsh and frightening. 'If you do not succeed the
Cave of Gatt will crumble and you will be trapped for all eternity behind
the high tariff walls. For so the emperor of the Clintonites has decreed.'
Fearfully, Aladdin entered the cave, which to his ears seemed to be filled
with the sound of endless talking. But immediately he gasped in wonder. All
around were the great treasures of the world, spices from the East Indies,
rice from Thailand, textiles from China, computers from Taiwan, jumbo jets
from Seattle. Then he saw the entertainment section, with piles of Michael
Jackson CDs and heaps of videos such as Rambo 2 and Child's Play 3. In the
middle lay what must be the Magic Lamp, battered and dusty, and surely
worthless.
Then he made a grave mistake. Tempted by the treasures all around, he picked
up a Peter Pan video. At once the ground began to shake violently beneath
his feet, and he heard the angry voice of Eisnar bellowing from the entrance
to the cave. 'You foolish knave, you have disobeyed my instructions and you
have infringed my intellectual property rights. You shall pay the ultimate
penalty. You shall be consumed by a trade war.'
Desperately Aladdin looked around. Surely he could not get out by December
15 now. He picked up the Magic Lamp and looked at the primitive object to
see why it might be so valuable. Was it broken? He rubbed the side to see if
it might be made of gold.
The result was amazing. There was a sudden blue flash, a clap of thunder,
and a hazy figure appeared. 'I am Sir Leon, genie of the Magic Lamp,' the
apparition pronounced. 'Your every directive is my command, or at least,
will be the basis for meaningful negotiations at the highest level.'
Aladdin looked around in panic at the crumbling Cave of Gatt. It might fall
in at any moment. 'Can you get me out of this mess?' he cried. 'No problem]'
answered the genie. 'It may take all night, but I can fudge an answer
somehow] And then I can appear on BBC breakfast TV at the peak audience
time]'
And so the Cave of Gatt did not, after all, collapse but was propped up.
Aladdin returned home and life continued much as before, but he realised
that somewhere Eisnar was still at large, and in his anger and frustration
might be seeking revenge, especially as the newspapers said that
EuroDisneyland was threatened with closure.
Several months passed, and then one afternoon he heard a strange sound
outside his house. Looking through the window he saw a stooped old pedlar
with long white hair hobbling along the road, carrying a bundle of papers.
In a quavering but penetrating voice the old man called out repeatedly: 'New
shares for old] New shares for old]'
Other people were approaching him, offering shares in companies such as
Fisons, Tiphook and Queens Moat Houses, yet he turned them away. But then
Aladdin came up with his EuroDisney certificates. Suddenly the old pedlar
seized them, crying: 'Excellent sir, you are the investor I have been
searching for. Your shares are worthless, without hope of dividends, but why
not take these perpetual zero coupon loan certificates instead?' They
sounded good, Aladdin admitted, but why was there a picture of a small furry
animal in the corner? 'It is logical,' replied the old man, who seemed to
become younger by the minute. 'When you have Mickey Mouse securities it is
wise to recognise the fact.'
And so Eisnar - for indeed it was he in disguise - went away in triumph
because he no longer needed Aladdin, and he began to work his spell on the
Magic Kingdom. The capital was restructured, some new magic carpet rides
were built and the marketing was sharpened up. New auditors were hired, to
replace the over-fussy previous firm. A new tunnel to the north was opened,
encouraging Anglo-Saxon hordes to visit at special cut prices, with a
special opportunity to purchase duty-free drinks.
Aladdin was upset, because he believed he had been deceived. But he
remembered the old Magic Lamp, which was still in his possession, and he
rubbed it vigorously. Again Sir Leon the genie appeared in a puff of smoke.
'Your wish is my directive, subject of course to satisfactory harmonisation
procedures and the required legislative implementation by all member
states,' he said.
'You must stop Eisnar,' cried Aladdin. He has restored the power of the
Magic Kingdom and may achieve total cultural domination.'
'Don't worry about a thing,' replied Sir Leon. 'It should be easy. With a
wave of my regulation book I shall require full compliance with the Third
Theme Park Directive, including sub-section 13(c). Furthermore, all Mickey
Mouse impersonators must be paid a minimum wage of Ecu1,000 an hour. Lastly,
all food prepared at the site, including ice cream, must contain 10 per cent
garlic from the garlic mountain. That should fix it.'
Thus was Eisnar repelled, and the clouds gathered and the rain fell and a
great forest grew around the Magic Kingdom and hid it, until even the
highest turrets of the castle had vanished.
But sadly Aladdin and his friends did not live happily ever afterwards. The
moguls of the Holy Wooden Empire developed a new scheme. They created
monsters called Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus which roamed the land,
crushing and consuming local opposition and creating a famine in the box
offices. But that will be another story, the one they shall call Jurassic
Park 2.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Siemens to invest DM2.4bn in Dresden microchip plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DRESDEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, Germany's largest electronics manufacturer, is to invest DM2.4bn
(Pounds 950m) over 10 years in a new microchip plant in Dresden.
The project will be one of the largest single investments in eastern Germany
and the biggest anywhere in the European electronics sector in recent years.
More than 1,200 jobs will be created, and another 2,000 ancillary jobs are
expected to grow around the new plant.
The investment is part of Siemens' strategy to increase its share of the
international telecommunications market, which is expanding rapidly,
particularly in Europe. Growth would be largely driven by worldwide exports,
the company said.
Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, said that the investment would be made
primarily in production, with 10 per cent for research and development.
'By building this new plant in Dresden, we want to increase productivity,
focus on innovation and expand our markets,' he added. Production and
research will be based under one roof.
The production centre, scheduled to be on line by early 1996, is expected to
have an annual turnover of DM1bn. It will make 64-megabyte memory chips and
the 256-megabyte chip used for telecommunications, mobile telephones and the
car industry.
Siemens intends to invest and organise production alone in Dresden, but Mr
von Pierer added that 'the door would be left open' for potential partners,
including Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group.
Siemens chose Saxony instead of expanding outside Germany after lengthy
negotiations with Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's prime minister, who is
adept at cutting through red tape.
There were also attractive investment grants. The European Union's regional
fund and the German Ministry for Research and Development will contribute
about DM300m.
Siemens said it chose Dresden partly because it offered a highly qualified
workforce. The skills available in the region meant it could become a new
centre of an eastern German electronics industry.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Former Saudi bank head to pay Dollars 220m in BCCI charges
waiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The former head of Saudi Arabia's biggest commercial bank is to pay more
than Dollars 220m (Pounds 147m) as part of a deal with the US authorities to
drop charges against him in relation to the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former chief operating officer of National
Commercial Bank, reached an agreement yesterday with Mr Robert Morgenthau,
the New York district attorney, under which BCCI-related fraud indictments
brought against him last year have been dropped.
The plea bargain marks the latest high-profile case concerning BCCI in which
Mr Morgenthau has failed to secure a criminal conviction. A case brought
against Washington lawyer Mr Robert Altman for allegedly helping BCCI gain
secret control illegally of First American Bankshares, a US bank, collapsed
in August. Later, Mr Morgenthau dropped similar charges against Mr Clark
Clifford, a former US defence secretary.
Yesterday's deal could lead to US investigators obtaining valuable new
information in their continuing investigations into BCCI. Sheikh Khalid is
believed to have agreed to provide information on senior executives in the
collapsed bank, and the role of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI.
Under the terms of the plea bargain, Sheikh Khalid is to pay about Dollars
35m to the US Federal Reserve and Dollars 2m to the district attorney's
office to cover costs, in return for the dropping of civil and criminal
charges against him. He will also pay Dollars 188m into an escrow account to
fund other possible civil cases against him.
Sheikh Khalid and National Commercial Bank are being sued for Dollars 10.5bn
by the liquidators to BCCI, who claim he broke US laws by engaging in
racketeering and fraud. The liquidators' writ alleges that Sheikh Khalid
channelled nearly Dollars 1bn through NCB to buy a stake in BCCI and in the
parent company of First American Bankshares.
National Commercial Bank is the biggest bank in Saudi Arabia and the only
private one. It holds the Saudi royal family accounts.

FT  24 DEC 93 / China set to top 13% growth: Rate of increase would be
world's fastest for second successive year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's economy is likely to have produced the world's fastest growth rate
in 1993 for the second successive year, in spite of the government's
attempts to slow the pace and prevent overheating.
Several western economists who recently visited China expect the economy to
show 13.2 per cent growth in 1993, slightly faster than last year's 12.8 per
cent pace. It is driven by huge growth in industrial output and by massive
investment, with about Dollars 20bn pouring into the economy this year from
foreigners alone.
The economists are cautiously optimistic, however, that the Chinese
government will succeed in slowing the pace of growth to about 10 per cent
during the first half of 1994, and will avoid a 'hard landing'.
Mr Cyril Lin, fellow of St Anthony's College, Oxford, said: 'We're going to
see modest growth in the first half, mainly because the first half of 1993
was so strong.'
Another senior economist said most Chinese leaders appeared united on the
need to stabilise growth. He said the 16-point programme introduced at mid
year to cool the economy 'seems to be working' but admitted there was 'a big
if about monetary policy'.
The economists believe that, while concerns about inflation remain, they
should not be exaggerated. Fears have recently been expressed that the
partial relaxation of monetary policy ordered in the autumn by Mr Zhu
Rongji, vice-premier and central bank governor, will cause the economic boom
to run out of control and force the government to take austerity measures
later in 1994 to curb inflation.
Mr Zhu admitted this week that the government, which had tightened credit in
July to curb the most speculative aspects of the boom, had so far failed to
control growth in money supply and investment in fixed assets. The Beijing
municipal authorities have re-imposed controls on prices of grain, cooking
oil and eggs because of recent sharp rises. Inflation in larger cities is
above 20 per cent.
There have been signs of inflationary psychology - for example, farmers
holding back goods in expectation of further price rises. However, the
economists do not believe that indicates the kind of panic buying and loss
of belief in government policy that presaged previous crackdowns.
Mr Zhu's easing of monetary policy in autumn has not yet had an impact on
the inflation rate, but is likely to do so in the first quarter of 1994. The
economists believe the government's expected 9 per cent target for 1994
inflation is unrealistically low, but that inflation will not run out of
control.
Strong political pressure forced Mr Zhu to go back partly on the tightening
of credit. Even healthy state-owned enterprises were running out of money to
pay wages.
However, the economists believe the easing has been selective, that Mr Zhu's
programme to slow the economy essentially remains in place, and that he is
showing himself determined to press ahead with financial and economic
reforms.
Those include radical changes to the tax system during 1994 which are likely
to contribute to the cooling of the economy. Local governments will have
less revenue available.

FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The defining moment in the battle for Paramount is still some way off,
despite QVC's initial victory in the auction stakes. Both sides can increase
their bids before the tender deadline of January 7, but there is no hurry
for Viacom, which must now counter QVC's bid. The art for Viacom is to look
like a loser for as long as possible in the hope that its own shares will
rise while those of QVC fall, thereby reducing the overall value of its bid.
Yet the mere fact that such a strategy appears appropriate underlines the
silliness of the sums on the table.
Success will probably go to the bidder which offers the most cash. That will
hurt. Viacom must persuade its partners to dig deeper into their pockets,
but a successful bid would almost certainly leave it with much higher
gearing than QVC. Despite fine talk about the multimedia revolution, the
winner's immediate challenge will be to turn round Paramount, which is short
of box office hits. QVC could find that task easier - unlike Viacom it does
not plan to leave Paramount's top management in place.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of frankincense and myrrh may be impossible to chart; that of gold
has been moving up quite nicely recently. After the spell of profit-taking
which saw it retreat sharply from its year's highs of around Dollars 410 in
August, the metal is climbing back towards Dollars 400. That may seem
surprising in view of the retail consumer resistance that developed in the
Far East at the higher price levels, but other seasonal and not-so seasonal
factors are helping demand.
Not only is demand boosted by buying ahead of the Chinese New year and
Indian wedding season; the low oil price has perversely stimulated retail
buying by Middle Eastern investors worried about a possible devaluation of
their currencies. Jewellery demand has also picked up slightly in the US,
thanks to the economic recovery. As for supply, South African producers seem
reluctant to step up their forward sales while the price is rising, and it
will be some time before new discoveries in countries such as Venezuela and
Ghana come on stream.
The fundamentals could thus sustain a further price increase, provided it is
not too violent to scare consumers. One theory about the way in which Far
Eastern demand dried up in the summer was based on the sheer speed with
which the metal approached Dollars 400 rather than the absolute price it
reached. The risk, though, is that speculative pressures could again cause
the price to overshoot. Moreover, while the weak oil price appears to have
helped the metal so far, things would change if any producing country was
forced to sell bullion from its reserves. That, together with the prospect
of central banks cashing in options profits at higher prices, means gold may
struggle to break decisively through its closing peak of Dollars 414 during
the Gulf War.

FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be surprising if Tomkins' decision to explain its hedging strategy
was responsible for yesterday's fall in the shares against the run of a
rising market. There is nothing unusual about Tomkins' policy of protecting
its balance sheet against currency movements, only its choice of
instruments. Rather than borrowing in dollars in the manner of Hanson,
Tomkins uses currency swaps to create dollar liabilities in equal measure to
its US assets. If the dollar falls these assets will depreciate in sterling
terms, but so will the liability under the swap agreement. Shareholders'
funds should remain unchanged.
There is no reason why this approach should be risky, so long as Tomkins is
choosy about the banks with which it deals and has sufficient management
controls. Tomkins has no natural requirement for dollar debt, so borrowing
to hedge its US assets would anyway distort the balance sheet. The only
worry is that liabilities under swap agreements are held off balance sheet
and are therefore not visible in the accounts. One can only accept Tomkins'
word that it never strays into the territory of speculation.
Some investors will doubtless object on principle to companies which hedge
accounting exposures with instruments that can give rise to cash movements.
Tomkins also stands out from the crowd by hedging the translation of
overseas profits into sterling, usually by selling dollars forward. The
company argues that shareholders appreciate its efforts to make its
financial results more predictable. Since Tomkins' acquisitive strategy
depends on keeping its share rating well above the market average, that
level of certainty has a value all its own.

Stock market jitters about Christmas sales are as traditional as family rows
in front of the television. In 11 of the past 13 years, the UK stores sector
has underperformed the market in December. This year's worries have been
given added edge by the ominous trading wobbles in the textiles sector. The
new-found reluctance of retailers to seep news into the market through tipsy
indiscretions at stockbrokers' parties has left investors in the dark.
At almost 25 times historic earnings, the stores sector is more highly rated
in absolute terms than at any time since the early 1970s. With valuations
stretched so tight it is little wonder that the sector slipped at the
beginning of the month. Some shareholders clearly feared it was not just
turkeys that would be roasted this Christmas.
Yet it is a retailing truism that Christmas comes later every year. The
Budget may have confused the pattern but sales do appear to have accelerated
over the past weeks. The best guess is that it has been a steady, if
unspectacular, trading period. The latest John Lewis Partnership figures are
certainly showing solid sales gains.
The outlook for stores next year is finely balanced. Tax rises will depress
consumer spending, although the current savings ratio of 10.6 per cent
highlights potential spending power. Investors may also keep faith in a
sector that promises earnings growth in line with the market but with no
exposure to mainland Europe. The added bonus could come from the consumer
cycle being brought back into line with the political one. As the next
election looms, twitchy Tory MPs will be pressing for a more
consumer-friendly stance.

In the last session before the long Christmas weekend, US blue chip stocks

By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.47 at 3,757.72,
after flirting with a new record high for most of the session. But the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.06 ahead to 467.38. The American SE composite
added 2.49 at 465.32 and the Nasdaq composite 2.63 at 758.70.
Before adjourning for the three-day holiday, the market had been facing the
release of some important economic data. In the event, the numbers were
favourable, though mostly in line with expectations. In response, equities
climbed 12 Dow points at one stage. Reinforcing the impression that the
economy was in a period of sustained expansion, November factory orders for
durable goods were 2 per cent above the October level.
On the consumer side, the University of Michigan's index of sentiment jumped
to 88.2 in December, from 81.2 last month. The growth of confidence was
underlined by November's figures on personal income, up 0.6 per cent from
October's after seasonal adjustments, and personal consumption, up 0.4 per
cent.
With price pressures remaining tame, the bond market was able to weather the
bullish economic news with barely a ripple. Such resilience encouraged
interest in blue chips by traders seeking to square their year-end
positions.
But the market reversed course in mid-afternoon in very thin trading, and
the session ended with the bellwether index in negative territory.
Among the Dow components, 3M shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 108 3/4 , IBM
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 5/8 and McDonald's Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 56
7/8. General Electric gained Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 106 on reports that CSX,
the largest US railway operator, was close to placing an order for 300 GE
locomotives.
Walt Disney was Dollars 3/8 ahead at Dollars 44 3/4 after Morgan Stanley
upgraded the stock.
In the pharmaceutical sector, Schering Plough climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 67 3/8 . Elsewhere in healthcare, Baxter International dipped
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 23. Owens &amp; Minor, its rival in the hospital supply
business, moved ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/4 on news that it would
double its size with the acquisition of Stuart Medical.
On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer was marked down Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/4
after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the stock.
Canada
Toronto stocks received a lift from firmness in Canada's currency and bond
markets as foreign investors responded to the federal government's
commitment on Wednesday to inflation reduction targets.
The TSE 300 index finished 19.5 up at 4,246.4 and rises led falls by 541 to
223 after volume of 59.9m shares. The energy group put on 1.37 per cent and
financial services 0.94 per cent.

FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan falls 4% as
margin loans are rationed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roundup
Markets moved in sharply divergent directions, with Tokyo on holiday and
Bombay still strikebound.
TAIWAN plunged 4 per cent on heavy profit-taking triggered by news that
Fuh-Hwa Securities Finance was introducing a rationing system for margin
loans. The weighted index ended 216.79 down at 5,257.96, after an intraday
low of 5,248. Turnover remained heavy at TDollars 78.87bn but fell from
Wednesday's TDollars 103.92bn.
Fuh-Hwa is the market's biggest provider of margin loans. Profit-taking from
the market's 32 per cent gains since November 27 was relentless in spite of
some bargain hunting at mid-morning.
China Steel, the most active issue of the day, retreated TDollars 1.60 to
TDollars 25. Among the most recent targets of foreign buying, the banking
stock ICBC finished only 50 cents lower at TDollars 67.50.
BANGKOK rose 1.3 per cent in active trade, propelled by the strong gains of
TelecomAsia and the debut of satellite dish seller Samart Corporation. The
SET index added 19.77 at 1,543.52 in turnover of a robust Bt25.43bn.
TelecomAsia, the largest capitalisation issue in the market, hit its 10 per
cent upward limit, surging Bt11 to Bt127, and was the most active stock in
volume and turnover terms.
Samart soared to Bt452, or more than five times its initial public offer
price of Bt80. The stock was the second most active. The combined turnover
of TA and Samart represented 21.8 per cent of the market total.
HONG KONG saw selective buying which took the Hang Seng index 173.24, or 1.6
per cent, higher to a record 10,881.20, although profit-taking had pared a
day's best of 10,957.59. Properties led the gains, with Sun Hung Kai
Properties peaking at a record HKDollars 66 before finishing HKDollars 3.50
ahead at HKDollars 65 and Henderson Land up HKDollars 2.25 at HKDollars 44.
San Miguel Brewery, a locally listed subsidiary of San Miguel, of the
Philippines, surged HKDollars 1.425 to HKDollars 5.80, buoyed by a late wave
of local demand after market rumours that the brewery might move its
operations to China.
NEW ZEALAND's rally continued, supported by lower interest rates. Most
shares gained ground on good volume, the NZSE-40 capital index climbing
16.94 to 2,088.72.
Strong foreign demand took Telecom 3 cents higher to NZDollars 3.98 and
Carter Holt Harvey up a cent to NZDollars 3.51 in turnover of 5.6m shares.
MANILA closed at a record high for the fourth straight day as money
continued to flood into the market.
The composite index moved up 99.63 to 2,997.46, taking this week's
cumulative rise to 12.6 per cent.
JAKARTA advanced in moderate late trading which left the official index 7.27
higher at a record 557.34.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its ggod run, led by institutional buying of blue
chips, with the composite index ending 30.86 up at a new 1993 peak of
1,152.24.
SINGAPORE was in bullish mood, the Straits Times Industrial index rising
24.66 to a high of 2,298.61 in heavy volume of 515.9m shares.
SEOUL was dragged lower amid profit-taking in high-priced blue chips and the
composite index fell 10.23 to 858.37.
KARACHI encountered more profit-taking, pushing the KSE index 28.88 lower to
2,033.08.

FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentine equities meet violence with
equanimity - John Barham on a lucrative Buenos Aires bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week ago, rioting broke out in one of Argentina's northern provinces. In a
matter of hours, rioters took control of the city of Santiago del Estero,
burning and pillaging as they went. It was Argentina's worst day of violence
since hyperinflation brought looting to a number of the country's big cities
in July 1989.
Yet the next day, with the dramatic images still fresh in the minds of
investors in Argentina, and around the world, share prices rallied with a
respectable, 2 per cent gain.
There are a number of explanations. One may be the firm response of the
country's president, Mr Carlos Menem, who flew back the same day from a
state visit to the Vatican, ordered security forces to reimpose control and
refused to allow the uprising to blow his economic reforms off course.
Another is that, as in other markets in Latin America, equities in Buenos
Aires were also lifted by with a inflow of international funds.
Argentina, too, is still widely viewed as one of the world's most exciting
emerging countries. It has a rapidly developing equity market, which offers
easy and increasingly representative exposure to a fast-growing economy. It
also has currency stability, with the peso tied to the US dollar.
The bulls continue to be rewarded. This week the market has been climbing
steadily after idling for most of the month. So far this year the Merval
market index has risen by a quarter and the IFC Argentine index is up by 55
per cent, both in local currency and in dollar terms.
This seems a fair reward for dabbling in explosive Latin American risks. In
London the FT-SE 100-share index has risen 17 per cent this year and in New
York the Dow has seen a 14 per cent advance.
Inevitably, the Merval's advance masks far more interesting shifts in
individual stocks. Mr Christopher Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires equity analyst,
says Swiss-owned cement company Holderbank's equity stake and management
contract in Corcemar, an Argentine cement-maker, has transformed this into
the market's hottest company, with a 300 per cent price rise this year. Yet
he is still estimating Corcemar's prospective p/e, to June 1994, at 14.
Banco Shaw, a small retail bank taken over by Spain's Banesto, has put in a
250 per cent share price increase. Banks are expected to make big profits
from the embryonic mortgage lending business. Yet Shaw's prospective,
calendar 1994 p/e is only 12. Even the top-ranking companies in the sector,
Banco Frances and Banco Galicia, which have seen very strong advances all
year, remain relatively cheap.
At the other extreme, Argentina's two highly profitable telephone companies,
Telecom and Telefonica, are both considered overpriced after gains of 22 per
cent this month.
The steelmaker, Acindar, hit by unexpected recent losses and a government
investigation into trading and accounting irregularities, is also deemed
expensive. Siderca, another steel company, and Celulosa a pulp company, are
mired in losses.
The market is seeing an increasing number of initial public offerings. On
Tuesday, Citicorp, the US bank, began floating off a minority stake in CEI,
its Argentine investment vehicle, which holds stakes in 12 companies, mainly
privatised utilities.
The government floated its remaining stakes in two privatised power stations
in December. One of them, Central Costanera, saw its share price rise to a
premium of almost 20 per cent over its offer price on the first day of
trading.
In June, the government sold 45 per cent of YPF, the national oil company,
raising Dollars 3.04bn. YPF, now the most active stock in Buenos Aires,
initially showed a steep rise but it has now settled down to a trading range
around Dollars 25, one-third above its flotation price.
Speculators who made a killing in YPF are giving way to program traders
playing the arbitrage market between New York and Buenos Aires. By one
estimate, about Dollars 80m in YPF arbitrage takes place every day.
The development of more adventurous derivative instruments is still being
thwarted by a limited range of actively traded stocks, a poorly-designed
market index and shortage of sophisticated players. And in spite of the
market's steady growth, private companies are resisting the attractions of
cheap equity funding.
They prefer to raise equally cheap debt in overseas markets whenever
possible. As in most other Latin countries, Argentine companies remain
famously averse to opening up to outsiders.

FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials at record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady demand for industrial shares took the Johannesburg industrials index
up 64 to a record 5,262 in a continuation of the rally which has seen the
sector rise 17 1/2 per cent since the Washington conference on the country's
future on October 2, writes Michael Morgan.
Copthall Martin in London noted that foreign demand has picked up
substantially, particularly in the industrial sector over the last three
months as the political process has proceeded more smoothly than many people
had expected.
The broker added that liquidity has also improved, with many local investors
willing to cash in holdings as price/earnings ratios approached the 15
level.
Ready demand from foreign buyers has since taken industrial stocks up to a
current historical high of 16.6 times 1993 earnings.
De Beers picked up from a day's low of R95 to end R1.25 easier at R96.50,
still dogged by reports of leaks in its diamond supply deal with Russia.
Golds advanced 22 to 2,094 and the overall index moved ahead 29 to 4,641.

FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Five of six top bourses score
new highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five of the continent's six top bourses scored new highs yesterday as Milan,
which peaked back in August, eased on profit-taking, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT professionals went home with another 1 per cent gain on their
books, the DAX index closing 25.33 higher at a new high of 2,222.84.
Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said that it was German institutional
investors who did the business, and that most of of that was done in the
first half hour. However, the Ibis indicated DAX held its gains in the
post-bourse, where it rose to 2,227.63.
Turnover rose from DM9.2bn to DM9.5bn. West German December inflation
figures showed a steady year-on-year rate and a slowing monthly figure.
Banks were strong, particularly Deutsche Bank which rose DM13 to DM888.50.
Siemens had another good day, up DM16 to DM786.50 for a two-day gain of
DM30. Siemens has been asked to rebid for a DM4bn, Korean high-speed rail
contract, said Mr Longley, which was won by GEC Alsthom, but which now
seemed to be open to negotiation once again.
PARIS was lifted past its old high by a strong French bond market and an
inflow from mutual funds, the CAC-40 approaching today's end of the December
account with a rise of 17.23 to 2,243.02 in turnover of FFr4.8bn,
Club Mediterranee regained some of its recent losses, rising FFr24 to FFr345
as short positions were bought back following the news of its FFr290m net
attributable loss for 1992/93. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that
there may also have been some bargain hunting, as the stock was viewed as
slightly oversold.
Among the cyclicals, rising on the dollar and the prospect of European
recovery, Alcatel Alsthom climbed by FFr16 to FFr841 and Schneider by
FFr20.20 to FFr459.20.
Credit Lyonnais certificates, up FFr21 at FFr729, offered a belated reaction
to the appointment of a new chairman, and the prospect that 1994 would be a
recovery year.
AMSTERDAM peaked, too, with the CBS General Shares Tendency index adding
1.20 to 147.90, supported by hopes of a continuing lower trend in interest
rates.
Aegon, however, shed Fl 4.70 to Fl 106.20 in a late burst of British selling
which more than wiped out the Fl 4.40 spurt made just before Wednesday's
close.
Stocks to hit new year-highs included Unilever, which closed up Fl 2.30 at
its session best of Fl 225.40 after its recent acquisitions, and Elsevier,
up Fl 3.90 at Fl 181.90.
ABN Amro shed 20 cents to Fl 71.10 after a low of Fl 70.90 in heavier than
normal volume after saying that it would buy a French subsidiary of CS
Holdings.
The fall was attributed to fears that the bank might be about to announce a
much more ambitious purchase, possibly involving a rights issue.
Publishers continued in favour. Wolters Kluwer ended at its 12-month high of
Fl 123.70, up Fl 1.50 while VNU added Fl 3.40 to Fl 166.50.
ZURICH was propelled to a fifth consecutive peak by continued high liquidity
and further hopes of lower rates in the new year. The SMI index added 23.9
to 2,966.3.
Nestle led the market higher with a SFr28 rise to SFr1,277. Zurich
Insurance, which has lagged behind its sector recently, saw its bearers rise
SFr24 to SFr1,499. CS Holding, the best performing bank, rose SFr30 to
SFr3,700.
Adia, the temporary employment group, rose SFr12 to SFr189 after the
announcement that practically all of its shareholders had subscribed to the
company's issue of new bearer shares.
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the arms-to-fashion group, rose SFr2.50 to SFr119.50 on as
it confirmed an earlier forecast of higher 1993 net profits.
MILAN turned lower after the recent rally which has seen the market rise by
6.2 per cent since December 10. The Comit index shed 5.01 to 614.45 in
subdued trading, with the Senate's approval of the budget already discounted
by the market.
Among exceptions to the downward drift, Nuovo Pignone climbed L406 or 6.5
per cent to L6,673, on news that a group of US companies led by General
Electric were taking a large stake.
By contrast, Fiat's Cogefar fell L162 or 5.6 percent to 2,747 after
announcing a L620bn rights issue ahead of merging its activities with three
other construction companies.
MADRID hit the level that most traders were looking for, the general index
closing 4.22 higher at a new high of 322.06 in turnover of Pta38bn.
Buying interest focused on electrical utilities. Iberdrola was up Pta26 at
Pta1,020, and Sevillana and Endesa by 3 per cent and 2.5 per cent
respectively.
OSLO added 1.7 per cent, taking its lead from the gains in the leading
European markets.
The all-share index climbed 9.93 to 596.68 in turnover of NKr929m as
shipping shares registered a broadly based advance.
VIENNA posted a new high as equities were helped up by a 10 basis point
easing in the Gomex money market rate to 5.6 per cent, the ATX index closing
23.85 higher at 1,100.95. Traders also acknowledged that the market had some
catching up to do on Germany.

FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise Oil hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report that French oil group Elf Aquitaine has reclassified its 10 per
cent share-holding in Enterprise Oil as a non-core investment was
interpreted as increasing the likelihood of the shares being sold and
prompted renewed downside pressure on Enterprise shares.
Already unsettled earlier this week by a sell recommendation issued by
NatWest Securities, Enterprise shares were among only a handful of poor
performers in a generally buoyant market, closing 2 off at 446p. Earlier
they had fallen to 442p. Turnover was a higher than usual 1m shares.
Other oil issues managed to move ahead yesterday in spite of the continuing
poor showing of crude oil prices, which currently languish below the Dollars
14 a barrel mark.
Elf is thought to be planning Pounds 600m worth of asset sales for the next
three years and dealers said the Enterprise stake would probably be at the
end of the queue. 'They would be seen as unwise to unload such a big stake
on to the market when a weak oil price has wrought such damage in the
sector,' said one analyst.
Lasmo rallied 4 to 118p, responding to favourable press comment on the
Pounds 123m asset sale to PowerGen.
Bank shares came under sustained selling pressure early in the session, as
some of the market's action funds began to cash in their profits on the
sector and switched to other high yielding areas of the market, such as the
utilities.
Hit by the early flurry of selling, the banks then mostly rallied as
marketmakers took the opportunity to replenish their trading books.
Standard Chartered, however, shrugged aside the early selling, with the
stock price stimulated by talk that Cazenove, the bank's own broker, had
upgraded its forecasts. Standard shares, among the market's outstanding
performers in recent weeks following a series of rather wild bid stories,
forged ahead 32 to 1221p as the Cazenove upgrade filtered into the market.
Lloyds Bank, which retains a 4.6 per cent holding in Standard Chartered
following its unsuccessful bid for the bank in the 1980s, and is always seen
as a potential bidder for the company, came under pressure, closing 4 off at
644p.
TSB, put forward by many market observers as one of the market's best
potential bid targets, put on 3 at 254 1/2 p.
Merchant banks showed further strength, led by Hambros, which appreciated 8
to 396p, followed by Kleinwort Benson, 4 higher at 595p.
Royal Insurance took the honours in a mostly subdued composite insurance
sector, racing up 16 to 333p, while Sun Alliance rose 9 to 387p after talk
of a Fleming buy recommendation. CE Heath, still responding to strong buy
advice from Kleinwort Benson, added 13 at 380p.
YJ Lovell shares plunged 30 per cent, closing 4 3/4 down at 11p, after
revealing a loss of almost Pounds 60m for the year. That figure included
Pounds 55m worth of write-offs on land and property values in the UK and the
US.
Stores stocks finally shrugged off talk of drab winter sales as reports were
heard of a late surge in Christmas shopping. Clothes shares, which have
borne the brunt of the poor sales reports, were in particular demand. Next
advanced 10 1/2 to 226 1/2 p, Austin Reed 8 to 183p, GUS 16 to 631p and
Burton 1 1/2 to 65p.
Among others, Boots rose 14 1/2 to 575p, Goldsmiths 7 to 85p, Kingfisher 18
to 737p, just under its all-time high reached two weeks ago, and Lloyds
Chemist 10 to 349p.
Property shares were left behind by yesterday's rush, although analysts said
the sector's recent rumbustious run meant many stocks were looking
overbought.
MEPC, which has seen its shares jump 12 per cent in the past six weeks,
almost double that of the FT-SE 100, slipped a penny to 550p. Land
Securities remained at 787p, still 13 off its all-time high hit two
ses-sions ago.
Leisure and property group Ladbroke returned to favour as investors bought
it on recovery potential; the stock was also tipped by one newspaper as a
likely outperformer in 1994.
There was again heavy two-way business, with some investors still unwilling
to stay in the stock, which has been plagued in recent months by speculation
over its trading situation and dividend policy. Yesterday the share price
gained 9 1/2 at 164p in hefty turnover of 18m.
Other lesiure stocks were in demand. Among hotel groups, Stakis added 4 at
64p, as did Forte, at 261p. Granada Group, still awaiting developments in
its television bid war, continued to make its all-paper offer more
attractive as its shares climbed 8 to a record 534p.
Rank Organisation, also among some brokers' tips for 1994, moved up 6 to
980p, while Thorn EMI gained 11 at 1009p.
Euro Disney, however, missed the party as the theme park operator dismissed
suggestions by its auditors that it may have to close this spring without a
much-needed financial restructuring. The shares dropped 22 to 373p.

FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters may buy US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock market heavyweight Reuters Holdings cranked up to become one of the
day's big gainers as analysts became convinced that the news and electronic
information group was poised to attack the US market. The shares advanced 64
to 1880p.
The speculation, which emanated from New York, focused on a bid for Quotron,
the US dealing screen arm of Citicorp which has been making losses and has
been seen as up for sale for some time.
Mr Brian Newman, analyst with agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite and a
long-time enthusiast of Reuters shares, said a bid was imminent.
'The deal is on. Citicorp will sell the business to Reuters for a nominal
sum. This will leave Reuters with a world-wide market share of around 25 per
cent of specialist equity terminals - double its present share.'
Mr Newman believes the deal will be sufficiently beneficial to send Reuters'
US traded American Depositary Receipts up to Dollars 100 each - equivalent
to a UK share price of Pounds 22. However, not all analysts are so
enthusiastic. One said: 'Quotron is a declining business and I am not
convinced that it is the best way into the US.'

FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volume in the derivatives market dried up yesterday as the pressure from
recent buy programmes shifted to the underlying stock market and pushed it
to a new high, writes Peter John.
The March Footsie futures contract was marked up some 23 points at the start
of official trading, reflecting a sharp squeeze prompted by bear closing in
the market.
However, the advance was not sustained by heavy activity and at the official
close less than 5,000 contracts had changed hands and March was only up
another 20 points.
It was a day that allowed the futures to breathe more easily after a
sustained period of heavy activity, particularly in tailor-made over the
counter options which have been expiring recently.
Turnover in the traded options area of the Liffe was at 42,045 contracts,
down from Wednesday's 49,000 lots, although that volume had been boosted by
stock options scheduled to expire in December.

FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index breaks through the
3,400 mark - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The squeeze on marketmakers in a London stock market now convinced that the
new year will feature low interest rates and inflation sent share prices
racing to new peaks yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index broke through 3,400
briefly before closing a net 40.8 points ahead on the session at 3,396.5.
The action started early, with the stock market moving up on its own
initiative, without waiting for the stock index futures market to open. But
the March contract on the Footsie added fuel to the fire, showing a
substantial premium to cash in early deals, and the initial gain of 18
points on the Footsie was quickly extended to more than 30 points.
Equities were responding to signs that the buying programme operated by a
Swiss investment house on Wednesday night was taking effect. Another Swiss
house followed suit yesterday afternoon in the cash market.
Marketmaking firms are now gripped in a vice. They cannot refuse to sell
stock to the big institutions, but they soon find that hardly anyone will
sell stock to them when they need it for delivery.
Yesterday, with the extended Christmas holiday ahead, some dealers were
willing to pay substantial premiums for stock, thereby pouring oil on the
flames of their own bonfire.
The squeeze among the second line issues was even stronger than on those in
the FT-SE 100 list. At 3,762.8, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 35.8 points
higher on the day.
Overall Seaq volume rose to 885.2m shares. But 16 per cent of this total
came from very low priced dealings in nil-paid stocks. On Wednesday, 779.2m
shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of Pounds 1.56bn.
Among the best-favoured sectors were the media stocks, where Reuters rose
strongly on hints that an important deal was pending in the US. Hotel
shares, which suffered badly during the downturn in global tourist and
consumer markets, moved sharply higher as investors struggled to get hold of
stock.
Oil shares, having been held back over the past month by weakness in crude
oil prices, were helped by the better performance of the sector on Wall
Street. The New York market was up by a further 8 Dow points in UK hours
yesterday, and US interest added to the day's gains in oil issues in London.
Financial shares had a more mixed session as some profits were taken in
sectors showing substantial gains over the past month and also over the year
as a whole. But dealers stressed that across the range of the market,
investors were more inclined to let profits run into what is expected to be
a successful new year than to take quick profits at this stage.
Among the more bullish of the market strategists, Mr Nicholas Knight of
Nomura predicted yesterday that the Footsie will reach 3,700 by the end of
January. He identifies further increases in cash at the US mutual funds
which, he says, are increasingly attracted to the UK as a useful and
lucrative 'dumping ground' for cash.
The equity market was also helped by firmness in UK government bonds,
reflecting general confidence that inflation and interest rates will be kept
low next year. Short-dated bonds remained steady, while at the longer end,
prices gained just over half a point, bringing yields down to around 6.45
per cent on these issues.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark gains in spite of continuing US
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark gained yesterday against the dollar in spite of economic data
signalling a continuation of the strong US recovery, write Peter Marsh and
Emma Tucker.
The French franc was also moderately strong against other important
currencies, rounding off a helter-skelter year for the French currency.
In thin holiday trading, the dollar found few buyers, in spite of data
indicating durable goods orders rose 2 per cent in November, above market
forecasts. After hitting DM1.693 in European trading, the dollar rallied
slightly by the close but only to DM1.6935, down nearly a pfennig from the
previous finish. In New York it also ended at DM1.6935.
The franc was steady against the D-Mark as French Economy Minister Edmond
Alphandery told a news conference that the government would not hesitate to
take further steps to help stimulate growth, if that were necessary. The
French franc ended last night little changed against the German currency at
FFr3.406.
In other parts of Europe, the Austrian central bank announced a cut in its
GOMEX money market intervention rate of 10 basis points to 5.6 per cent from
December 27, while the National Bank of Greece said the bank would reduce
its deposit rate by 1 percentage point to 16 per cent in the next few days.
There were few buyers for sterling as dealers, reluctant to take positions
over Christmas, quoted prices defensively.
In spite of this, the pound held firm against the D-Mark in late European
trading, and gained against a generally weaker dollar to break through the
psychologically important Dollars 1.50 barrier.
It closed in London up  1/4 pfennig at DM2.5475, with analysts yesterday
predicting that at least in the short term there was little upside left for
the pound. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5040, after the
previous day's Dollars 1.4950.
The Bank of England announced that from January 20 it would introduce a new
permanent sale and repurchase agreement, or repo, to relieve money market
shortages.
The move to the permanent repo still depends on consultations currently
under way with banks and building societies, but follows on from the special
facilities that were originally required after Black Wednesday last year to
help offset the exceptionally large money market shortages that arose from
the settlement of official foreign exchange transactions.
In the meantime, the Bank said it would offer temporary facilities to take
effect from January 5, maturing on January 20, to replace the outstanding
January 5 maturing repo.
On the money markets, the overnight rate slipped as low as 3 1/2 per cent,
as a Pounds 1.5bn shortage was easily removed. The March short-sterling
contract moved about 5 basis points higher to close at around 94.82 and the
three-month interbank rate ended the day at 5 3/8 per cent.

FT  24 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOL Prices at New Zealand sales on December 20 were frequently a little
softer again, and clearances to the trade were not good. Only at last week's
Bradford auction of British wool did prices rise, and the rise was sharp at
up to 15%. This was a special situation with very few firms selling
substantially earlier in the season and finding that better activity in the
carpet wool sector has led to concentrated competition for limited supplies.
The market otherwise has closed dull and indecisively for Christmas with
wool prices significantly above the season's low point but also well down on
November peaks.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME metals trim back
early gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The base metals markets were yesterday approaching the Christmas holiday in
a cautious mood, with most London Metal Exchange contracts surrendering some
of their earlier gains.
Among these was copper, which dropped Dollars 6 in the three months position
to close at Dollars 1,797.25 a tonne. But that was still Dollars 50.50 up on
balance, thanks the strong surge on Monday and Tuesday.
Analysts were divided on whether the market's improved sentiment principally
reflected short-term factors, such as a downturn in LME warehouse stocks, or
a fundamental change in the perceived outlook.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group thought that 'the overall fundamentals of this
market still remain bearish' and forecast that the stocks decline would
prove to be 'a temporary phenomenon', attributable to delayed shipments from
the former Soviet Union and light Chinese offtake.
But Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group,
insisted that 'the fundamentals in the copper market are getting better all
the time', with US demand up 8 per cent so far in 1993 and stocks falling at
both the New York Commodity Exchange and the LME. Stocks now represented
only eight weeks' consumption, he noted, which was a low level coming out of
a recession.
Zinc was another market still showing gains on the week despite falling
yesterday. The three months price climbed to Dollars 1,002.50 a tonne on
Wednesday as it benefitted from the strength of copper, but fell Dollars 6
yesterday to close at Dollars 996.50 a tonne, still Dollars 9 to the good.
Traders told the Reuter news agency yesterday that sentiment might have been
dented by a forecast that Chinese zinc production could hit 900,000 tonnes
next year as new smelters came into operation.
Aluminium prices, which had surrendered some of their early gains in
mid-week, moved higher again yesterday, a Dollars 4.25 rise taking the three
months quotation to Dollars 1,121.50 a tonne. up Dollars Dollars 7 on the
week.
Among the precious metals, silver once again put in the steadiest
performance, the cash price closing yesterday at Dollars 5.02 1/2 cents a
troy ounce, up 4 cents on the week but 7 cents below Monday's peak. Monday
had also seen the peaks for gold and platinum, Dollars 389.60 and Dollars
388.75 an ounce respectively. But both retreated and were showing net
declines by yesterday's close. 'None of the precious metals look prepared to
go higher now,' one trader told Reuter, 'but underlying support should hold
while prices consolidate.'
At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa futures market resumed where it
had left off last week, with the March position extending its Pounds 70
decline by another Pounds 62 to reach Pounds 904 a tonne at Monday's close.
Mr Lawrence Eagles of London broker GNI blamed the fall on 'massive long
liquidation of speculative positions' built up during the period of
uncertainty about the health of Mr Felix Houphouet-Boigny, veteran president
of the Ivory Coast, the world's buggest cocoa producer.
The peaceful hand-over of power following the announcement of Mr
Houphouet-Boigny's death two-and-a-half weeks ago left the market at the
mercy of the bearish developments that had been ignored during that period -
heavier-than-expected arrivals from West African harvests and signs that the
Ivory Coast would not, after all, be delaying the marketing of its mid-crop
cocoa.
Support appeared, however, when the March price briefly dipped below Pounds
900 on Tuesday, and by yesterday's close it had recovered to Pounds 929 a
tonne.

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fiat reduces construction
exposure in three-way link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, is cutting its exposure to the
troubled building sector via a complex three-way merger. The deal will
create the country's biggest construction concern.
Fiat will merge its quoted Cogefar-Impresit subsidiary with Lodigiani and
Girola, two large, privately-owned, building groups. The combined entity,
with annual sales of about L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn), should be more
competitive against larger rivals, such as Germany's Hochtief and Philipp
Holzmann and Bouygues of France, for big international contracts.
The multi-stage deal will begin with a rights issue by Cogefar-Impresit, 63
per cent-owned by Fiat, which will then merge with Impregilo. The latter is
a long-standing joint venture between Cogefar-Impresit, Lodigiani and
Girola, operating exclusively in big infrastructure contracts outside Italy.
The merged company, to be called Impregilo, will then take over the
industrial activities of Lodigiani and Girola in return for equity stakes.
Fiat's stake in the 'new' Impregilo will fall to about 26.5 per cent when
the deal is completed during the next 18 months. A similar proportion of the
shares will be floating. The remainder will be split between Lodigiani (17
per cent), Girola (16.3 per cent), and five banks (15 per cent).
'The deal reflects an awareness that the companies concerned need to
concentrate and rationalise,' said Mr Ugo Montevecchi, chief executive of
Cogefar-Impresit. 'The existing Impregilo joint venture was the obvious
point on which to focus.'
Italy's big builders have been devasted this year by recession and the
long-running political corruption scandal, which has led to a virtual freeze
on public-sector contracts. Profits have crumbled at most large groups,
while many smaller builders, which often act as subcontractors, have gone
bankrupt.
Mr Montevecchi said the Fiat-led reorganisation was dictated by market
forces in the highly-fragmented Italian construction sector.
Cogefar-Impresit, the country's leading builder, expects sales of about
L1,600bn this year, while turnover at Lodigiani and Girola should be about
L500bn and L300bn respectively.

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Murdoch buys into Indian TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star Television has acquired a 49.9 per cent stake in
Asia Today, the Bombay-based company which broadcasts Zee TV, a
Hindi-language entertainment channel.
The acquisition means two of Star's six television channels will be
broadcast in a regional Asian language. It demonstrates the strategy of Mr
Murdoch's News Corp, which owns 64 per cent of Star, to widen its choice for
Asian viewers.
Zee TV will continue to be operated by its current management team in
Bombay, which generates all programming and advertising sales, and will
maintain its 10-year output agreement with Zee Telefilms, a public company
listed on the Bombay stock exchange.
The purchase will boost Star's share of prime-time viewing in Indian cable
homes to more than 50 per cent.
Zee TV, transmitted by satellite, is seen in more than 7m homes, or 25 per
cent of Indian households with television sets.
The Hindi entertainment and current affairs programme channel has enjoyed

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alitalia warns unions over cuts
as losses grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alitalia, Italy's state airline, has warned labour unions that urgent
measures are necessary to cut costs and improve productivity to staunch what
may be one of its biggest losses on record.
Details of Alitalia's 1993 results will not be available until well into
next year. However, some stock market forecasts suggest this year's loss
could reach L300bn (Dollars 182.5m).
Alitalia lost L214bn in the first half of this year, well above the L14.7bn
deficit incurred for the whole of 1992 and on a par with the group's record
loss of L217bn in 1989.
The group said it would be taking a variety of steps to improve its
earnings, including job losses, asset disposals and the transfer of some
operations to outside companies.
Efficiency improvements and tough negotiations on productivity have allowed
the company to better its financial performance in the past three years, in
spite of the impact of the 1991 Gulf war.
Alitalia's costs remain relatively high compared with Europe's most
efficient airlines and service standards, in spite of improvements, can
still be lamentable.
In a statement to union leaders, the company said it planned to accelerate
its fleet replacement programme, with the disposal of some of its big
four-engined Boeing 747 jets in favour of lower capacity twin-engined long
range aircraft.
The company may try to make further savings by postponing or stretching out
its big contract for new Airbus 321 aircraft, for which it is a launch
customer, although no official comment has been made.
The job losses, estimated at about 1,400 people, will fall mainly on white
collar staff. Among other measures to improve its financial performance, the
group may also sell, and then lease back, more of its fleet, which stood at
162 aircraft at the end of June.

ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to expand in France through the
acquisition, from Swiss Volksbank, of Banque Odier Bungener Courvoisier
(OBC), a Paris-based bank specialising in private and corporate banking,
The Dutch bank said the takeover price would be around FFr500m (Dollars
85m), though an exact sum has not yet been fixed with Swiss Volksbank, a
subsidiary of Credit Suisse Holding.
OBC, which has a staff of 250 and a balance sheet total of about FFr5.8bn,
will continue to operate under existing management. It will retain its own
identity and independence within the ABN Amro group.
Vendex International, the privately-held Dutch retail group, plans to sell
its 79 per cent stake in Staal Bankiers, the Dutch bank, to the country's
fourth-largest insurance group, AVCB.
The proposed deal brings to an end Vendex's long search for a buyer.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The latest bid by workers at United Airlines to take a majority stake in the
US carrier cleared its biggest hurdle when the company's board voted to back
the deal.
The board decided late on Tuesday to accept an offer for between 53 per cent
and 63 per cent of the company in return for wage cuts and changes in
working practices which it valued at more than Dollars 4.5bn.
An earlier union proposal was rejected by the UAL board a month ago. CS
First Boston, financial adviser, estimated that offer at Dollars 140 a share
and said it did not provide adequate value to shareholders.
The sweetened offer was judged fair by financial advisers, First Boston and
Lazard Freres, the company said. It has been valued at Dollars 173 a share
by the unions, but UAL has not put a value to it.
Mr Stephen Wolf, UAL chairman and chief executive, said: 'For the first
time, majority interest in a global air carrier will rest with its
employees. United's employees will share in the company's success and will
have substantial incentive to ensure that UAL remains a global aviation
leader.'
Mr Wolf, and Mr John Pope, president and chief operating officer, are due to
step down once the deal is completed.
The deal needs the approval of the two unions with which it was negotiated,
as well as UAL's shareholders.

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Battle for Paramount not over
yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 10bn, three-month takeover battle for US entertainment group
Paramount Communications entered its final leg yesterday with television
shopping business QVC Network holding an edge over cable TV company Viacom.
The advantage, however, could be temporary.
In a significant psychological shift, the Paramount board recommended on
Wednesday night that shareholders accept QVC's previously-hostile offer,
rather than a lower, but friendly, bid from Viacom. Paramount's board,
chaired by Mr Martin Davis, had previously shunned QVC's advances.
This, however, does not clinch the battle. Under the rules drawn up for an
auction of Paramount, both bidders are free to increase their offers for the
company until January 7. Their tenders for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares
will expire at midnight, New York time, on that day. Shareholders remain
free to accept either offer.
Paramount said Viacom was considering raising its offer. Mr Sumner Redstone,
Viacom's chairman, is believed to have been discussing additional financing
with media and communications partners. These include Nynex, the regional
telephone company serving the north-eastern US, and Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video rental chain.
The Paramount board voted unanimously on Wednesday morning to enter a merger
agreement with QVC - a decision which must have been difficult for Mr Davis,
who has a history of personal animosity with Mr Barry Diller, QVC head and a
leading film industry figure.
Under the merger agreement with Viacom, Mr Davis would remain chief
executive of the combined group. If QVC wins, he will almost certainly be
ousted by Mr Diller, who clashed repeatedly with Mr Davis when he headed the
group's Paramount Pictures film business in the 1980s.
However, the board had little choice but to recommend QVC's offer, made
before a Monday night auction dealine, since it was significantly higher
than Viacom's. Directors were under instruction from the Delaware supreme
court to seek the highest value for shareholders.
QVC is offering Dollars 92 in cash for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock,
compared with Dollars 85 from Viacom. Both are offering bundles of
securities for the remaining 49 per cent. QVC's offer for the entire group
is worth around Dollars 10bn, while Viacom's is at some Dollars 9.5bn.
However, since many on Wall Street believe both companies are paying a high
price for Paramount, the perceived winner of the bid on any day is seen by
the market as a loser. This is depressing its share price and the securities
element of its bid. The ultimate winner is likely to be whichever company
puts most cash on the table.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strintzis Lines, Greece's largest private ferry operator, plans to raise
Dr5.7bn (Dollars 23.7m) in what will be the first flotation of a shipping
company on the Athens stock exchange.
The company, which controls an Irish ferry line as well as its Mediterranean
operations, wants to diversify in preparation for deregulation in European
Union coastal shipping at the end of the 1990s.
Strintzis will increase its capital base by 25 per cent, issuing 4.08m new
shares.
The company will use 60 per cent of funds raised to buy a new ferry for its
fleet. The remainder will provide long-term working capital to finance
future expansion, including the acquisition of a high-speed ferry.
Strintzis operates eight medium-size ferries on the Ionian crossing between
Greece and Italy and through the Cyclades islands to Mykonos and Santorini.
The new ship will be used on the Ionian crossing, where Strintzis has
increased its share of truck traffic by 40 per cent in the past year.
Year-round traffic on the Ionian crossing has increased sharply in recent
years.
The company last year acquired Swansea Cork Car Ferries, which operates a
daily crossing between Wales and Ireland, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Strintzis Lines Ireland
Strintzis expects pre-tax profits to total Dr2.5bn for 1993, a 51 per cent
increase on 1992.

FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Suez rescues troubled banking
unit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, is taking full
control of Banque Monod, its troubled banking subsidiary, in a FFr150m
(Dollars 25.9m) financial rescue package.
Banque Monod has, like other French financial institutions, been badly
affected by the crisis in the property market. The bank has incurred heavy
losses in its property financing activities.
Mr Francois Lesieur, deputy chairman, yesterday warned that Banque Monod,
which made a net loss of FFr74m in 1992, had fallen further into the red
this year with a net loss of about FFr200m.
The rescue package involves a capital injection worth FFr150m and the
restructuring of Banque Monod's interests. The banks will withdraw from the
property financing sector and will concentrate on property management and
commercial loans.
Mr Lesieur said he hoped the bank would return to 'an acceptable level of
profitability' in 1994.
As a result of the recapitalisation, Suez, which owns 90 per cent of the
bank, will take full control as Financiere de l'Atlantique, the other
minority shareholder, relinquishes its 10 per cent stake.
Suez has encountered difficulties with its other banking subsidiaries that
are exposed to the problems of the French property market.
Last year, it recapitalised Banque Indosuez, its main banking unit, and this
year has been burdened by the losses of Banque Henin, another subsidiary.

FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: YJ Lovell restructures finances - Pounds
45.8m debt-for-equity swap and placing and open offer for Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YJ Lovell (Holdings), the builder and property developer, has announced a
capital restructuring. The agreement followed negotiations lasting more than
a year with six banks, four building societies and one US lender.
Lovell's creditors have agreed to a Pounds 45.8m debt-to-equity swap and
given the go-ahead for a placing and open offer.
The restructuring, expected to inject Pounds 60.6m into the balance sheet,
will reduce gearing from about 400 per cent to 29.5 per cent.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said without a radical reorganisation the group
'would have gone into orderly liquidation'.
He added that 'less than competent' managers had over-extended the company
in the 1980s. The group has endured three successive years of large pre-tax
losses since 1990.
The group also announced that in the year to September 30 the pre-tax
deficit reached Pounds 60m against a shortfall of Pounds 27m last time,
restated for FRS 3. Lovell blamed the sharp decline on Pounds 55.3m in
property and land write-offs, mostly in the US.
The figures were further depressed by interest charges of Pounds 5m (Pounds
7.71m). Increased borrowing pushed off-balance sheet gearing, the debt
incurred on joint venture business, up to 650 per cent.
Turnover totalled Pounds 221.3m (Pounds 274.8m) of which Pounds 207.8m
(Pounds 244.5m) related to continuing core activities. Losses per share came
out at 71.2p (30.4p) and the final dividend is again omitted.
Hoping to shed some light on the results, Lovell said its core businesses
reported an operating profit of Pounds 368,000 although this was down
sharply on a Pounds 16.2m gain last time.
Faced with few signs of an imminent upturn in the property market, Mr Bob
Sellier, chief executive, said the company would be reducing its US
operations and hinted at UK disposals.
He predicted it would compete more effectively once the capital
restructuring, placing and open offer had been completed.
Under the restructuring, Lovell's principal creditors have agreed to swap
Pounds 45.8m of debt for 45.8m convertible preference shares. The banks will
be able to take ordinary shares at 12 1/2 p once the issue has been fully
completed in two years' time.
Separately, Lovell is placing 316m new ordinary shares at 10p to raise
Pounds 29.7m net of expenses. The open offer has been made on a 19-for-5
basis for existing shareholders.
The company has agreed to reduce the nominal 25p value of existing shares to
1p as part of the capital reorganisation and then consolidate them into 10p
shares. It will also effect a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on
the profit and loss account.
The banks have also agreed to further borrowing of Pounds 37.5m, made up of
a Pounds 25m four year term loan and up to Pounds 12.5m in working capital
facilities.
Once completed the restructuring, open offer and placing will give the banks
and other creditors a 49 per cent stake and new shareholders will control 40
per cent.
After unveiling the restructuring, Mr Hichens said he would 'make way for a
new chairman following the reconstruction of the company's finances'.
Mr Trevor West, finance director since 1989, is to take early retirement.
The shares closed down 1/4 p at 11 1/4p.

<TEXT>
Expamet International, the building, industrial and security components
supplier, has warned of pre-tax losses in the second half of its year to the
end of this month. Its shares fell 11p to 58p.
A deterioration in sales and margins in some of its continental European
activities has necessitated reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.1m, including
Pounds 1.7m of redundancy charges. It will also be making a Pounds 1.8
provision against property holdings.
The company said that excluding the costs, to be taken as exceptional
charges, second half pre-tax profits would be about the same as the first
half's Pounds 1.95m.
Mr John Roberts, chairman, said the annual saving of the redundancies would
be more than Pounds 3m but only about Pounds 1m would benefit the present
year.

Beverley Group, the engineer, has entered an agreement to sell its Gall
Thomson Marine offshoot to Villiers, the USM-traded company formerly known
as Caspen Oil, for up to Pounds 4m in cash and shares.
In October, Beverley agreed to sell the subsidiary to Sealand Industries, a
wholly owned offshoot of VSEL, for Pounds 3.5m. That agreement was rescinded
yesterday with Beverley contributing Pounds 40,000 to Sealand's costs.
In addition to the increased consideration, Beverley, formerly known as
Petrocon, will benefit from the profits generated by Gall Thomson in
November and December which Beverley estimates at about Pounds 125,000.
The sale proceeds represent a surplus over net book value of some Pounds
3.93m and will be used repay borrowings, reduce creditors and improve
gearing.
Beverley is also disposing of Engineering Surveys, a lossmaking surveying
business, a freehold property in Suffolk and its head office building.
Beverley's shares added 3 1/2 p to 8p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothmans International's plans to merge its tobacco interests in Malaysia,
Singapore and Hong Kong into a single regional company have suffered a
setback.
A meeting to seek approval from shareholders in Rothmans Malaysia - 50 per
cent owned by the group - had to be adjourned after one large shareholder
asked for more time to consider the proposals which it fears may dilute its
stake. The meeting was postponed until December 31.
The merger, already unanimously agreed by shareholders in Rothmans
Singapore, requires the approval of 75 per cent of public shareholders in
the Malaysian company.
Rothmans International, which would receive a special dividend of about
Pounds 100m if the merger goes ahead, said the restructuring would
concentrate resources on a more effective exploitation of cigarette markets
in the Pacific Rim.

British Gas has emerged as one of the potential bidders for the Belgian
government's 50 per cent stake in Distrigaz, the monopoly gas transportation
and storage company in the country, writes Robert Corzine.
The company declined to comment on whether it would make a bid, although it
said that it 'was watching the situation very closely.'
The Belgian government's interest in Distrigaz is held through NIM/SNI, the
state holding company which includes businesses ranging from publishing and
television distribution to paper and textiles manufacturing.
It is not clear whether British Gas would be able to bid only for Distrigaz.
Other potential bidders include Tractabel, Bayernwerke of Germany and the
Conoco oil subsidiary of DuPont, the US chemicals company.
Distrigaz operates 3,400 km of pipelines in Belgium and Luxembourg, compared
with the 17,900 km network run by British Gas in the UK.

FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tomkins reassures shareholders over
currency hedging arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the diversified industrial group, has written to its institutional
shareholders and to stockbrokers' analysts describing its policy on currency
swaps. It uses the swaps to hedge the currency risk on its overseas assets.
The group, which has about half its assets outside the UK, mostly in North
America, has met some criticism for using swaps which create off-balance
sheet assets and liabilities.
Some investors fear that Tomkins could be exposed to large 'invisible'
liabilities. They recall that Allied-Lyons, the drinks and food group, lost
Pounds 150m in March 1991 by speculating on the dollar.
Tomkins believes the criticism stems from a misunderstanding of its currency
swaps and the tight management controls it has instituted, which were
lacking in the Allied-Lyons case. It hopes to clear up this misunderstanding
through its letter.
Swaps are set up between two parties wishing to exchange exposures. In a
currency swap one side might have a dollar debt but prefer a sterling
liability. It would swap the exposure with a counterparty with the opposite
aim. When the swap expires the money is swapped back at the new exchange
rate.
Because Tomkins uses such swaps to hedge its assets, if the exchange rate
moves so that it loses on the swap, it will automatically make an equivalent
gain on the assets.
Tomkins' annual reports show the fluctuations in its net assets due to
foreign exchange movements have been minimal. Other companies have suffered
relatively larger falls.
In addition, Tomkins usually receives income from its dollar/sterling swaps,
which amounted to Pounds 10.6m in the year to end-April 1993, which it
discloses each year.
Most companies with subsidiaries overseas match the assets with a similar
amount of debt.
However, Tomkins has always preferred to be ungeared. If it borrowed in
dollars to match its dollar assets it would then have surplus cash to invest
in the UK. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has taken this route and
made money on the interest differential between dollars and sterling.
In its letter Tomkins said it used to follow this policy but found it
'ballooned' both sides of the balance sheet, which Mr Ian Duncan, finance
director, said made the balance sheet unrepresentative of the underlying
business.
Further there is a concern that the US tax authorities are increasingly
unwilling to allow US subsidiaries to offset interest on an abnormal amount
of debt against US profits since this reduces the tax take.
Tomkins said it takes a number of steps to minimise risk. It has a number of
swaps running at any one time, it only deals with counter-parties with
strong credit ratings, the swaps are 'marked to market' every 90 days, and
Tomkins re-evaluates its exposure to each currency to within Pounds 500,000
each month so that it is never significantly over or under-hedged.
Mr Duncan supervises the swaps, and the banks the group deals with are
instructed to check with him before Tomkins' treasury staff can arrange any
unusual deals.

FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cookson pays Pounds 37m for JM's jewellery
arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson Group, the industrial materials group, is reinforcing its presence
in the European precious metals market with the Pounds 37m purchase of
Johnson Matthey's jewellery materials operations.
The move follows rumours that the two companies intended to merge their
precious metals divisions. Mr Richard Oster, Cookson's chief executive, said
speculation had been sparked by negotiations for yesterday's deal.
Cookson will pay Pounds 17m in cash for the operation, based in Dublin and
Birmingham, which sells semi-finished gold, silver and other precious metals
to jewellers, dentists and the electronics and electrical industries. A
further Pounds 20m will be paid for the precious metal.
The business, which had sales of Pounds 44m in the year to March 31, will be
combined with the recently acquired Knight Stern company.
Mr Chris Clark of Johnson Matthey said the proceeds would be used to reduce
debt, which was about Pounds 120m in September. Jewellery materials did not
fit the company's strategy, he said. Nor had it achieved the required 20 per
cent return on net assets.
Mr Oster said Cookson would increase the return by improving efficiency and
bringing technological expertise from its Stern Leach jewellery materials
business in the US. Last year, Cookson had achieved returns there of about
35 per cent on assets.

FT  24 DEC 93 / The essential connection: Mobile phones are still costly,
but many now consider them a necessity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
O reason not the need] Our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
King Lear, going mad, realised that 'need' is relative. But for those beyond
the stage of worrying about food and heat this Christmas, the mobile phone
is fast becoming a basic necessity on a par with the freezer and the
microwave.
With Cellnet, the UK's second-largest mobile phone operator, connecting
almost as many new customers to its network this month as in the whole of
1992, mobile phone sales are increasing exponentially. By new year, the UK's
three operators will have a total of nearly 2m subscribers.
Already the mobile phone is more than a yuppie toy or business accessory.
West Yorkshire Police has lent 75 mobile phones to victims of domestic
violence for use in emergencies; for safety reasons Southwark council in
London equips most of its social workers with mobiles; health authorities
now give them to midwives to speed communication, and have a pool for other
nurses.
'The phones have made a tremendous difference,' said Chief Superintendent
Gary Haigh of West Yorkshire Police. 'The women at risk don't feel as
isolated. They can call us by pressing three digits and we know exactly who
they are even if they can't speak.'
A survey by Ms Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex University, shows
that the image of mobile phone users as swanky businessmen no longer tells
the whole story*. Growth areas include vulnerable groups and blue-collar
workers who deal directly with customers.
Since the launch of the mobile phone in the mid-1980s, self-employed mobile
workers have been prime customers. Next year's north London Yellow Pages
directory of business telephone numbers gives mobile numbers for 30
plumbers, for example - up from 16 this year. 'It's business,' said a
self-employed taxi driver in central London. 'You don't have a mobile, and
you lose jobs to others.'
Now, according to Ms Wood, large companies are also equipping their mobile
staff - such as gas fitters or railway officials - with handsets. 'The
stereotype is being turned upside down. And though the number of
'non-professional' users is still small, the fact that mobile phones are
being seen in the hands of ordinary people is vital to creating a mass
market.'
But however ordinary they become, mobile phone sales will still depend on
price. At the moment, the cost is prohibitive for most people. Mercury
One-2-One, the new cellular network covering the London region, has done
more than any other operator to popularise the mobile phone, with free local
calls in the evening for non-business subscribers. But to get free calls
requires a handset costing at least Pounds 350, a Pounds 23.50 connection
fee, and a Pounds 14.70 monthly subscription - a total of Pounds 550 in the
first year before a single call has been made.
Nevertheless, among the more affluent, attitudes are clearly shifting away
from the idea that a mobile phone is a luxury. The Carphone Warehouse on
London's Marylebone Road has been packed this week with the well heeled,
claiming they had to have a mobile phone to do their job or move about
safely.
'For me it's pretty well essential,' said Mr Nick Saunders, a business
consultant from north London who commutes to Surrey. 'I'm buying one for
myself and one for my partner for Christmas: with the crime rate going up, I
don't like her doing long journeys in the car alone.'
Most of the others in the shop were men, on high salaries, buying mobiles
for Santa to pass on - 'though Christmas is just the excuse for spending the
money now', said an oil broker. One female investment banker was splashing
out on the most expensive phone in the shop (Pounds 400) for her husband's
stocking. 'But I figure I'll get to use it more than him, so it's a bit
self-interested.'
Mr Charles Dunstone, Carphone Warehouse's 28-year-old managing director,
started the business four years ago with Pounds 6,000 and a tiny office. Now
he has 115 employees, owns a mail order business and 17 shops - mostly
opened this year - and is one of Capital Radio's biggest advertisers.
'The yuppie stigma is fading fast,' said Mr Dunstone. 'Since Mercury
One-2-One got going with the free calls, our inquiry lines have been jammed
 -and many of those who think they can't afford one now will be in when the
next round of price cuts takes place.'
The location of Mr Dunstone's other stores in London sums up the state of
the mobile phone market: Harrods, Moorgate, Fleet Street, King's Road,
Watford, Croydon, Staples Corner and Thurrock - the first four in
upper-crust or City locations, the latter four in middle-brow commuting
towns. Across the country, the picture is similar.
In an effort to broaden the market network operators are competing to offer
attractive tariffs for infrequent users. There is room for growth: the 2m
mobile phones in use compares with more than 20m BT lines. Handset prices
are also falling fast: one dealer in Surrey - Sell Phones Direct - is
selling them for 99p, if the customer pays the subscription charges. With a
fourth national network, Microtel, to be launched next year, the price war
will only hot up.
Meanwhile, for those who need the latest and most expensive, a digital
network has been launched by Vodafone, the largest UK operator, which allows
users to make mobile phone calls across Europe. The cost in the first year
of buying and running the phone, before making calls, is about Pounds 850.
One of Mr Dunstone's first customers for the new network was industrialist
Lord Hanson. No doubt he finds it essential.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Mercy's short shelf-life: Political capital and human
suffering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unless you pay particularly close attention to the small print in the
newspapers, you probably won't know who Faruk Catisbusic is.
Seven-year-old Faruk was among the six children and one adult evacuated from
central Bosnia this week for urgent medical treatment in the UK as part of
Operation Angel. He is now in the Midlands Centre for Neurosurgery in
Smethwick, recovering after an operation to remove shrapnel from his brain.
Rather more familiar will be the name of Irma Hadzimuratovic. Irma's
evacuation from Sarajevo became the subject of fleeting worldwide interest
in August after Mr John Major, UK prime minister, intervened to offer the
gravely injured girl a hospital bed in Britain.
Mr Major's intervention sparked a much bigger evacuation drive, dubbed
Operation Irma, to airlift people needing medical treatment from Bosnia to
the UK, Sweden, Ireland, the US and several other European and Islamic
countries.
Newspapers devoted their pages to reports on the plight of children and
other non-combatants in the former Yugoslav republic. TV and radio news
bulletins led on little else for much of the week.
Yet this week's Operation Angel evacuation has received only cursory
coverage in the UK media. The tabloid newspapers have given at least as much
space to the video link-up between British soldiers in the former Yugoslavia
and their families at home.
The contrast between the two evacuation operations could hardly be more
striking. The first came in the middle of what is known as the 'the silly
season'. With most politicians and many newspaper readers on holiday, there
is often little of substance to report in August. A human interest story can
attract much more attention than at busier periods of the year.
So it was with the case of 'little Irma', as the wounded child became known.
The five-year-old had suffered head, stomach and spinal injuries at the end
of July in a random mortar attack by the Bosnian Serb army laying siege to
Sarajevo. Her mother had been killed, and Irma seemed unlikely to recover
from her injuries in primitive hospital conditions.
The main stumbling block to her evacuation was the shortage of hospital beds
available in other countries. Between April and August, only 90 people were
evacuated from Bosnia on medical grounds.
But a Sunday evening news report of Irma's plight on BBC television began to
open doors. As calls poured into Downing Street, Mr Major ordered an RAF
Hercules to bring back Irma, her father and sister. By Monday evening, Irma
was in London's Great Ormond Street children's hospital, undergoing a
three-hour operation.
With a further 20 refugees on their way to Britain, the prime minister's
intervention was followed by other countries. More than 2,000 hospital beds
have since been offered in more than 20 countries. Ms Sylvana Foa of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says that the change in
attitudes after 16 months of indifference from western countries was like
'day following night'.
But Irma and the 41 other evacuees flown out that week were not the only
people to benefit. For Mr Major, Operation Irma marked a turning point in a
year when good news had been in short supply.
The exit of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, the battle
to ratify the Maastricht treaty, the slow economic recovery, and hefty tax
increases announced in the spring Budget had culminated in two Tory
by-election defeats in the formerly safe seats of Newbury and Christchurch.
The prime minister could now bathe in the approbation of those who welcomed
the lead he had given through this humanitarian gesture.
The goodwill generated by Mr Major's intervention on behalf of the Bosnian
refugees was, however, dented after it was reported that Downing Street was
unhappy with the preponderance of adults in the airlift. To the UNHCR's Ms
Foa, it appeared that Mr Major wanted to see photogenic children rather than
the adults who made up the bulk of those needing evacuation. She accused
Britain of using Sarajevo as a 'supermarket'.
Further criticism followed about the preference of western governments for
high-profile evacuations of sick children over more basic, cost-effective
aid to those treating the injured on the ground. Even the families of the
evacuees called for international military action to stop the fighting which
caused the suffering, rather than palliative rescue missions.
Four months on, the plight of the people of Bosnia no longer catches the
attention of the public or the media. Christmas has its own silly season,
but it tends to focus on domestic concerns. Charities can raise money for
the homeless in Britain, but know that it is a bad time to involve the
public in suffering in far-off countries.
The success of the rock singer Bob Geldof's 'Do they know it's Christmas',
the Band Aid record that raised Pounds 8m for Ethiopian famine victims in
1984, was the exception that proved the rule.
Most of the politicians who jumped on the bandwagon of Operation Irma now
want Bosnia's government to accept the settlement brokered by Lord Owen and
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. Mr Major, over the
worst of his troubles, looks instead to peace in Northern Ireland - a much
greater prize in UK political terms.
As for Irma Hadzimuratovic, she remains in intensive care on a ventilator in
Great Ormond Street hospital. Like Faruk Catisbusic and the 400 other
evacuees brought out of Bosnia since August, Irma is the beneficiary of
intense media interest in individual suffering. But thousands more are
stranded in the middle of a civil war which shows no sign of an early end.

<TEXT>
Sir, The leased territories in Hong Kong must be returned to the landlord,
the People's Republic of China. If Britain feels morally responsible for the
sub-tenants, the people of Hong Kong, then it should provide another place
of abode for those of them who do not wish to live directly under the rules
laid down by the landlord.
Any other action is an admission of flawed moral perceptions.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Iain Saville (Letters, December 17) misses the point in his reply to
Mr J D Whittle (Letters, December 11/12) with regard to the impact of the
proposed Crest share settlement system.
Most of us would welcome the chance to get rid of all those bits of paper
that are processed in the City and at registrars, provided that our rights
as shareholders were safeguarded. We are now being asked to surrender these
rights or pay extra, and have to keep certificates as well.
Crest is protecting the position of redundant registrars and operators of
nominee accounts at the expense of private shareholders. Why?

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Michael Thompson Noel suggests to French people that 'they must
ditch their dead language'. The contents of his feature ('English yes,
French non', December 18/19), which can be quoted as a model of jingoism, is
so witty that his portrait shows him to be laughing at his own jokes.
Mr Thompson Noel (should I say Mr Thompson Christmas?) is outraged by French
drivers being unable to understand his gracious insults.
A 'large yellow Citroen' (ask Mr Stuart Marshall, your excellent motoring
correspondent, if he has ever seen a lot of this type and colour) nearly
touched his Rover, 'a noble and lineal descendant of the Spitfire aircraft'.
Maybe he was keeping to the left side of the road as a proud Englishman
should do everywhere. Anyway, it is a pity that the Parisian driver could
not appreciate it. He would certainly have replied in the language of
Shakespeare and Mickey Mouse that he would have believed that Rover was now
merely a subsidiary of Honda.
Mr Thompson Christmas is absolutely correct as regards speaking foreign
dialects. Some stupid natives are entrenched in the belief that English is
not the only key to a civilised world.
Why didn't Fellini realise that 'Such a Good Life' instead of 'La Dolce
Vita' would have earned many dollars more? Why do Frenchmen prefer their own
way of cooking instead of a 'leg of lamb in mint sauce'? And why doesn't the
Parthenon stand in Marble Arch?
So 'cultural identity' is farcical and 'Nobody on the planet . . . likes the
French'. As a Frenchman (nobody is perfect), I apologise for our arrogance
and rudeness and I am very grateful to your writer to have taught me some
English.
I was looking for the translation of what is said in the Bible about 'la
paille et la poutre'. My Collins dictionary tells me 'It's the pot calling
the kettle black . . .'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUCE V JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your choice of cock-fighting for an article was disturbing ('A life of
sex, food and fighting', December 18). It gave a favourable, even
enthusiastic, description of the 'sport'.
If your writer had expressed misgivings, or attempted to explain why such
practices are banned in civilised countries, there might have been some
mitigating circumstance. To describe death in 30 seconds as lacking in
cruelty and comparable with a commercial poultry operation, shows a serious
lack, or deliberate denial, of knowledge of both physiology and the poultry
industry.
Apart from the fact that death is not always instantaneous, additional
pre-fight preparation by live plucking of leg feathers and other niceties
were overlooked. The issue is not only that of needless cruelty to a
sentient being, but the consequent brutalising of the participating
audience, including, I suggest, your writer.
The UK has a much respected image for its positive attitudes to animal
welfare. Your author does nothing to strengthen this perception and can only
tend to make it difficult for those of us who work in the international
livestock and animal health markets.

a 21st-century working mother fell through a time warp into the hands of the

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I've finished my Christmas shopping at last. It's taken me hours, but Harry,
my personal assistant, came up with some really great ideas. He took me 'net
surfing' around the world's shopping malls to find just the right thing for
everyone on my list.
I even found the perfect gift for my brother, Francis, the 'young man who
has everything'. We found a store in Tokyo selling a brand new line of
calendars that automatically adjust to local time zones. I'm sure he will
like it because as a network bandwidth broker - selling time on worldwide
digital communications networks - he spends much of his day in international
video meetings.
I asked the store to design the calendar with some original sports graphics.
I'm really looking forward to seeing the look on Francis's face, Christmas
morning, when he logs on to the network and finds the calendar has been
downloaded on to his personal organiser.
For my husband I ordered You're the 49er Quarterback, an interactive fantasy
game. My daughter, Beth, 16, will get a driving simulator and a new pocket
video phone. My 14-year-old son wanted a virtual girlfriend. I'm not sure
that I approve, but better that than the human variety, I suppose. Perhaps a
subscription to Starnet, the latest science fiction network, would keep his
mind on galactic travel.
Jessie, 8, my younger daughter, has asked Santa for a 'walking, talking
Barbie' with long blonde hair, like her own. Harry had to scour the country
to find one. It is the hit toy of the year and most stores have sold out.
I also bought a new kitchen control unit for my parents. They still use a
portable personal computer to programme their kitchen and it is so much
nicer to have a built-in model.
The whole family - my parents in Cheshire, my brothers and their wives and
children in various parts of the UK and my sister, who is working on a big
computerised library project in Spain - will all be gathering 'virtually'
for Christmas dinner, via video links. Harry arranged the whole thing for me
via DinersNet. We chose the traditional holiday package: turkey and all the
trimmings. The food will be delivered to our homes on Christmas eve. Harry
has E-mailed the cooking instructions to everyone's chief assistants so that
their kitchens will be pre-programmed.
As a surprise I arranged for live Christmas trees to be delivered along with
the food. These days most people have hologram trees, but to me there is
nothing quite like the real thing, even if it does mean cleaning up pine
needles.
We booked the video links months in advance. It is still expensive, but the
price is coming down by the month. In any case, I wanted to put our new
'life size' displays to use. We just had them installed in the dining room,
so we will literally be surrounded by family members for Christmas dinner.
This will be the first Christmas that we have all been together for years.
No doubt there will be a lot of reminiscing. Mum is sure to bring out her
collection of old family photographs. Her grandchildren have a hard time
believing that we used to snap pictures with little hand-held cameras and
then take the film to a photograph developer, waiting for hours or days to
get back a set of prints.
These days it's all digital imaging. We can play back Christmas dinner over
and over if we choose, or capture a special moment and record it on a
wallet-sized smartcard that plugs into any display terminal.
The youngsters have no idea what we used to go through getting ready for
Christmas; fighting the traffic and traipsing through shopping malls to buy
presents and then spending most of Christmas day in the kitchen fretting
over the turkey.
The information highway changed all that. By the mid-1990s TV shopping was
already very popular. Then electronic catalogues stored on computer discs
became all the rage. Now you can access almost any shop on the planet and
arrange for express delivery of goods. It makes life so much easier.
But I would be lost without Harry. He's my right-hand man, my network guide;
a sort of Jeeves character, like a family butler. I designed his personality
myself, choosing attributes from an electronic directory. His facial image
was created automatically to match. They say that the personality of your
digital assistant tells a lot about your own character.
I'm rather old-fashioned. For example, I still like to read newspapers
printed on paper. That is considered rather eccentric these days. Of course,
I also have my multi-media text, graphics and video 'personal news-source'
downloaded to my office screen every morning, with news that relates to my
business. But I enjoy flicking through the pink pages, just for old times'
sake. Besides, even the best news assistants don't always pick out
everything that might interest you.
For instance there was a ghastly story in yesterday's paper about a virus,
called Homewrecker. It got into somebody's home and caused havoc with the
environmental controls. The heating system blew up, the refrigerator
defrosted and water pipes burst. It is hard to believe that the security
sensors would not have picked something up, but I imagine they must have
been disabled by the virus. I must ask Harry to run an extra virus scan on
our home network.
So much for the wonders of home automation. Harry says I shouldn't read
'paper news' because it always stresses the negative aspects of the
'information age'. Of course, he would say that. He's digital.
I'm not one of those 'anti-tech' types, but I do have some reservations. I'm
not convinced that information technology is always good for the
environment. Electronic communications have vastly reduced the use of paper,
but the average consumption of electricity, per household, is climbing. And
with the paper industry in decline, there is little incentive for companies
to maintain the forests they used to harvest. The ecological impact of
technology is becoming very complex.
On the other hand, there is no doubt the information superhighway has
created new opportunities. My daughter is studying at an on-line university
and I am taking courses in multi-media production.
The biggest change, however, has been in our home life. Now we all work at
home, telecommuting to our jobs. We've been able to cut back from three cars
to one, but the savings have gone into financing an extension to the house
for our offices.
Some people find it hard to adapt to being 'homebound'. It doesn't help that
land travel is becoming so expensive. We can visit distant cities
electronically at a touch of the screen, but transporting your body has
become a real luxury.
Personally, I don't miss those supersonic flights. I always felt disoriented
when landing in a foreign country and the jet lag was awful. These days I
like to take the occasional 'virtual vacation' right here in my living room.
Last month I took a trip on HawaiiNet. I just put on my swimsuit and basked
in the sights, sounds and aromas of white sands and swaying palm trees. You
can't beat it.
Enough of this dreaming. I must get back to writing Christmas cards. I send
them on MailNet, which only takes a few seconds, but I like to write a
personal greeting on each one.
Then we are off to see Santa Claus. Even he is electronic now. The children
would never miss seeing Santa's reindeer pulling his sleigh through the sky
on Christmas eve. The image is created with high-power lights reflected on a
simulated cloud, but we try to keep that a secret. Not for much longer in
this family, I fear. Yesterday, my daughter Jessie asked me if Santa Claus
is 'virtual'. What could I say?

FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Equity scheme balances interests in
insolvencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIPPE AGHION, Mr OLIVER HART and Mr JOHN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent consultative document published by the Department of Trade
and Industry's insolvency service has raised the general question of how
best to rescue financially distressed companies. While we welcome the idea
of improving the rules governing administration and company voluntary
arrangements, we think there is a fundamental problem with current
procedures that no amount of tinkering will solve.
Current procedures mix the decision of what should happen to an insolvent
company with the decision of who should get what. This creates conflicts of
interest. Senior/ secured creditors typically favour early liquidation,
since they bear most of the costs from trying to reorganise the company, but
enjoy few of the gains. Conversely, junior creditors typically push for
reorganisation as they get little from liquidation. This conflict of
interest makes it difficult to agree on a rescue plan. As a result, good
companies can be needlessly shut down and some bad companies may be allowed
to struggle on for too long.
There is a way to avoid conflict among creditors. In an appendix of the DTI
document, we propose a scheme whereby debt claims are converted into equity.
The decision about whether to reorganise or liquidate is then put to a vote.
The merit of our scheme is that all claimants, now that they are
shareholders, have a common interest in voting for the efficient outcome.
We urge the government and interested parties to think more adventurously
about the reform of insolvency law. We believe our scheme is practical,
cheap, and strikes the right balance between rescuing good firms and weeding
out bad ones.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cry of pain and hurt pride echoing from the Russian elections and the
continuing conflict in Bosnia are reminders of the wrenching nature of the
changes which have accompanied the end of the cold war. But four years after
the summary execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator, which
marked the bloody end of an extraordinary year, the overall balance sheet
remains positive, by a large margin.
Even the strong electoral showing of Vladimir Zhirinovsky should be seen in
context. The Russian people, in all their diversity, were given their first
opportunity to express themselves freely in a multi-party, multi-candidate
election. The fact that so many expressed anger and frustration after a
75-year totalitarian nightmare and eight years of painful and disorientating
disruption, without any relief in sight, is hardly surprising.
The important thing is that Russians, for the first time, now have a legal,
constitutional and peaceful way of expressing their views. This is a step
forward of incalculable importance for a country where so often in the past
repressed popular discontent has found violent issue through the pogrom and
the blind savagery of the mob. That said, neither Russians nor the west can
be complacent when contemplating what needs to be done to help Russia and
the other former Soviet states chart a course for a democratic and
prosperous future.
Communist wreck
Western governments and policymakers would be well advised to listen more
carefully to the suggestions emanating from those central and east European
states which were militarily occupied subject nations of the late and
unlamented Soviet empire only four years ago. The largely inexperienced but
courageous people who emerged from the wreckage of communism to take up the
challenge of rebuilding their distorted economies and humiliated civil
societies have gained much experience in a short time. They started with an
invaluable insight into the working of the Soviet system and have picked up
with impressive speed the skills and know-how required to run the infinitely
more complex structures of a modern, law-based and market-oriented
capitalist society.
What their experience shows is that the necessary structural changes cannot
be accomplished without a period of ultimately creative destruction. A large
part of any Soviet-style economy, characterised by outsized monopoly
producers, grotesquely bloated military industries, primitive banks and
under-developed services of all kinds, simply has to be demolished, or
drastically cut down in size. This inevitably brings with it a period of
rapidly rising, and potentially socially destabilising, unemployment.
Harsh realities
Four years after facing up to this harsh reality, 'fast track' reforming
states such as Poland, Hungary and Slovenia have unemployment levels up to
15 per cent of the workforce. The Czechs, with low inherited debt, a
stronger industrial base and smart political leadership, have managed to
prepare for resumed growth without either high inflation or high
unemployment. Meanwhile, Poland has become the fastest growing economy in
Europe, and all the central European states, with the probable exception of
Slovakia, will be producing and exporting more in 1994.
All have managed the painful return to economic growth while holding
multi-party elections and forming functioning parliamentary governments. In
September Poland even witnessed a remarkably smooth return to power of
parties with their roots in the communist past after free and fair
elections.
Central Europe's experience is instructive for Russia, Ukraine and other
former Soviet states where the military-industrial complex is so much bigger
and structural change has hardly begun. It should also forewarn western
policymakers that their top priority must be to focus on the overwhelming
need to help set up and partially finance an unemployment insurance and
retraining safety net for the inevitable casualties of structural reform.
Otherwise Russia could fall into anarchy, which would put at risk all the
gains made over the past four years by post-communist Europe.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Capitalism at Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world is about to celebrate the most capitalist Christmas in history.
Never in 2,000 years has the doctrine of the free market spread so widely
across the globe. Communism has been buried, socialism is in deep retreat,
and even the hardiest proponents of social democracy are beset by doubt.
Adam Smith has vanquished Marx, immobilised Keynes, and turned many thoughts
away from Jesus. As to the latter, it may be remarked that while capitalism
is by no means incompatible with Christianity, the growth of individualism
has been accompanied by a decline in attendance at church. Just as religion
is on the defensive, so also democracy and political pluralism, two
important doctrines associated with capitalism, are being taken up with less
enthusiasm, and in fewer countries, than the system of wealth creation that
is now everywhere regarded as the most effective that humanity has yet
devised.
No known alternative stands ready for the choosing. The present strength of
free enterprise is derived in part from the influence over the past 40 years
of the Gatt regime, which liberalised trade and unleashed the power of free
markets everywhere. The former Soviet polity, so recently a global threat,
simply collapsed under the spectacle of such awesome competition. Christmas
1993 follows hard on the heels of new trade accords, which set up a
successor to Gatt, and moved trade liberalisation to a higher gear. The
result of the successful completion of the Uruguay Round is likely to be an
acceleration of production, a greater accumulation of man-made assets, and
an entrenchment of the market as the dominant economic force on the face of
the planet.
Imperfect force
It remains, however, an imperfect force. Even the middle classes, who have
benefited most from economic growth, are wrestling with unease. Those in
jobs fear that they may lose what they have, while those outside note that
however rich the super-rich may get, large-scale unemployment persists.
Lower down the income scale the picture is far worse. The 1980s created
losers as well as winners, as can be seen on the pavements of cities across
Europe and the US. In many cases the poor have become poorer, relatively in
some countries, absolutely in others. About two-thirds of the world's
population have gained little or no substantial advantage from rapid
economic growth. In the developed world, the lowest quartile of income
earners has witnessed trickle-up rather than trickle-down.
Rapid changes
The temptation is to respond by calling for a return to some of the
comfortable 'certainties' of the past. That would be a mistake. The poor
existed under communism, and do even in Europe's most advanced social
democracies. The world is changing rapidly; the Atlantic nations in general
and Europe in particular face competition from the younger, harsher, more
robust capitalism of south Asia. If welfare capitalism is to be sustained,
its managers must find new means of controlling its cost, and minimising the
cost to employers. Radical policies, centred around the notion of giving the
poor a hand-up rather than a hand-out, must be pursued.
There will always be clumsy starts, as with Britain's Child Support Agency,
which pursues absent fathers for maintenance payments. Such initial
difficulties should not deter politicians and economists from seeking to
ensure that the fruits of capitalism do indeed reach the lower quarter of
western society, as well as the global two-thirds. The evident need is to
find new structures that provide accountability, transparency, choice and
genuine care for those who cannot manage for themselves. New methods have to
be devised at a cost that is not so high that the productive strength of the
rest of the economy is drained away. This is easier said than done.
Christmas is a time when sentimentality may be guiltlessly enjoyed. But the
true spirit of the festival requires that those who desire an economic
success built upon something other than foundations of much misery and
deprivation engage in the search for policies which are both hard-headed and
ethical. Human economic history has not ended with the triumph of the free
market. It has hardly begun.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Making money out of Mao: The 100th anniversary of the birth
of Mao Zedong is the stuff of fairy tales and commercialism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One by one the great Maoist shrines have fallen, not to angry mobs bent on
casting out the devils of the past, but to the power of money.
In this 100th anniversary year of the birth of Mao Zedong - he was born on
December 26 - a visitor to his birthplace, to his revolutionary strongholds,
and to the commune that came to symbolise his most erratic phase would find
that celebrations have less to do with the past than they do with cashing in
on the present.
Seventeen years after Mao's death, in September 1976, which ended a decade
of torment known as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, his centenary
has been transformed into a fantasia, even though official celebrations are
lukewarm.
China's reformists seek to draw sustenance from association with this deeply
flawed icon of the revolution without attracting attention to the stark
differences between Mao's policies and their own.
The history of the post-1956 period, during which disaster piled upon
disaster, has become a black hole. Pictorial essays, photographic
exhibitions, biographical material shudder to a halt from the mid-1950s,
before the 'anti-rightist' persecutions of 1957, the catastrophic 'Great
Leap Forward' of 1958 and the madness of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
But these episodes, beyond revision of even the most creative of party
chroniclers, have been put aside for the moment. The anniversary makes 1993
a good news year for the party and for Mao. Thus Mao's place in the
firmament is the stuff of fairy tales and commercialism.
Like tawdry Christian relics, Mao memorabilia, ranging from jewel-encrusted
gold watches with the Great Helmsman's face on the dial, to cigarette
lighters playing the Maoist hymn The East is Red, are being foisted on an
eager public.
It is not the least of paradoxes that in death the man who railed against
money as the root of all evil has spawned one of the greatest cottage
industries of all time. Traffic in 'Maobilia' this year is certain to yield
tens of millions of dollars to China's new-rich entrepreneurs.
At Shaoshan village in the green hills of southern China's Hunan province
where Mao was born, the rebellious son of a well-to-do peasant grain dealer
and money-lender, an oriental Jerusalem has emerged complete with rows of
stalls selling trinkets. The only god is mammon.
In the Yanan redoubt of northern China where the communists took refuge at
the end of the epic Long March of 1935-36, townspeople go about their
business without much regard, it seems, for Mao's teachings. Karaoke bars,
whose synthetic repertoires include an up-tempo version of The East is Red,
mock the austere 'spirit of Yanan'.
Several hundred kilometres to the east at the Dazhai commune, singled out by
Mao in 1964 as a model for a communist utopia, the survivors of the zealotry
that enveloped this rural hamlet during the Cultural Revolution are quietly
getting on with implementing Mr Deng Xiaoping's 'capitalist-style' reforms.
Members of the younger generation are becoming factory hands in a garment
plant, or workers in a joint venture cement works, or miners in the local
coalmine. Unlike their poor fathers who scrabbled in terraced fields to
survive, the sons and daughters of Dazhai equip their wedding nests with
stereophonic sound systems, refrigerators and TVs.
On walls around this village of 500 people, faint outlines of Maoist
Cultural Revolution slogans survive. But superimposed are the bold
exhortations of the Deng era.
Archaeologists of future generations may well track the twists and turns of
20th century China by studying wall slogans piled upon each other, and be
confused by the apparent sudden shift from Mao's emphasis on
collectivisation to Dengist free-market economic policy.
They might also wonder why this tiny settlement in the barren hills of
Shanxi province required a hotel with a dining room capable of seating 800
people. These days, this vast room stands virtually empty, an echo chamber
to past excesses when tens of thousands of cadres, including Mr Deng
himself, were trucked in to 'learn from Dazhai'.
Dazhai's small picture exhibition celebrating its revolutionary past
includes not only photographs of such visitors as Pol Pot and Mr Lee Kuan
Yew of Singapore, but also one of Deng Xiaoping, taken during his
rehabilitation in 1973 before he was purged for a second time during the
Cultural Revolution.
The expression frozen on Mr Deng's face in black and white is one of deep
scepticism. If a picture can be more revealing than words themselves, it
seems that China's future leader was saying that hysteria surrounding the
'learn from Dazhai' campaign was the last thing China needed if it was to be
transformed into a modern state.
Madam Guo, Dazhai's party secretary who gained prominence in the 1960s as
the photogenic leader of the 'Iron Girl Squad' of peasant workers, appears
uncomfortable when conversation turns to the past. Not only were the
commune's production figures exaggerated, but its former headman became a
tame mascot of the revolution, used by the Maoists as a theatrical prop in
remorseless ideological campaigns.
'We started walking forward a bit late because we carried a huge ideological
burden,' she says. 'Now we want to travel light . . . it's been a very
stressful transformation.'
But like government officials the length and breadth of China, Madam Guo was
not about to forsake the party catechism. 'I was a worshipper of Mao, I
respected him very much,' she declares. 'He was a great man.' This latter
observation is the one that drops, like a mantra, most readily from official
lips in this year of 'Good Mao'.
When asked whether Mao, like other towering figures of history, was deeply
flawed, she says: 'We are all deeply flawed . . . after all, he was human.
There is no perfect human being on earth. He was a man not a god.' One
wondered whether such blasphemy might have been possible while the Great
Helmsman was still alive.
In Yanan, some six hours' drive north of Xian, China's ancient capital,
Mao's compound and those of his senior comrades from the 1930s and 1940s are
deserted. Snow lies on the ground and it is bitterly cold, a reminder of the
hardships that were endured during the more than decade-long Yanan period.
It was in their simple cave dwellings, cut into the hills of northern China,
that Maoist ideology was tempered in long days and nights of debate and
discussion. This is where Mao spent more than a decade sheltering from the
nationalists. There was scarcely a more important period in the history of
the Chinese Communist party.
During this time, Mao consolidated his hold on the party, directed Red Army
military operations in a series of stunning victories across China, and
married a saucy young actress from Shanghai named Jiang Qing.
And yet, curiously, in the quarter of a century between 1949 and his death
in 1976, Mao did not return to the place where he had spent more than a
decade sheltering from the nationalists. It was almost as if he wished to
avoid the memories, and perhaps even the ghosts of former close
comrades-in-arms who served with him in happier days.
At Yanan's museum of revolutionary history, one of China's most complete
pictorial records of the early stages of the communist struggle, many of the
smiling revolutionary heroes pictured standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mao
eventually became his victims, either before or during the Cultural
Revolution.
Some, like Liu Shaoqi, the former president, Peng Dehuai, former defence
minister, and He Long, the revolutionary warrior, died miserable deaths
after being persecuted by young revolutionaries unleashed by Mao and his
supporters. Even Zhu De, the brilliant Red Army commander, suffered
persecution and died virtually ignored in July 1976, just two months before
Mao passed away.
There was hardly one of Mao's intimate circle in the Yanan period, including
Zhou Enlai, who went on to be foreign minister and premier, and Deng
Xiaoping, who emerged unscathed in the post-revolution era.
Not one of those pictured in the Yanan gallery, with the possible exception
of Kang Sheng, could possibly have predicted that the glorious victory in
1949 would have produced the nightmare of the decades 1956-1976. The shadowy
Kang became Mao's secret police chief and evil genius behind the mass
campaigns and persecutions of the Cultural Revolution.
At Yanan university, like countless institutions across China, the
department of political science has been evaluating Mao's contribution to
Chinese history. The results of these judgments have followed a predictable
course, adhering to the party's own assessment made in the early 1980s that
the chairman had made 'mistakes', but on the whole his contribution to the
revolution far outweighed those errors.
Mr Feng, director of Yanan's political science faculty, perhaps came as
close as any Chinese official might to an admission that more time was
needed before an unexpurgated version of Mao's life and works might be
possible. 'The time is not ripe yet for a complete assessment,' he said. 'He
was a very complicated man and revolutionary.'
His colleague, Mr Li Xin Chang, added: 'All in all Mao made quite a few
serious mistakes. He was a successful leader in wartime, but he was not so
successful in peacetime.' There would appear to be ample scope for future
Chinese historians.
In Beijing, the custodians of the Central Party Archives have been churning
out Mao literature to mark the centenary, while studiously avoiding
controversy. Five books have been published, including a compendium of his
Selected Works drawn from Volumes 1-4 dealing with the (safe) pre-1949
period; a digest of his military speeches; a non-controversial biography of
the 1893-1949 era; an idealised pictorial essay; and a sugary tribute from
former associates, including his bodyguards.
Likewise, Mao's speeches captured on tapes and laser discs and distributed
in their thousands to mark the anniversary do not trespass beyond the 'Great
Wall of Silence' of 1956. This was the year before the 'Hundred Flowers
Campaign' of 1957, which led to the anti-rightist purges and disastrous
'Great Leap Forward' in economic policy, which left in its wake terrible
famine and hardship.
Mr Wang Yuyao, head of the Mao Zedong Research Group at the Central Party
Archives, was hazy about when there might be further volumes of Mao's works
covering the period after 1957 to his death in 1976, saying merely that an
enormous amount of preparation was required.
But the last entry in volume five of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong
(published in 1977), by recalling his famous statement that 'all
reactionaries are paper tigers', shows that much of his thinking was not as
prescient as his followers liked to believe. 'US imperialism has not yet
been overthrown and it has the atom bomb, but I believe it too is a paper
tiger and will be overthrown,' Mao wrote in November 1957. Unlike
Nostradamus, Mao was not in the habit of saying when his predictions might
come true.
Mr Wang made no attempt to disguise his organisation's mission in this 'good
news year' of the Mao centenary. 'We want to make the best use of Mao's good
thoughts,' he declared. 'Psychologically speaking, the masses would rather
think of Mao in a positive way for the good things he has done for the
people.'

FT  24 DEC 93 / Letter from Cairo: Fragile harmony when shouting stops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Christmas morning lull is inconceivable in the teeming chaos of Imbaba,
the poor Cairo suburb which in the past two years has become a byword for
militant Islamic fundamentalism. The morning will pass with the same
incessant hubbub of daily life as any other.
Indeed, it is hard to conceive of anyone enjoying a peaceful Christmas or
anything else in Imbaba, where the few klaxoning cars which manage to
negotiate its narrow, mud-caked streets - through the ditches, the donkey
carts, the street-vendors, the mounds of rubbish and hundreds of scampering
children - are barely audible above the din of people going about their
business.
But the few Coptic Christians whose homes and shops are scattered throughout
what one Islamic militant leader last year declared the 'Islamic state' of
Imbaba believe that this Christmas will, at least, be more secure than last.
'It is much better than it was, the harassment has decreased,' says Sabri, a
23-year-old Copt who sells spitroast chicken from a spartan grill on Luxor
Street. 'The people who used to insult us have been arrested - there are no
more left.'
Across the road from his cafe more than 200 Christians gather in the simple
Church of Jesus, men and women sitting apart in the undecorated church. It
is adorned only with three neon-lit crosses above the altar, a few ceiling
fans and some dusty but incongruously ornate chandeliers. The priest
implores the faithful to raise their eyes from their poor lot and 'work not
for this life, but the next'. At the back, a uniformed security guard keeps
vigil. State security agents materialise instantly from the crowds outside
to try to deflect the curiosity of this visiting jour-nalist.
It is such watchful eyes which will assure a safe Christmas, says Sabri.
'This year we will celebrate Christmas and new year properly,' he continues.
'I feel we can this time. Last year the ones with beards stood outside the
church - there was no feeling of festivity.'
The 'ones with beards' are the militant Islamic fundamentalists who lent
Imbaba its notoriety as they began to tighten their grip on the million
people who live in the suburb's warren of bare-brick apartments and filthy
streets. Preaching an absolutist Islam and a violent defiance of Egypt's
secular government, these young men attacked 'un-Islamic' video shops and
hairdressing salons, rounded on Moslems who drank alcohol and forced women
who were not already doing so to don the veil. 'Islamic law is being applied
in Imbaba,' one self-proclaimed young 'emir' said at the time, 'and, God
willing, it will be applied to all of Egypt.'
Up to a year ago, the militants were also harassing Imbaba's few Christians.
Nobody was physically assaulted, says Sabri, but the threatening attention
disturbed the otherwise calm coexistence of the two great faiths in the
suburb. It was a peace, tinged perhaps with suspicion but only rare
violence, which has characterised Coptic-Islamic relations in Egypt since
Islam arrived from the Arabian Peninsula in the 17th century and quickly won
predominance over the Coptic (which means Egyptian) Church, founded by St
Mark in 41AD.
But the surge of Islamic fundamentalism over the past two years, one rooted
in growing poverty and disaffection with the government, began to poison
social relations in Imbaba and elsewhere. Sabri recalls how, every Tuesday
night, militants would gather outside the Church of Jesus. Some would
brandish swords and knives, others would chant 'kill the infidels'. One
night they tried unsuccessfully to torch the church.
Anis, a 50-year-old Copt whose tiny tailor shop also sits across Luxor
Street from the Church of Jesus, says he feared an explosion of
anti-Christian feeling. 'I felt that everyone, all the young unemployed men
here, would join them. If the government hadn't come in, I don't know what
would have happened.'
But the government did come in - mainly in an attempt to crush the cells of
Islamic extremists it believed were using the central Cairo district as a
base from which to launch bombings and shootings. Goaded by claims that
Imbaba had become an Islamic state-within-a-state, the government one night
in December last year flooded Imbaba with 14,000 armed troops and hauled off
600 alleged ringleaders.
More arrests followed throughout January and February. The government then
signalled its resolve to smash the extremists in March by launching a series
of bloody raids on alleged extremist hide-outs, shooting 14 people dead in
their homes. Since then, says Anis, the harassment has ceased. Gangs no
longer gather to glower threateningly at the icon of Christ which adorns his
shopfront. He no longer has to wash off black paint daubed over the holy
image.
Life, he says, has resumed its normal flow. But Anis does not speak
comfortingly of the future. 'If the government keeps a grip on things, then
we can continue to live together,' he says. 'If not, then no.'
The government's priority, he says, is to conquer militant fundamentalism,
not to protect Christians. 'Look at what is happening in Upper Egypt,' he
adds. He is referring to clashes between militants and Copts in the villages
around the Islamic strongholds of Dairut and Assiut. These flared into
bloody clashes 20 months ago which eventually subsided. But sporadic
killings continue and at least a dozen Copts have been slain in Upper Egypt
in the past two months. 'The government just lets things go - the extremists
kill Christians there, but they do nothing to protect them,' Anis says.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Strong demand pushes car output up 9.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK car production increased by 9.9 per cent year-on-year in November, as
output for the domestic market rose strongly and offset the decline in
production for export markets.
Both car output and new-car sales are forecast to achieve further growth
next year, with increases of 7 per cent and 6 per cent.
Car production in the first 11 months of the year was 1,288,594 - 7.7 per
cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1992 and in contrast to the
steep fall in output in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
Car output for export markets has fallen by 6.4 per cent in the first 11
months of this year to 500,817, but this has been compensated for by a 19.1
per cent surge in production for the home market to 787,777.
The UK has been virtually the only new-car market in western Europe where
demand has been growing significantly this year.
New-car sales in Britain in the first 11 months rose by 12.6 per cent in
contrast to an overall fall of nearly 15 per cent in the whole of western
Europe.
According to forecasts by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders UK
car production will rise again next year by about 7 per cent to 1.46m from
1.36m this year. Sales of new cars are forecast to rise by about 6 per cent
to 1.86m from 1.77m in 1993.
Car production in November totalled 128,401 compared with 116,799 a year
ago, according to figures released by the society.
Output for the home market in November rose by 77 per cent to 76,841, while
production for export markets fell by 30 per cent to 51,560.
Car output in the month was boosted by rising production from the Rover
group, Jaguar and IBC Vehicles and increased production and from the UK
plants of Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda.
The improvement has been helped by the UK industry's leading presence in the
production of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles. The leading
producers in this sector are Land Rover, part of the Rover group, and IBC
Vehicles, a 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu which
produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera.
Leisure/utility vehicles continued to gain market share, at the expense of
sales of conventional passenger cars.
The higher level of car output in November was achieved in spite of
short-time working by some manufacturers, including Nissan, Vauxhall and
Ford.
Commercial-vehicle output rose by 14.3 per cent in November to 21,914, the
first monthly year-on-year increase since January.
In the first 11 months output in this sector was still 22 per cent lower
than a year earlier at 182,144.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Weak import growth sets a sales conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual shopping binge before Christmas has traditionally been good news
for importers and bad news for the UK trade deficit.
But heavy-duty shopping so far this year appears to have inflicted little
damage on the trade gap. While consumer spending has risen steadily and
retail sales have perked up, import growth has been virtually flat.
The most recent complete trade figures - which admittedly warn of future
revisions - show import volumes up only 0.5 per cent in the three months to
September, compared with a year previously, and flat compared with the
previous three months.
Over the same period consumer spending rose 2.6 per cent, while retail sales
in September, compared with a year ago, were up 3.8 per cent.
This trend seems peculiar. Even during the worst years of the recession
imports held their own, or grew, as a share of consumption. Now, with other
European countries in the economic doldrums, the growing UK economy is a
prime target for hard-pressed foreign manufacturers.
So where are the goods in the shops coming from? The most optimistic reading
of the figures is that retailers are substituting domestic goods for those
from overseas.
Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said: 'I suspect that, even
though the trade figures are dodgy, UK companies have actually taken a
bigger share of the domestic market because they are more competitive.'
Other economists are less generous about the UK's lust for foreign goods. Mr
Doug McWilliams, head of the Centre for Economics and Business Research,
said: 'I think some of the information we got last year was misleading.
Imports probably have gone up, but it is the base that is wrong rather than
the current level.'
In spite of lack of faith in the trade figures - collected by a new system
since the beginning of the year - evidence from the Confederation of British
Industry points to some import substitution.
In its November distributive trades survey, the CBI said the percentage of
deliveries to retailers accounted for by imports had barely risen in the
past year, suggesting that import penetration in the high streets was being
held at bay.
But is the trend as suspect as some economists believe? Mr Michael Saunders,
economist at Salomon Brothers, pointed out that although import growth had
lagged consumer spending this year, it had increased slightly faster than
total domestic demand, which included stocks and private investment
spending.
Balance of payments figures show imports 1.8 per cent higher in the third
quarter than the same quarter a year ago. That compares with a 2.6 per cent
rise for consumer spending, but a 1.4 per cent rise in total domestic
demand.
This, Mr Saunders said,was to be expected. 'Consumer spending should be
quite strong coming out of recession, but you would expect private

FT  24 DEC 93 / Shops see ghost of free-spending past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sheffield's Meadow Hall centre came up with a novel way of making sure
shoppers reached its stores this Christmas. It set up its own radio station
giving constant traffic reports so people could find the most
congestion-free routes and car parks.
The move paid off. The number of shoppers visiting the centre this week was
4 per cent up on last year.
Even shops and shopping centres that did not go to such lengths are
reporting a considerably better Christmas than last year.
Central London has mounted a particularly strong recovery. Queues were
reported yesterday outside Marks and Spencer's food hall and Selfridges on
Oxford Street even before they opened their doors.
In Essex, the Lakeside shopping centre had a different problem. 'We've had
people queueing to get into the car park at 7.30 in the evening,' said Ms
Heather Davies, marketing manager.
She added that Lakeside's trading tended to peak earlier in December and the
last week had been quieter.
In south-western England and Wales trading was quieter. Retailers said sales
had improved on last year but spending was restrained. By yesterday trading
had passed its peak and many shops were discounting to attract last-minute
shoppers.
Mr Colin Antrobus, manager of Regent Arcade in Cheltenham, said: 'It has
been a steady Christmas, but it is debatable whether there has been a
significant uplift. There are plenty of people about, but actual spending is
up only marginally on last year, and that was a very bad Christmas.'
St David's Centre in Cardiff reported visitors were up 6 per cent on last
Christmas. But shoppers started to peter out on Wednesday and some
discounting was starting.
Mr Geoff Witcher, finance director of Trago Mills, which runs two
out-of-town centres in Devon and Cornwall, said the Christmas shopping
period had started earlier this year, at the end of October. 'Probably
people are wanting to spread the burden over two monthly pay cheques,' he
said.
Trading was also quieter in the Midlands. Merry Hill shopping centre in
Dudley said yesterday that it was 'busy but not packed to the doors. It's
like a good Saturday'.
Mr Michael Stephens, of Cathy Stephens Jewellery in Leicester, said trade
this week was 'ok, but no big deal'. The company has been making more unit
sales, although at a lower individual value than last year.
At Beatties, the Wolverhampton department store, sales on Wednesday, the
traditional late-night shopping day in the town, were 4 per cent higher than
on the comparable day last year.
Further north, Manchester's Arndale Centre, which recorded a record 1.2m
shoppers last week, was 'shoulder to shoulder' with shoppers yesterday. Mr
Ken Hunter, general manager, said most shops were running between 10 per
cent and 20 per cent up on sales this year.
Mr Hunter added: 'The difference from previous years is that shoppers are
using cash, not plastic.'
In the north-east, the number of visitors since Monday to Gateshead's
MetroCentre, Europe's largest shopping centre, was set to pass 500,000 by
the time the mall closed last night, and managers were anticipating a busy
day today. 'We call it the turkey trot,' said one.
Retailers in Scotland reported similarly buoyant trade. Mr George Ritchie,
general manager of Glasgow's St Enoch Centre, said: 'Where they are finding
the money from, I don't know, but they are certainly spending it.'
The newly opened Gyle shopping centre in Edinburgh said Christmas had
exceeded all expectations. 'For five or six weeks there's been no let-up at
all,' the centre said. It was receiving 90,000 to 95,000 visitors a day,
compared with the 300,000 a week it had forecast.
Some retailers will have only Saturday and Sunday to rest before their
new-year sales start on Monday.
In addition to looking for bargains on larger items, retailers say many
shoppers will actually start next year's Christmas shopping next week - only
to be found out by friends and relatives in a year's time when they try to
get an exchange or refund.
Computerised product numbers give the game away, leaving the recipient of
the present crestfallen. 'Aunty Nelly brings it back to us for the money
back or to change it,' said Mr Brettle of Littlewoods, 'and we have the
dreadful task of telling her it's a year old.'

FT  24 DEC 93 / Order, order, as MPs stock up: The Palace of Westminster's
retail success story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep in the Palace of Westminster - between Strangers' Bar and the staircase
to the members' tearoom - business is brisk in the most successful small
retail outlet in the country.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, in sports jacket and corduroys, peruses the list
of chocolates, alcoholic beverages and accessories, all bearing the
distinctive House of Commons portcullis, before making his selection.
Mr Tony Banks, never at a loss for a quip, has just told Mr Clarke that if
the whole economy was doing as well as this little shop, Britain would be a
happier place.
After purchasing his bulk order, the Labour MP for Newham North West
explains that each year he dons his Father Christmas hat and gives mints and
wine to those who have helped in his constituency advice surgery. Goods from
the shop - which range from gunpowder mustard to jacquard-lined dress
wallets - are also 'useful for raffle prizes at constituencies', he says.
A few minutes later a denim-jacketed Mr Calum MacDonald prepares to lug a
cardboard box full of sherry and mints towards the members' staircase. As
Labour MP for the remote Western Isles, Mr MacDonald faces the problem of
trying to 'clamber aboard the shuttle' with his acquisitions.
He, more than most, appreciates the MPs' privilege of being able to have
their whisky orders sent direct to their constituencies. The shop's
merchandise, he says, makes popular presents in hospitals and old people's
homes.
Measured by sales per sq ft, this tiny souvenir kiosk outstrips all British
rivals. And as with the retail trade in general, the approach to Christmas
is by far its busiest period. On the heaviest days, Mr Jose Alba, Mr Fidel
Benserghine and its other green-jacketed stewards say they can shift as many
as 2,500 to 3,000 boxes of mints and up to 25 boxes of whisky.
According to Mrs Sue Harrison, director of catering services at the Commons,
December accounts for nearly a third of the annual sales of Pounds 670,000.
This turnover is doubly impressive as, according to a recent catering
committee report, there has been 'a restriction on the amount of stock which
can be available in the kiosk'. It ran out of chocolates for two days this
month.
A notice to customers says: 'Unfortunately, the after-dinner mints, coffee
creams and orange creams will not reappear before Christmas due to a
manufacturers' packaging deficiency.'
Sales are also, at present, generated predominantly from the 651 MPs and
3,000 or so others who work in the palace.
But proposals are afoot to change this. Subject to various approvals, a new
kiosk - more easily accessible to the 800 tourists a day who visit the
Commons - may soon be erected in Westminster Hall. The new facility could be
operating after next year's summer recess and in time for next Christmas.
There are even plans for a visitor centre, but these are not expected to
come to fruition until early next century.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Scottish Life to end society ties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Life, the mutual life assurance company, is to end its
relationships with the Portman and Staffordshire building societies from the
end of June and from the end of 1995 respectively.
The company said yesterday that it would no longer use tied agents to
distribute its products and would focus entirely on selling through
independent financial advisers. IFAs already bring in about 97 per cent of
its business.
Scottish Life said the cost of the arrangement was disproportionate. Both it
and the building societies emphasised that the decision did not reflect
dissatisfaction with the working relationship.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Touche partner fined Pounds 1,500
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An insolvency partner with Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been
reprimanded, fined Pounds 1,500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 1,000 by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for failing to
hold creditors' meetings on time for a company of which he was liquidator.
Mr Roger Powdrill, who was appointed liquidator to KM Joinery (Haverill) in
1991, did not hold meetings in 1992 and 1993 within the time set down in the
1986 Insolvency Act.
It is believed that administrative delays held up the meeting in 1992, and
that the one in 1993 was delayed to save money and to combine it with a
final creditors' meeting. Touche Ross said no creditors attended any of the
meetings.
The issue raises questions over the legal requirement for holding annual
creditors' meetings in liquidations, which frequently are unattended.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Lenders forecast housing recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A housing-market recovery next year, in spite of factors such as reduced
real incomes because of tax increases, is forecast today by the Council of
Mortgage Lenders, Alison Smith writes.
The council, which represents building societies and centralised lenders
such as banks, says the stabilising of house prices and the likelihood of a
small rise next year, with the reduction in negative equity and better
employment prospects, will boost confidence.
It believes these will outweigh elements such as the fall in mortgage
interest tax relief and the greater expense of becoming an owner-occupier.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Football club finds profitable venue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newcastle United Football Club's strip, which costs Pounds 32.99, will be
found by thousands of native and adopted Geordies in their Christmas
stockings tomorrow.
At one time clubs expected fans to trek to their grounds to buy merchandise.
But this Christmas more than a score of clubs have discovered the potential
of a city-centre retail pitch. This follows a link between Newcastle United
and Littlewoods, the chain-store operator.
Sales far exceeded United's expectations when it opened a concession in
Littlewoods' Northumberland Street branch in Newcastle upon Tyne in August.
This prompted concessions by other clubs in their local Littlewoods in time
for Christmas.
Mr Frank Brettle, general manager of Littlewoods' Newcastle store, said:
'Once it was (Ninja) turtles, now it's Mr Blobby but as far as I'm concerned
the great thing in the UK is football merchandise.'
Mr Brettle said most retailers would be delighted to achieve Pounds 20 of
sales per sq ft a week. His store's Newcastle United shop, however, is
turning over Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000 a week - about Pounds 150 per sq
ft.
Mrs Hazel Hebron, Newcastle United's retail sales manager, said sales of
club merchandise in the 1993-94 season would exceed Pounds 2m, well up on
1992-93.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Government firm on Andersen ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected efforts by accountants Arthur Andersen to
have a ban on the firm doing public-sector work lifted.
The Treasury solicitor wrote yesterday to Herbert Smith, Andersen's lawyers,
rejecting the firm's claim that the action could be in breach of European
law.
Andersen has not obtained public-sector work for nearly a decade since it
was sued by the government for alleged negligence as auditor to De Lorean,
the car company.
The Treasury said that its ban on Andersen obtaining auditing, privatisation
advisory and other accounting work would remain while litigation was in
progress.
It emerged this week that the firm had approached the government in the
autumn after enactment of new European Union legislation suggesting that
outstanding litigation need not be a barrier to tenders for other work.
Earlier this year the government recommended a ban on giving any work to 13
named partners and staff at accountants Touche Ross. However Touche as a
firm continues to receive work.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Sid starts to worry about getting burnt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Sid, the proverbial small investor, about to be burnt by the very company
he helped to found - British Gas?
When the company was privatised in 1986 several million small investors
responded to the call 'Tell Sid' and bought shares. The prospectus said that
British Gas's authorisation would last 25 years, suggesting a long and
secure future.
This week Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, decided to
abolish the British Gas monopoly, suddenly transforming the prospects for
the more than 2m small shareholders who held on to their British Gas shares.
Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, chief executive of Proshare, the organisation set up
to promote wider share ownership, said yesterday that he had received
several dozen letters from small shareholders asking him what they should
do. He, in turn, has written to Mr Heseltine.
He said: 'That licence has been ripped up. The investors' interests have not
been taken into account. These are not seasoned investors. They are loyal
people. A lot of them are retired.'
All is not lost, however. The profit prospects of British Gas now depend on
the complex pricing formula which has still to be agreed by Mr Heseltine and
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator.
Mr Maddrell said the government would have to remove uncertainty for the
small shareholder. He added: 'When the next privatisation comes along, no
one is going to believe what the government says.'
The industry department denies that the prospectus has been ripped up. It
points out that the offer document said the 25-year authorisation could be
revoked on various grounds including 'certain provisions of general
competition law'.
Also, it is not clear how worried Sid really is. Mr Paul Killik, a
stockbroker who specialises in popular shares, said yesterday that he had
heard nothing at all from Sid. 'He's utterly oblivious,' he said. 'Most
people have simply tucked their shares away.'
Mr Killik points out that British Gas shares still offer an attractive 5.5
per cent yield, but anyone seeking capital gains would do better to sell and
go to another sector.
Sid paid 135p for his shares in 1986. This year they hit a high of 361p, but
the monopoly decision knocked them hard, pushing them down to 333p this
week. Yesterday they recovered 3p to close at 336p.

FT  24 DEC 93 / DTI acts to boost television industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has set up a DTI branch
to boost UK broadcasting at home and abroad.
It is the first time that broadcasting has had a specific branch to study
its competitiveness and encourage programme exports. The branch, which will
be headed by Mr Neil Warman, an assistant secretary, reflects Mr Heseltine's
conviction that broadcasting in all its forms represents a significant
industrial opportunity.
The move follows last month's meeting of top broadcasters called by Mr
Heseltine and Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary.
Apart from looking at the competitiveness of Britain's broadcasters Mr
Warman's branch will also be responsible for pulling together the DTI view
on issues such as further de-regulation of ownership rules and the promised
review of cross-media regulations.
Work has already begun to establish an inter-departmental committee to
review the rules on cross-media ownership.
At present, for instance, newspaper groups are forbidden from holding more
than a 20 per cent stake in a commercial broadcaster. Newspaper groups such
as Lord Rothermere's Associated Newspapers, The Telegraph group and Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, have all been lobbying for a relaxation of the
restrictions.
The ownership committee will have representatives from the DTI, the Treasury
and the Cabinet Office.
After the recent government decision to allow a company to hold two ITV
licences, there is a growing feeling that relaxation of the cross-media
ownership rules may happen.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Lord Gowrie to take over from Lord Palumbo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Gowrie in Trafalgar Square, London, yesterday after the announcement
that he is to take over from Lord Palumbo in April as Arts Council chairman,
Antony Thorncroft writes.
Lord Gowrie was arts minister from 1983 to 1985 but resigned from the
government saying he could not afford to live in London on a ministerial
salary of Pounds 33,000 a year.
In 1987 he became chairman of auction house Sotheby's Europe. He is to
resign this post on December 31 but will continue as a director.
The Arts Council chairman is unpaid but has the use of a car.
It is believed that Lord Gowrie was the first choice of Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary. Apart from his time in government he has spent
most of his career in the arts, as an art dealer, poet and critic. His
particular interests are music, the visual arts, and cinema. During his
chairmanship the council will take over responsibility for distributing
National Lottery revenue to the arts.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Large decline forecast in craft jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Craft and skilled manual jobs are expected to decline by as much as 520,000
during the 1990s, a fall of 14 per cent during the decade, a government
report says.
Occupational trends and projections to the year 2000 have been produced by
the Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick. The
forecasts, published yesterday, highlight the increase in higher-level jobs
which will require a more highly skilled workforce. The most rapid growth is
expected in the managerial, professional and technical categories. At the
same time the general skills content of most jobs is increasing.
The largest proportionate fall, of 35 per cent, will be in the primary
industries.
The government has not formally endorsed the forecasts but said they were
'useful broad indicators'.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Major responds to nursery pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's call yesterday for nursery education available for all comes
as a response to increasing pressure from educationalists during the past
year.
The prime minister recognised that the short-term barrier to providing this
was finding the necessary funds. He said: 'It would be an ambition of mine
over time to move to universal nursery education, but I do stress that is an
ambition . . . we don't have the resources.'
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, favours universal nursery
provision, but made it equally clear last month that he did not think it
could be afforded while the public sector deficit remained about Pounds
50bn.
Recent estimates published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development suggest that the UK trails countries such as Belgium, France and
the Netherlands on nursery education.
Britain's public-sector nurseries provide places for 38 per cent of
three-year-olds and 56 per cent of four-year-olds. But the UK's provision is
slightly ahead of the US and Japan.
The National Commission on Education, an educational think-tank whose launch
was welcomed by Mr Major, called last month for the phased introduction of
nursery education for all. Its favoured target was to see 95 per cent of
four-year-olds and 85 per cent of three-year-olds in nursery school by the
year 2110.
This provision, on a half-time basis for three-year-olds and four-year-olds,
should be available to all children whose parents wish it, the commission
said. It added that funds should be concentrated initially on inner-city
areas.
Mr Patten responded by saying that the funds were not available and
decisions on nursery education should be left to local decision-makers.
According to Department for Education estimates, the total funding needed,
on this year's costings, is Pounds 1,770 per child.
This money would have to come from local authority budgets, at a time when
they need to find savings to meet targets set in the Budget. For political
reasons, nursery budgets tend to be easier to cut than others.
This leads to wide variations in provision. At the end of 1991, education
department figures showed a total variation in the proportion of under-fives
in nursery schools and classes from zero (Gloucestershire) and 2 per cent
(for Somerset and Bromley), to 58 per cent in Newham and Walsall.
Once all under-fives, including those in reception classes at primary
schools, are included, the total range in provision is from 17 per cent in
Bromley to 92 per cent in Walsall.
Funding will be difficult. Tory-controlled Westminster city council has
adopted one of the more original plans to cut costs by putting its day
nurseries out to tender. It said it was happy with the response it received
from the private sector, but Westminster's in-house team eventually won the
contract, on cost grounds.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, urged Mr Major to make wider
nursery provision a priority and to suggest ways of funding it.
But she warned: 'This government does not seem to be making any progress in
creating new nursery places. Where is the crash programme for the expansion
of nursery provision? It just is not there. Ministers have the power to
provide it, but I do not see a genuine commitment.'
If Mr Major can find the funds, there is evidence from the market of strong
demand for nursery education, fuelled by the trend for mothers to stay in
employment.
According to the commission, the number of children in English private
nurseries rose by 259 per cent between 1980 and 1991, from 22,017 to 79,029.
The use of childminders also more than doubled, from 98,495 to 233,258. This
was in spite of significant increases of 36 per cent in children at state
nursery schools, and 32 per cent in reception classes of primary schools.
Universal nursery provision might prove very popular indeed with voters.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Tecs seek approval for mergers with chambers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training and enterprise councils are to advise the government not to object
to their integration with chambers of commerce, provided that a number of
quality criteria are met.
If ministers accept this advice, which comes after the government invited
Tecs' comments, a number of mergers could take place.
The move would be unpopular in some areas but would be in line with wider
moves to redraw the map of locally delivered business and economic
development services. Kent Tec, for example, is negotiating with Kent County
Council over its integration with the county's economic development unit.
The quality criteria could include obliging the new bodies not to be
deliverers of services. At present many chambers give contracts to Tecs to
provide training.
Chambers, which are private bodies, and Tecs are already co-operating in the
new Business Links outlets which deliver services to small businesses. But a
number would like to go further.
In the past the Department of Employment has set demanding criteria before
considering mergers, saying that the two organisations have different aims
and remits. Chambers, it has said, exist to serve the needs of their
business membership while Tecs were set up by the government to provide
support for training and economic development.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Second challenge to council revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somerset County Council is to seek leave to apply for a judicial review of
the Local Government Commission's proposal to scrap the council and replace
it with three unitary authorities.
Its action follows a similar move by Cleveland on Tuesday and will increase
pressure on the government to abandon its review of local government
structure.
Somerset describes the recommendation as 'perverse' and wants it declared
null on the grounds that the commissioners have acted unlawfully and
unreasonably, and ignored evidence from opinion polls conducted for the
commission by MORI.
The commission, headed by Sir John Banham, originally proposed replacing the
county council and five district councils with a single unitary authority
for most of Somerset. But after public consultation it recommended three
unitary councils.
All four of the Conservative MPs in Somerset, including Mr Tom King, the
former cabinet minister and MP for Bridgwater, have supported the status
quo.
The request for judicial review has all-party support on the council, which
the Liberal Democrats won from the Conservatives in May.
Cleveland is Labour-controlled and its move has divided local Labour MPs. Ms
Marjorie Mowlam, MP for Redcar, supports the county but Mr Peter Mandelson,
MP for Hartlepool, believes the legal action is a waste of money.
Mr John Whitcutt, Somerset county solicitor, said yesterday that the
commission's proposal was not supported by its own published evidence.
A MORI poll showed 19 per cent support for three unitary authorities and 14
per cent support for one unitary authority, but 32 per cent preferred the
present arrangement.
Another 24 per cent wanted a two-tier Somerset on its former, pre-1974
boundaries. Together with the 14 per cent who wanted a single unitary
authority, the poll showed 70 per cent wanted some form of strategic
county-wide authority.
Mr Whitcutt said that figure compared with an equivalent figure of 60 per
cent for Gloucestershire, where the commission this week recommended the
status quo.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Lloyd's revises offer to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has revised the Pounds 900m compensation package offered
to the insurance market's loss-making Names, after discovering a calculation
error in its original offer.
The Lloyd's Names associations' working party said that the admission of the
error would further undermine the confidence of Names in the offer. It urged
Names to reject the offer, which it described as 'an act of expediency
rather than a settlement based on principle or equity'.
The revision involves the re-allocation of Pounds 22m of the total. It will
result in an increase in the offer for 13,500 Names of up to Pounds 90,000
and a reduction in the offer for 9,300 Names of up to Pounds 40,000.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, described the error as 'extremely
galling' but said that it should not alter the outcome.
He said: 'For the vast majority of people the scale of the mistake is small
in quantum but it does not belittle the fact that the mistake has been
made.'
The error, which involved one step of a complex, 60-step calculation,
originated from a mistake in the allocation of money between members on a
number of syndicates.
Lloyd's realised it had made an error after receiving a number of queries
from action groups and individual Names. On Thursday last week it appointed
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, to check its calculations. It
intends to send out the revised offer to Names next week.
As a result of a separate error Lloyd's is reducing the Pounds 2.5m offer
made to Wellington 406 by Pounds 500,000.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Skiers deterred by overseas costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British skiers are abandoning the slopes this winter, put off by the strong
currencies of Switzerland, Austria and France.
Travel companies have said the number of ski holidays sold in the UK this
year is down by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on last winter, in spite
of good snow falls and strong bookings in other European countries.
The fall is in strong contrast to the overall holiday market, where bookings
are at record levels. Thomson, the largest tour operator, said that by last
week it had already sold 1m holidays for next summer. By Christmas last year
it had sold fewer than 500,000.
Thomas Cook, the travel agents, said bookings to Switzerland from the UK
were down 25 per cent. Austria and France had seen bookings from the UK fall
by 14 per cent.
Bookings to Italy, however, were up about 20 per cent, helped by the weak
Italian lira. Thomson said it was using larger aircraft on its weekly
flights to Turin from Manchester and London's Gatwick airport.
Thomas Cook said cheaper ski destinations such as Romania and Bulgaria had
sold reasonably well, although they were also slightly down on last year.
Operators and travel agents said they expected ski holiday sales to pick up
after Christmas. Thomas Cook said an increase in late bookings could limit
the final fall in the market to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.
Skiing has, however, been falling as a proportion of the UK winter holiday
market for four years. Ski trips are expected to account for 11.5 per cent
of UK winter holidays this year, according to Lunn Poly, the largest travel
agents' chain. This compares with 13.6 per cent last year and 16.7 per cent
in 1989-90.
Ski holidays have fallen victim to the recession and the downturn in
consumer spending. A ski trip is a second holiday for many consumers.
While many experienced skiers have continued to head for the slopes,
operators say there have been fewer first-time ski holiday buyers in recent
years. Another factor in skiing's demise has been the growing popularity of
winter sun holidays.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Christmas is coming - even in Bethlehem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BETHLEHEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas will be celebrated in Bethlehem for the first time in six years
tomorrow, amid hopes of growing reconciliation between Jews and Christians.
The Biblical town has not officially celebrated Christmas since the
Palestinian uprising against Israel erupted in December 1987. But the
Palestine Liberation Organisation has just made Christmas a national
holiday, allowing the town to celebrate openly.
Christmas in Bethlehem is special too this year as next week the Vatican and
Israel will sign an agreement to establish relations, in what many people
hope will prove to be a landmark on the road to reconciliation between Jews
and Christians. Pope John Paul II has said he will visit the Holy Land soon.
Nevertheless, enormous problems remain in bringing peace and goodwill to the
peoples and the religions of the land of Israel.
Indeed, a dispute almost stopped Christmas from happening at all in
Bethlehem when the Palestinian major threatened to cancel the festivities
unless Israel withdrew its demands for the Palestinian flag to be taken
down. Last night senior PLO officials had taken up the matter with Israel's
foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres.
Despite the peace process, the lives of Palestinians have yet to change for
the better. Israeli troops with machine-guns yesterday lounged on the wooden
stand used by the Christmas choir in Manger Square - a potent reminder of
the continued occupation - and last night defused a small bomb there.
Arab-Jewish violence continues unabated. And even if the self-rule peace
agreement is finalised in the coming days the Palestinian state which Arabs
yearn for remains distant.
For Jews, too, getting into the spirit of peace and goodwill remains
difficult. The killings of Jewish settlers by Palestinian gunmen has left a
shadow over the peace process. And many Jews remain deeply uneasy about
Jewish-Christian friendship.
Professor Sergio Minerbi, a Jew who has made the Vatican his special
academic interest, says the Holy See's establishment of relations with
Israel has been made possible because the church has separated politics from
religion. It now treats issues on principles of international law rather
than theological doctrine and has tacitly dropped its teaching that the
dispersal of the Jews out of the Holy Land was punishment by God for the
refusal of the Jews to acknowledge Christ as the saviour.
Like many Jews, Professor Minerbi believes that persecution by the Nazis was
due partly to the theological anti-semitic teaching of the Catholic Church,
which, until 1965, held all Jews collectively guilty for the crucifixion of
Jesus by virtue of descent.
Among Christians in Jerusalem too there are profound question marks about
the possibility of a reconciliation between the religions. 'The theological
thing is either they are right or we are,' said Father Jerry Murphy
O'Connor. 'Either Christ was the saviour or he wasn't. The rest is tea
parties.'

FT  24 DEC 93 / Treasurer's departure prompts Keating reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, yesterday used the departure of
Mr John Dawkins as treasurer to change his cabinet for the first time since
his Labor government was re-elected in March. Eleven ministers or
parliamentary secretaries moved.
The new cabinet has a more balanced appearance, giving prominence to some
supporters of Mr Bob Hawke, the last Labor prime minister, and easing up on
the rewards for previous Keating support.
Mr Ralph Willis, 55, former finance minister, takes over from Mr Dawkins in
a widely anticipated move. A competent if uncharismatic man, he has been an
MP for more than 20 years and was treasurer briefly in 1991.
'What we want to do is to accelerate the growth (in the economy) and the job
growth that comes with it, and to get the unemployment numbers down. That's
our number one priority,' he said yesterday, adding: 'All that's to be done
within a responsible fiscal policy and. . . we remain absolutely committed
to the deficit reduction strategy.'
Mr Willis will be replaced as finance minister by Mr Kim Beazley, previously
responsible for employment, education and training. He was formerly finance
minister in 1991.
The employment portfolio passes to Mr Simon Crean, minister for primary
industries and energy since mid-1991, who recently oversaw reorganisation of
the wool industry. With the jobless rate in double figures, the post is
likely to be a high-profile one. Mr Crean was president of the Australian
Council of Trade Unions in 1985-1990.
The large transport and communications portfolio is being split, with
communications being taken over by Mr Michael Lee, 36, a relative newcomer
at ministerial level. He is adding it to his existing tourism portfolio. Mr
David Beddall takes over resources, previously handled by Mr Lee, and Mr
Laurie Brereton, a close associate of the prime minister, will add transport
to his industrial relations responsibilities.
The decision to give communications to Mr Lee and transport to Mr Brereton
has surprised many pundits, who believed it would be the other way round.
Communications has been extremely sensitive of late, with the government
embarrassed by the near-farcical 'auction' of satellite pay-TV licences and
questions about the way in which foreign investment limits have been applied
in the print media.
Completing the circle, Mr Bob Collins - who previously held the transport
and communications portfolio, and had been heading home to Darwin on
Wednesday night before being recalled to Canberra - takes over Mr Crean's
job at primary industries.

Elders IXL brewing and agribusiness group, was yesterday charged with two
counts of theft, involving ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 30m), and with conspiring
to disguise the theft under the guise of two fictitious foreign exchange
transactions. He was freed on ADollars 450,000 bail.
Similar charges were brought against Mr Kenneth Jarrett and Mr Peter Camm,
two other former Elders IXL executives. Mr Jarrett was charged with theft
and conspiracy, Mr Camm with conspiracy only. Both were also granted bail.
The charges were served hours after a High Court judge refused to grant a
temporary injunction barring the National Crime Authority and the Victorian
Director of Public Prosecutions from bringing a criminal case against Mr
Elliott.
Mr Elliott, who vehemently denies any wrongdoing, has successfully kept
injunctions in place for several months, arguing that the NCA had
overstepped its authority in pursuing these matters and alleging that he had
become the victim of a political conspiracy.
Last month, however, a federal court decided to lift the injunctions, and
the full federal court then rejected Mr Elliott's application to appeal.
This meant that the High Court became Mr Elliott's last hope - and that was
dashed by Justice Gaudron's ruling yesterday.
The charges relate to two foreign exchange transactions between Elders and
the Bank of New Zealand, and then between the Bank of New Zealand and
companies connected to executives of Equiticorp, the failed New
Zealand-based group, in 1988.
The transactions resulted in losses to Elders of ADollars 39.5m and ADollars
27m respectively, and similar gains to the Equiticorp-related companies. The
authorities allege that these were ficticious deals, designed to funnel
money from Elders to Mr Allan Hawkins, Equiticorp's now-jailed former chief
executive, or to companies connected with him.
When yesterday's High Court decision became known, Mr Elliott - a former
president of the Australian Liberal party - quickly reasserted his
innocence. 'The contest for justice is far from over and will continue,' he
said in Melbourne, adding that he 'rejected the charges, whatever they are'.
But when the three men later appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court to
seek bail, one lawyer for a prosecution witness described the charges as
'one of the largest cases of theft ever to come before an Australian court'.
He claimed that Mr Elliott had been the 'linchpin' in the two transactions,
and Mr Jarrett, a 'major player'.
Mr Elliott was remanded to reappear for a committal hearing on April 14 next
year. The other two men were also bailed to reappear next April, with bail
for Mr Jarrett set at ADollars 450,000 and at ADollars 225,000 for Mr Camm.

Israel and the PLO failed to settle differences over control of borders

talks in France yesterday, Julian Ozanne reports.
The two sides agreed to consider a compromise whereby Israel would retain a
veto over who could enter the West Bank and Gaza but the Palestinians would
man separate checkpoints and deal with immigration, customs and tax
formalities. The negotiators meet again in Cairo on Monday.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Mining company chairman accused: Australian federal
authorities launch prosecutions against two of the country's leading
businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Normandy Poseidon, the large Adelaide-based mining and exploration group,
last night took the highly unusual step of disclosing that its executive
chairman, Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, was about to be charged by the
federal director of public prosecutions.
The company's solicitors added that they had been advised that Mr Thomas
Meiklejohn, a former employee of Normandy, would also be charged.
Normandy, which made the announcement after the stock market closed, said
full details of the charges had not been disclosed but continued: 'It is
understood that they relate to the takeover by Brunswick NL in 1989 of
Bendigo Gold and that the charges allege that Mr de Crespigny and Mr
Meiklejohn allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Part
A statement delivered to Bendigo Gold shareholders did not contain
misleading information.
'It is understood that Mr Meiklejohn is also to be charged for allegedly
having knowingly published false information in relation to the financial
position of Brunswick.'
Brunswick started corporate life as Brunswick Oil, but sold its oil
interests and moved into the gold exploration business in Western Australia.
Control was then acquired by interests related to Mr de Crespigny who, in
1989, was chairman of the company. Mr Meiklejohn, at that time, was
Brunswick's managing director.
The merger with Bendigo Gold was agreed in 1990. A 'Part A' document is one
of the offer documents formally required under Australian takeover practice
 -and the one which tells shareholders in the target company about any
information relevant to them in deciding whether to sell their shares.
Mr de Crespigny, one of the most influential figures in Australia's mining
industry, denied any wrongdoing. 'The laying of these is entirely unexpected
and very disappointing,' he said in a statement.
'The DPP has never spoken to me nor made any serious attempt to canvass its
concerns with me.'
He said he was completely innocent of the charges and would defend them
vigorously. He was confident of an acquittal, 'although clearly the laying
of these charges is bound to cause me enormous personal damage'.
Last night, Mr Andrew Corletto, Normandy's company secretary, said that he
did not believe that the charges had actually been laid to date, although he
conceded that it was possible this would happen before the holiday weekend.
Normandy's early disclosure of the impending prosecution appears to have
been prompted by a wave of rumours.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris stock market yesterday hit an all-time high despite publication of
gloomy economic statistics revealing a steep decline in industrial
production during October.
The announcement by the Insee state statistics institute that industrial and
manufacturing output fell 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively during
the month had no tangible effect on enthusiasm for French equities.
The CAC 40 Index continued its recent bull run by beginning the day's
trading with a rise to a record 2,239.7. It rallied again during the
afternoon to close at a new high of 2,243,02, an increase of 0.77 per cent
over the previous day.
However, the franc faltered on the publication of the poor production
figures which came on the heels of Wednesday's announcement that household
consumption had fallen 1.6 per cent last month.
The franc, which earlier this month returned to its old European exchange
rate mechanism trading bands for the first time since the summer currency
crisis, rose during the morning only to lose momentum. It closed in Paris at
FFr3.4079 against the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.4074 on Wednesday.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, sought to play down the significance
of the gloomy economic news by claiming that French economy was in a
'pre-recovery stage'.
Mr Alphandery pointed to the strength of the bourse, recent reductions in
interest rates and the mildly optimistic tone of some recent business
confidence surveys as encouraging omens for the future.
The minister said the cabinet would assess next month the general prospects
for the economy and decide whether it was necessary to implement special
reflationary measures, thereby echoing earlier statements made by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister.
In the meantime, the government has decided to extend its support for small
and medium-sized companies by providing a capital injection of FFr500m
(Pounds 57m) to Credit d'Equipement des PME (CEPME), an institution that
provides credit to the small corporate sector.
The government will keep control of monetary policy until a new monetary
policy council at the Bank of France is named and installed, Mr Alphandery
said, Reuter reports from Paris.

hands, his office announced yesterday, AP reports from Moscow.
His decree assigns the Federal Department for Insolvency Affairs, a unit of
the State Property Committee, to identify failing enterprises and decide
their future. Businesses found to be insolvent can be liquidated,
restructured or transferred to other owners, including the private sector,
the decree said.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Yeltsin sets opposing courses: The two main tasks handed to
the government are incompatible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin has set himself and his government two important -
and incompatible - tasks.
At a news conference in the Kremlin on Monday, a slow and halting Russian
president said economic reform would continue despite the reformers' poor
showing in the elections two weeks ago. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime
minister and the man most associated with reform, would remain in the
cabinet.
'Gaidar stays,' said Mr Yeltsin, 'and that means the course which he has
brought in with the president and the government stays.'
Yet, the reform course Mr Gaidar has set in motion is not the one he really
wants to pursue. Nor is it the policy that many Russians blame him for.
Since returning to office in September, Mr Gaidar, in overall charge of the
government's economic departments, has punctured his predecessor Mr Oleg
Lobov's attempt to reinstate the economics ministry as a kind of revamped
Gosplan. However, only at times has he been able to dam the flow of credits
to state industries and he has completely failed to produce a strategy which
might let some of those industries collapse.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, made clear last week that he
blames Mr Gaidar's reforms for the reformers' defeat in the polls and that
he must 'think again'. Mr Gaidar himself, in off-the-cuff remarks, seems
inclined to agree, commenting that higher investment and an end to falling
production are now priorities.
At his news conference President Yeltsin also commended a 'more socially
oriented' course for the government. If inflation continued to fall social
spending should rise, he said, and warned that economic reforms had to be
made 'strictly in accordance with the constitution'.
The latter is a grab-bag of commitments, but insofar as they are economic,
they lay down that Russia 'shall be a social state' and that the state shall
ensure 'a guaranteed minimum wage, state support for the family, motherhood,
fatherhood and childhood, and also support for the disabled and for elderly
citizens, develop a system of social services and establish government
pensions, benefits and other social security guarantees'.
The Gaidar reform course, however, insofar as that is defined as a
monetary-based strategy aimed at stabilising the economy, is simply
incompatible with any greatly increased social spending in the short term.
The International Monetary Fund, which has made known that it too wants to
see more social spending, must attempt early next year to come to an
agreement with a government with contradictory aims - having failed to do so
this year with a government supposedly set on a radical reform course.
The new government will inherit a budget deficit of Rbs6 trillion (million
million) - that is, budgetary expenditure delayed from this year to keep the
deficit within 10 per cent of gross national product, but which must be
paid.
The second incompatibility is more directly political. Mr Yeltsin said he
wanted his government (albeit smaller) to stay, that it would not be a
coalition, and that he would seek to work with parliament and with a
'constructive' opposition, in which he included Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democrats.
The government is already a coalition. Some of its ministers stood on Mr
Gaidar's Russia's Choice ticket, others on that of the Party of Unity and
Accord. Others scorned both. As the past week has shown, the cabinet is now
a group of openly quarrelling individuals.
If, however, a reform team is kept together, it will be heavily opposed by
the largest part of the parliamentary parties. Though Russia's Choice, with
over 100 seats claimed, is the biggest group in the lower house, or State
Duma, the two other reformist parties only bring the total up to 155-160.
The anti-reformers are likely to be able to count on over 200.
To be sure, Mr Zhirinovsky's LDP is regarded with some doubt by the
Communists and their allies. But Mr Genady Zyuganov, the Communist leader,
has made clear he does not regard the LDP as fascist and wants to explore
co-operation. The opposition groups will thus fight for the allegiance of
the independent and other small party votes from a position of strength.
Government is thus likely to continue against a parliamentary background of
opposition.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Durables orders underscore recovery in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh batch of economic statistics, led by strong orders for durable
goods, gave further indications of the vigour of the US economy yesterday.
In November, orders for manufactured durable goods rose by 2 per cent to
Dollars 139.4bn. That follows a 2.6 per cent advance in October and
constitutes the fourth consecutive monthly increase, the longest series of
gains for more than six years. Orders stood 8.8 per cent higher than a year
ago.
The increase was led by the aircraft and automobile sectors, with
transportation as a group up 5.7 per cent in the month. The only leading
industrial category to record a decline in November was electrical
machinery. In view of the contracting military budget, overall defence
orders also fell - by 1.7 per cent - but that was more than offset by a
healthy 5.3 per cent rise in the non-defence sector, which augurs well for
future capital spending.
Shipments of durable goods also rose for the fourth consecutive month, this
time by 2.7 per cent, while unfilled orders - the manufacturing backlog -
fell for the ninth consecutive month, by 0.6 per cent in November, to the
lowest level since May 1988.
The government also reported that personal incomes rose last month by more
than personal spending, an indication that the consumer, although saving
less, may yet help to sustain the recovery.
Income went up by 0.6 per cent in November, another fourth monthly increase
in succession, while spending rose for the eighth consecutive month, this
time by 0.4 per cent, only half the level of October.
Meanwhile, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, forecast that the federal
deficit in fiscal 1995, starting next year, would fall to about Dollars
190bn (Pounds 127bn), compared with a little under Dollars 250bn in the
current year and a shortfall for fiscal 1995 of just over Dollars 300bn
projected when the Clinton administration took office.
Mr Panetta attributed the reduction to the effect on new deficit-cutting
policies and to the renewed strength in the economy, which increases tax
revenues.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Clinton turns over files in land affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has ordered his personal lawyer to give federal
investigators all relevant files about a failed Arkansas real estate venture
in which the president and his wife were once partners.
The move is an apparent attempt by Mr Clinton to defuse a growing
controversy about whether he might be trying to cover up financial
wrongdoings. It came as separate allegations that he tried to cover up a
sexual scandal by offering government jobs appeared to fade.
The White House said yesterday the files on the land deal would be turned
over to 'appropriate law enforcement authorities at the Justice Department'.
They would include files removed from the office of Mr Vince Foster, his
White House lawyer who committed suicide last July.
The files relate to an investment by Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary in
Whitewater Development Corp, a partnership with a close friend who owned a
now defunct savings and loan association.
For months the Justice Department has been investigating whether Mr
Clinton's partner had channelled any money from the S&amp;L into Whitewater; if
any S&amp;L money was used to retire Clinton campaign debt; and whether the then
Governor Clinton had influenced treatment by state bank regulators of the
S&amp;L. The White House has consistently denied any wrongdoing by Mr Clinton.
Republicans have been demanding congressional hearings and the appointment
of a special counsel to take over the Justice Department investigation. But
Miss Janet Reno, the federal attorney general, yesterday refused to
appointed a special counsel.
Democrats suspected that the controversy was being fanned by Mr Clinton's
opponents because of concern at his end-of-year surge in public opinion
polls.
In its statement, the White House said: 'There has never been any suggestion
by any law enforcement officials of any impropriety regarding the Clintons'
investments in Whitewater. The president has voluntarily decided to release
these documents for whatever relevance they have in any Department of
Justice law enforcement enquiry.'
Earlier, some of the steam seemed to go out parallel allegations that Mr
Clinton had used state troopers in Arkansas to help him arrange
extra-marital affairs and had later tried to buy their silence by offering
them federal government jobs.
One state trooper signed an affidavit denying that he or his colleagues had
been offered jobs by Mr Clinton in exchange for their silence.
The alleged offer of a federal job would violate federal law.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Russia signs dual citizenship pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ASHKABAD, TURKMENISTAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed the former Soviet Union's
first dual citizenship accord, making Turkmenistan the former empire's only
member to shed some of the near-fanaticism with which most have asserted
their separate nationalities.
The agreement allows Turkmenistan's 400,000 Russians, representing about 10
per cent of the republic's population and 40 per cent of its capital, to
hold dual citizenship, something that most of its former Soviet brethren
have rejected.
The accord was reached during a state visit by Mr Yeltsin one day before a
summit in the Turkmen capital of the Moscow-dominated Commonwealth of
Independent States, which groups most ex-Soviet republics. It is the first
such meeting since this month's Russian parliamentary elections, in which
the nationalist Liberal Democratic leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, made an
unexpectedly strong showing.
Analysts have expected Mr Yeltsin to use the summit as a forum to press CIS
leaders to be less resistant to Moscow's economic and political influence,
with the justification that the alternative could be a purely imperialist
Russia.
In citing the agreement, the Turkmen president, Mr Sapurmurat Niyazov, has
in some ways helped Mr Yeltsin move further ahead in Moscow's slow redigging
of its roots in the ex-Soviet southern rim. For his part, Mr Yeltsin also
may have progressed towards co-opting, or at least undermining, some of Mr
Zhirinovsky's nationalist support.
Mr Zhirinovsky, who has advocated reabsorption of much of Moscow's defunct
empire, won 37 per cent of the vote among the roughly 7,000 ethnic Russian
officers serving under contract to the Turkmen army.
The result, a stronger showing than Mr Zhirinovsky achieved in Russia
itself, in part reflected a desire among the much-needed officers - the
backbone of Turkmenistan's security forces - to improve their comparatively
spartan living conditions and status two years after the break-up of the
Soviet Union.
Since then, Mr Niyazov has appeared on national television offering the
officers free flats and other benefits. Mr Yeltsin gave some indication that
he might seek similar agreements with other CIS partners. The Turkmen
agreement was 'a sign of great friendship between two peoples', he said.
Diplomats said that, for Mr Niyazov's part, the accord was at least partly
an attempt to stanch the emigration of ethnic Russians from the republic.
Just last spring, there were about 11,000 ethnic Russian officers in
Turkmenistan. 'The government has been well aware that it needs Russian
skills,' said a diplomat in Ashkabad.
'We are seeing Russians wanting more and more to go. Every time they look up
and see Niyazov's face on a poster, it reminds them that they are no longer
in charge, and it makes them uncomfortable.' However, the citizenship
agreement does little or nothing to counter-balance harsh housing laws that
Mr Niyazov has enacted and that have had the effect of making it almost
impossible financially for Russians to go.
About 18 months ago, Mr Niyazov banned the sale of flats for 10 years,
removing one main way in which ethnic Russians have been able to earn the
cash they need to start a new life outside Turkmenistan.
Then, in the summer, he banned flat or home rentals, taking away an
alternative to which some Russians had turned for a steady cash flow while
they made new lives for themselves in Russia.

The British charity Oxfam appealed yesterday for urgent international aid to
avert 'a terrible humanitarian crisis' among 750,000 refugees from the
central African state of Burundi, writes Michael Holman in London.
The refugees fled to neighbouring Tanzania and Rwanda in the wake of an
attempted coup in Burundi on October 21. It triggered off widespread ethnic
clashes in which thousands of people died.
Oxfam said that the lives of some 40,000 refugees stranded in Kitanga,
north-east Tanzania, were most at risk.

West German consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent in December from November,
leaving the annualised inflation rate unchanged at 3.6 per cent, the Federal
Statistics Office said yesterday, Reuter reports from Wiesbaden.
The monthly figure compares with a rise of 0.2 per cent in November. The
year-on-year figure is down from a peak of 4.3 per cent in July.
Average inflation for 1993 was 4.1 per cent. All the figures were in line
with economists' expectations.

The Papua New Guinea government claimed last night that its security forces
were poised to recapture the large and controversial Panguna copper mine on
the island of Bougainville before the end of the year, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney.
However, Radio Free Bougainville was playing down the progress of government
defence forces, claiming that no PNG troops were moving towards the mining
township, although admitting that they were in the area.
The mine, originally operated by CRA, was once a main source of income for
the PNG government. It became the subject of a bitter and bloody clash
between local landowners, together with Bougainvillean secessionists, and
the PNG government in the late-1980s, and was closed down in 1989.
Any retaking of the mine is thought to be a largely symbolic gesture, as PNG
forces may have considerable difficulty defending the isolated township
against guerrilla attacks.

Little enthusiasm emerged yesterday for an offer by the six-member Gulf
Co-operation Council to cut oil output if other producers, including those
not affiliated to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, do
likewise, writes Robert Corzine in London.
The GCC, which includes Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, made its offer conditional
on non-Opec producers taking part in a production cutback to prop up weak
oil prices.
Analysts said some smaller non-Opec producers might go along with such a
strategy.
However, one analyst said that it was 'virtually unimaginable' that two of
the biggest non-Opec exporters, the UK and Norway, would abide by it.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Exxon wins Dollars 2bn tax dispute in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon won a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) tax dispute with the US Internal
Revenue Service in a transfer pricing case which it said would set a
precedent for other US companies operating internationally, writes Richard
Waters in New York.
The IRS had claimed that an oil trading consortium, of which Exxon was a
part, along with other US energy companies, had sold Saudi Arabian crude oil
at below market prices in 1979-81 to affiliates overseas. This reduced
taxable profits in the US, where the trading company, Aramco, was based.
In a ruling handed down late on Tuesday, the US Tax Court backed Exxon's
argument that it had been constrained by a Saudi Arabian government
directive at the time. The kingdom was attempting to damp down the oil
price, and had specified the price at which Saudi crude could be sold, it
said.
'For the first time, a foreign legal restriction has been granted weight' in
a US transfer pricing case, said Mr William O'Brien, Exxon's general tax
counsel. Other US companies which operate under pricing restrictions outside
the US would be less open to challenge from the US tax authorities as a
result, he said.
This week's judgment also found in favour of Texaco, another partner in
Aramco. Two other partners, Mobil and Chevron, were not involved in the case
which led to yesterday's decision.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Paris bourse defies gloom on industry

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris stock market yesterday hit an all-time high despitepublication of
gloomy economic statistics revealing a steep decline in industrial
production during October.
The announcement by the Insee state statistics institute that industrial and
manufacturing output fell by 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively
during the month had no tangible effect on investors' enthusiasm for French
equities.
The CAC 40 Index continued its recent bull run by beginning the day's
trading with a rise to a record 2,239.7. It rallied again during the
afternoon to close at a new high of 2,243,02, an increase of 0.77 per cent
over the previous day.
However, the French franc faltered on the publication of the poor production
figures which came on the heels of Wednesday's announcement that household
consumption had fallen by 1.6 per cent last month.
The franc, which earlier this month returned to its old European exchange
rate mechanism trading bands for the first time since the summer currency
crisis, rose during the morning only to lose momentum. It closed in Paris at
FFr3.4079 against the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.4074 on Wednesday.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, sought to play down the significance
of the gloomy economic news by claiming that French economy was in a
'pre-recovery stage'.
Mr Alphandery pointed to the strength of the stock market, recent reductions
in interest rates and the mildly optimistic tone of some recent business
confidence surveys as encouraging omens for the future.
The minister said that the cabinet would assess in January the general
prospects for the economy and decide whether it was necessary to implement
special reflationary measures, thereby echoing earlier statements made by Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
In the meantime, the government has decided to extend its support for small
and medium-sized companies by providing a capital injection of FFr500m
(Pounds 57m) to Credit d'Equipement des PME (CEPME), an institution that
provides credit to the small corporate sector.
The capital injection should enable the CEPME to provide FFr5bn more credit
to small companies in 1994 than it has done this year. So far, small and
medium-sized businesses have borne the brunt of the French recession and
have triggered the steep increase in the rate of corporate failures.
The government will keep control of monetary policy until a new monetary
policy council at the Bank of France is named and installed, Mr Alphandery
said, Reuter reports from Paris.
He said the six lay members who will join the central bank governor and his
two deputies on the new council would be named at a cabinet meeting on
January 5.

FT  24 DEC 93 / German states to help flood victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several German states yesterday announced emergency financial measures to
help property owners flooded by the river Rhine following days of torrential
rain.
Troops in wading boots stacked sandbags in the basement of parliament to
keep the worst Rhine flooding in decades from knocking out its heat and
electricity.
The Rhine and its tributaries rose to their highest levels since the 1950s,
flooding thousands of houses along their banks.
Cologne's medieval centre was swamped as the river breached a 5km stretch of
bank. By early morning, the river had hit a near-record flood level of 10.39
metres.
Four people have died in the floods in Germany and a further two in France
and Belgium.
The rising rivers have blocked roads and stopped barge traffic on the Rhine,
Europe's main north-south artery, ruining Christmas in dozens of towns. Few
property owners in Germany are covered for flood damage. Only the southern
state of Baden-Wurttemberg has introduced special insurance cover for such
damage.
'A few insurance companies have started to offer coverage for floods since
early 1992,' said Mr Jorg Knospe, spokesman for the German association of
insurance companies. 'Very few households have such policies.' The North
Rhine-Westphalia government said it would provide tax concessions for
households and businesses suffering flood damage. It is also offering to
help families earning under DM2,500 (Pounds 980) a month by replacing
furniture.
Companies and self-employed people without insurance policies will also be
able to ask for credits and financial assistance from their banks, who will
receive state aid. 'The funds will be available to companies, especially
small ones, who would otherwise go bankrupt and fire their employees,' a
spokesman from the North Rhine-Westphalia government said.
The state of Saarland, where the usually quiet Mosel river turned into a
wild torrent, also said it would provide DM10m (Pounds 3.93m) for families.
In the states of Rheinland-Pfalz and Hesse, state officials said they would
offer individual amounts to households needing help.
Thousands of houses between Koblenz and Dusseldorf were flooded after three
days of torrential rain. In Bonn, the Rhine stopped by mid-morning a few
centimetres short of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office and the new parliament
building.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Ciampi seeks modest budget surplus: Italian government to
approve measures raising extra revenue of L6,700bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has pledged to approve before the end of the year
additional fiscal measures to raise L6,700bn (Pounds 2.67bn) to add to the
1994 budget.
The extra receipts are considered necessary to ensure a modest primary
surplus (the balance between revenues and expenditure excluding interest
payments) of L31,000bn in 1994.
However, the continuing increases in the cost of social security and pension
payments, coupled with lower revenues, both as a result of recession, could
well force a mini-budget in mid-1994.
The 1994 austerity budget itself finally cleared all its parliamentary
hurdles on Wednesday, having been first presented in September. Its progress
was aided in the past three weeks by the agreement of the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) to give direct support to the various budget bills
instead of abstaining.
Another important piece of financial legislation also cleared parliament
this week. A new law will permit the sale of the state's huge housing stock,
held variously by local authorities, the railways (FS), the Ministry of
Posts and the Treasury.
Special discounts will be offered to encourage owner-occupiers, while 80 per
cent of the receipts will go towards building new houses and 20 per cent to
the Treasury.
With these pieces of financial legislation, the government of Prime Minister
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has virtually completed the terms of its mandate
undertaken in May.
An announcement on the dissolution of parliament is expected at the end of
the year. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday met Mr Giovanni
Spadolini, the head of the senate, and Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the leader of
the chamber of deputies, to co-ordinate the dissolution.
The extra 1994 revenues are expected to be raised via a further VAT rise,
plus increased taxes on alcohol and cigarettes as well as in selected stamp
duties. A further rise in already high petrol taxes was considered but
appears to have been ruled out, in part to avoid inflationary effects.
The new budget deliberately seeks to attack the deficit by seeking cuts in
spending rather than through an increase in the overall tax burden.
Thus, of the extra L32,000bn needed in 1994, L23,000bn will come from
spending cuts. The deficit is due to be cut from more than 10 per cent of
gross domestic product to 8.7 per cent of GDP.
Mr Sergio Cusani, a leading financial consultant whose trial for alleged
corruption in Milan is causing a political sensation, was yesterday ordered
to be released from prison.
Mr Cusani had been in prison for more than five months, refusing to talk to
investigating magistrates except in a public court. His trial began three
weeks ago, but he has refused to appear in court until now.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Moscow reformer criticises US stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A close aide to Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister and
the country's chief reformer, yesterday criticised the US administration for
'populistic' statements which suggested that the reform course associated
with Mr Gaidar should be relaxed.
Mr Vladimir Mau, a long-time associate, strongly reiterated Mr Gaidar's
determination to continue - and to deepen - the reform course with which he
is associated.
He said that Mr Gaidar's future participation in the Russian government
would depend on the government's commitment to radical measures.
He was speaking the day after President Boris Yeltsin said Mr Gaidar would
stay in the government and the reform course would continue.
'We do believe that any slowing down in the pace of reform could make the
situation worse in the immediate future,' Mr Mau said.
He said that the remarks made by US Vice President Al Gore suggesting
International Monetary Fund insensitivity to Russian realities, and those
made by Mr Strobe Talbott, special ambassador with responsibility for the
Soviet Union, saying that the US administration was not committed to any
particular brand of reforms, were beside the point. 'We have no particular
problems with the IMF's position,' said Mr Mau. 'The main problem we have
with the western countries is restrictions on our exports.'
Mr Mau said that the reformers 'have paid a very heavy political price in
the elections for their policies. It would be silly not to use the time now
to continue these reforms, by throwing them away for some other policies
which would not address the real problems.'
The vital issue, he said, was the continuing support of the president. The
parliament's lower house, or State Duma - where reformist parties are in a
minority - could only block measures if a two-thirds majority could be
mobilised against them.
However, he warned that the two other reformist parties, the Yabloko group
led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky and the Party of Unity and Accord led by Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, 'might oppose some specific reforms'. In that case, Mr
Gaidar's Russia's Choice group, which has at most 103 deputies out of 450,
might find itself without the necessary third of the votes to block a motion
against the government.

Russia's State Precious Metals Committee yesterday denied allegations by De
Beers that it was selling uncut diamonds to the Antwerp market in breach of
an agreement to sell only through the South African diamond cartel, Reuter
reports from Moscow.
The committee, Komdragmet, has nothing to do with exports and did not leak
diamonds to the market in breach of the deal with De Beers said Mr Boris
Pozdnyakov, the committee's deputy chairman.
'We never exported any diamonds to the Antwerp market,' he said. But he
attacked the De Beers contract, saying Russia was losing at least 30 per
cent of its potential profits in diamond sales because of the agreement.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Peace hopes hit as IRA limits truce to three days: Sinn Fein
official hints at future action against troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A top Sinn Fein official dealt a blow to Anglo-Irish efforts to bring peace
to Northern Ireland, as the IRA announced last night that its traditional
Christmas ceasefire would last only the usual 72 hours.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a key figure in the Republican leadership, used a
newspaper interview to hint that last week's Downing Street declaration
would not be enough to persuade the IRA to end its 25-year armed struggle.
The political situation had not 'developed to a position where Sinn Fein can
use its influence to end attacks on the British Crown forces', Mr McGuinness
said.
His remarks came as nearly 450 prisoners - many convicted of terrorist
offences and 100 serving life sentences - were let out of the province's
jails to spend Christmas with their families.
Coming just a week after the Major-Reynolds declaration, the traditional
Christmas exodus is expected to fuel debate over whether to embrace the
peace process.
Senior IRA men released yesterday at the same time as loyalist prisoners are
expected to be involved in talks with Sinn Fein leaders about their response
to the joint declaration.
That may add to pressure on Republican leaders to demand an amnesty for IRA
prisoners as part of any peace deal. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, called this week for all IRA prisoners to be released as part of
a negotiated settlement - a position echoed by Mr McGuinness.
Meanwhile, the acquittal of two Royal Marines charged with attempting to
murder two Roman Catholic brothers in a checkpoint shooting added to tension
in the province.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, said he
was 'very depressed' by the verdict, which was also condemned by Mr Tom
Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman.
Interviewed in the Derry Journal, Mr McGuinness - who played an important
role in this year's secret contacts between Sinn Fein and the British
government - said that last week's declaration had to be 'backed by
actions'. Taken alone, 'for all its grand phraseology', it was 'not going to
solve the problems'.
He warned that any reintroduction of internment would be 'a recipe for
disaster' leading to another 25 years of violence.
Downing Street responded to Mr McGuinness's comments by reiterating that it
was interested only in a permanent cessation of violence leading to a
lasting peace. Mr McGuinness's statement coincided with an announcement by
the IRA of a 'temporary suspension' of their campaign for 72 hours, starting
at midnight.
The IRA announces a three-day ceasefire every Christmas, but hopes had been
raised that a longer ceasefire would be announced this year to give scope
for the peace initiative to gather further momentum.
The prisoners, selected from the 1,845 in custody in the province, are due
to return to the Maze, Maghaberry and other prisons by December 30.
Some 20 IRA prisoners were let out of jails in the Irish Republic yesterday
under similar arrangements.
The UK release scheme was introduced in 1948 and is confined to Northern
Ireland. It was extended five years ago to include 'lifers' who have served
at least 11 years of their sentence.

Shops around Britain yesterday reported a significant improvement in
Christmas sales over last year, and said there were signs of confidence
returning to the retail sector.
Sales were reported to have been particularly strong in the past two weeks,
after a slow November, but the picture around the country was mixed.
Central London, Scotland and parts of south-east and north-east England
reported buoyant trading, but the Midlands and south-west England were more
subdued.
The British Retail Consortium, representing 300,000 retail outlets, said it
thought sales nationally had been between 13 per cent and 17 per cent up on
last year over the last two weeks.
'Most retailers are seeing much more customer traffic, and they are really
prepared to spend money,' the consortium said. 'But it is still very much in
the medium and lower price bracket.'
John Lewis Partnership said sales at its 22 department stores last week were
up 10.6 per cent overall, and it was 'very happy' with trading this week.
Littlewoods' 124 chain stores were said to have enjoyed sales on Sunday and
Monday that were 40 per cent better than the equivalent days last year.
Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges and chairman of the Oxford
Street Association in London, said his department store enjoyed a 'double
figure' sales increase last week. He said most large stores on Oxford Street
were likely to report similar results, in spite of the disruptive bomb
alerts earlier this week.
As well as traditionally popular presents such as perfumes, cosmetics,
lingerie, books and clothing, items reported to be selling well included
Lady Thatcher's autobiography, and the video, chart-topping record and doll
of Mr Blobby, the tele-vision character. Nielsen, the market research
company, said the pick-up in sales was not confined to gifts. It said
grocery sales totalled Pounds 928m last week - 10 per cent higher than an
average week.
Not all this year's targets were exceeded, however. Barclaycard, the UK's
largest credit card company, said spending on its card was up only 8 per
cent for the month of December, compared with a forecast of 14 per cent -
although it was 15 per cent up for last weekend.
Some retailers reported customers using cash rather than credit cards. 'We
hope they're saving the credit cards for the sales, which start on Monday,'
said one shopping centre manager.

FT  24 DEC 93 / London outpaces continental bourses as investors pour in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market climbed to another record close yesterday as dealers
scrambled for shares to balance their trading books before Christmas.
The move reflected a positive investment environment throughout continental
Europe where five of the six top bourses hit new highs yesterday.
German institutional investors took Frankfurt up just more than 1 per cent
to a fresh record as west German inflation figures showed a slowing monthly
figure. Paris was lifted to its highest close by a strong French bond market
and an inflow from mutual funds.
Among the others, in Zurich, Amsterdam and Madrid, equities hit their fifth
consecutive record figures, boosted by continued strong liquidity and hopes
of lower interest rates in the new year.
But the gain of about 1.2 per cent in London outpaced gains in the other
European bourses.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which represents the UK's 100 most highly valued
companies, closed up 40.8 on the day at 3,396.5 after breaking briefly
through 3,400.
The London market is fuelled by hopes that bank base rates will fall again
in the new year, down from the current 5.5 per cent. Renewed demand for
shares yesterday caught out the market-making firms, which were already
having great difficulty finding stock for delivery to the buyers who have
been driving the market ahead for the past month.
The FT-SE 100 has risen more than 1,000 points since the UK left the
European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. This year investment
institutions and the securities firms that service them have made
substantial profits.
Buying pressure was exacerbated by continuing background activity in the
derivatives markets. Foreign investors have been funnelling money into the
UK since the summer and using derivatives as an efficient way into the stock
market.

FT  24 DEC 93 / Mobile phone sales soar to record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cellular phone, until recently regarded as a yuppie toy, appears to be
on the verge of breaking through to the mass market.
Mobile phone sales are at record levels in the run-up to Christmas as the
better-off hunt for fashionable stocking fillers.
Cellnet, the UK's second largest mobile phone operator, will connect nearly
as many new subscribers to its network this month as in the whole of 1992.
By the end of the year, the UK's three mobile phone operators will have
nearly 2m subscribers between them. The tally was 1.4m at the start of the
year, built up over eight years.
Cellnet expects a net increase of more than 50,000 subscribers in December,
compared with 67,000 in 1992. Last December the company made a net gain of
15,000 customers.
Mr William Ostrom, Cellnet's director of corporate affairs, said: 'The
market seems to have reached the point of take-off; price is ceasing to be
regarded as a barrier.'
The pre-Christmas sales rise comes after two months of rapid growth. In
November, Cellnet made a net gain of 35,000 subscribers, and in October,
25,000. In November 1992, its net gain was 8,300.
Vodafone and Mercury One-2-One, the other two network operators, have not
disclosed their December subscriber numbers. But last month Vodafone, the
largest operator, made a net gain of 29,382 subscribers, the highest monthly
increase since its service opened in 1985.
Mercury One-2-One is estimated by analysts to have about 35,000 subscribers
in the London area, all gained since the launch of its network in September.
Cellnet and Vodafone opened up the market a year ago with lower tariffs for
occasional users, now at Pounds 25 for connection and a Pounds 12.77 monthly
subscription.
But Mercury One-2-One's launch, featuring free local calls in the evenings
and at weekends for residential users and off-peak tariffs for business
users down to 8p a minute, is widely credited with forging the breakthrough.
Mr Robin Meakin, mobile communications analyst with CIT Research, a London
consultancy, said cellular telephony was 'set to become far more competitive
next year, as handset prices fall and a fourth network is launched by
Hutchison Microtel'. CIT forecasts 7m mobile phone subscribers by 2003,
about 12 per cent of the population.
The Financial Times' mobile communications newsletter says subscriber
numbers in western Europe rose by 45 per cent in the year to December 1,
with strong growth in Germany and Spain.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Prague awaits its spring chicken
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After the revolution came McDonald's. Now the famous hamburger will face
much tougher competition from fast-food rival Kentucky Fried Chicken which
plans to expand significantly its presence in central and eastern Europe.
KFC intends to open up to 40 restaurants over four years in the Czech
Republic, one of the region's strongest markets, as well as increase the
number of its restaurants in Poland.
KFC's move is its biggest commitment yet in the region. But it faces stiff
competition from McDonald's which was quicker to take advantage of the
opening of the former communist markets and of the popular appetite for
western and American products and fashions - catching the headlines when it
opened its Moscow restaurant in 1990.
McDonald's began its activities in the region in 1988 with restaurants in
the former Yugoslavia and Hungary, then rapidly built up its presence with
more than 40 outlets currently operating in the region including Poland, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Russia.
But Pepsico, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which specialises in
Mexican food, is fighting back in the war to win eastern European palates
weaned on the more stolid fares of pork, goulash, dumpling and boiled
cabbage.
KFC's move into the Czech Republic is part of a strategy of rapid
development in the region. 'We also have very aggressive growth plans in
Poland where we will open at least another 10 outlets next year,' says Mr
David Rutley, business development director for central Europe at Pepsico
Restaurants' division in London. Pepsico currently has two restaurants in
Warsaw, and three in Budapest.
The company is upbeat about prospects in the Czech Republic where it will be
partner in a joint venture with Motokov, a diversified Czech trading
company. 'Our experience in Poland has been wildly successful,' a spokesman
at the company's headquarters in Louisville, said. The Czech Republic has
good economic prospects and chicken is already part of the local diet.
KFC's first Czech outlet will be opened in the summer and offer its standard
fare of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and biscuits. Encouraged by results
elsewhere in the region, the company is confident of success.
The main competition will come from McDonald's whose four outlets in Prague,
and another three in provincial cities, have been highly popular among the
younger generation. Pepsico admits there is sharp international competition
between the two groups on the global market, but says it is misleading to
talk of competition in individual markets. 'We offer very different
products, so we don't really compete in that sense,' says a spokesman.
But not everything goes according to plan. McDonald's closed three of its
six restaurants in the former Yugoslavia because of the civil war and the
United Nations embargo which prevents it from importing crucial ingredients.
Three restaurants remain, but they have been downgraded, losing the
characteristic red and gold arch symbol.
Finding good local supplies is crucial for keeping prices low in an
increasingly competitive environment.
KFC says it normally uses local suppliers importing only the recipe's secret
herbs and spices from the US, but the pale-fleshed Czech chicken may not be
be up to Kentucky's standards.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Chinese air hijack talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan and China yesterday ended five days of talks without resolving the
problem of frequent hijackings of Chinese aircraft to Taiwan.
The two sides could not agree on mutually acceptable language for an
agreement in principle that hijackers should be repatriated. Nine Chinese
aircraft have been hijacked to Taiwan this year.
The failure underlines the difficulty both will have in solving intractable
problems as 'unofficial' contacts gather pace. The talks were the third
round of negotiations on practical issues agreed by Taiwan's Strait Exchange
Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait in
April.
Taiwan officials said the critical gap remained Beijing's unwillingness to
accept Taiwan's 'right of legal jurisdiction' - a code phrase for the
island's sovereignty as a political entity separate from China.
Mr Shih Chi-ping, a Taiwan official, said: 'Although the mainland side is
eager for us to repatriate suspected hijackers, they are unwilling to accept
the fact that we have equal rights of legal jurisdiction.'
Mr Hsu Hui-you, chief negotiator on the Taiwan side,said the discussions had
for the first time 'got down to core issues.' But he said there were
'fundamental differences in thinking and methods to solve problems that made
it difficult to reach consensus on decisive issues.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / GE-led bid wins battle for Nuovo Pignone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is selling a controlling stake in Nuovo Pignone, the
gas turbines and compressors group, to a consortium led by General Electric
and including two other US companies, Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand.
The sale represents a significant political move by the Italian government,
which has favoured a US partner over European candidates in its first big
industrial privatisation. Both GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering
group, and ABB-Atlas Copco also bid for Nuovo Pignone.
The deal values the 69.3 per cent of Nuovo Pignone being sold by the Eni
state holding company at about L1,100bn (Dollars 660m). The figure
represents about L700bn for the equity and about L400bn in debt transfers.
Nuovo Pignone, which specialises in low-powered turbines and compressors for
the energy and chemicals industries, made net profits of L36.7bn on sales of
L1,977bn last year. The L7,000 a share bid is a significant premium for
Nuovo Pignone's minority shareholders compared with Tuesday's pre-suspension
closing price in Milan of L6,269.
Announcement of the deal, which had been under negotiation for more than a
year, was greeted by demonstrations by employees, who took to the streets of
Florence in protest.
The company's works council said the sale to GE represented 'the worst
solution', while Mr Giorgio Morales, the city's mayor, expressed concern
about the inclusion of one of Nuovo Pignone's biggest rivals in the
consortium.
Union leaders fear the sale could result in Nuovo Pignone losing its
independence and suffering redundancies among its 2,600 strong workforce.
Some politicians have also expressed concern about Italian state companies
falling prey to cash-rich foreign predators under the privatisation
programme.
Political concern to limit such fears and possible union opposition explains
the deal's complex structure. GE, always the most likely to win, will take
only 25 per cent of Nuovo Pignone.
A further 20 per cent will be held by six Italian banks. Some observers
believe the banks will eventually sell their stakes, of 2 per cent to 4 per
cent each, to GE once the political heat over the deal dies down.
The surprise, however, was that Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand, two
other US turbine or oil industry specialists, are taking 12 per cent each.
The two companies bid in tandem for Nuovo Pignone and may have decided to
join forces with GE when it became clear their offer would prove
unsuccessful.
A GE victory had seemed virtually certain from September 1992, when Rome
first announced plans to sell Nuovo Pignone. The company has co-operated
with GE for more than three decades, and the two have numerous
cross-licensing deals. Nuovo Pignone has used GE technology in its larger
turbines, and the US group has taken up ideas from the Italian producer for
lower-powered units.
As expected, Eni will retain a significant stake of 20.25 per cent,
reflecting the continuing interlocking interests between the two. Much of
Nuovo Pignone's business has come from Eni contracts. The current order book
partly reflects a massive deal, worth about Dollars 1.6bn, to upgrade the
trans-Siberian gas pipeline negotiated by Eni with the Russian government
last year and for which Italian export credit insurance cover has recently
been approved.

FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rehabilitation of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, was taken a stage
further yesterday after the bank announced its long awaited new senior
management structure. Sir Nicholas Redmayne and Mr David Clementi will share
the chief executive role at the merchant bank.
The moves were greeted enthusiastically by the stock market, where Kleinwort
Benson shares, savaged in the aftermath of the stock market crash of October
1987 and also by a disastrous bought deal in Premier Consolidated Oilfields,
surged ahead 30 to 591p, their highest closing level since just before the
1987 crash.
A banking specialist commented: 'After their half-year performance there was
really no need for any major upheavals in Kleinwort's businesses; the news
got a very receptive audience.' However, he also attributed part of
yesterday's upsurge in Kleinwort shares to an ever tightening squeeze on
marketmakers' short positions in the stock.
SG Warburg also participated in the strong showing of the merchant banks
sector, finishing 12 up at 942p.
News that Lasmo is selling Pounds 123m of offshore North Sea assets,
including part of its Liverpool Bay and Southern Gas Basin interests, came
as a surprise to the market.
The shares' failure to make progress after the move, generally greeted
favourably by oil sector analysts, was attributed to hefty selling pressure
by one of the leading US invest-ment banks involved in marketmaking in the
UK. Lasmo shares closed a penny harder at 114p. Turnover was a hefty 5.2m
shares.
'It is a good deal for Lasmo and they got a good price; it is gratifying
that the Lasmo directors are aggressively managing the company's assets
after the problems of the past year or so,' said an analyst.
British Gas was the market's most heavily traded stock, with more than 23m
shares changing hands. The stock price retreated 13 1/2 to 333 1/2 p, still
burdened by the market's poor reception of the Department of Trade move to
dismantle British Gas's monopoly in the domestic gas market.
There was also evidence of large-scale switching out of British Gas and into
British Petroleum. The latter improved to 358p following the switch moves,
but attracted flurries of US selling late in the session and closed
marginally easier at 355p.
Reuters jumped 44 to 1816p on a stock shortage in the wake of a number of
relatively large delayed trades which made up a large portion of the day's
1.2m share trading volume in the stock. The shares initially hit an all-time
intraday high of 1822p. Earlier SG Warburg reaffirmed the share on an
international asset allocation list which included nine other UK stocks.
International publisher Reed International forged ahead 22 to 890p, with
dealers focusing on a buy note from US house Goldman Sachs. Goldman was
unavailable for comment.
Chemicals concern ICI dipped 4 to 754p after BZW, the company's joint
broker, reduced its forecast for the group's 1994 profits. The securities
house said it had adjusted its forecast down by around 8 per cent but was
still above Hoare Govett's Pounds 350m bottom of the range estimate. BZW
added that it expected the shares to fall by between 5 and 10 per cent
before they became a 'compelling buy'.
Also in the chemicals sector, Courtaulds fell 10 1/2 to 455p as a result of
a technical trade in the options market by one securities house left with
too much stock on its hands. The trade offset the potentially beneficial
effect of a Pounds 2.7m disposal by the company. Courtaulds sold its
industrial paints business to Croda International, which eased a penny to
327p.
A worsening stock shortage and some determined buying by one of the leading
UK marketmaking houses was said to have driven the banks sharply better in
early trading. Best levels were not always held, however, and TSB ended a
net 1 1/2 off at 251 1/2 p, after climbing to 258p at the outset.
Sun Alliance, 5 up at 378p, shrugged off suggestions of a Smith New Court
downgrade.
Construction group Costain attracted some heavy activity - 5.7m traded  -
and closed 1 1/2 ahead at 28p, with institutions said to be chasing the
stock as a strong recovery prospect.
Food retailers came under renewed pressure as stories persisted of an
imminent outbreak of price wars and continued fretting over margins. Hoare
Govett added to concern in Argyll Group, arguing that the stock was
particularly prone to eroding margins. The shares declined 4 1/2 to 275 1/2
p.
In a mixed food manufacturing sector, Strauss Turnbull emerged as a strong
buyer of Perkins Foods, the shares appreciating 4 1/2 to 67p. The broker
argued that the stock had been oversold and that its yield was now double
that of the base rate and three times the market's yield.
There was another generally weak session in the drinks sector, with agency
broker James Capel advising clients to take profits. Most of the falls were
limited to the brewers, with Bass slipping 9 to 558p, Greenalls 5 to 450p,
Boddington 7 to 282p and Whitbread 'A' 8 to 579p.
Euro Disney slid 8 to 395p as auditors to the theme park operator said it
may have to close if it failed in talks to restructure its financing with
bankers and parent company Walt Disney by next spring.
P&amp;O strengthened after announcing the Pounds 117.5m sale of a large part of
its investment in a Hong Kong terminal. The company said the disposal would
add profits of around Pounds 44m for 1993. The shares finished 7 higher at
646p.
Positive comments from Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court were said to
have helped British Aerospace move forward 7 to 413p.

FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cut hits Coats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Textiles group Coats Viyella was hit after one of its joint brokers cut its
profits forecast for the company to reflect the slow recovery in the
industry.
Securities house BZW, which shares the brokership with Cazenove, was said to
have cut by Pounds 5m to Pounds 147m for this financial year, bringing its
estimate into the lower end of the current range of Pounds 145m to Pounds
155m.
The downgrade was followed by a statement from the company that it expected
to meet its original forecasts. Some in the market interpreted this as an
unwarranted move to dampen criticism and failed to take heart. The shares
remained at their low of the day, down 8 1/2 at 259 1/2 p.

FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking halted as equity buyers
reappear - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The optimists refused to be daunted by early falls in UK stocks yesterday
and, encouraged again by firmness in stock index futures, shares were driven
ahead towards the close by suggestions that a Swiss investment house was
putting together a large buy programme in UK equities.
In early trading the FT-SE 100 Index was down nearly 10 points as overnight
profit-taking orders were completed. But the day's low in the 3,333 area was
reached quickly and the market then benefited from firmness in other
European bourses and a solid premium on the March contract on the Footsie
index.
With several sectors facing profit-taking recommendations from UK broking
houses, upward progress was difficult and the gain in the market was stopped
at around 16 points on the Footsie before profit-takers came back again when
UK bonds turned sluggish.
The final punch came when the March futures contract moved to a strong
premium and shares moved close to the early highs. At the end of the
session, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 13.3 to 3,355.7. Renewed
demand for the smaller stocks took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new peak of
3,727, up 20.1 on the day.
Traders saw yesterday's performance from the stock market as convincing
evidence that the big investment institutions will not let share prices fall
very far below existing levels before re-entering the market as buyers of UK
equities. However, buying was somewhat selective with several sectors
lagging behind a stock market which has performed spectacularly over the
past two months.
Significantly, Seaq volume increased as the market turned higher and the
final total was 779.2m shares compared with 756.2m on Tuesday; equity
trading retail value in the previous session was Pounds 1.78bn, an
impressive figure for a pre-Christmas trading session. Non-Footsie business
made up around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, a relatively high
level compared to recent sessions which have been led by the Footsie stocks.
Interest rate hopes remained in place, inspiring further gains in the
merchant banks and other financial shares. Building stocks, also closely
linked to interest rate hopes, did well and the stores sector, which has
lain under a cloud, found buyers.
Strategists noted that the London market appeared to brush off news from the
corporate sector, which ranged from renewed threats of problems at Euro
Disney to another asset sale by Lasmo, the UK-based oil exploration company.
Sentiment was also helped at first by a steadier tone in Uk government
bonds, although this was unsettled later when both short and longer dated
bonds turned easier. The domestic bond market has been a prime force behind
UK equities, as the fall in returns on bonds has made shares more attractive
to institutional investors.
However, while impressed by the high trading volumes reported in the stock
market, traders pointed out that marketmakers are still trying to keep books
tight ahead of the extended Christmas holiday weekend, and that this makes
share prices highly responsive to sudden changes in investment direction.
The big institutions have largely closed down their trading positions for
the extended holiday break and are now content to overhaul portfolio
positions, trading only at the margins of their holdings.

FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Footsie futures regained their lead against the underlying stock market
yesterday as buyers returned, writes Peter John.
The March contract opened at 3,355 and moved ahead to 3,390, at which stage
it reflected a premium of some 30 points to cash. Then in the afternoon,
dealers said there was heavy buying linked to expiry of a large tailor-made
Footsie option expiring at 3,350.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment house, was believed to be behind the deal.
The house, which has a prestigious global client list, has become a by-word
for large futures related deals in the past few months. In mid-November it
bought 8,000 FT-SE puts - options to sell the market at a fixed time and
price.
By the official close, just after 4pm, the March contract hit 3,377 on
moderate turnover of 6,711 lots but the buying pressure pushed it back up by
another 10 points in after hours dealing.
Fair value for the March contract - the premium which factors in the cost of
carrying minus the dividends that would be had by holding the underlying
stocks - is estimated at around 18 points.
On the options side of LIFFE, total turnover of 49,139 lots was up from
37,336 lots on Tuesday but activity was boosted by expiry of a number of
stock options.
Some 25 stocks had their December series expiring and all the most
actively-traded issues - British Gas (5,634 lots), Dixons (3,582), Glaxo
(2,554), Barclays (2,494), TSB (1,846) and Hillsdown (1,698) - reflected the
technical situation. Turnover in Footsie-related options was less than
18,000 contracts.

FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late strength in bonds sends
Dow forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks rallied yesterday afternoon in response to an unexpected
surge in the price of longer-dated US Treasury bonds, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 17.04 ahead at 3,762.19,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved forward 2.02 to
467.32. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.06 higher
at 462.83 and the Nasdaq composite up 0.44 at 756.07.
New York SE volume came to 272.4m shares and advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 1,150 to 949.
The day's only fresh economic news was a rather stale morsel for equities.
The Commerce Department said it had revised its estimate of third-quarter
GDP to a seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of 2.9 per cent, up from an
earlier figure of 2.7 per cent.
Equity investors largely ignored the data, as did the US bond market, which
has turned its attentions to the prospects for sustained growth and low
inflation in the first quarter of the new year.
However, bond prices turned sharply higher in the afternoon when the
Treasury's monthly auction of five-year notes generated unexpectedly
aggressive bidding. The demand carried over to the benchmark 30-year issue,
which surged 1 1/4 to 100 7/16 in late trading.
Stocks responded in kind, staging a late rally after being held in a choppy,
directionless pattern during most of the session. The advance was given a
further boost by portfolio managers seeking to dress up their year-end
positions before Christmas.
Among the blue chips, Chevron was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 87 1/2 , Mobil
Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 77 5/8 and General Motors Dollars 3/4 firmer
at Dollars 55 5/8 .
UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 148 1/2
while its board was meeting to consider an offer by unions to acquire a
majority stake in the company.
Borden shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 17 1/4 after the food products group
denied reports that it was conducting talks over a possible sale or merger
of the company.
The semiconductor sector was a bright spot, with many issues retracing some
of their recent losses after Prudential Securities raised its rating on
Intel, in part because of an expected industry-wide increase in orders. On
the Nasdaq, Intel rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 , while on the NYSE,
Texas Instruments climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , Motorola Dollars
2 3/4 to Dollars 89 1/8 and National Semiconductor Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
15 1/4 .
With the battle to take over Paramount Communications apparently drawing to
a climax, QVC was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after the
directors of the target company voted to accept its sweetened Dollars 10bn
bid. Viacom's 'B' shares, the main currency in its rival offer, were up
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 and its 'A' stock Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars
51. Paramount slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 79 5/8 . Trading in all three
companies was sus-pended for part of the session.
Canada
The Toronto market posted a small gain in fairly active trading. The TSE 300
index finished 12.1 firmer at 4,226.8 and rises outscored declines by 426 to
409 after volume of 76.2m shares worth CDollars 790m. Industrial products
rose 1.01 per cent, leading the 11 advancing groups out of the 14 sectors.

FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Overseas buying spurs
Taiwan 4.4 per cent ahead

<TEXT>
Firm share prices in the electronics sector, led by Oki Electric, brought
the Nikkei average up a little ahead of today's national holiday, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fluctuated within a narrow range before closing 130.31 better at
17,445.74, after a day's low of 17,296.33 and high of 17,453.15. The Topix
index of all first section stocks rose 4.64 to 1,450.37, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.37 to 1,194.95.
Sentiment also improved on afternoon reports that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
prime minister, may unveil an economic stimulus package along with his
speech on political reform tomorrow.
However, many investors remained on the sidelines as uncertainty over the
political situation prevailed, and technical trading on the futures market
dominated the day. Volume was 280m shares, against 220m. Rises outpaced
falls by 587 to 396, with 179 issues unchanged.
The design of the government's package to stimulate the country's financial
markets, announced on Tuesday, had little affect on share prices. Along with
deregulation measures, the Ministry of Finance will allow the resumption of
rights issues, which have been suspended since March 1990.
Although the government hopes that an increase in blue chip issues will
attract investors back into the market, traders said the stock market had
enough supply already.
Oki Electric, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y510. Reports
that the company may post a pre-tax profit for the current business year to
March, instead of a pre-tax loss, encouraged investors.
The yen's fall against the dollar supported some export-orientated
high-technology stocks. The Japanese currency closed at a seven-month low of
Y111.30 yesterday to the dollar.
TDK moved ahead Y40 to Y3,800 and Victor Y10 to Y820. Automobile issues were
also strong, with Suzuki Motor up Y50 at Y1,060 and Honda Motor gaining Y20
at Y1,500.
But some stocks lost steam. Matsushita Electric Industrial closed unchanged
at Y1,490 and NEC lost Y3 at Y857.
Hanwa, the steel trader, fell Y20 to Y630. The company, known for the large
losses on financial investments it made during the late 1980s, has been
facing selling due to worries over financial difficulties. Moody's Investors
Service yesterday lowered its credit ratings for the company from BA2 to B1.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 8.73 to 19,221.65 in volume of 129.3m
shares.
Roundup
The region produced another selection of new highs yesterday, with major new
issue debuts, so far, failing to make much of a dent in demand.
TAIWAN soared 4.4 per cent to a 29-month high in hectic trade, the weighted
index closing 228.88 stronger at 5,474.75 as turnover nearly doubled from
TDollars 55.24bn to TDollars 103.92bn.
Financials led the gains, surging 6.6 per cent as signs of foreign buying
were used as an excuse to act on bullish domestic sentiment and loose
liquidity. Insurance stocks, including Cathay, Fubon and Shinkong, were all
the day's limit up.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further speculative buying and renewed institutional
interest, the KLSE composite index ending 24.77 higher at a new closing peak
of 1,121.38.
Volume swelled to 776m shares from 497.8m and the big winners, again, were
rubber and tin stocks driven by takeover rumours.
BANGKOK hit its new high on heavy buying of finance and brokerage houses in
the afternoon, and on active trade of the new Telecom Asia listing.
The SET index climbed 16.52 points to 1,523.75 in active trading of
Bt24.75bn, with TA, the most active stock on Bt4.32bn turnover, finishing at
Bt116 against an initial offer price of Bt55.
HONG KONG talked of bargain hunting, although the 183.68, or 1.75 per cent,
gain in the Hang Seng index left it just over 100 points short of Monday's
record high - itself 99 per cent higher than the January 4 low for the year.
Turnover was HKDollars 7.66bn against an adjusted HKDollars 9.09bn on
Tuesday. The real estate sector, weak on Tuesday, led the gains with Sun
Hung Kai Properties putting on HKDollars 4 at HKDollars 61.50.
NEW ZEALAND strengthened after a weak start to close 1.2 per cent ahead, the
NZSE-40 index rising 24.81 to 2,071.78 in turnover of NZDollars 46 million.
Telecom rebounded from selling earlier in the week, ending NZDollars 10
higher at NZDollars 395.
AUSTRALIA fell as another fall in News Corp triggered profit-taking in most
sectors. The All Ordinaries index finished 13.8 lower at 2053.2 in turnover
of ADollars 620m.
News Corporation, which dropped 33 cents on Tuesday, fell another 38 cents,
or nearly 4 per cent to ADollars 9.32. Investors worried about the USDollars
1.5bn the company paid to broadcast the next four seasons of National
Football Conference games in the US.
KARACHI closed lower on profit-taking by jobbers and institutional investors
after the steep rises of the past few days, the KSE 100 index falling 14.38
to 2,062.86.
BOMBAY, pensive after the parliamentary report on last year's Rs40bn stock
scandal, stayed closed for the seventh successive session due to a brokers'
boycott after a ban on forward trading. There was some hope that this issue
could be resolved today.

FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate considerations
take bourses higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the corporate news, especially in Paris, was not inspiring, rate
cut hopes extended this week's rally, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS climbed on renewed hope for interest rate cuts, prompted by the
strength of the franc and following the Dutch and Danish interest rate cuts
on Tuesday.
The CAC-40 index closed 9.93 higher at 2,225.79 in turnover of FFr5.9bn.
However, the outstanding moves of the day were on the downside.
The leisure business looked grim. Club Med fell FFr14, or 4 per cent to
FFr321. After hours it said that a big loss in 1992-93 partly reflected
local political conditions in Egypt, Senegal, Turkey and the former
Yugoslavia, where 14 holiday villages had to be closed.
At Euro Disney, an auditors' report on 1992-93 said that it would need
financial support to face its contractual obligations in 1994. Analysts said
that there was nothing new in this but the shares fell another FFr1.40 to
FFr34.10.
Suez dropped FFr2.20 to FFr340 as the biggest block trade of the day, 1.12m
shares, went through the market at a price of FFr331.50.
MADRID, too, was lifted by interest rate talk of interest rate cuts in the
near future, the general index rising in spite of late profit-taking to
close 1.26 higher at 317.84, in strong turnover of Pta32bn.
MILAN continued higher as expectations of imminent passage of the 1994
budget and growing hopes of an interest rate cut contributed to the positive
sentiment. The Comit index added 8.67 to 619.46.
Ferruzzi added L50 to L2,150 and Montedison L50 or 5.8 per cent to L915 in
continued response to the launch of their complex capital increases on
Tuesday.
Stet, the state telecommunications holding company, rose on speculation that
it would follow Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano in making
savings shares convertible into ordinary shares in the run up to
privatisation. Its savings shares rose L73 to L3,392 while the ordinary
added L33 to L4,253. Shares in Sip, the domestic telephone operator, climbed
L37 to L3,577.
Industrials found support in interest rate expectations. Fiat climbed L35 to
L4,403 and Pirelli by L28 to L2,182. Olivetti, strong in recent days on
speculation that the company would be awarded Italy's second cellular
telephone licence, added another L10 to L2,130.
FRANKFURT climbed on strong trade figures and as the state of Hesse
confirmed the slowdown in West German inflation. The DAX index hit a new
closing high of 2,197.51, up 12.58, then broke up through 2,200 to end the
post bourse at 2,209.17.
Turnover fell from DM10.2bn to DM9.2bn. A large buy order in London took
Siemens up DM14 to DM770.50, and another DM5 to DM775.50 in the post-bourse.
Allianz fell another DM15 to DM2,920, reflecting the big line in the
insurer's stock which came out late last Friday.
German institutions continued to buy defensive stocks. In utilities, RWE
rose DM9 to DM504, Veba DM9.50 to DM515 and Viag DM10.20 to DM495.
In steels, Preussag and Thyssen rose DM6 to DM424 and DM3 to DM263.50,
benefiting from the positive trade data, while Mannesmann's telecoms
prospects saw the latter up another DM7.50 to DM419.80.
Lufthansa continued to be depressed by worries over the implementation of
the US-German air traffic treaty signed earlier in the year. The airline
lost DM3.50 at DM168.
ZURICH established its fourth consecutive record close, the SMI index adding
24.4 to 2,942.4, with the continued strength of the franc attracting foreign
funds hoping for exchange rate gains on further currency appreciation.
Derivative instruments supported some shares. UBS, SFr18 higher at SFr1,384,
issued warrants on its own shares, while Bankers Trust set warrants on
Ciba-Geigy, whose bearers added SFr8 to SFr920.
However, the strong franc also depressed some export-oriented shares. Brown
Boveri shed SFr7 to SFr1,048.
AMSTERDAM saw brisk foreign demand which took the CBS Tendency index 0.9
higher at 146.7.
Publishers were again at the centre of attention. Elsevier gained Fl 4.10 to
Fl 177.60 and Wolters Kluwer Fl 3.20 to Fl 122.20, although VNU fell Fl 1.90
to Fl 163.10.
COPENHAGEN staged a solid comeback, casting aside days in the doldrums after
the central bank's latest deposit and discount rate cuts to 6.25 per cent
which took effect from the opening of trade.
The KFX index added 2.28 or 1.65 per cent to 102.76, in sizeable turnover of
SKr692m.
OSLO added 1.1 per cent, supported by by falling interest rates. The
all-share index climbed 6.08 to 586.75 in turnover of NKr774m after
three-month money market interest rates fell to 5.42 per cent from 5.54 per
cent.

FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Manila finishes year with flourish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippine equity market, a laggard in recent years, is finishing 1993
with a flourish. The Manila composite index, higher again yesterday, has
risen by a cumulative 8.8 per cent this week, for an advance of 24.2 per
cent since the start of December and 128.7 per cent since the year began.
The surge has been fuelled by consistently strong foreign demand, projecting
a take-off in the economy and corporate profits after two years of zero GDP
growth.
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity sees growth of 2 1/2 per cent this year, not
less than 4 1/2 per cent in 1994, and more in subsequent years as the World
Bank eases its influence on the economy.
The pick-up has accompanied government moves to overcome long standing
electricity shortages: a series of new power stations will supplement
existing hydro-electric generation and overcome seasonal shortages.
Five stocks account for 90 per cent of the market capitalisation, with PLDT
and San Miguel having the highest profiles with overseas investors.
PLDT, traded overnight as an ADR in New York, regularly provides a clue to
the local market's subsequent direction. Asia Equity sees deregulation as
the key to the imminent exploitation of a vast potential for expansion of
the local telecoms market, and a resulting surge in PLDT's performance.
It forecasts earnings per share of 517 pesos fully diluted for the year
2000, adding that a 20 times multiple that year, still low for the sector,
would give a share price of 10,340 pesos - more than five times the current
value. 'Discounted back to today, this gives a current share price valuation
of 4,225 pesos - more than twice the current price and 43 times 1994's
earnings.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Belgium reduces rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helped by the continued strength of its currency against the D-Mark, Belgium
yesterday joined the Netherlands and Denmark in the latest round of European
interest rate reductions, writes Conner Middelmann.
The Belgian central bank shaved 10 basis points off its key central rate to
7.40 per cent and lowered its overnight lending rate by 10 basis points to
9.10 per cent.
On Tuesday, the Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate by 10 basis
points to 5.70 per cent and the Danes lowered their discount rate by 25
basis points. Following Tuesday's discount rate cut, the Danish central bank
yesterday lowered its key rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements
by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent.
All three currencies remained buoyant against the D-Mark on widespread hopes
that the rate cuts would spur economic recovery.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the Belgian and French francs
are now back in their former 2.25 per cent trading bands against the D-Mark,
while the Danish krone is hovering just below the floor.
The Belgian franc firmed to BFr20.73 per D-Mark, from Tuesday's close of
BFr20.76.
The Danish krone continued to gain ground against the D-Mark and finished at
DKr3.904, compared with DKr3.910 the previous day.
The Dutch guilder moved up to Fl 111.97 per DM100 from Fl 112.0 on Tuesday.
The Canadian dollar had a bumpy ride, dropping sharply on rumours that Bank
of Canada governor John Crow was about to resign and then jumping on the
news that Mr Gordon Thiessen, currently the bank's senior deputy governor,
would become central bank governor in January when Mr Crow's seven-year
appointment ends.
Mr Crow is widely respected for his tough anti-inflation stance, and his
rumoured departure sparked fears that the new government might soften its
commitment to low inflation in favour of inflating the economy. However, Mr
Thiessen's appointment calmed market fears of a more lax policy.
'Thiessen will follow the same policies as his predecessor,' said Mr Adrian
Cunningham, senior currency analyst at UBS, noting that Mr Thiessen has been
with the bank for 30 years and is the joint architect of the disinflation
policy that has brought Canadian inflation to historical lows.
In the morning the Canadian dollar slumped as low as CDollars 1.3482 to the
US dollar, at which point traders reported intervention by the Bank of
Canada to smoothe the currency. After Mr Thiessen's appointment was
announced, the currency rallied to CDollars 1.3370. Late in London it was
trading around CDollars 1.335.
Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, said the government remained
committed to a low inflation policy aiming at a 1 to 3 per cent inflation
range from 1995 to 1998.
Meanwhile, the US dollar retraced some of its recent gain against the
Japanese yen, closing at Y110.55, down from Y111.05 on Tuesday. It finished
in New York at Y110.34. Although most market observers think the dollar will
continue to appreciate against the yen in the coming months, many expect it
to range-trade between Y110.50 and Y112 in the near term.
The dollar's decline was attributed mainly to profit-taking in anaemic
trading conditions. 'The market is very, very thin and it does not take much
to move prices,' said a London currency dealer.
Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) also
put a slight dampener on the US currency, with the Fed seen sticking to its
neutral policy stance for now.
'Their open-market oper-ations (following the meeting) highlighted that they
are not moving to a tighter policy stance just yet,' said UBS's Mr
Cunningham.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar fell as low as DM1.6978 before recouping some
of its loss to finish at DM1.7020, down from DM1.7080 on Tuesday. In New
York it ended at DM1.7015.
The Swiss franc continued to strengthen against the D-Mark, breaching
technical resistance at SFr0.8470 and firming to SFr0.8433. It ended at
SFr0.845, up from SFr0.849 at Tuesday's close. Traders said the move was
made possible by thin volumes in quiet pre-Christmas trading.
According to one London trader, the Swiss franc is unlikely to strengthen
above SFr0.840 against the D-Mark, and looking to next year he expects it to
weaken back to around SFr0.86/87 in the first quarter as the Swiss central
bank continues its cautious easing policy.
The US dollar's weakness enabled sterling to break through resistance at
Dollars 1.490 to end at Dollars 1.4950. It closed little changed against the
D-Mark at DM2.5450, up from DM2.5425.
In the money market, the March short sterling futures contract rose by 0.04
point to 94.78. The contract looked cheap after Tuesday's sell-off, a money
dealer said.
The Bank of England initially announced a Pounds 1.7bn shortage, which was
later revised downwards to Pounds 1.25bn. In early operations the Bank
purchased bills totalling Pounds 341m, followed by further morning
operations where it bought Pounds 492m of bills. In the afternoon it
purchased another Pounds 27m of bills, and finally provided late assist-ance
of around Pounds 415m.

<TEXT>
Brazil's 1994-95 cotton output is forecast at 500,000 tonnes, up 40,000
tonnes from the current 1993-94 projection of 460,000 tonnes, according to a
US agricultural attache, reports Reuter from Washington.
The projection is based on estimated area increases in the two largest
Center-South region states of Parana and Sao Paulo, the attache wrote in a
field report and filed from Sao Paulo. Prices are expected to increase in
1994 and encourage producers to increase the area.
Production in the north-east region is forecast to repeat the 1993-94 level
of 50,000 tonnes, restricted by dry weather, boll weevil infestations and
limited and expensive producer credit.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's first platinum
development given go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The go-ahead was given yesterday for Zimbabwe's first platinum mine.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian steel and natural resources
group, announced that it would proceed with the ADollars 310m (Pounds 142m)
development of a mine and associated processing facility at the Hartley
complex, on the country's Great Dyke.
The project is a joint venture with Delta Gold, another Australian mining
and exploration group, although its funding will be provided solely by BHP.
Assuming that an investment agreement is successfully executed with the
Zimbabwe government, BHP will have a 67 per cent interest in the project,
with Delta retaining 33 per cent.
According to Mr Peter Vanderspuy, Delta's chairman, Hartley may be linked
with other properties on the Great Dyke to form a substantial platinum
producing area. He said recently that BHP and Delta were involved in talks
with RTZ Corporation and Anglo American Corporation about pooling their
interests.
Mr Vanderspuy suggested that the Great Dyke was geologically similar to the
Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the world's biggest repository of platinum
group metals. He believed the Great Dyke area had the potential to support
operations producing up to 600,000 troy ounces of platinum a year - about 15
per cent of present western world demand.
Delta said recently that discussions the Zimbabwe government had 'progressed
well' and that 'agreement-in-principle' had been reached on an investment
framework for the project. It is expected that the development will begin
fairly early in 1994.
Collaboration between the two companies on the potential project began three
years ago.
Delta, which holds an exclusive prospecting order on a 640-square-kilometre
area in the region, covering a major part of the Hartley Complex, invited
BHP to undertake a feasibility study on the possible extraction of platinum
group metals in 1990.
Under an agreement between the two companies, BHP was required to let Delta
know by the end of 1993, whether it intended to proceed with development of
the mine. Last week, announcing BHP's half-year results, Mr John Prescott,
BHP's managing director, made clear that the Melbourne-based company
intended to keep to that timetable.
The ADollars 310m project expenditure will be spread over a three-year
period, and the project will initially be designed to permit the mining of
about 2.2m tonnes of ore a year. Delta recently estimated that, on the basis
of 2.1m tonnes of ore a year, the mine would turn out some 150,000 troy
ounces of platinum, 110,000 ounces of palladium, 11,500 ounces of rhodium,
23,000 ounces of gold, 7m lb of nickel and 5m lb of copper.
The project is expected to employ over 2,000 people.
News of BHP's decision lifted Delta Gold shares, which ended the day up 10
cents at ADollars 3.77. BHP, however, shed 16 cents, to ADollars 16.36, in
the generally weaker Australian market.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead and zinc smelters cut
capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lead and zinc smelters are being forced to shut production capacity because
concentrates, their essential raw materials, are in short supply.
Concentrates are intermediate materials produced by mines and shortages are
building up because many mines have been closed, victims of low metal
prices.
Asturiana de Zinc of Spain, which has an annual capacity of 320,000 tonnes,
enough to satisfy about 6 per cent of western world demand, is the latest
producer to announce cuts. It said its zinc output would be reduced by
70,000 tonnes next year. The company already had been forced to cut
production by 10,000 tonnes a month in November and December.
Asturiana blamed concentrate shortages for its decision but some traders
pointed out that at present it was discussing 1994 supplies with mines
around the world and that the announcement might have been a negotiating
ploy. They also suggested that the concentrate shortage was only just
begining to bite in the zinc market.
However, the situation was more severe for lead.
Mitsubishi Materials Corporation of Japan said this week that it would close
its only lead smelting and refining plant in April next year - the plant is
Japan's third-largest with an annual output of about 30,000 tonnes.
'Adverse market conditions and other factors have made continued operation
of the facility uneconomical,' the group said. In particular, Japan's
decision to cut its tariffs on lead imports to 3 per cent from 9.1 per cent
as a result of the Uruguay round of international trade talks contributed to
this decision.
Ms Karen Norton, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, estimates that, with the Mitsubishi closure, about
130,000 tonnes of refined lead production cuts have already been announced
for 1994 compared with cuts of about 170,000 this year.
One of the other companies to have announced cuts, MIM of Australia, said it
was to shut one of its two Mt Isa smelters next year because its stock of
concentrates was running low.
The latest statistics from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group show
that in the first ten months of this year mine production of lead was down
by 10.7 per cent or 205,000 tonnes to 1.7m tonnes while production of
refined lead eased by only 1.1 per cent to 3.68m tonnes.
Mine output of zinc dropped by 9.3 per cent, or 439,000 tonnes, to 4.29m
tonnes while refined zinc production slipped by only 0.7 per cent to 4.55m
tonnes.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan counts the cost of
cotton losses - Many growers are now thinking of planting alternative crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An uneasy quiet prevails around the village 'Chak 38' outside Faisalabad -
the centre of agricultural research and planning in the Punjab province,
which is the source of much of Pakistan's foodgrain and cotton. A small
group of peasants have gathered outside the half-built house of Mr Bashir
Ahmed, a local landowner. The mood is sombre, almost funereal.
On the outskirts of the village, other peasants look, with a sense of
immense frustration, at the bare 21-acre holding that should have yielded Mr
Ahmed a valuable cotton crop. Their crops have also been devastated by this
year's widespread pest attacks and many are now thinking of planting
alternative crops. But if they do so it will be with heavy hearts.
Meanwhile Mr Ahmed is still counting his losses. The destruction was so bad
that he decided to plough his land rather than first taking the pick from
his cotton plants. The labour costs would have been more than the value of
the crop that remained after the pest attack.
The tragedy is not confined to the cotton growers themselves. It has turned
into a national setback for a country that was hoping partly to pay for its
economic needs out of a bumper crop this year. Almost 60 per cent of
Pakistan's export earnings come directly or indirectly from cotton.
The government now estimates that at least 15 per cent of the 12m bales of
cotton it was expecting has been lost. That projection subject to the
uncertainty caused by local newspaper reports, some of which have estimated
a loss of over 25 per cent. In the absence of reliable monitoring systems,
no one can be exact, but there is no doubt that the losses have been
substantial.
'We will not be able to achieve our targets and we may stay in the range of
10m bales,' says Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, the Minister of State for Commerce. 'This
definitely would be detrimental to our economy because the surplus of 2m
bales would have added to our meagre foreign exchange reserves.'
Human error is being cited as one reason for the setback. 'Where the damage
has been caused, it is because there was no virus here before and farmers
did not take adequate precautions,' says Mr Waheed Sultan Khan, director of
the government's highly respected Cotton Research Institute in Faisalabad.
According to Mr Khan, the worst hit areas were those with no record of
similar attacks in recent years. That created a sense of complacency among
the peasants and pesticides, which could have provided a useful safeguard,
were not used. The farmers did not realise the importance of doing so and
instead chose to save on input costs.
Cotton researchers are also looking into other factors that may have
contributed to the severity of the damage. Scientists at the CRI are trying
to establish a link between higher night-time temperatures - on average 3'C
to 4'C higher than in previous years - and its impact on the final yield.
They hope to develop new varieties more tolerant to such environmental
changes.
Meanwhile, back in the fields farmers like Mr Ahmed remain depressed. 'I
shall never sow cotton again although I have done it for 6 years so far,' he
declares. 'For us, there's no cotton, he says, waving his hand towards his
fellow farmers. His prophecy of doom for cotton reflects the attitude of
many other farmers, who are afraid that it has become a very high risk crop.
Despite such fears, however, it is not yet clear how badly Pakistan's cotton
production will suffer in the after-shock of this year's experience. More
and more farmers are show reluctance to face the risks of cotton growing,
but officials such as Mr Khan are confident that the profit motive will
ensure that most will soldier on. He estimates that spending Rs1 (2.1p) on
inputs for cotton can earn a farmer Rs43.50, a much better return than those
offered by other crops like wheat or rice.
Some officials are confident that Pakistan's success in raising its cotton
output in the past will prove to be the crucial driving force behind future
efforts to raise production. During the past four decades the countries
cotton production has risen by a factor of ten with the adoption of newly
developed high yielding varieties and improved husbandry techniques.
Back in the fields, however, many peasants find that track record of rapid
progress little consolation after this year's heart-breaking experience.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker forecasts tighter sugar
market for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sugar market should tighten somewhat in the new year as demand continues
to rise although the current ready supply to the world market and slow
import demand has kept prices steady, according to the latest sugar report
from ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodities broker.
The success of this year's Australian and Philippine sugar crops is
currently satisfying short-term demand, but Man suggests that the situation
may change early next year.
Brazilian exports could be reduced if production in the north-east is lower
than last year - fears of a 50 per cent drop in output have been circulated.
In addition, the outlook for the Thai and Cuban crops has deteriorated in
recent weeks.
Cuban exports were 60 per cent lower than last year in August at 132,964
tonnes. Concern over next year's crop has increased following heavy rains
causing possible damage and delay in harvesting.
Conversely, the Thai crop could be affected by dry conditions during the
growing season. A hesitant start to the Thai harvest and rumours of millers
buying back some of their earlier sales has added to the market's fears of a
poor outcome.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium anti-dumping suits
threatened by Alcoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminum Company of America will file anti-dumping charges against aluminium
exports from the former Soviet Union if multilateral talks in Brussels on
January 18 and 19 do not result in an agreement to cut world production of
the metal, the company's chief executive, Mr Paul O'Neill, warned yesterday,
reports Reuter from New York.
'If a solution doesn't come about in January, it'll be time to file suit
under anti-dumping laws,' he said. 'We could be successful in such suits,'
he added.
Mr O'Neill said he was 'somewhat optimistic' that the talks between
aluminium producing nations would produce an agreement to cut world output
temporarily 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year.
Western producers have blamed a flood of exports from Russia for a recent
slump in real world aluminium prices to their lowest levels ever in real
terms.
Speaking at an analysts meeting Mr O'Neill said, however, that anti-trust
laws in the US and other western nations posed a formidable obstacle to any
co-ordinated cuts.
'It's not possible under anti-trust law to have an allocation process,' he
explained. So, forming an agreement was going to involve 'an unbelievably
artful drafting process'.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on heavy auction bidding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds rallied across the yield curve yesterday after the
government's monthly auction of five-year notes generated unexpectedly
aggressive bidding.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/4 higher at
100 7/16 , with the yield falling to 6.212 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/8 ahead at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.184 per cent.
Early in the session, the market was content to remain in its pre-holiday
torpor, with no fresh readings on inflation to drive sentiment. The commerce
department's upward revision of third-quarter gross national product was
largely ignored.
The market had been anticipating possible difficulties in absorbing the
Treasury's offering of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes, as most
institutional buyers have locked up their positions until the new year.
However, a last-minute surge in demand developed before the auction's
bidding deadline, pushing the five-year yield down to 5.19 per cent, two
basis points less than expected.
Prices rose further after dealers who had sold borrowed notes in
anticipation of replacing them cheaply at the auction had to scramble to
cover their 'short' positions.
Canadian government bonds rallied strongly as the appointment of a new
central bank governor dispelled jitters about future monetary policy.
Rumours swept the market early that Mr John Crow planned to resign from his
position as governor of the central bank, leading to an initial decline in
bond prices.
However, the actual announcement of Mr Crow's resignation, and the
appointment of an internal candidate - Mr Gordon Thiessen, the senior deputy
governor - to the top position cheered the market, which expects to see the
central bank stick to its low-inflation policy.
Bond prices climbed across the range of maturities.
The release of better-than-expected inflation figures helped German
government bond prices to nudge up in thin trading.
The state of Hesse reported a 0.1 per cent rise in the month to
mid-December, giving a year-on-year increase of 3.7 per cent, against a 3.8
per cent rise in November.
Hesse is the second of the big four western German states to release its
December CPI figures. Bavaria's annual inflation rate, released on Tuesday,
was unchanged from November at 3.4 per cent.
The bund futures contract traded in a narrow range of 100.71-100.80 on a
volume of about 13,000 contracts.
Italy and Spain, Europe's high-yielding bond markets, both saw new buying
interest from foreign investors, gaining nearly half a point.
Dealers said expectations of an imminent interest rate cut propelled the
Italian government market, with progress on the approval of the 1994 budget
and the release of good inflation figures this week contributing to the
buoyant mood.
UK government bonds ended the day little changed, as the gilt market wound
down for the Christmas holiday.

Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) has arranged a USDollars
1bn debt issuance programme, less than a week after having its credit rating
cut.
Last Friday, Moody's cut the MTRC's rating for Hong Kong dollar-denominated
debt to A1 from Aa2. The move comes with concerns for political stability in
China and the possible impact on the colony. Moody's saw vulnerability in
the Hong Kong/US dollar peg.
Debt issued under the new programme, signed yesterday, can be denominated in
any currency, subject to agreement with MTRC, with a maturity of between one
month and 30 years. It may take the form of fixed, zero-coupon or
floating-rate notes.
The programme replaces a HKDollars 3bn medium-term note programme set up in
1988 and which has now matured.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Focus on Italy's new year offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issue activity was concentrated in the Euroyen sector yesterday as the
rest of the Eurobond market wound down for the Christmas break.
As a result, syndicate managers with time on their hands pondered the likely
terms of the Republic of Italy's forthcoming Y300bn offering, which is
expected to be the first big deal of 1994.
The current yield on Italy's outstanding 10-year Euroyen bonds, of 23 basis
points over yen Libor, provided the basis for the price talk in the market.
Some syndicate managers reported that price talk on a five-year maturity
centred around 30 basis points over yen Libor.
However, talk on a 10-year maturity was much more varied, ranging from yen
Libor plus 25 basis points to yen Libor plus 70 basis points. 'With no
guidance from the joint leads or from Italy, the market is taking numbers
out of the sky,' said one syndicate manager.
Most of yesterday's Euroyen offerings were the so-called 'high-premium,
high-coupon' bonds which have become fashionable in recent weeks.
Nikko, which has arranged most of these deals, said the issues were tailored
to satisfy demand from Japanese investment trusts wanting to shift away from
fixed-rate to floating-rate instruments.
However, other syndicate managers noted that the inherent capital loss on
the bonds also appealed to investors looking for ways to reduce their
capital gains tax bill.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has placed its ratings
of Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris (Scuap) and its related
entities on CreditWatch with negative implications. This follows the French
government's confirmation that Scuap is likely to be privatised in the first
half of 1994.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: US recalls a bumper year in
corporate fundraising - Companies enjoyed low interest rates and high equity
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US capital markets may not see anything like it again for many years.
Driven by the lowest long-term interest rates for a quarter of a century,
and equity dividend yields at the bottom of their historical range, US
companies have engaged in an orgy of capital-raising and refinancing over
the past 12 months.
Although the US capital markets are likely to remain busy for the first
quarter - and perhaps the first half - of next year, few expect 1994 to
match 1993.
Two forces have driven the surge in bond and equity issues this year. First,
low long-term interest rates have prompted a wave of debt refinancing. This
has been true both for investment grade and, even more notably, junk-rated
issuers, many of whom have refinanced paper issued during the last junk bond
boom of the late 1980s.
Second, high equity prices have made it possible for a wide range of
companies to issue shares, hastening the process of de-gearing under way
since the start of the 1990s. Unless bond yields go much lower, both of
these forces will be less in evidence next year.
Given the favourable conditions in the capital markets, it is not surprising
that bank lending has remained depressed. Total syndicated bank loans so far
this year amount to Dollars 340bn, some Dollars 20bn less than last year,
according to Loan Pricing Corporation in New York.
This decline looks all the more marked given the sharp improvement in the
financial health of the US's commercial banks. A moderate price war in bank
lending has resulted - though it has not been on a par with the 1980s, when
lending margins collapsed in the face of fierce competition. A typical
single-A rated company could now borrow at 40 basis points over Libor, down
from 50 basis points at the start of the year, says Loan Pricing. Also,
covenants have been relaxed for some better credits.
This amounts to a slight thaw, rather than an outright deluge. One sign that
the banks are holding out against pressure to give in to borrowers was the
resistance encountered by IBM last month when it tried to push down the fees
on a Dollars 10bn financing. It was the second-biggest corporate financing
ever arranged (General Motors had pulled off the largest earlier in the
year). The company had to sweeten the fees offered on the deal after some
banks balked at underwriting the transaction - though in general syndication
later, it proved a big success.
Two things could increase the demand for bank finance, though neither seems
likely at this stage. First, if the Federal Reserve chooses to give interest
rates a sharp push upwards, rather than adopting the gentle and gradual
tightening which is widely expected, the capital markets could quickly
become a hostile place.
The second factor which would change the complexion of the US capital
markets is a change in US corporations' need for capital. If the US economy
continues to grow at the pace of the last quarter of this year, rather than
slackening off, many companies are likely to build their inventory levels.
Towards the end of the year, if the growth continues at a fast pace, there
could also be demand for capital from companies looking to build new
capacity. Banks have been natural providers of both these forms of financing
in the past. Few banks, though, are expecting much of an upturn in demand
for a while.
Wall Street, meanwhile, is looking overseas for a continuation of the
capital markets boom. With interest rates and bond yields falling
internationally, the financing pattern that has characterised the US could
be repeated elsewhere.
'They're a couple of years behind in that cycle,' says Mr David Komansky,
executive vice president in charge of capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Most
US investment banks, he says, have been building their capacity overseas to
take advantage of the coming boom in international capital markets.
If this is right, the next stage of the capital markets boom will be felt
around the world, not just in the US.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian and UK gas groups plan
expansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
British Gas and Nova Corporation of Alberta, the Canadian petrochemicals and
pipeline group, plan to expand their international gas services and
processing interests through their joint majority stake in Natural Gas
Clearinghouse (NGC), one of the biggest independent US gas marketers.
Nova this week agreed to buy a 36.5 per cent stake in NGC for CDollars 170m
(USDollars 126m). British Gas has a similar interest in the Houston-based
company. The remaining 27 per cent is owned by NGC management.
NGC is best known as a marketer of gas, which it buys from producers both on
the spot market and under long-term contract.
However, it has become increasingly active in gathering gas from wellheads
and transporting it to its own processing plants. It also provides services
such as risk management and pipeline bookings for distributors.
Gathering and processing operations contribute one-third of NGC's income,
but that is expected to rise to about 50 per cent next year. Pre-tax
earnings were USDollars 46m in 1992. The business has grown by about 20 per
cent a year over the past seven years.
Mr Charles Watson, NGC's chief executive, said the company hopes to acquire
a large slice of the USDollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn of gas marketing and services
assets which it expects to become available during the next three to five
years. In addition to the US, NGC is seeking opportunities in Europe, Canada
and Latin America. It is discussing a partnership with British Gas in the
UK, and plans a similar joint venture with Nova in Canada.
Mr Terry Poole, a Nova senior vice-president, cited Argentina as another
possible area of co-operation between the three companies. British Gas has
an interest in a gas distribution system in Buenos Aires, while Nova has an
equity stake in a pipeline.

Dollars 10bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TelecomAsia, the Thai concession-holder for the installation of 2m new
telephone lines in Bangkok, immediately became the largest capitalised
company on the Stock Exchange of Thailand when its shares were publicly
traded for the first time yesterday.
TA shares closed at Bt116, more than double the initial public offering
price of Bt55, giving the company a market value of more than Dollars 10bn.
The company, a subsidiary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand (CP),
Thailand's largest group of companies, is now regarded by most foreign
stockbrokers in Bangkok as greatly over-priced.
With the contract to install telephone lines still in its early stages, the
prospective price/earnings ratio for 1994 is 500 times, falling to about 20
times for 1997 and 1998.
'It reflects the market mania that has now gripped Bangkok. Unless the
company has invented the secret of eternal life, nothing justifies a p/e
multiple above 100,' said one stockbroker yesterday.
Even TA's main asset - its contract to expand the Bangkok telephone system -
is in danger of being undermined by the slow rate at which the state-owned
Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) connects new lines to subscribers.
TOT staff have long profited from the acute shortage of lines and they are
reluctant to relinquish income from bribes, typically more than Dollars
1,000, paid for the installation of each new line. TA has sought to co-opt
TOT workers by offering them cut-price TA stock worth up to two years'
salary at TA's current share price.
Trading in TA was the focus of stock market activity in Bangkok yesterday.
Turnover in the shares amounted to more than Dollars 170m.
Thai mutual funds are expected to want TA shares because the company now
accounts for about one-tenth of the market's capitalisation and will be a
significant factor in the movement of the SET index.
Foreign suppliers and their local partners regard the Thai market as rich in
opportunities because the country has only three telephones per 100
inhabitants, compared with 10 in neighbouring Malaysia. Nynex of the US is
CP's partner and holds 15 per cent of TA stock.
TA hopes to lift the value of its Bangkok contract by using fibre-optic
lines for cable television as well as telephone calls, and is looking for
opportunities to expand abroad.
The CP group, controlled by the ethnic Chinese Chearavanont family, is one
of the largest foreign investors in China. TA intends to install hundreds of
thousands of telephone lines in China's Hubei province and to join a Chinese
satellite launching venture.

Rising stock markets in both Kuala Lumpur and Singapore helped Rashid
Hussain, one of Malaysia's foremost financial services groups, to post
pre-tax profits of MDollars 131m (USDollars 51m) for the six months to
November 30 1993, writes Kieran Cooke.
The figure represents a rise of more than 200 per cent on the equivalent

year while the Singapore market has risen by more than 50 per cent.
Rashid Hussain's turnover in the six-month period rose more than 200 per

Berjaya, the fast-expanding Malaysian conglomerate controlled by
Chinese-Malaysian businessman Mr Vincent Tan, has won a contract to set up
and operate a lottery system in the Philippines.
Under the terms of the contract Berjaya will install and operate 2,000
lottery terminals in Luzon province and Manila. Berjaya already runs the
highly profitable sports toto lottery in Malaysia and is undertaking four
lottery projects in China.
Berjaya has grown into one of Malaysia's biggest companies and Mr Tan has a
reputation as one of the country's foremost dealmakers.
While hotels, leisure and lotteries form the base of Berjaya's activities,
the company is also involved in light manufacturing and timber and recently
signed an agreement with the Hyundai company of Korea to make trucks in
Malaysia.
Earlier this year Berjaya teamed up with the UK's North West Water group in
a MDollars 6.27bn (USDollars 2.43bn) project to build, upgrade and operate
Malaysia's national sewerage system.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Profiting from new-found freedom
 -Thai telecoms sector is poised for rapid growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modesty does not come easily to those at the forefront of Thailand's
fast-growing telecommunications sector.
'Normally, we grow at a rate of 60 per cent a year,' says Mr Thaksin
Shinawatra, the former police colonel who heads the Shinawatra
telecommunications, broadcasting and computer group now valued at more than
Dollars 4bn, in answer to a question about the group's prospects.' That will
continue in 1994 and 1995, but between 1995 and 1996 I think the growth will
jump and probably reach 100 per cent.'
After years of stifling control by the government and the armed forces,
telecommunications networks in Thailand are starting to develop rapidly
under the influence of young, private-sector companies that have won
concessions to operate satellites and install millions of new telephone
lines.
Thaicom-1, Thailand's first satellite, was launched last week by Arianespace
from French Guiana and will be operated by Shinawatra Satellite. The
Shinawatra subsidiary - soon to become the fourth Shinawatra company listed
on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) - will also operate a second
satellite to be launched in August and possibly a third planned for 1996.
At least six other communications companies are being floated on the Thai
stock exchange to help finance the expansion of telephone and broadcasting
systems.
The first and biggest was TelecomAsia, the subsidiary of the multinational
Charoen Pokphand group that is implementing a concession to install 2m new
telephone lines in Bangkok; Nynex of the US holds 15 per cent of
Telecom-Asia.
Expansion of the telephone network is long overdue, and even the projects
now being implemented to install an additional 3m lines nationwide are
unlikely to meet pent-up demand.
Samart Satcom, which makes satellite dishes, is expected to begin trading
today. Next in line are United Communication Industry (Ucom), the mobile
phone operator whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by Motorola of the
US, and Loxley, whose affiliate Thai Telephone and Telecommunication has a
concession to install and operate 1m telephone lines in the provinces.
'The telecoms sector used to account for 5 per cent of the Thai market,'
says Mr David Gambrill, research manager with Peregrine Brokerage in
Bangkok. 'By the middle of next year it will be 18 per cent.'
Foreign fund managers are likely to have problems adjusting their portfolios
to take account of the increasing weight of the telecommunications sector in
the SET index.
This is partly because only limited amounts of stock are available to
foreigners; only 10 per cent of TelecomAsia, for example, is being sold to
the public, and only half of that is allocated to foreign buyers.
Price/earnings ratios for some of the newly-floated companies are also
likely to be very high, especially in the early years of implementing
concessions when costs are substantial and revenues low.
Investors will watch closely to see how much value can be added to such
companies by the use of new technology and by overseas expansion.
TelecomAsia, for instance, plans to use the fibre-optic cables it is
installing in Bangkok for cable television services as well as for telephone
calls, while Mr Thaksin says he can squeeze more value out of his satellites
by using digital compression technology to push as many as eight television
channels on to one satellite transponder.
Thai telecommunications companies rely heavily on foreign hardware
suppliers, advisers and partners, and there are doubts about how well they
can perform outside their home market, where they tend to benefit from their
political connections.
But that has not stopped them from seeking to expand beyond Thailand's
borders. TelecomAsia, having already raised the money it needs for the 2m
new lines in Bangkok, intends to use some of the proceeds of the public
flotation for foreign expansion, including a satellite launch venture for
China and the installation of new telephone lines in China and Vietnam.
Shinawatra already has broadcasting and telecommunications contracts in
Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines, and Mr Thaksin is also looking at China,
Vietnam and Burma.
Thailand alone should keep them busy enough. 'There are now half a dozen of
these telecommunications companies coming to the market,' says Mr Paul Ngo,
an investment analyst at H. G. Asia in Bangkok. 'It should be an exciting
year in 1994.'

deal

<TEXT>
Martin Marietta is to buy the space systems business of fellow defence
contractor General Dynamics for Dollars 208.5m in cash, the two US companies
announced yesterday.
The deal, which had been rumoured in the industry for several months, allows
Martin Marietta to enter the market for intermediate-sized rockets. It
already produces the Titan rocket, which is used to launch heavy satellites.
General Dynamics makes the smaller Atlas-Centaur launch system.
The sale underscores the sharply differing strategies of the two companies
to cope with shrinking defence spending following the collapse of the Soviet
empire.
General Dynamics has shrunk by selling off large parts of its defence
business, while Martin Marietta has been an aggressive buyer.
Its acquisitions include General Electric's aerospace unit for Dollars 3bn
last year.
General Dynamics will retain ownership of the space division's real estate,
including a 40-acre tract in San Diego with a Dollars 50m book value.
The space division had 1992 sales of Dollars 500m, employs 3,700 and has a
backlog of around Dollars 2.5bn.

Swissair

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swissair will make a small consolidated profit again this year, in spite of
suffering a large loss on its flight operations for the fourth consecutive
year.
The company's forecast was slightly more optimistic than that made in the
summer when the Swiss national airline said it would be difficult to break
even this year.
Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, said in a newsletter to staff that results
in September and October were 'pleasing,' with the load factor reaching 70.6
per cent in October.
Nevertheless, prices remained depressed and a 'massive loss' would again be
recorded on airline operations. Only substantial proceeds from aircraft
sales and profits from subsidiaries would make possible the overall group
profit.
Last year, the group made a SFr113m (Dollars 75.80m) net profit, due to
SFr179m from aircraft sales.
Following the collapse last month of the Alcazar negotiations aimed at
merging Swissair and three other medium sized European airlines, Mr Loepfe
said the group approved SFr211m in new capital spending on buildings and
installations.
He said the airline would concentrate on strengthening its existing
alliances with Delta Air Lines of the US, Singapore Airlines, Austrian
Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: State likely to sell Elf in
single package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is likely early next year to privatise Elf Aquitaine,
the state-controlled oil group, in a single issue, according to Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister.
Mr Alphandery said, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, that the
government would 'most probably' sell its stake in Elf, which is France's
largest company with a market capitalisation of over FFr100bn, 'in one go'.
It had previously considered selling the shares in two tranches.
However, he stressed the government would wait until the last possible
moment to decide how best to structure the sale and the timing of the issue
would be determined by stock market conditions. 'Elf is a pearl of French
industry,' he said. 'But it's a big mouthful for the market to swallow.'
Mr Alphandery also confirmed that 10 per cent of Elf's shares will be
allocated to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors.
A number of companies have already been mooted as noyaux durs including
Banque Nationale de Paris and the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance
group.
The government plans to remain Elf's biggest single shareholder by retaining
a 10 per cent to 15 per cent stake.

Borden, the US food and chemicals group, yesterday denied that it was

Early this week speculation about such a proposal surfaced in the US press.
Hanson Industries, the US arm of the British conglomerate, was reported to
be considering a Dollars 3.2bn offer for Borden, which has suffered from
declining profits and shrinking market shares for its diverse range of
products in recent years.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: State likely to sell Elf in
single package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is likely early next year to privatise Elf Aquitaine,
the state-controlled oil group, in a single issue, according to Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister.
Mr Alphandery said, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, that the
government would 'most probably' sell its stake in Elf, which is France's
largest company with a market capitalisation of over FFr100bn, 'in one go'.
It had previously considered selling the shares in two tranches.
However, he stressed the government would wait until the last possible
moment to decide how best to structure the sale and the timing of the issue
would be determined by stock market conditions. 'Elf is a pearl of French
industry,' he said. 'But it's a big mouthful for the market to swallow.'
Mr Alphandery also confirmed that 10 per cent of Elf's shares will be
allocated to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors.
A number of companies have already been mooted as noyaux durs including
Banque Nationale de Paris and the Union des Assurances de Paris insurance
group, as well as Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti interests.
The government plans to remain Elf's biggest single shareholder by retaining
a 10 per cent to 15 per cent stake in the oil group.
The French state controls 50.79 per cent of Elf, which means the
privatisation will involve the sale of a 35 per cent to 40 per cent stake
valued at between FFr37.4bn (Dollars 6.36bn) and FFr42.7bn on yesterday's
share price of FFr415.
The success of the Elf privatisation will be seen as an important indication
of investors' response to the next phase of the French government's state
asset sales.
This year's issues, notably the sales of BNP and the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals
company, have been heavily over-subscribed.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fokker set to cut prices by 30%

<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Deutsche Aerospace of
Germany, plans a 'drastic' reorganisation in 1994 that would lead to a
return to profit in 1995.
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, chairman, said in the company magazine the aim of
the reorganisation was to cut the cost price of Fokker's aircraft by around
30 per cent over the next three years.
He said the world's airlines were demanding lower aircraft prices as part of
their attempt to survive the fierce competition in international aviation.
Mr Nederkoorn cited the US car industry as a sector which had successfully
carried out an extensive reduction in production costs.
'It is unrealistic and very dangerous for the continued survival of the
company to wait for the market to produce miracles,' he said.
Fokker did not say how many jobs would be lost in the latest restructur-ing
round, but details are expected to be released before the end of February.
The company recently reduced its workforce to around 10,000 people from more
than 12,250 at the end of 1992. Dutch trade unions said they expected
several hundred job losses at Fokker.
Earlier this year Fokker said its results were expected to swing into a net
loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 79m) in 1993 from a net profit of Fl 120m in 1992,
partly due to the one-off costs of laying off staff.
Mr Nederkoorn said that 1994 was expected to be a 'difficult' year for
Fokker.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti in food industry deal
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the controversial financier who last week was severely
censured by the Ontario authorities for share trading misdemeanours, has
bounced back with a complex food industry deal in his native Italy.
Shortly after being released from house arrest by Italian magistrates
investigating alleged political corruption, Mr Cragnotti has sealed a
multi-billion lire accord to join forces with a little-known agricultural
co-operative.
Mr Cragnotti, a former executive of the troubled Ferruzzi group who set up
his own investment bank, has become the white knight in a complex deal
linked with Italy's privatisation programme.
Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, his banking group, is linking with
the Fisvi farm co-operative from Apulia to create one of Italy's biggest
milk and dairy products groups.
Mr Cragnotti has invested heavily in dairy products as part of a strategy to
create a big foods business by accumulating small acquisitions. The latest
deal involves pooling his two regional dairy products companies with part of
the food interests of the former state-controlled SME group, bought by Fisvi
earlier this year.
Fisvi entered the privatisation process after the IRI state holding company,
which controlled SME, failed to find a buyer for the latter's Cirio,
Bertolli, De Rica canned vegetables, edible oils and milk subsidiary.
While IRI quickly sold SME's Italgel frozen foods operation to Nestle, it
proved impossible to find a buyer willing to meet its tough conditions for
CBD. After a second round of tenders, Fisvi emerged as the surprise
candidate in September.
However, it had difficulty raising the acquisition price, in spite of having
agreed to sell-on CBD's edible oil business to Unilever.
Cragnotti &amp; Partners will now buy 10 per cent of Fisvi. The two will then
set up a joint venture, 51 per cent controlled by Fisvi, in which the latter
will pool its controlling stake in CBD and the bank will contribute its
dairy products interests.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banesto puts off bond issue as
ratings are cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banesto, the troubled Spanish financial group which in February entered a
capital raising and strategic advice agreement with the US bank J. P.
Morgan, has shelved a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue planned before the
end of the year.
The delay came as IBCA, the London-based rating agency, lowered its short
and long-term ratings of Banesto, from A to A- and from AI to A2
respectively.
The agency had lowered Banesto's long-term rating in June and its move
yesterday followed similar downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's last week and by
Moody's in August.
Adding a further controversial note to Banesto's fortunes, Ms Violy de
Harper, who as managing director of J. P. Morgan's corporate advisory arm
masterminded the agreement with J. P. Morgan's Corsair fund, has joined
James D. Wolfensohn, the New York investment bank. She will remain an
external co-adviser to Banesto.
Banesto was the first target of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio
set up by J. P. Morgan to invest in undervalued banks.
The bond issue was to be the third tranche in a programme that has already
raised Pta94bn (Dollars 671m) through new issues which turned the Corsair
fund into Banesto's biggest stockholder with 8.16 per cent of its equity.
The issue was aimed at lifting Banesto's capital to the level of rival
Spanish banks.
Banesto is run by Mr Mario Conde, who purchased shares worth Pta6.4bn in the
rights issue, increasing his holding in the bank to 3.1 per cent.
Banesto and J. P. Morgan said yesterday the bonds would be issued next year
after the Spanish bank's 1993 results had been fully audited.
This was the first official admission there had been problems over the
issue's timing and it fuelled market rumours, staunchly denied by both
Banesto and J. P. Morgan, that the delay had been prompted by a disagreement
between the two banks which had led to Ms de Harper's departure from the US
bank.
Wolfensohn said Ms de Harper was joining the firm as a member of its
executive committee and would be the partner responsible for its Latin
American and Iberian business.

<TEXT>
Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group, yesterday urged
shareholders to accept a CDollars 555m (USDollars 420.4m) takeover offer by
Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the Swiss industrial group.
Alusuisse is to proceed with its CDollars 14-per-share cash bid after a
month-long examination of Lawson's operations and financial statements.
Lawson directors said the offer was 40 per cent above the highest price at
which Lawson shares have traded this year. CS First Boston has provided an
opinion that the offer is fair to Lawson's public shareholders. The offer
expires on January 14.
Cragnotti and Partners, the Italian investment group controlled by Mr Sergio
Cragnotti, earlier agreed to tender its 52 per cent stake.
Mr Cragnotti last week removed a cloud over Lawson by agreeing to a lifetime
trading ban and a CDollars 2.7m payment to settle allegations of securities
law violations brought by the Ontario Securities Commission.
Although Lawson's head office is in Canada, about four-fifths of its
revenues come from Europe, especially the UK.
Alusuisse, which has substantial packaging interests through its subsidiary
A-L Packaging, has been attracted by Lawson's strong market share in the
folding carton, flexible packaging and label markets.
A-L Packaging is a significant participant in flexible packaging, but its
interests are centred on France and Germany.
It is keen to expand its product line and its geographic reach.

<TEXT>
Winterthur Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurer, and UAP, the
biggest French insurer, are setting up a joint venture company for credit
insurance in France.
The venture, called Assurcredit, will take over the credit insurance
business of Winterthur in that country which has annual premium income of
about FFr80m (Dollars 13.60m).
UAP, which does not have a significant presence in the credit insurance
sector, will bring capital to the venture and make its distribution channels
available.
Mr Michel Clerckx, a Winterthur general manager, said the groups hoped to
have the venture operating in April or May of next year.
Winterthur acquired a 3 per cent stake in UAP in December 1992 in exchange
for its 37.4 per cent holding in Nordstern Allgemeine of Germany. Mr Peter
Spalti, Winterthur chairman, said last June the group might raise this stake
when UAP was privatised.
Mr Clerckx said yesterday that would be discussed when the privatisation
plan was brought forward, probably in January or February.
He added that the two groups were discussing further co-operation, notably
by extending their joint activities in breakdown assistance for motorists.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Club Med losses prompt relaunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Club Mediterranee, the French leisure group, plans a relaunch of its 'sun,
sea and sex' holiday villages after plunging into the red with a net loss of
FFr290m (Dollars 49.31m) for the year to October 31, against net profits of
FFr161m in the previous year.
Mr Serge Trigano, who in the autumn took over as chairman from his father,
Gilbert, the founder of the group, said Club Med had been badly affected by
the European economic recession and by the enforced closure of its holiday
villages in Egypt, Senegal, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia due to local
political pressure.
He is implementing a rationalisation drive, including cutting operating
costs by FFr150m a year and closing 'five or six' loss-making villages over
the next three years. Club Med will also try to raise between FFr600m and
FFr1.6bn by selling up to eight other villages while retaining management
rights.
Mr Trigano also plans to modernise Club Med by relaunching the group for the
mid-1990s.
This will involve revitalising its marketing strategy and cutting prices by
15 per cent at selected villages. It will press ahead with expansion in
Asia.
Club Med's shares yesterday fell by FFr14 to FFr321 in anticipation of the
announcement after the closure of the Paris stock market.
The group had warned that it would record a loss in the second half on
publication of its interim results in September which showed it just managed
to break even with a net profit of FFr2m in the first half.
However, the full extent of the loss, which has not yet been fully audited,
was worse than analysts expected.
Club Med saw sales fall by 1.9 per cent to FFr8.09bn in the year to October
31 from FFr8.25bn in the previous year. It suffered throughout the year by
the squeeze on consumer spending in its three main markets France, Germany
and Italy.
These operational difficulties were aggravated by the closure of 14 of its
110 holiday villages in political trouble spots.
The group made an exceptional charge of FFr60m (from total provisions of
FFr90m) for political and legal risks in its 1992/93 accounts.

FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Heineken to buy Swiss brewer
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewery group, is to buy a 52.3 per cent stake in
Brauerei Haldengut of Switzerland which controls the second-largest Swiss
brewer, Calanda Haldengut.
The stake will be acquired from the Schollhorn family and from Winterthur,
the Swiss insurer.
Heineken declined to say how much it would pay for the shares.
Brauerei Haldengut's market capitalisation is SFr72.3m (Dollars 49.9m). The
remaining 47.7 per cent of Brauerei Haldengut is listed on the Zurich stock
exchange.
The Dutch brewery said it was still discussing the possibility that Calanda
would brew Heineken beer in Switzerland.
Heineken has exported its flagship Heineken brand to Switzerland since 1980.
Calanda, in which Heineken already owns a 10 per cent stake, distributes
Heineken beer in the south and east of Switzerland.
Calanda, with annual turnover of around SFr245m, has 12.5 per cent of the
Swiss beer market. Its two breweries in Chur and Winterthur have total
production capacity of 600,000 hectolitres of beer per year.
The company is also involved in soft drinks and mineral water.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1994.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KPMG sued over Medway valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two former directors of Medway Ports are suing accountants KPMG Peat Marwick
for alleged negligence in a share valuation, which they claim deprived them
of a multi-million pound windfall.
The suit was launched by former operations director Mr Des Crampton and
ex-legal director Mr Keith Middleton, who were made redundant along with
hundreds of employees earlier this year.
They are disputing the 250p valuation by KPMG in March, just months before
the company agreed to a takeover bid by Mersey Docks at Pounds 37.25 a
share. Employees who were made redundant were required to surrender their
shares, some to directors of the company, at Pounds 2.50. Mr Crampton and Mr
Middleton claim to have lost more than Pounds 4m by the KPMG valuation.
The company's four directors received shares and cash worth Pounds 20m in
the takeover.
A valuation by accountants Ernst &amp; Young found the shares would have been
worth more than Pounds 2.50. KPMG has claimed the value was depressed, in
part by uncertainty over staffing levels.
Mr Crampton said he expected other former shareholders to take similar
action.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICI to invest Pounds 9m in Bangkok paint
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, yesterday
announced it was investing Pounds 9m on a paint plant in Bangkok, Thailand,
as part of its Asian expansion policy.
The company simultaneously announced that its new paint plants in Malaysia
and China would be fully operational during the first half of next year.
Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, said: 'The expansion of our
Thai facility is part of a long-term strategy aimed at seizing the exciting
opportunities for sales of surface coatings in the expanding economies of
the Pacific Basin.'
The new plant will add 50 per cent to the group's paint capacity in
Thailand, where ICI paint sales have doubled over the last five years.
The facility, designed to manufacture solvent-borne decorative paints, will
be operational in three years. ICI already owns a 67 per cent stake in a
plant at Bangkok. The remainder is owned by the East Asiatic Company of
Denmark.
The Asian-Pacific region - including Australia which is an important market
for ICI Paints - represented about 22 per cent of the division's Pounds
1.58bn turnover last year.
Demand for paints and varnishes in the Asia-Pacific region was about 4.56m
tonnes last year, three times more than in 1970.
It is is expected to reach 6m tonnes by 1997 and could approach 8m tonnes by
2002, according to the European Polymers Paint Colour Journal.
Smith New Court, the broker, expects the paints division to generate sales
this year of Pounds 1.71bn, largely as a result of growth in Asia and the
North American market.
The division, which represented about 20 per cent of group turnover last
year, is expected to generate trading profits of about Pounds 107m, compared
with Pounds 115m last year.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ascot sells Belhaven to management for
Pounds 31.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ascot Holdings, the former Control Securities which finalised a debt
refinancing in June, yesterday agreed disposals which will cut debt by
Pounds 50m.
The company's shares rose  1/4 p to 5 1/2 p.
At the half year end on September 30 the property and hotel group's net debt
stood at Pounds 197.5m and it had negative net worth of Pounds 18.6m.
It has tied up the long-expected sale of Belhaven, Scotland's oldest
independent brewery which has a 61 pub estate, to a venture capital backed
management team for a total of Pounds 31.5m. The consideration compares with
net asset value of Pounds 16.4m.
It has also agreed the sale for Pounds 24.4m cash of Heywood Business Park,
a freehold warehouse distribution estate of 1.4m sq ft eight miles north of
Manchester.
The sale price was just above book value of Pounds 23.8m; the annual rental
income is currently Pounds 2.4m. The purchaser is Burford Holdings, the
property group which has been actively investing in property this year.
The Belhaven deal will cut Ascot's net debt by Pounds 25.5m, made up of
Pounds 17.7m in cash, Pounds 2.8m in preference shares and Pounds 8m of free
trade finance which the buyer will assume. However, Ascot will provide
Pounds 3m of mezzanine debt, paying interest at 10 per cent.
Ascot will purchase a 15 per cent stake in the buy-out company, Belhaven
Holdings, for Pounds 15,000 and has warrants to buy a further 10 per cent
stake for Pounds 10,000.
Mr John Kerslake, Ascot's finance director, said he was pleased to retain an
equity stake in Belhaven. 'We believe in the business but we had to sell
it', he said, because of Ascot's high level of debt.
Mr Stuart Ross, the managing director who led the BHL buy-out, said: 'We
believe the Belhaven brand can go a lot further'.
The Dunbar-based brewery, founded in 1719, produces 50,000 barrels of beer a
year, including Belhaven Best and 80/- cask conditioned ales.
The management is believed to have about a 50 per cent equity stake in BHL.
The buy-out raised a total of Pounds 36m which includes some funds for
investment in the pub estate. It was backed by CVC Capital Partners, part of
Citicorp Ventures, with senior debt arranged by the Bank of Scotland.
Mr Nazmu Virani, former chairman of Control Securities, first took an
interest in Belhaven in 1983 and became chairman of the company in 1984. He
sold his stake and resigned the chairmanship in 1986, but came back with the
purchase by Control Securities of the brewery and pubs, completed early in
1988 for Pounds 18m.
Mr Virani's arrest in connection with the BCCI collapse precipitated his
departure from Control Securities in March 1992 and refinancing talks with
the group's bankers.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O in Pounds 117m HK disposal - Sale is
part of company's realignment of activities in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation has sold a 9.47 per cent
shareholding in Modern Terminals for about HKDollars 1.35bn (Pounds 117.4m).
The shares, bought for Pounds 8.4m, have a current book value of Pounds 74m.
P&amp;O maintains a 5 per cent stake in MTL, the six-berth facility at Hong
Kong's Kwai Chung Container Terminal where P&amp;O is an important user.
The disposal is in line with P&amp;O's policy of trimming its interest in
operations it does not manage.
The sale comes a month after P&amp;O announced its first large commitment in
China since 1949 - the acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in the HKDollars
615m Shekou Container Terminal - as part of a series of deals involving
Pounds 500m in the region.
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said the group's commitment to China made
listings on the mainland's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
inevitable.
P&amp;O obtained a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange in
September 1991.
Within a fortnight of the signing of the Shekou terminal deal, P&amp;O bought
into Zhangjiagang-Win Container Terminals, near Shanghai, which involved the
investment of an undisclosed sum into Win Hanverky Investments, which holds
51 per cent of the terminal.
Lord Sterling said this project was another step in the company's plans to
develop in transport related activities in the Pearl River Delta, the
Yangtze River Corridor and north-east China.
The Shekou facility began operation in August 1991 and has an expected
throughput of between 80,000 and 100,000 20-foot equivalent units for this
year.
P&amp;O takes up management of the terminal from the beginning of next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved profit margins and cost reductions arising from restructuring
helped Symonds Engineering, the Cheshunt-based precision engineer, to halve
pre-tax losses from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 126,000 in the six months to
September 30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 2.31m to Pounds 2.09m as a result of reducing the
number of low margin contracts.
Losses per share were down from 1.93p to 1.27p.
Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, said he was confident the company would shortly
return to profitability.
Since March, the workforce had been reduced by about 25 per cent to 155.
Improved systems and procedures had been introduced by appointing a
financial controller, together with a sales manager to expand the existing
business customer base.
There is no interim dividend - last year's distribution was 0.15p but no
final was paid.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vulnerable but still in the field - Lasmo,
badly affected by the oil price fall, is selling assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, one of the UK's biggest independent oil exploration and production
companies and one of the most vulnerable to current low oil prices, is
suffering from 'a past obsession' with size, according to Mr Joe Darby,
chief executive.
Yesterday's sale to PowerGen of Pounds 123m worth of assets, including 5 per
cent of the promising Liverpool Bay gas project, suggests that that
obsession is over.
Mr Darby took over last January from Mr Chris Greentree, who in 1991
engineered the Pounds 1bn acquisition of Ultramar which, with hindsight, is
seen as the start of the company's troubles.
The market value of the merged company fell by about half in the six months
to July last year. That was partly because of the decline in the oil price
but also because of a re-rating of the merged company. Since that time
Lasmo's share price and market capitalisation has roughly tracked the
decline in the oil price.
Lasmo's overwhelming priority from the late 1980s was rapid growth and
aggressive expansion abroad. It was such that the company was 'blinded to
some extent' on where oil prices were heading.
At the same time 'pride in being a black oil company' left Lasmo with little
exposure to buoyant natural gas prices.
The London market's judgment of past errors and strategy has been harsh.
Lasmo's shares have underperformed the oil sector by some 45 per cent over
the past year. Investors have reacted badly to deteriorating profitability
and the prospect that gearing will rise from 70 per cent to 80-90 per cent
by the end of 1995, despite yesterday's sale.
The need to broaden the company's base and reduce its vulnerability to low
oil prices will take time and could tax further the patience of
shareholders. Mr Darby agrees that his 'honeymoon' with the City has been
cut short by the oil price fall.
He is keen not to put further strain on the relationship. Lasmo's board will
consider a final dividend in March, an event which investors will be viewing
with more than usual interest. Mr Darby says eliminating a recommended 2p
pay-out would save only Pounds 15m plus advance corporation tax, an amount
'not very significant' to the company's overall health, especially when
weighed against the message it would send to investors.
According to some analysts, Lasmo's fall from favour has distracted
attention from its success in cutting costs and selling peripheral assets.
Development projects, which are pushing debt upwards, are not only aimed at
securing lower-cost reserves, but will also boost Lasmo's production by 40
per cent from a 1993 average of 160,000-165,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day to 220,000-230,000 a day by 1996. Yesterday's asset sale should not
affect that target.
Personnel changes in the offing will give Lasmo's senior management a new
look. The resignation in October of Mr Michael Pavia as finance director
paved the way for a successor who is likely to have stronger City
connections. And the resignation of Lord Rees last month will allow Lasmo to
appoint a new chairman, who, Mr Darby says, will be either 'a City figure
with a good reputation or a strong personality who has performed well
elsewhere.'
Neither position is likely to be filled until the end of March, and there is
persistent speculation that Lasmo may be the subject of a takeover before
any new appointees can settle in.
'We are vulnerable,' concedes Mr Darby, 'and I can't guarantee that it won't
happen'. But Lasmo won't resort to poison pills or other artificial
defences, he says.
A takeover would be the easiest way to end Lasmo's financial pain, although
Mr Darby insists that he hopes to persuade shareholders that the company can
succeed in its unenvious task of 'investing against a sliding oil price'.
The main element of the strategy will be continued cost cutting, including a
sharp reduction in spending on exploration and appraisal wells. A maximum of
Pounds 60m will be spent in 1994, compared with Pounds 85m this year.
A long-standing criticism of Lasmo has been its poor record in finding new
oil at a cost in line with industry averages. Mr Darby concedes that he 'has
been disappointed with the quality of some of Lasmo's people' on the
exploration side. But he contends that the company's new exploration team
under Mr Peter Nolan, a veteran of British Petroleum, and future
concentration on low cost areas in which Lasmo already has a presence should
lead to improvements.
The company also wants to reduce its dependence on oil. One way would be to
capitalise on its experience in running one of the world's largest liquefied
natural gas plants in Indonesia through involvement in a similar project
elsewhere. 'It may be as a technical adviser or possibly even taking an
equity position,' according to Mr Darby.
Other gas projects linked to power generation schemes will also be
considered, he says. Under the terms of the Liverpool Bay project, for
example, 85 per cent of the price of the gas sold to PowerGen's planned
Connah's Quay plant will be linked to the retail price index, rather than to
oil prices.
Mr Darby is sensitive that any future asset sales maximise shareholder
value. Would-be buyers have played on Lasmo's weakness, but he does not
'feel under enormous pressure to sell at distressed prices'.
This attitude applies to some foreign assets which Lasmo would like to sell
as well as to the Markham gas field which straddles the British and Dutch
sectors of the North Sea. It has been for sale since March, but negotiations
with Wintershall of Germany have so far failed to agree on a price.
Yesterday's sale has eased the pressure on the company, but Lasmo remains at
the mercy of the oil price. And 'there are no obvious signs of improvement
in the short term,' concedes Mr Darby.

Framlington, the fund manager, has raised Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.6m) to
launch the first quoted Russia investment fund - some Dollars 10m less than
its original target.

International Finance Corp, the private sector arm of the World Bank.
The Luxemburg-registered fund will take stakes mainly in small to
medium-sized joint ventures between Russian and western companies. Early
investments will be in food processing, high technology and consumer goods

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Invesco sells stake in Oak Inds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco, the fund management company, yesterday announced the end of another
chapter in its liaison with Drayton Consolidated, the failed investment
trust, which extracted substantial compensation last year for mismanagement
of its investments.
The company is selling its 4.6 per cent stake in Oak Industries, the US
electrical components and controls manufacturer.
It bought the stake in November 1992 via a Dollars 6.5m (Pounds 4.4m)
interest-free loan note as part of a compensation package agreed when
Drayton was wound up.
Ironically, Invesco said its expected to make a Dollars 5.7m profit after
redeeming the loan note.
'The exceptional profit represents a most satisfactory step in the
continuing process of Invesco divesting itself of peripheral interests,' the
company said yesterday.
Since Invesco issued the loan note, the value of Oak shares has doubled to
about Dollars 15.
Lord Stevens, chairman of Invesco at the time it was managing Drayton's
funds, is also chairman of Oak Industries.
Second Consolidated, the investment trust that emerged from the ruins of
Drayton and retained a stake in Oak Industries, said it expected to benefit
from a simultaneous placing through Lehman Brothers in New York.
Many of Second Consolidated's shareholders had stakes in Drayton, which
failed last year following Invesco's decision to invest Pounds 43m in Alma
Holdings, a Scottish confectionery company. Alma subsequently collapsed with
debts of Pounds 40m guaranteed by Drayton.
Under the compensation package, Invesco paid Pounds 9.5m in cash to the
trust's shareholders and agreed to purchase Pounds 7.5m of loans to City
Merchants Bank, another Drayton investment.
Mr Rod Richards, a director of Foreign &amp; Colonial, the fund managers acting
for Second Consolidated, said: 'It's an embarrassing quirk for Invesco that
they ended up making a profit on the compensation.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ERF cuts loss to Pounds 0.48m but shares
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERF, the last remaining publicly-quoted UK truck maker, cut its pre-tax
deficit substantially in the six months to the end of September 1993, from
Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 479,000.
The loss last time was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 945,000.
The shares closed 19p down at 295p.
The company has been in loss for the last three-and-a-half years during the
deep recession in the UK commercial vehicle industry, but is expected to
return to profit in the second half of the year, helped by the growing
recovery in heavy truck demand.
Group turnover rose by 22 per cent, from Pounds 54.6m to Pounds 66.9m.
Mr Peter Foden, chairman and chief executive, said that the UK heavy truck
market had increased by 24 per cent during 1993, but there was continuing
heavy pressure on margins due to stiff competition from European
manufacturers.
The UK is one of the few markets in Europe where truck sales have grown this
year, and European truck makers have concentrated intense marketing efforts
on the UK market.
Mr Foden said that the deepening recession in Europe and in many parts of
the world had affected the group's export business and sales into the
Spanish and French markets had been difficult.
Prospects for 1994 for ERF were 'more encouraging', he said, and the company
was continuing to lower its cost base and improve its competitiveness.
Despite the improved trading position there is still no interim dividend.
The level of a final distribution would depend on 'trading circumstances' in
the second half of the year, said Mr Foden.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Irish Life buys AGF life assurance arm for
Pounds 23.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Life, the UK subsidiary of the Dublin-based life assurance, pensions
and investments group, has acquired City of Westminster Assurance, the life
assurance business of AGF Holdings (UK), for Pounds 23.5m.
The purchase, which includes City of Westminster Assurance Society, takes
under its wing 40,000 policyholders who generated a premium income of Pounds
8.5m in 1992.
Irish Life also announced it intends to apply early next year for a licence
to operate from the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.
Once granted, an IFSC licence would bring a number of tax advantages and
increase sales in the UK and overseas.
In 1992 Irish Life had a 0.5 per cent share of the UK life assurance market,
providing 15 per cent of its premiums.
Mr Jean Pierre-Paumier, UK chief executive of AGF, said the French company
was selling its life assurance business to strengthen its profitable
non-life UK business, which provided 97 per cent of business.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scott Pickford buys as profits more than
double
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scott Pickford, the USM-quoted petroleum consultant, yesterday reported more
than doubled pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30. At the same
time, it announced an acquisition which moves the company into a new
business area.
The purchase is of Samuel Denison, a maker and distributor of
computer-controlled materials testing equipment, for an initial Pounds
1.15m.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 2.61m new ordinary
shares, representing about 22.3 per cent of the enlarged capital, and Pounds
235,000 in cash.
A further consideration, in either cash or shares up to a maximum Pounds
850,000, is dependent on Denison's pre-tax profits exceeding Pounds 675,000
in the year ending March 31 1995.
On turnover up 55 per cent to Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.08m), the pre-tax
result advanced to Pounds 209,114 (Pounds 103,167). The results included two
months' trading from GAPS Geological Consultants, acquired in August.
Earnings per share amounted to 1.89p (1p).
The shares rose 5p yesterday to reach a high for the year of 40p.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Film licensing difficulties behind fall to
Pounds 0.65m at Novo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Licensing difficulties within the film entertainment services division and
provisions against the planned disposal of its French associate resulted in
interim pre-tax profits at Novo Group falling from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds
649,000.
Licensing irregularities were discovered in the Walport International
offshoot which affected trading in the period and is expected to cause
'significant damage' to future earnings.
The company added that it had received advice that it might be able to claim
against BET, the former owner of Walport, to recover a substantial part of
the costs and losses arising from the irregularities.
As a result of the problems Novo is paying only a nominal interim dividend
of 0.1p (0.3p). The level of future payments will depend on the
reinstatement of Walport's film supplies and satisfactory outcome of the
warranty claims.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 5.97m).
Provisions of Pounds 259,000 related primarily to the planned disposal of
the French associates. Earnings per share were 0.97p (2.98p).

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Granada director gets 17% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Robinson, the chief executive of Granada, now locked in a hostile
takeover bid for London Weekend Television, received a healthy pay increase
of more than 17 per cent this year.
Mr Robinson's remuneration rose in the year to October from Pounds 346,000
to Pounds 407,000, making him by far the highest paid director.
In the 12 months, the television, rental, leisure and computer services
group achieved a better than expected 53 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 176m on turnover of Pounds 1.6bn.
Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, actually received a substantial pay
cut from Pounds 267,000 to Pounds 169,000.
This reflects the arrival of Mr Robinson and the fact that as a result, Mr
Bernstein is not working as many hours at the company as he used to.
Mr Robinson holds 299,172 shares in the company and has options on a further
737,500.
At LWT, which is resisting a Granada offer valuing the company at more than
Pounds 600m, directors and management own about 10 per cent of the company,
following a share scheme put in place before the competitive tenders for new
ITV licences.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: KB keeps top jobs internal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, has abandoned its attempt to recruit
a new chief executive from outside the bank, and will instead split the
responsibility between three senior executives.
Kleinwort has appointed two investment banking chief executives to
complement its investment management chief executive. It has been looking
for a new chief executive to succeed Mr Jonathan Agnew, who left the bank in
August.
There has been speculation that Kleinwort found it hard to attract an
executive from another investment bank. But Lord Rockley, the executive
chairman, who succeeded Mr David Peake in May, said he had not offered the
job to anyone, and had decided it was unnecessary.
'We talked to a lot of people, but we did not get down to a short list. Over
the months, I have been confirmed in my view of the strength of what we had
internally.'
Sir Nicholas Redmayne and Mr David Clementi have been appointed as joint
chief executives of investment banking, which includes financing and
corporate advisory services, equity securities and treasury operations.
The two men will report jointly to Lord Rockley and Mr Simon Robertson, the
deputy chairman. Mr Colin Maltby, the current chief executive of Kleinwort
Benson Investment Management, will continue to report directly to them.
Lord Rockley said it was 'always going to be difficult' to introduce a new
chief executive from outside, and he had been searching at a time when the
existing management had shown itself capable of generating much new
business.
He said that 75 per cent of management decisions had been taken by
executives in charge of investment management and investment banking during
this year, and they had proved themselves able to deal with day-to-day
issues.
The bank reported doubled interim profits for the six months to June 30 of
Pounds 42.2m. However, the lack of a chief executive for several months has
led to some uncertainty over its future direction.
The shares rose 30p yesterday to close at 591p.

FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Listing for opencast coal company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rackwood, the Derby-based opencast coal company, is coming to the market via
a placing of 9.2m shares which will raise Pounds 2.7m and capitalise the
group at Pounds 6.4m.
Dealings are expected to begin on January 6.
The company sees the forthcoming privatisation of British Coal as an
opportunity for growth. Like BC's opencast operations, its business is the
identification, development and operation of mining sites and the marketing
and sale of the coal produced.
Also like BC, it subcontracts the operation of its sites to specialist
earthmoving and mining contractors.
The company says this enables it to obtain fixed unit costs for various site
operations and does not expose the group to risks attached to substantial
investment in plant.
Rackwood also has contracts to supply more than 500,000 tonnes of coal to
the electricity supply industry.
It has rights at 10 sites. The majority are in the UK with some in France.
One site is in operation and Rackwood expects three others to be operating
next year.
Rackwood has accumulated losses of about Pounds 750,000 for the three years
to last July but says this refects efforts to build up its portfolio.
It expects pre-tax profits for 1993 to be at least Pounds 10,000.
The issue, sponsored by Greig Middleton, the broker, will leave Mr Max
Crosland, managing director, and Mr Dennis Bell, chairman, holding 43 per
cent of the enlarged capital.
The prospectus shows that Mr Bell was fined Pounds 10,000 in connection with
a breach of the exchange control act 1947 after exporting Krugerrands to
France.

Willis Corroon, the UK insurer, has floated approximately 55 per cent of
Gryphon, the holding company for Associated International Insurance and
Calvert Insurance, its US underwriting operations, in the US and Canada.
The public offer, outlined in September, was of 4.5m shares of common stock
at Dollars 13 a share, raising about Dollars 49m (Pounds 33m) for Willis.
Underwriters to the offer, Smith Barney Shearson, Goldman Sachs and Lehman
Brothers, have a 30-day option to take up a further 8.3 per cent of Gryphon
to cover over-allotments.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Auditors stress Euro Disney crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney's auditors have warned that the troubled leisure group will be
forced to close if it cannot persuade its banks to restructure its finances.
PS Audit, a subsidiary of Price Waterhouse, has qualified Euro Disney's
accounts for the year to September 30. 'The company will need financial
support in order to meet its contractual obligations for the 1994 accounting
year,' it said. It also warned that if the refinancing 'is not completed in
sufficient time', the group will 'have liquidity problems and will not be
able to continue'.
Euro Disney, which last month reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Dollars 900m)
on turnover of FFr5.7bn, is trying to negotiate a financial rescue package
with 60 international banks. Its net debt totals FFr20.3bn.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, warned the banks last month that Euro Disney was on the brink of
bankruptcy and that the lavish EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris would
close if they did not agree to the restructuring.
'The auditor's statement hasn't told us anything we didn't already know,'
said one of the bankers involved. 'But it does emphasise the fact that Euro
Disney is in deep, deep trouble.'
Euro Disney said yesterday that it was still financially self-sufficient,
but that it risks running out of cash - thereby becoming technically
bankrupt - early next year. Walt Disney has promised to provide enough money
to keep the park afloat while the restructuring is completed - but
itssupport will only last until March 31.
The Disney camp hopes to pressurise the banks into reaching an early
agreement, thereby defusing the uncertainty over Euro Disney's future and
minimising the amount of money that Walt Disney will have to plough in.
But the negotiations are on ice because the banks have commissioned an
investigative audit of Euro Disney's finances. KPMG, the accountancy group,
was appointed last week and is expected to complete its report in January.
Walt Disney has proposed that the banks reduce Euro Disney's net debt to
around FFr10bn through such measures as a debt-for-equity swap and a rights
issue. The banks are expected to insist that the parent also waives or
postpones royalty payments from Euro Disney. Rights issue prospects are
clouded by the recent slide in Euro Disney's shares, which yesterday shed
another FFr1.40 to FFr34.10.
The only consolation for Euro Disney is that the Christmas season has so far
been busier than in 1992.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Tackling the ghost of Black Wednesday - Sara Webb explains
moves to ease liquidity problems in London's money markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For months, London's sterling money market has been haunted by the ghost of
Black Wednesday. But with the implementation of new procedures early next
year, the Bank of England hopes to alleviate the liquidity and volatility
problems which stemmed from the September 1992 sterling crisis.
When the Bank was forced to support sterling in the autumn of 1992 - in what
later proved to be a futile attempt to keep the British currency within the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism - the heavy intervention resulted in a
large drain of liquidity from the money market.
The Bank introduced temporary measures to ease difficulties and ensure a
steady flow of wholesale cash through the banking system. The biggest banks
and building societies, as well as the gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms), were
allowed to borrow money from the Bank using UK government bonds (gilts) and
other high quality paper as security.
This ad hoc 'sale and repurchase' of gilts, known as a repo, took place
directly between individual counterparties and the Bank. The measures were
used to complement the Bank's normal money market operations in which the
Bank accepts bills from the banks in return for lending wholesale cash.
Now, the Bank has decided to keep these repo facilities as a feature of its
money market operations, with a fortnightly timetable.
Funds will be provided through the purchase and resale of government debt
denominated in sterling and other currencies. In addition, the Bank is
inviting all banks and building societies, as well as the Gemms, to act as
counterparties. In the past, only the biggest banks and building societies
were able to do so.
The proposed changes are outlined in a memo from the Bank which was sent to
members of the British Bankers' Association at the weekend. Given the
December 31 deadline for comments and the holiday mood, it would appear the
Bank does not expect BBA members to object.
Privately, several money market participants have already welcomed the
proposals, and there is now considerable speculation that further
improvements to the financial markets could follow.
The main point is that the measures should help to reduce the liquidity
shortage to a more manageable level while ensuring that short-term interest
rates are less volatile. 'The discount houses are very much in favour of
this as it should pull more liquidity into the market and reduce the daily
shortages,' said Mr Robin Moser, chairman of the Discount Market Association
and chief executive of Alexanders Discount. According to Mr Philip Shaw, an
economist at Union Discount, 'daily shortages of Pounds 1bn-plus have become
the norm'.
The moves should also help to reduce the volatility of short-term interest
rates. The discount houses complain that a couple of the big clearing banks
have a tendency to 'manipulate' the overnight interest rate by hoarding
bills. They maintain that overnight interest rates have oscillated between
4.5 per cent and as much as 20 per cent.
'The clearing banks have had effective control of the market, as they have
been the biggest holders of bills,' says one market participant.
According to Mr Shaw, 'smaller banks often face unpredictable and
prohibitive funding costs. The ensuing notion is that the UK money markets
are increasingly becoming a closed club which does little to promote
London's reputation as a financial centre.'
With the proposed changes, the Bank should be able to keep closer control
over short-term rates. To some extent, it depends how many people use the
repo system. While the clearers are expected to remain the biggest players
in the money market, in theory by distributing the liquidity provided by the
Bank over a broader range of participants, their influence should be
tempered.
'Overnight rates will never go up to extortionate levels again except at
those times when the authorities deliberately push up short-term rates, for
example to dampen speculation about a possible interest rate cut. This takes
the violent swings out of the market,' says Mr George Blunden, chairman of
Union Discount.
The system is not the same as that used by the Bundesbank in its money
market operations where the weekly repo is one of the most closely watched
rates. It could be argued that the Bank could quite easily use its repo rate
more frequently than twice a month, and harmonise operating procedures with
other European central banks as the prospect of European Monetary Union
draws closer. As yet, however, there are no signs that the Bank is
considering doing so, and the discount houses believe the bill system will
remain the significant day-to-day operation.
What the proposals have done, though, is to kindle hopes in some quarters of
the City that the Bank will implement further changes to the financial
markets.
Specifically, they ask: what is to stop the Bank from allowing the
establishment of an open gilt repo system - whereby holders of gilts could
lend out their stock directly to other parties in the market rather than
only to the Bank - given that the proposed changes are being seen as a step
in that direction?
One money market specialist points out that the new arrangements set the
basic standards for an open repo system and should encourage familiarity
among banks and building societies with the concept of 'repo-ing' gilt
holdings.
The Bank is considering an open gilt repo system, but it may be some way
off.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Eni sells turbine arm to US trio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday announced the sale of the Nuovo Pignone gas
turbines and compressors group to a consortium led by General Electric of
the US.
The sale represents a significant political move by the Italian government,
which had favoured a US partner over European candidates in its first big
industrial privatisation. Both GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering
group and ABB-Atlas Copco also bid for Nuovo Pignone.
The deal, which had been under negotiation for over a year, values the 69.3
per cent of Nuovo Pignone being sold by the Eni state holding company at
about L1,100bn (Pounds 440m). The figure represents about L700bn for the
equity and about L400bn in debt transfers.
Nuovo Pignone, which specialises in low-powered turbines and compressors for
the energy and chemicals industries, made net profits of L36.7bn on sales of
L1,977bn last year. The L7,000-a-share bid is a significant premium for
Nuovo Pignone's minority shareholders compared with Tuesday's pre-suspension
closing price in Milan of L6,269.
The deal prompted street demonstrations by employees. Union leaders fear the
sale could result in Nuovo Pignone losing its independence and in
redundancies among the 2,600-strong workforce.
Political concern to limit such fears explains the complex structure of the
deal. General Electric will take only 25 per cent of Nuovo Pignone. A
further 20 per cent will be held by six Italian banks. Some observers
believe the banks will sell their stakes, of between 2 per cent and 4 per
cent each, to GE once the political heat over the deal dies down.
In a surprise move, however, Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand, two US
turbine or oil industry specialists, are taking 12 per cent each. The two
bid in tandem for Nuovo Pignone and may have decided to join forces with GE
when it became clear they would be unsuccessful.
As expected, Eni will retain a stake of 20.25 per cent in Nuovo Pignone,
reflecting interlocking interests between the two.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Ferranti managers may make bid to receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A seven-man team of senior Ferranti International managers is preparing a
bid for the bulk of the defence electronics company, which is in
receivership.
The team, led by Mr Phil Burton, Ferranti's director of marketing, is aiming
to put together a consortium in the new year and begin detailed financial
negotiations in February.
'It has become clear to us that, shorn of problems stemming from the ISC
acquisition, the group has a bright future,' Mr Burton said yesterday.
The initial proposals envisage the management group teaming up with UK or
overseas partners to mount a bid for most of Ferranti's non-manufacturing
operations.
It is understood that Ferranti's components business, which manufactures
specialist hardware and sub-systems, would not be included in the bid.
Ferranti's highly successful simulation and training business has attracted
interest from potential purchasers and may be sold separately.
The management consortium proposals were immediately welcomed by Mr Murdoch
McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the two administrative receivers from Arthur
Andersen, appointed to the ailing group after GEC withdrew a 1p-a-share
rescue bid in December. They said there were a number of long-term options
for the businesses.
The receivers added they had been approached by a large number of UK and
overseas groups that had expressed an interest in acquiring Ferranti
businesses.
Mr Burton said a re-born Ferranti would have to be well capitalised and
strong enough to compete in the international defence and civil markets. He
said these factors put it beyond the reach of an ordinary management
buy-out. Therefore, he said, the management team, which is being advised by
Mr Richard Stone of Coopers and Lybrand Corporate Finance, was proposing a
consortium bid, 'backed by long-term players in these nationally important
sectors'.
He said initial discussions with the receivers and potential partners from
the UK and overseas had been 'very encouraging'. While emphasising that it
remained early days, he said 'we do plan to be in a position to commence
formal purchase negotiations in February'.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Lasmo makes Pounds 123m sale to PowerGen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday
gave its flagging balance sheet a boost by selling a Pounds 123m package of
offshore assets to PowerGen, the electricity generator.
The centrepiece of the deal is a 5 per cent stake in the Liverpool Bay gas
field, which will supply PowerGen's planned power plant at Connah's Quay in
Wales. Lasmo's interest in two North Sea gas fields, Ravenspurn and
Johnston, are also in the package.
Liverpool Bay - which constitutes about a fifth of Lasmo's UK assets - is
one of the most promising development projects in the group's portfolio,
most of which is heavily geared to volatile oil prices. Mr Joe Darby, chief
executive, said the company could have sold more of its stake. But it did
not want to see its share in the project fall below 25 per cent given the
high quality of the asset and the fact that financing was in place.
Analysts believe Lasmo received similar terms for Liverpool Bay to those
achieved by Monument Resources last month when it sold a 3.9 per cent stake
in the project to PowerGen. Monument achieved a 25 per cent premium for the
reserves on a dollars per barrel basis.
Lasmo shares closed yesterday at 114p, up 1p.
Mr Darby said the sale would help the company through a period of heavy
spending on development projects, which would reduce its vulnerability to
oil prices.
Without the sale, the company faced a rise in gearing from the present 70
per cent to 80-90 per cent at the end of 1994 - at current low oil prices.
Mr Simon Flowers, an analyst at Natwest Markets, estimated that the cash
injection, which should come through in April, would be supplemented by
Pounds 58m in savings on Liverpool Bay capital costs over the next three
years.
That means Lasmo's gearing at the end of 1994 could be contained to about 75
per cent, although it is likely to continue rising through 1995 because of
development spending.
Additional asset sales, including the Markham gas field which straddles the
UK and Dutch sectors of the North Sea, are still in the offing, according to
Mr Darby. Talks with Wintershall, the German gas company, are continuing,
but the conflicting tax positions of the two companies are a complication.
PowerGen's second upstream purchase in as many months is in line with its
aim of securing more of its own fuel reserves.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Paramount board shifts to QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of entertainment group Paramount Communications was reported
yesterday to have recommended that shareholders accept a hostile Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) bid from television shopping channel QVC Network, rather
than a friendly but lower offer from cable company Viacom.
The move - reported late in the morning by executives involved in the fight
 -would represent a big psychological shift in the three-month-old battle
for Paramount, since until now the board had shunned QVC's advances and
insisted that a merger with Viacom offered better long-term benefits.
But it would not spell the end of the tortuous fight since each bidder still
has a 10-day period in which it can increase the value of its offer and
shareholders are free to accept whichever proposal they want.
Viacom was understood to be seeking finance for a higher offer yesterday
from other companies which have backed its bid, such as Nynex, the regional
telephone company serving the Northeastern US, and Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video rental chain.
No immediate comment was available from Paramount, but its shares were
suspended at Dollars 80 3/8 , up Dollars  1/8 , pending an announcement.
later yesterday.
The board's action follows a ruling by the Delaware Supreme Court that the
company must create a level playing field for both the Viacom and QVC
offers.
Paramount agreed to auction itself off and set a deadline of last Monday for
offers.
QVC increased the value of its cash offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's
shares from Dollars 90 to Dollars 92, while Viacom resubmitted its existing
cash offer, worth Dollars 85 a share.
Both bidders are offering stock for the remaining 49 per cent. and Based on
their fluctuating share prices, QVC's entire bid was worth around Dollars
10bn, or Dollars 83 1/2 a share, yesterday morning, compared with Viacom's
Dollars 9.6bn, or Dollars 79 5/8 a share.
After deliberating for much of Tuesday and yesterday morning, the Paramount
board evidently voted to recommend the QVC offer.
Analysts said it had little choice, since QVC's offer was markedly higher
and the board was under close legal scrutiny to ensure it did not unfairly
favour Viacom.
Viacom is understood to have asked Paramount for more time to finance a
higher bid.
This suggests it could be facing difficulties in raising funds, or is simply
involved in protracted negotiations with its partners over the terms of
additional funding.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Tidal wave of beer from France hits UK drinks industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More beer is now pouring across the Channel from Calais than total French
beer exports worldwide through conventional trade channels, industry
estimates say.
UK retail beer sales worth about Pounds 260m a year have been lost, and the
cost to the government in excise duty and value added tax amounts to about
Pounds 150m a year.
When personal imports of wine and spirits are added, drinks retailers in the
UK are estimated to have lost business worth Pounds 700m. Government revenue
has declined by at least Pounds 350m.
The amount of beer brought into the UK this year by cross-Channel shoppers
is equivalent to the total annual sales of 4,000 tenanted pubs or the
production of two larger regional brewers.
Since allowances of personal duty-paid imports were increased in January to
110 litres - the average yearly UK consumption per head - the Brewers'
Society reckons more than 256m pints have been brought into the UK.
Differences between UK and French rates of beer taxation offer consumers
huge savings. Excise duty on beer in the UK is 30p a pint compared with 4p a
pint in France.
Legal imports, on which duty has been paid in France, have been swollen by
higher duty-free allowances bought aboard the cross-Channel ferries.
Personal imports now account for 9 to 11 per cent of the UK take-home beer
trade. Brewers estimate that illegal imports for resale take another 4 per
cent.
With more cheap drink available at home, the pub trade is also beginning to
suffer, the brewers argue. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, seemed to
recognise the threat both to the industry and to the government's pocket
when he left beer duty unchanged in the Budget.
But Customs and Excise maintains that industry estimates of personal imports
are exaggerated. Sir John Cope, paymaster-general, stands by official
forecasts made early this year of a total loss of revenue of Pounds 250m
from imports of beer, wine, spirits and tobacco. Mr Bernard Windsor,
chairman of the Wine and Spirit Association, says its monitoring of
cross-Channel purchases since personal import allowances were raised
suggests that Pounds 264m of revenue will be lost on wines and spirits
alone.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Construction orders rise fuels hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction orders rose sharply during the three months to the end of
October, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the
Environment. The figures suggest that a more broadly based recovery than
previously thought is under way in the industry.
The value of construction orders rose to Pounds 16.31bn during the first 10
months of this year, a 9.5 per cent advance on the corresponding period in
1992.
During the latest three months, new work increased in every area of
construction compared with the corresponding period last year when
investment fell sharply after the UK decision to quit the European
exchange-rate mechanism. Among the most encouraging three-month figures were
rises of 20 per cent and 11 per cent in private industrial and commercial
orders.
Contractors hope private sector spending on homes, factories, warehouses,
shops and offices will increase to compensate for reduced public investment
in social housing, roads and local authorities announced in last month's
Budget.
Overall, the value of orders at constant 1985 prices rose by 18 per cent
during August, September, and October, compared with the same three months
last year. Orders were also 9 per cent higher than during May, June and July
this year.
The biggest rises were in housing, where public sector orders, mostly from
housing associations, were 33 per cent up on last year. Private housing
orders during the same period rose 26 per cent.
Builders welcomed the increases but said the improvement would need to be
sustained if the industry were to make a full recovery.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, one of the industry's
chief forecasting bodies, last week halved its projections for growth next
year from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent, blaming public sector spending cuts.
The council, which represents more than 2,000 companies with a combined
annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, said yesterday there had been a
bunching of private sector orders during the three months to the end of
October. That was because of the ending of capital allowances for industrial
building as well as a rush to qualify for construction-related Business
Expansion Schemes due to end this month.

<TEXT>
The sale of Nuovo Pignone completes the easiest part of the privatisation of
Eni, Italy's state-owned energy group. Even so, the trade sale of a
profitable engineering company has taken well over a year to complete.
General Electric of the US was an obvious suitor, since the companies enjoy
a commercial relationship in turbines. The involvement of Dresser,
Ingersoll-Rand and a syndicate of Italian banks is more difficult to fathom.
It is hard to believe the triumvirate of hard-nosed US corporations will
want to endure a minority position for long.
Transfering the larger parts of Eni out of public sector control will
require more preparatory work. AGIP in oil exploration and production and
SNAM in gas marketing and distribution are attractive enough. AGIP ranks
fifth among world oil and gas exploration companies ranked by reserves. But
despite promises of restructuring, it seems too much to hope that Enichem
might be knocked into shape in time to take part. Its problems are
deep-rooted, especially while petrochemicals markets remain depressed. SNAM
and AGIP will have to sever their shareholding connections with Enichem
before they can be brought to the market.
Welding AGIP and SNAM together would create a natural resources company to
be reckoned with, but putting a workable management structure in place will
also take time. With France due to privatise Elf Aquitaine in the first half
of next year, though, allowing international investors to rest between
courses may be no bad thing.

<TEXT>
The cynical way of looking at P&amp;O's disposal of most of its stake in Modern
Terminals for Pounds 117m is that the company is conveniently realising a
capital gain at the end of the year to help pay its dividend. Last year's
payout was only just covered and operating profit showed only marginal
growth in the first half. So the company needs exceptional gains to justify
a dividend which it actually increased as profits fell at the onset of
recession. Were that the whole story, the market would scarcely have been
justified in pushing up P&amp;O's share price by 1 per cent in response to the
sale. There are, however, mitigating considerations.
Since the stake in Modern Terminals was too small to be consolidated or even
equity-accounted its only contribution to profits was a meagre dividend
flow. The disposal has revealed a hidden value which was not apparent at the
operating profit line. If this situation is replicated elsewhere in P&amp;O's
balance sheet, the market may have under-estimated its true net worth. One
question, therefore, is how far investors should factor in the scope for
capital gains.
The answer would be easier if P&amp;O were explicit in its intention to make
money out of trading assets. In that case, its dividend would also be
smaller, since it would presumably be anxious to conserve resources for
profitable investment deals. As it is, the group remains wedded to its
cyclical property and shipping businesses, and there is limited transparency
to its investment activities. Investors may take some comfort from the
possibility of future capital gains. They would take more if the main
businesses were generating more by way of operating profit.
