<TEXT>
The retirement of Alan Orsich, 60, as an executive director of STANDARD
CHARTERED is a further sign of the tremendous change which has taken place
in the boardroom of one Britain's biggest overseas banks.
Orsich, who joined Standard Bank in 1950, was one of the last of the career
bankers who had worked their way to the top. After working in East Africa,
he became chief dealer of Standard Bank in 1969 and spent the rest of his
career on the Treasury side of the bank. During Standard Chartered's more
difficult periods, Orsich's side of the business continued to generate good
profits and he survived many of the management reshuffles which ended the
career of other colleagues.
Orsich's departure means that David Moir is the only executive director on
the Standard Chartered board who has worked for the group for longer than
five years. He joined in 1958. Orsich's responsibilities for treasury
operations have been taken over by John McFarlane, the former chief
executive of Citibank in the UK, who joined last June.

FT  24 NOV 93 / People: Stapleton to chair Hundred Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Stapleton, 47, has been appointed chairman of the Hundred Group of
finance directors from January 1.
Stapleton was recently appointed chief financial officer of Reed Elsevier,
and has been the chairman of the technical committee of the Hundred Group
for three years.
His new appointment follows the announcement earlier this month that Michael
Lawrence, finance director of Prudential and the current chairman of the
Hundred Group, is to become chief executive of the London Stock Exchange.
From its creation in the early 1970s, the Hundred Group has grown into an
important forum on a wide range of issues of importance to finance directors
 -notably accounting and auditing matters.
It has been influential over the past few months in delaying and bringing
about more co-ordination in the implementation of the Cadbury code of
corporate governance.
Stapleton worked at Unilever, becoming vice president, finance, before
moving to Reed International in 1986 as finance director and also became
chief financial officer following the merger with Elsevier earlier this
year. He is a non-executive director of Allied-Lyons.
His successor as technical committee chairman will be Christopher Pearce,
finance director of Rentokil Group.

FT  24 NOV 93 / People: High Gosforth restructuring on course
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Gosforth Park Company, the plc which owns Newcastle Racecourse, has
restructured its board to lay more emphasis on racing expertise.
Captain the Hon Nicholas Beaumont, clerk of the course and secretary at
Ascot Racecourse, has been appointed chairman designate of High Gosforth
Park; he will succeed Roy Baker, former chairman of National Tyre Services,
in early 1995. In the meantime Beaumont has become a non-executive director.
The Captain's nephew, the Hon Wentworth Beaumont, a member of the Jockey
Club and a steward at Newcastle, who also serves on panels at Carlisle,
Ripon, York, New-market and Ascot, has joined the High Gosforth Park board.
Other new board members are David Stephenson, formerly managing director of
Newcastle Breweries, and James Marris, recently retired regional chairman of
British Gas Northern; Sir Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish and Newcastle
and Ken Bell, chairman of Bellway, have retired.
The company, whose course offers the only Grade One racing between York and
Ayr, is fighting a protracted planning battle to ensure its future by
selling some of its Green Belt land for housing and commercial development.
The board restructuring is intended to help carry through the upgrading. 'We
must be teed up and ready for the off,' says managing director and clerk of
the course David Parmley.

FT  24 NOV 93 / People: Taylor leaves National Express
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Taylor resigned yesterday as managing director of National Express,
Britain's largest scheduled coach operator, after only a year in the job.
The company, which obtained a London Stock Market listing last December,
said the reason for Taylor's departure was a difference in management style
and minor, internal policy differences.
Taylor (right), 45, joined National Express after an early career spent in
marketing and product development with Forte and GrandMet.
It appears that Taylor's approach to business, honed in large companies, did
not match the more entrepreneurial style of the National Express Board.
'We are a very small management team and inevitably someone who has worked
in very large companies probably finds the transition rather difficult,'
said Adam Mills, deputy chief executive. 'But this is not a one or two-man
band. We are very Cadbury.'
Mills acknowledged that Taylor's rapid departure might raise questions about
the company's recruitment procedures but said it had employed 'a
distinguished headhunter and had gone through all the due process'.
Mills and Ray McEnhill, chief executive, acquired National Express with the
help of venture capital finance after an earlier management and employee
buy-out ran into difficulties. They both had a background in the bus
industry.
Taylor was on a one-year rolling contract so his redundancy payment will not
be 'a headline figure', said Mills. Taylor is to stay on to provide advice
until March 31 but the company expects to have a new managing director in
place by then.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Making a splash in Japan -
Support for Greenpeace is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Is the Sea of Japan turning into a nuclear waste dump?' screamed the
headline in a Japanese national daily after Russia dumped its nuclear waste
there last month. The disposal of 900cu m of low-level coolant and cleaning
water from Russia's nuclear submarines into the sea provoked widespread
anger.
However, at the same time it earned respect for Greenpeace, the
international environmental pressure group, which had uncovered the dumping.
Until the dumping, many Japanese were wary about Greenpeace's activities.
'The incident helped ordinary Japanese understand that Greenpeace wasn't
just a bunch of hysterical people bashing Japan about whales,' says Naoki
Ohara, director of Greenpeace Japan.
The aggressive tactics in Greenpeace's appeals over environmental issues,
especially over Japan's whaling, have alarmed ordinary Japanese, who usually
disapprove of direct confrontation. A collision last year between Japan's
plutonium- carrying vessel and a Greenpeace ship caused apprehension among
many people who thought this was 'going too far'.
As a result, Greenpeace has managed to attract only 800 members within the
country. Since the Russian episode, however, interest in the group's
activities has heightened. Greenpeace's information-gathering methods have
been praised as far more advanced than those of the foreign ministry.
Accounts of how the group discovered Russian vessel TNT-27 has been told and
retold in the media. Greenpeace says it predicted Russia's dumping from a
Russian government report which states that it would have to continue marine
disposal of nuclear waste until 1997. On October 7, the Greenpeace ship left
northern Japan and waited until the Russian vessel appeared on October 16.
The Japanese are especially sensitive to water purity because the eating of
fish, raw or cooked, is an important part of national culture. The dumping
of nuclear waste in the country's main fishing area revived memories of the
Minamata poisoning case, which began in the late 1950s. (Chisso, a chemicals
manufacturer, disposed of its mercury refuse into the bay of Minamata, on
the southern island of Kyushu, contaminating fish and poisoning the local
population.)
The widespread outcry over Russia's nuclear dumping has forced the Japanese
government to change its stance on the disposal of nuclear waste and to
support a proposal that would ban ocean dumping.
Between 1955 and 1969, Japan dumped 1,650 drums of low-level radioactive
waste into the Pacific Ocean. Although the government has refrained from
dumping low-level waste at sea since 1969, it has remained ambivalent over
the matter, hoping to keep ocean dumping as an option for disposing of waste
from its nuclear power stations.
However, while Japan supported calls for a complete ban on dumping of
low-level waste at the meeting earlier this month of the London Dumping
Convention, Japan continues to release waste water from its nuclear power
plants at sea. Japan disposes of at least 1,020bn tonnes of coolant from its
nuclear energy plants per year, although the radiation levels are said to be
lower than international standards.
Meanwhile, public awareness over environmental issues remains low. Ohara
says people reacted because the Russian dumping was in their 'backyard', but
issues such as the destruction of rainforests in southeast Asia for wood
exports to Japan have remained untouched. And many Japanese believe western
criticism of whaling is another form of Japan bashing.
Ohara blames the low awareness on the lack of school education on
environmental matters.
The media is reluctant to cover such issues, especially if there is a large
Japanese company involved. 'Japan has to realise its responsibilities as a
leading industrialised country,' he says.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Hook, line and sinker - As
Brussels prepares to fix European fish quotas / A look at how long North Sea
stocks will last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Safely home in the port of Lowestoft, on the east coast of England, the crew
of the UK fisheries research vessel Cirolana is recovering from a month-long
mission to investigate the state of fish stocks in the treacherous North
Sea.
'We were out in all that wind and rain and there were all sorts of ships
going down around us,' says Barry Chapman, Cirolana's bearded captain, with
just a hint of seadog swagger. 'We stayed till the last bitter minute.'
The 10 scientists on board have been tracking the serious depletion in many
species of fish, notably cod. Their findings, together with those from
scientists of other European countries, will feed into data to be used by
fisheries ministers in Brussels next month to set next year's quotas for the
whole of the European Union.
The changeable climate that forced Cirolana into port a day ahead of
schedule is also thought to be responsible for the enormous fluctuations in
fish numbers from one year to the next, which scientists find particularly
difficult to explain.
'Predicting fish stocks is like predicting the weather, only worse,' says
John Shepherd, deputy director of the government's fisheries research
directorate at Lowestoft.
The inexact nature of the science irritates those on the receiving end - the
fishermen - who see their livelihoods being squeezed by quotas and other
limits on how often and how much they can fish.
British fishermen are currently locked in a bitter dispute with the
government over its plans to restrict the number of days they can spend at
sea. A High Court ruling is awaited on an application by the National
Federation of Fishermen's Organisations to have the restrictions quashed.
The policy is part of the government's drive to cut UK fleet capacity by 19
per cent by the end of 1996 in a European-wide attempt to curb over-fishing.
The situation for cod is so serious that the European Commission has just
set up a task force to examine how to protect the dwindling North Sea stock.
Nobody wants to see cod disappear, as it almost has off Newfoundland. A
moratorium on fishing there has led to 20,000 fishermen and processors being
laid off.
'Everybody agrees that we ought to be very worried about the state of the
cod stock,' says Shepherd. 'It may be in terminal decline.'
The spawning stock of cod - fish that are mature enough to breed - has
fallen to about 50,000 tonnes, the lowest level on record, through a
combination of over-fishing and natural causes.
Most cod do not mature until they are about four years old. But in the North
Sea only a very small percentage survives to spawn and landings are
dominated by two-year-old immature fish.
The North Sea fishing surveys carried out by Lowestoft scientists are
complemented by researchers from Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands
and Norway, who work together in the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea.
They determine the age of the fish they catch by their length or by
examining their scales or the tiny stones in their ears, which carry growth
rings similar to trees.
Cod is only the most striking example of over-exploitation. All but two
species of fish - the low-value blue whiting and horse mackerel - are either
fully exploited or over-exploited in the waters around Britain. That means
the same number or fewer fish would be caught even if fishing increased.
Cod levels are also very low in the Irish Sea and in Icelandic waters. But
stocks of north-east Arctic cod in the Barents sea have returned to much
healthier levels thanks to drastic cuts a couple of years ago in the quotas
shared by Russian and Norwegian fishermen. These accelerated a cyclical
recovery in the stocks. 'It's a nice example of how well-timed management
action can help,' says Shepherd.
Some stocks, such as western mackerel in the North Sea, never recover from
over-fishing. Others make sudden comebacks, such as North Sea haddock,
catching even the scientists by surprise.
After three very poor breeding years, which took quotas to an all-time low,
the haddock has unexpectedly enjoyed three consecutive good years. The
scientist acts in loco parentis for the fish and always has to be cautious,
says Shepherd.
'When you're seeing the lowest stock size on record and it's been there for
three years, no responsible person could do other than warn that the stock
was in a critical state and likely to get worse.'
The best way of conserving fish is the subject of fierce debate. Fishermen
argue that 'technical' conservation measures, such as increasing minimum
mesh sizes to allow smaller fish to escape, would offer an alternative to
direct restrictions on their activities.
The problem with larger mesh sizes is that they would not help the cod, the
biggest of the main commercially exploited species in the North Sea, says
Shepherd. 'For North Sea cod, the increases in mesh size required to enable
restrictions on catch and effort to be lifted are such that this is hardly a
practical proposition.'
Ten years of quotas under the Common Fisheries Policy have failed to solve
the problem of overfishing, partly because of evasion. That is where
enforceable measures such as decommissioning of vessels and restrictions on
fishing times come in.
'Searching for a conservation measure which is painless (for fishermen) is a
waste of time,' says Shepherd. 'There is none.'
The problem would be eased by a shift in consumer preference away from white
fish. Cultivation of fish and shellfish may also emerge as a partial
solution in the long term. The UK has been cultivating lobsters and Norway
is experimenting with the farming of halibut, turbot and even cod.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Management: Agents move into the driving seat - Legislation
coming into effect on January 1 will strengthen their position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many British companies are waking up to realise that they have precious
little time left to reorganise advantageously their agency arrangements in
European Union countries.
New legislation comes into effect on January 1 that will generally
strengthen the position of agents as opposed to principals (companies). One
of the provisions in the new directive stipulates that proper notice should
be given to terminate contracts.
At the moment many British concerns have very loose arrangements with their
agents.
Mike Reynell is marketing director of Flomerics, a software company
specialising in computational fluid dynamics, used for cooling in
electronics products.
He says: 'It was only when we read reports in the newspapers that we
realised we could face difficulties with our agents in Europe. At the
moment, the agreements are very informal, based only on a letter. We could
have difficulties.'
The UK and Ireland will join the rest of the EU in applying far more
detailed rules governing companies and their agents. The new rules borrow
heavily from legislation in Germany, where agents have been able to use
their contracts as security for loans and compensation is available if an
agreement is terminated.
The new rules mean that either party must give written notice of not less
than one month for the first year, two months after two years and three
months
for the third and subsequent
years if a contract is terminated.
Other rules stipulate that principals will no longer be able to delay paying
their agents simply because they have not been paid.
Provided the agent has not breached the terms of his contract, companies
become liable to pay compensation to their agent to cover losses and costs
resulting from the termination of the contract. Compensation must take into
account the commission the agent might
have earned and costs and expenses he has not been able to recover.
Rebecca Attree, an inter-national solicitor working in the international
department of the London office of Laytons, says: 'The new regulations mean
substantial changes to companies' agency arrangements. We are advising our
clients to review all current agency arrangements, and establish whether
they are actually agency agreements. If they are, the companies should
consider the costs and benefits of terminating any existing agreements.'
One company concerned about the new arrangements is Hampshire-based Apollo
Fire Detectors. Neil Quinn, managing director, says: 'We realised there
could have been losses involved in termination of contracts when the new
rules came in.'
The company's answer to the problem was to set up distributorships in most
EU markets, which are outside the regulations. In Germany, Apollo set up a
subsidiary company.
Flomerics, however, is not keen on the idea of distributors. The company,
which was set up in 1989, now has a turnover of Pounds 2m, most of which is
exported. The largest market is the US, but Europe is growing rapidly.
Reynell says: 'Distributors do not really suit us; we are not selling a
commodity which can be stored and sold on. We like to know who the end
customer is, and we tend to have a few large customers. There are a lot of
intellectual property rights wrapped up in our products and we like to keep
the customers in view.'
While favouring agents, the company does admit to a satisfactory arrangement
in one EU country. Reynell says: 'We will have to change our arrangements -
certainly in one EU country and possibly more. I am seeing our lawyers about
it imminently.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Management: Clipped wings of ambition - The demise of the
Alcazar airline deal provides a cautionary tale for those following the
cross-border merger trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcazar, the cynics always said, was far too ambitious to succeed. On Sunday
the cynics were proved right.
After a year of painstaking negotiations, entailing costs in management time
and lawyers' fees which can only be guessed at, the attempt by four European
airlines to forge what would have been the continent's most ambitious
cross-border enterprise collapsed when they failed to agree on which US
carrier should become Alcazar's American partner.
With hindsight, it is easy to judge that the idea of melding Austrian,
Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Swiss interests into one unified
airline was as hopeless as the name given to the project was grandiose.
After all, Alcazar, a four-towered Moorish fortress built to keep predators
at bay, had no obvious association with the cultures of the protagonists.
But even if the final breakdown was not a great surprise, the four airlines
did come tantalisingly close to pulling off a deal, establishing along the
way a fund of knowledge and experience that could well be useful to others
who follow the cross-border merger trail.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the Alcazar project was the constant
acknowledgement by the four airlines - Austrian Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Swissair - that what they
were attempting was, indeed, extremely complicated.
The four proclaimed their vision of an alliance strong enough to compete
with British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, the three European giants.
But from the moment the negotiations, begun in the autumn of 1992, were made
public this February, they tempered their ambitions with sober warnings of
the hurdles to be overcome.
These ranged from the intangible issue of how to marry four corporate
cultures, through the associated problem of how to square the need for a
single multinational management structure and flight network with the
rigidly bilateral nature of airline route agreements.
The airlines also feared that opponents, both inside and outside their
ranks, could appeal effectively to the strong emotional attachment people in
every country feel towards their national airline.
When the four chief executives launched informal talks in late 1992, the
initial objective was not just to set down what the advantages of an
alliance would be, but also to identify the areas that could be 'deal
breakers'.
It was immediately clear, for example, that logic dictated there should be
one headquarters, located in one of the six home countries. Could the five
that 'lost' the HQ be reconciled to the decision?
Other thorny questions were the relative stakes of the companies in Alcazar
and the question of the US partner.
By January, the chief executives had reached a sufficient 'level of comfort'
to feel that they could proceed with more detailed negotiations. It was
informally agreed, for example, that the three big airlines would have equal
30 per cent shares in the new group, regardless of significant differences
in their actual asset values. They felt this was the only way to avoid
constant niggling over the share-out of management posts.
According to Swissair, it was also understood that Delta Air Lines would be
the US partner. At the time, Northwest, KLM's partner, looked to be at
death's door.
No less than 17 committees, or work teams, were then set up with
representatives of each airline meeting once a week, usually at weekends.
Each airline had its own steering committee to co-ordinate internally their
conduct of the talks. The work teams also reported to an Alcazar steering
committee which in turn reported to the chief executives. The work was done
in English.
Most of the 17 work teams were concerned with technical airline matters  -
passenger systems, cargo systems, fleet maintenance and the like. But three
key committees thrashed out corporate structure, 'air political' issues and
balancing the value of the participants' shares in Alcazar.
The results of these studies were extremely encouraging. The route networks
fit together well, the marketing philosophies were similar and the prospects
for cost savings were impressive.
Sufficient progress was made so that in April the managements of the four
airlines went to their shareholders for approval to proceed to signing a
loose Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which would be followed by a formal
negotiation of a final Alcazar deal. All but the three core committees and a
work team on communications were disbanded.
But now the problems everyone had been so careful to warn of began to arise
in earnest. Opponents of the deal, sensing that it was nearing the decision
point, suddenly emerged, rousing public anxiety and forcing governments in
Switzerland and Austria in particular to demand reviews.
This meant the signing of the MOU had to be postponed until after the summer
holidays. In the meantime, however, the lawyers kept working. Initially, the
intention was that the MOU would be fairly vague, merely binding the
partners to the Alcazar path. It would not necessarily resolve all the 'deal
breaker' issues.
However, by September, when the companies finally had their shareholder
approvals, the lawyers presented them with a very detailed MOU. The chief
executives then realised that they now had to move more quickly to resolve
the deal breakers.
For one thing, it had become clear that the original intention to form a
joint management company under which the four airlines preserved their
separate corporate and tax structures, at least in the early years, was no
longer adequate.
While this step-by-step plan would have diffused domestic objections to the
project and avoided problems with national and international transport laws
governing landing rights and other airline issues, it would have run foul of
the European Union and US anti-cartel regulations. Alcazar had to show it
was to be a genuine integration of the four airlines.
Moreover, by early September, it was clear that Northwest Airlines was
recovering smartly from the edge of bankruptcy in June and KLM's attitude to
the US partner issue had changed.
By late October, the four had overcome most of the toughest questions.
Austrian, SAS and Swissair had accepted that the headquarters would be in
Amsterdam and they had agreed a complex formula to compensate Swissair in
recognition of its net asset value being greater than its 30 per cent share
in Alcazar.
But they could still not resolve the US partner issue. If, indeed, that was
the sole issue that broke the Alcazar project, there is a certain irony in
it, because it is not an issue arising from the cross-border complexity of
the undertaking, rather one of basic competitive strategy.
However, even if this issue had been resolved, it is a fair bet that the
project would have hit other tough stumbling blocks.
It will never be known, for example, if governments and other shareholders
might have baulked at the last minute. The spectacle of the shareholder
revolt against Volvo's proposed merger with France's state-owned Renault
provided a tempting model for the six groups of shareholders of the Alcazar
companies.
There were also signs of substantial lingering disagreement over the scale
and speed of rationalisation, issues that would have been very difficult for
a fledgling management group to resolve peacefully.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Thorp's 2,100 jobs 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abandonment of British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.85bn Thorp plant would cost
2,100 jobs directly and increase unemployment in the Copeland area of West
Cumbria to 26.4 per cent, a report published yesterday says.
The research by the GMB general union also warns that if the Thermal Oxide
Reprocessing Plant is not commissioned Sellafield's entire operating cost
will fall on its Magnox reprocessing division, making it doubtful whether
the site's operations will remain commercially viable.
The report says this could lead to the complete closure of Sellafield,
Copeland's biggest employer, with the loss of 9,600 related jobs, raising
the area's unemployment to 48.9 per cent.
Closure of BNF's West Cumbrian operation is the 'hidden agenda' of
Greenpeace and other anti-Thorp groups, the document says.
It dismisses the dry storage option for nuclear fuel, proposed by Thorp
opponents, as an interim solution which is technically impractical and will
create at most only 100 full-time permanent jobs.
The report was launched yesterday in Whitehaven by the GMB, Sellafield's
biggest union representing 3,000 of the 8,000 BNF employees. The launch was
supported by Copeland district council and the Confederation of British
Industry, which are concerned at the economic implications should Thorp not
go ahead. An announcement by the government is imminent.
Unemployment in the Copeland travel to work area now stands at 11.5 per cent
or 3,685 people. The report says this is expected to rise by 2,400 to 18.9
per cent when Thorp's construction is complete.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Levitt trial ends with guilty plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trial of Mr Roger Levitt and three other former directors of the Levitt
Group, the collapsed financial services company, ended yesterday after a
second defendant changed his plea and admitted he was guilty of fraud.
Mr Mark Reed, the former managing director of the company, joined Mr Levitt
in changing his plea and admitting to the single charge of fraudulent
trading.
Mr Levitt changed his plea from innocent to guilty on Monday.
Both men will be sentenced on Friday and were released on bail until then.
The charge of fraudulent trading, an offence under the Companies Act 1985,
carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.
A similar charge against a third defendant, Mr Robert Price, the former
finance director of the Levitt Group, was dismissed and he was formally
acquitted.
The fourth defendant, Mr Alan McNamara, the company's former commercial
director, is still charged with one count of fraudulent trading and will
face a fresh trial in front of a new jury.
Mr Levitt and Mr Reed pleaded guilty to fraudulently misleading Fimbra, the
regulator for independent financial advisers, by presenting false and
misleading documents.
These documents purported to show that fees of almost Pounds 21m had been
received by the company as a result of personal advisory work performed by
Mr Levitt.
The two men had also been variously charged with a total of 21 other
offences, including false accounting, forgery, obtaining property and
services by deception, making misleading statements to induce investors and
falsifying company documents.
These charges, which had been scheduled to form the basis of a second trial,
will lie on the file and not be acted upon further.
The prosecution originally alleged that Mr Levitt and Mr Reed were the main
protagonists in a fraud which was wider than that they eventually admitted
to.
Mr David Cocks QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, alleged that they had
illegally injected the Pounds 21m into the company to save it from collapse
and produced false accounts to overstate its profits as well as deceived
Fimbra. Mr Levitt had been the 'architect' of the fraud and Mr Reed his
'right-hand man'.
The two men denied any wrongdoing beyond the deceit of Fimbra. Before his
change of plea lawyers for Mr Reed had told the jury he was too incompetent
at his job to be guilty of fraud. He was so inept he spent most of his time
writing memos about sandwiches and other equally routine matters, the court
was told.
After the acquittal of Mr Price his solicitor said there had never been any
evidence of any dishonesty on the part of the former finance director.
The main activities the prosecution had complained about had taken place
after Mr Price had resigned from the company in mid-1990, he said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Plans for ITV ownership rules are expected today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV companies will find out at 8.30am this morning how the government
proposes to change the ownership rules governing the industry.
In an echo of the 1991 announcement of new franchises by the Independent
Television Commission, the government will make its intentions clear by fax.
The expected liberalisation, which would allow some of the large ITV
companies to take over each other could lead to the launching of immediate
bid battles.
Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday licence, is expected to
launch a bid for Central, the second largest company, in which it has a 20
per cent stake. Granada will move against either Central or London Weekend
in which it holds 20 per cent.
Meanwhile, the commission is examining ways of improving the chances of
launching Channel 5 as a national channel using existing technology.
This is in response to a revival of interest in the concept in spite of the
commission's rejection last December of the only bid for the franchise.
Time Warner, the media group, is among those which have submitted
expressions of interest in the new channel. A total of 76 submissions were
received last month on options for the future of Channel 5, which included
using the available frequencies to help launch digital television in the UK.
MAI, the financial services and advertising company which controls Meridian
Television, is among those which have expressed interest in running a
conventional television channel.
The commission is likely to take a decision on whether to advertise a new
Channel 5 licence in January.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Coopers &amp; Lybrand elects chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER SMITH has been elected the new chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
UK's largest accountancy firm, for the first of what he hopes will be two
five-year terms.
The firm's 700 partners selected Mr Smith using a single-transferable vote
system controlled by the Electoral Reform Society at the end of an election
process leading to a short-list of four candidates.
Mr Brandon Gough, the current chairman, said the Electoral Reform Society
had only provided Coopers with the name of the winner and had not disclosed
the votes for the other candidates.
His victory came over Mr Adrian Lamb, partner in charge of the regions, Mr
Alan McFetrich, an executive partner, and Mr Richard Stone, head of
corporate finance.
Mr Smith, partner in charge of the London office, was believed to have been
Mr Gough's favoured candidate.
Mr Smith will take up his position from May 1. He said he had not yet
finalised his choice of the team that will help him run the firm. His
election is for five years, but he said he hoped to be in place for two
consecutive terms.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Accidents at work reach record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of deaths from accidents at work is the lowest on record, the
Health and Safety Executive said yesterday.
The commission's annual report says 430 people died from workplace accidents
in the year to March, compared with 473 in the previous 12 months.
The rate of fatal accidents has fallen for the third year running. It is
expected to be 1.3 per 100,000 employees this year, less than a quarter of
that at the beginning of the 1960s and half that of the early 1970s.
Sir John Cullen, who retired as chairman of the commission in September,
said the trends reflected 'some genuine improvements in safety, particularly
in the high-risk sectors where we have concentrated effort, namely
construction, mining and manufacturing'.
He conceded that the improvements were partly attributable to changes in the
structure of industry - a move away from high-risk heavy industries. The
lack of improvement in the rate of non-fatal injuries, when changes in
employment were taken into consideration, meant that the commission could
'derive little comfort' from the figures, he added.
Mr Frank Davies, the new chairman, said that he welcomed the government's
commitment to deregulation but it would have to be achieved without a
reduction in standards.
Mr Davies said the commission needed to come to terms with the fact that
most British companies were small. He called for a partnership between the
commission and private-sector safety officers and organisations.
The number of serious accidents in the workplace was down from 29,707 to
28,018 and minor accidents from 154,338 to 140,365. While the non-fatal
injury rate was down, the commission believes that the real position, after
adjustments for industry changes are taken into account, could be worse than
last year.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Minister condemns council on planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Cornwall district council is condemned for its planning practices in
an inquiry report published today.
Mr David Curry, planning minister, said in a Commons written answer
yesterday: 'North Cornwall have granted planning permission for sporadic
developments in the open countryside, on an inconsistent basis, contrary to
national planning guidance and the structure plan.
'Some councillors seem to have also favoured certain applicants, often local
people, because of their personal circumstances.'
The inquiry by Miss Audrey Lees, a professor of environmental studies and
chairman for England of the Nature Conservancy Council, was set up last
August after numerous complaints about district council decisions.
Mr Curry said that the inquiry had found that many of the complaints about
the council had been justified.
The council has been criticised by the local government ombudsman and the
district auditor on several occasions over its planning decisions.

FT  24 NOV 93 / ITC to take second look at launching Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission is examining ways of improving the
chances of launching Channel 5 as a national channel using existing
technology.
This is in response to a revival of interest in the concept in spite of the
ITC rejection last December of the only bid for the franchise.
Time Warner, the world's largest media group, is among those which have
submitted expressions of interest in the new channel. A total of 76
submissions were received last month on options for the future of Channel 5,
which included using the available frequencies to help launch digital
television in the UK.
MAI, the financial services and advertising company which controls Meridian
Television, is among those which have expressed interest in running a
conventional television channel.
The ITC foresees two main difficulties in trying to launch the channel
envisaged by the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
Many of the suggestions call for the use of different frequencies in an
attempt to avoid one of the main drawbacks with the original franchise
application - the need to retune several million video recorders.
Using different frequencies would almost certainly involve negotiations with
the UK's closest neighbours.
The second potential problem is that few of the companies most interested
are able to lead and control a consortium because of regulatory
restrictions. Time Warner, as a non-European Union company, cannot hold a
majority stake in a broadcasting licence.
The ITC is likely to take a decision on whether to advertise a new Channel 5
licence in January.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Child health fund may have to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trustees of the National Council for Child Health will decide today whether
to wind up the charity following loss of government funding.
The charity, the only one promoting immunisation and preventative health
among children, risks closure when the government is seeking to raise
overall health standards through its Health of the Nation strategy.
Ms Fiona Fountain, director, said the charity had made unsuccessful attempts
to obtain alternative finance to cover its core costs since a three-year
programme of government funding had come to an end.
Ms Fountain said: 'The government says that it is not its policy to provide
core funding indefinitely. We are able to raise finance to run specific
programmes, but grant-making trusts and similar organisations are unwilling
to provide money to cover basic administrative costs.'
The National Council for Child Health, whose patron is the Princess of
Wales, needs to raise its income by about Pounds 75,000 to remain in
operation.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Big groups seek power price curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large companies yesterday demanded tighter electricity price controls after
an academic study suggested that Britain's power consumers were being
overcharged by Pounds 545m a year.
The Energy Intensive Users Group said the report by Brunel University showed
the Pounds 1bn-plus annual distribution profits of the regional electricity
companies in England and Wales were twice the level that could be justified
in a risk-free monopoly business.
The group is asking Offer, the electricity regulator, to rein back the
'profits bonanza' in its forthcoming review of distribution price controls.
Brunel's report concluded that rates of return of 6.6 per cent on new assets
and 4.4 per cent on existing assets were appropriate for the power
distribution businesses.
The Chemical Industries Association, which commissioned the report, said the
actual rate of return in 1992-3 was 9.2 per cent, resulting in profits of
Pounds 1.04bn, against the Pounds 497m which could be expected from a 4.4
per cent return.
Mr Doug Rodger, the association's executive director for business, said that
if the 4.4 per cent return rate were applied, electricity prices would fall
about 3 per cent.
Brunel's report recommends significant changes to use-of-system charges,
including more consistency and openness in the regional distributors'
charging mechanisms.
It says use-of-system charges should be more cost-reflective. As currently
constituted, the charges penalise customers who use the distribution
networks more efficiently.
Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said the post
electricity privatisation price rises for large users contrasted with
developments in continental Europe where prices had remained static.
Mr Rodger said reductions of 25 per cent to 30 per cent were needed for
large users to bring prices into line with the continent.

The survey of 24 of the UK's largest companies revealed that a quarter have

Only half the companies thought their directors took data security
seriously. Computer fraud, hacking and other security breaches are estimated

The Commons' employment committee said: 'Any further decline in the number

Their union - the UCW - says they stand to lose up to Pounds 70 a week in
pensionable allowances if BT goes ahead with its proposals from next April
1. 'The anger and resentment felt by operators needs to be reflected in an

FT  24 NOV 93 / Plan for landfill levy angers waste industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new levy that would raise sharply the cost of putting waste in landfill -
licensed rubbish dumps - would be justified on environmental grounds, a
report commissioned by the government suggested yesterday.
A subsidy for incinerating waste might also be justified says the report,
which was prepared by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the
Global Environment at London University. Some incineration schemes can be
used to generate energy, reducing the role of coal-burning power stations
which pollute the atmosphere.
Ministers have been considering for a year whether to introduce a landfill
levy to encourage more incineration and recycling of waste. But the waste
management industry yesterday criticised the report's calculations and said
it would add unnecessarily to industrial costs.
According to the report a landfill levy of Pounds 8 a tonne - an increase on
present costs of between a quarter and a half - would be needed to reflect
the environmental impact fully. Government officials said yesterday this
would add about Pounds 800m a year to the costs of industry and local
authorities.
Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the National Association of Waste Disposal
Contractors, said: 'This report does not succeed in setting out the case for
a landfill levy, although it would be a nice little revenue earner for the
Treasury.'
He added that if the government's proposals to tighten regulation of waste
management, incorporated in the 1990 Environment Protection Act, were put
into practice then landfill costs 'would in any case rise significantly -
that is the time to see whether you want to fiddle around with the market'.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday that he was 'very
concerned' that the government had postponed introducing the new rules twice
this year - no date has yet been set.
About 90 per cent of UK waste now goes to landfill, a small amount to
recycling, and less than 10 per cent to incineration. The cost of landfill
has remained low in the UK compared with continental Europe, partly because
the UK has many unfilled quarries left from excavation of building
materials.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Birmingham hits back in row over facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham City Council, stung by the charge that it has spent too much on
international facilities and not enough on education, yesterday
counter-attacked by arguing that the facilities support 16,800 jobs in the
West Midlands.
The calculation is contained in the summary of a report, by accountants KPMG
Peat Marwick, on the local and regional economic impact of the National
Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National
Indoor Arena.
According to KPMG's survey the facilities attracted 4.5m visitors in the
year to August, at least 66 per cent from outside the West Midlands.
They spent Pounds 435m, of which Pounds 180m stayed in the region. This led
to the creation or sustaining of 16,800 jobs, of which 5,800 were in
Birmingham.
Publication of the figures is an attempt to justify council spending
priorities against local and national criticism.
Mr Andrew Coulson, chairman of the council's NEC-ICC committee, said: 'No
other investments could have generated 17,000 jobs into the West Midlands
especially at a time of industrial reces-sion.'
KPMG said investment in the facilities 'forms an integral part of Birmingham
City Council's overall economic development strategy to create additional
employment for Birmingham residents'.
Advisers recruited by the council to form an education commission had called
for a switch of priorities away from international facilities to a crash
programme of educational improvement.
They said education spending had been Pounds 236m less than the government
thought appropriate over the last five years.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has argued that the city council's
stewardship of its schools is so bad that they should be handed over to
central government control.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Roads plan flawed, says NAO report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government programme to widen 600 miles of motorways is expected to cost
nearly twice the original Pounds 3.4bn estimate and will not be able to
tackle the most congested motorways first, says the National Audit Office.
The NAO, which reviews government spending programmes, says in a report
issued yesterday that financial and environmental constraints will mean that
some stretches cannot be designed to meet forecast traffic demand and some
projects will have an expected life of just 15 years instead of the normal
40 years.
It says that original cost estimates were based on the assumption that only
one lane would need to be added and that simple construction methods could
be used.
'But in practice motorway widening has encountered specific design problems
and some motorways require more than four lanes,' the report says. Revised
traffic forecasts show in many instances that far higher numbers of vehicles
will be using the motorways.
The Department of Transport said it would carry out additional research into
whether road widening added to traffic growth, and into the impact on road
congestion.
The government announced its road widening programme in 1989 but estimates
of its cost have since risen by 46 per cent to nearly Pounds 5bn. The NAO
says further widening schemes identified since then will take the total cost
of the programme to Pounds 6bn, a 78 per cent increase on the original
estimate.
The cost of widening the London end of the M2 - the route runs from
Rochester to Faversham, extending to London and Dover through the A2 at each
end - is now expected to increase more than threefold from Pounds 41m to
Pounds 141m.
Few examples of planning large road-widening schemes were available when the
programme was first drawn up. The plans did not account for the demolition
and replacement of bridges and alterations to junctions. The widening and
improving of the Surrey stretch of the M25 is to come under attack in the
High Court today when Surrey County Council will seek leave to apply for a
judicial review.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Tories' real conflict comes to the surface: Kevin Brown
previews elections for the influential 1922 Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deep in the bowels of Westminster a guerrilla war is raging. The outcome
will show how far the Conservative party has recovered from the deep
divisions of the Maastricht debate. Some Tory MPs say it could even
determine the future of Mr John Major's government.
The conflict has little to do with the legislative programme announced in
last week's Queen's Speech, or the debate over the contents of next week's
Budget. It does not even involve opposition MPs. It is far more important
than that.
The battleground is the annual elections, due tomorrow, for the executive of
the 1992 Committee, the backbench organisation which represents all
Conservative MPs who have failed to find, or have lost, a place in the
government.
The battle lines are clear cut. On the right stands the Thatcherite 92 group
led by Sir George Gardiner, which provides a ideological home for the
party's Euro-sceptics, hardline free marketeers and social conservatives.
On the left stands the newly formed Mainstream Group led by Mr Cranley
Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 Committee, which comprises a mixture
of social liberals, economic interventionists and enthusiasts for the
European Union.
Mainstream regards itself as a 'loyalist' group, seeking to ease pressure on
the prime minister from the sometimes caustic 92 Group. Its guns are trained
on five main targets: Sir George, Mr John Townend (Bridlington), Mr James
Pawsey (Rugby), Mr Ivan Lawrence (Burton) and Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent
North).
A leading leftwinger said: 'The stakes are very high. This election is
symbolic of far greater things than just a few backbench committee
positions. What this is about is setting the stage for John Major to start
showing some leadership.'
Traditionally, the 18-strong executive of the committee has sought to act as
a conduit to Downing Street for the views of both wings of the parliamentary
party. But the traditional role required a fragile balance between left and
right.
The balance started to break down in 1989, when Sir Anthony Meyer, the
leftwing MP Clwyd North West, stood against Mrs Margaret Thatcher for the
leadership of the party.
Sir Anthony lost heavily. But the election precipitated a more serious
challenge a year later from Mr Michael Heseltine, another leftwinger, which
led to Mrs Thatcher's replacement by Mr Major.
The right, which dominated the party throughout the 1980s, extracted its
revenge in last year's elections for the 1922 Committee executive, when
candidates backed by the 92 Group swept the board.
But leftwingers are crying foul. They say the right cheated by enlisting the
support of Conservative candidates in winnable seats before the 1992 general
election. When the newly elected freshmen arrived, most of them duly backed
the rightwing slate.
The left says the right has misrepresented the balance of opinion in the
parliamentary party, and added weight to its own minority views.
A leftwing activist said: 'Many of them have misused their positions to
cause trouble for the government over Maastricht, and to wield undue
influence on issues like the content of the Budget.'
This year the left is better organised. The long-standing Lollard group
(named, like the 92 Group, after the address where its first meeting was
held) has joined hands with the pro-Brussels Positive Europe group to field
a single Mainstream slate.
On paper the Mainstream group has about 100 votes, compared with about 90
for the 92 Group. But protagonists on both sides say that it will not be as
simple as that.
Observers say the ideologically-focused 92 Group can probably rely on most
of its members to follow voting instructions. But the less cohesive
Mainstream group has found it difficult even to produce an agreed slate.
In addition, a small number of MPs who attended Mainstream's inaugural
dinner a couple of weeks ago have shown signs of drifting back to the
rightwing camp.
On the other hand, Mainstream can count on the votes of many of the 60 or so
parliamentary private secretaries - unpaid assistants to ministers - who are
entitled to vote.
Ministers deny rightwing claims that Downing Street has organised a discreet
campaign to corral the PPS vote. But there is little doubt that most of the
PPSs will vote for candidates loyal to the government.
A victory for the Mainstream group would be a significant boost for Mr
Major. But it might not end the simmering Tory civil war. A backbencher
said: 'We have never been more divided in our history than we are at the
moment. We are trying desperately to get over it. But if the right loses and
turns into a sort of detached rump, they will not only split the party, they
will destroy it.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Pension tax relief proposals rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has rejected a former Treasury minister's proposals for
raising an extra Pounds 7bn a year by changing the way pensions are taxed.
The proposal - by Mr John Maples, a former economic secretary to the
Treasury - was that tax relief be removed from pension contributions, while
pension payments should be exempt from tax.
Ministers have ruled out incorporating such a change in next week's Budget.
Their decision is thought to reflect expected difficulties in selling the
idea to voters and overcoming resistance from the pensions industry.
Implementing the proposed change would be worth Pounds 7bn a year to the
exchequer on the basis of a 25 per cent tax charge. Mr Maples has argued
that the incomes of both employers and employees after tax would be
unaffected.
When the idea was put forward this month, Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the
National Association of Pension Funds, predicted an angry response from
pensioners and pension scheme members.
'Could we trust future governments to resist the temptation to reintroduce
tax on pensions payments?', Mr Amy asked in a letter to the Financial Times.
He said the effect of Mr Maples's suggestion would be to take Pounds 100bn
from Britain's pension funds.
Mr Maples has acknowledged that the transition to his suggested arrangement
would be complex but he believes that technical objections could be
overcome.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Civilian MoD cut may miss target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior defence officials admitted yesterday that the Ministry of Defence
might not meet its target of cutting 20 per cent of civilian staff by
1995-96.
However, they rejected charges made by the all-party Commons defence
committee that the ministry would be lumbered with 'an unaffordable
civilian-manned infrastructure.'
Responding to sharp criticism from the committee about the progress on
manpower cuts, the officials said it was 'not certain' that the ministry
would achieve the planned reduction.
The officials said cutting manpower by 20 per cent was not necessarily an
overriding aim. In many cases it was cheaper to fill posts with civilians
than members of the armed forces.
The committee, in a brief report timed to precede the public expenditure
announcements in next week's Budget, called for an 'urgent reassessment' of
the strategy for achieving cuts in the MoD's 155,000-strong civilian
workforce.
'Although there have been some reductions in UK-based civilian numbers, the
rate of decline is now substantially slower than in the services, is not
centrally managed, and may even be reversed,' the committee said.
The MoD argues that civilian employment has been cut by 135,000 since 1979.
However, this figure includes 40,000 jobs in Royal Ordance munitions
factories, naval dockyards and the Atomic Weapons Establishment which have
been transferred to the private sector. 'We feel we have actually done quite
well,' one official said.
The committee report also criticised the relatively slow fall in officer
numbers in the armed forces, especially senior ranks in the army and RAF.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Plans to open milk market attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for opening Britain's milk industry are unworkable and proposals for a
new pricing structure could result in 'chaos', the Dairy Trade Federation
said yesterday.
Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, chairman of the federation which represents
Britain's dairy companies, said the proposals for freeing up the milk
industry would inhibit the development of competition and lead to 'consumers
paying higher prices for a more limited range of dairy products'.
The government plans to open the milk market in April following the
abolition of the Milk Marketing Board - its statutory purchasing scheme. The
consultation period for the board's proposals on reorganisation as Milk
Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative, ends on Friday.
Mr McMichael-Phillips said that the government should appoint an independent
body to monitor changes in the milk market over a two or three-year
transitional period. He believes that Milk Marque will exploit its position
in the market to increase prices and give poorer service to buyers.
Milk Marque expects to sign up 80 per cent of farmers in England and Wales,
and says prices will rise because the UK produces only 85 per cent of its
own supply.
The federation said the price auction proposed by Milk Marque for setting
prices in the new free market gave it far too much discretion. Mr John
Price, president, said: 'There is no system, no rules, no transparency.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Psychologists list Budget desires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Psychologists yesterday added their voice to the clamour of pre-Budget
advice to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The psychological impact on
consumers of an extra penny or two on income tax would be acceptable, they
said, but an extension of value added tax would not.
In its first ever Budget briefing the British Psychological Society said the
chancellor's priority next Tuesday should be to bolster consumer confidence,
so that the UK continued to pull out of recession, while at the same time
tackling the budget deficit.
Professor Cary Cooper of the University of Manchester Institute of Science
and Technology said: 'People would be very worried about any zero-rated
goods getting VAT because they are uncertain about how indirect taxation
affects them. But most people realise there's a big deficit and they would
accept one or two pence on income tax . . . it would give them a better
sense of control.'
The society said the City would prefer an extension of VAT to items such as
luxury foods but would see VAT on newspapers and children's clothes as
'psychologically and politically damaging'.
Consumer confidence would be best served by defence cuts but cuts in
services such as health and education 'would force consumers to hoard and
not to spend, and would adversely affect the recovery'. The society said,
however, that the City would prefer social security cuts, because the
defence industry was so important to the economy.
Dr Howard Kahn of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, who has surveyed 225
dealers, said that for some City workers - such as share and currency
dealers - the worst outcome would be a dull budget. 'There's a danger for
the government that policy might be influenced by the dealers' desire for
change for its own sake,' he said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / EDS to process tax data: Pounds 1bn Revenue computer
contract awarded to US company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contract for operating the Inland Revenue computers which process data
for income tax and corporation tax has been awarded to EDS-Scicon, a
subsidiary of General Motors.
This is the first time that a government has contracted out the data
processing of confidential tax information, although EDS already processes
sensitive data for the US defence department.
The company will be required to carry out all processing of confidential
information in the UK. Access to the information will not be allowed from
outside the UK.
The contract is said by the Inland Revenue to be worth 'well over Pounds 1bn
over the next 10 years', making it Europe's largest data processing
outsourcing deal.
It overtakes the Pounds 900m contract for British Aerospace data processing
which was awarded last week to Computer Sciences Corporation. A consortium
of CSC and IBM was the other bidder on the shortlist for the Revenue
contract.
Subject to discussions on the details of the contract, about 2,000 civil
servants in the Revenue's Information Technology Office will start the
transfer to EDS-Scicon in April.
The transfer is expected to be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Civil service terms and
conditions will therefore be preserved for staff who transfer.
The Revenue expects that a 'strategic partnership' with EDS will make it
easier to upgrade the department's computer operations using new systems
development techniques.
This will make it easier to change the tax system over the next decade with
the arrival of self-assessment, assessment of all tax on a current-year
basis and the abolition of separate tax schedules.
The department is reorganising its operations to improve customer service in
part by making a single tax office responsible for each taxpayer. Bulk
clerical and processing work will be concentrated in large regional back
offices.
The decision to award the contract to a US company was criticised last night
by the IRSF tax staff union. Mr Clive Brooke, union general secretary, said
it was regrettable that the staff had not been allowed to bid.
EDS has also won a five-year contract to provide information technology
services for the new parking enforcement regime in London, under which
boroughs are responsible for enforcing restrictions and collecting fines.
The company will also provide management services to the Parking Committee
for London, which co-ordinates the new scheme.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Regulator cautions on banks' code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning shot about the way that banks treat small-business customers was
fired yesterday by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, as he
revealed that the highest award - more than Pounds 80,000 - made under the
ombudsman scheme last year had been to a small company.
Mr Shurman, publishing his annual report, called for the code of banking
practice to be extended to small-business customers, as the ombudsman scheme
had been.
He said the award of Pounds 81,700 arose from a complicated investigation of
a property development project. It was one of the first cases to be raised
under the ombudsman scheme since it was widened in January to include
complaints by small businesses.
The bank had offered a loan facility to the borrower and withdrawn it after
the borrower was already committed. 'The bank was not entitled to withdraw
the facility as it did and when it did,' Mr Shurman said, 'and the resulting
loss to the complainant was the responsibility of the bank.'
In his report Mr Shurman again underlines comments he made to the committee
reviewing the code of banking practice.
He said that regardless of banks' own individual codes for dealing with
small businesses, the scope of the official code of practice should be
widened to small businesses.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Warning on civil service hiring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, yesterday gave a lukewarm
response to calls for making top civil service jobs open to the public.
Appearing before the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, Sir Robin
welcomed the call in an Efficiency Unit report this week for more open
competition for top civil service jobs but said the process might be
expensive and cause delays in filling posts.
He opposed advertising all top civil service jobs automatically, arguing
that the search for outside candidates could be a difficult process.
He said that the expense and delays of advertising were 'trivial questions
if you want to make sure you get the best person for the job', but he added
that if the minister and the prime minister were satisfied that within the
system they had the person they wanted to do the job, he saw no reason for
delay and expense of hiring someone from outside.
Sir Robin praised many of the Efficiency Unit recommendations. He said his
overall vision of the civil service was of one 'smaller than it is today'
with many functions delegated to operating agencies.
'There are functions which it will not be possible to put out to the private
sector - defence, areas of tax collection and so on,' he said. 'But, other
than that, there are no no-go areas where it is not reasonable to look at
what serves the public the best.'
Questioned about why targets for the amount of market testing to be carried
out by the government this year had not been achieved, he said the original
targets had been far too ambitious, but it was always necessary to set
ambitious goals for this kind of programme.
Sir Robin's comments came as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader,
warned that commercialisation of the civil service was threatening many of
its core values.
He said the drive for greater efficiency was laudable, but it had not been
complemented by the constitutional changes needed to ensure good government.
As a result basic values such as the unity of the service and the ethical
principles governing the behaviour of ministers and officials were being
undermined.
Above all, he said, the changes were destroying the fundamental principle of
ministerial accountability and responsibility. The government was 'creating
administrative black holes of responsibility where effective accountability
needs to be'.

FT  24 NOV 93 / MPs 'misled' over policy on defence sales to Iraq, Scott
told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers misled MPs repeatedly by insisting that the government had not
changed its policy on defence sales to Iraq since 1985, a senior civil
servant told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
Mr Eric Beston, a Department of Trade and Industry official, said written
answers to parliament, one of which was read out by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in
April 1989, contained 'misinterpretations, inaccuracies, misleading
statements, and things which could have been done differently'.
Mr Beston, now the DTI's East Midlands regional director, was in charge of
export controls when the operational guidelines were changed in December
1988 to allow UK companies easier access to Iraqi markets after the
Iran-Iraq ceasefire.
When questioned on why the written answers - which had been drafted by the
department's senior civil servants, scrutinised by its parliamentary units,
and authorised by ministers - contained such misleading statements, Mr
Beston explained that written answers were 'an art form rather than a means
of communication'. He said: 'Not all answers to all questions are
necessarily answered fully. Information is not volunteered that goes beyond
the strict limits of the question.'
He had been probed about the extent to which policy had been formally made
more 'flexible' and the four occasions in 1989 when written answers or
replies to MP's letters concealed the change.
He said that one answer, which he had helped to draft, would have been
better if it 'had been shorter'. Lord Justice Scott replied: 'It would have
been better if it had been an accurate answer.'
Ms Presiley Baxendale, Lord Justice Scott's counsel, referred to a Foreign
Office minute in which Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office
minister, pointed out that publicising the relaxation in the guidelines
would unduly raise exporters' hopes and draw 'unwelcome attention' from
previously disinterested MPs.
Mr Beston said Foreign Office officials instinctively reached for tighter
export controls as a foreign policy tool, citing the freeze on certain
exports to Iran following the Salman Rushdie affair.
He also admitted that he did not see until the following year a crucial
intelligence document, of November 1987, reporting that machine tools
exported by UK companies were being put to military use in Iraq.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Shares system 'will cost Pounds 30m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total capital costs for the Bank of England's proposed Crest share
settlements project will be Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m, with the core
processing system costing only Pounds 5m, far less than the failed Taurus
programme it is intended to replace.
Taurus, proposed but abandoned by the Stock Exchange earlier this year,
would have cost about Pounds 75m.
'We could build (Crest) for less than the annual cost of running Talisman,'
said Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England, referringto the
Stock Exchange's current settlements system. Mr Kent said that Crest could
start operations as early as mid-1996.
The Bank's Crest committee, of which Mr Kent is chairman, unveiled the
project specifications yesterday. They are far less comprehensive than was
envisaged for Taurus. Like Taurus, however, Crest aims to to replace the use
of paper share certificates with electronic records of share ownership.
Those who want to retain certificates may continue to do so.
Mr Kent said: 'This is going to end the paper chase.'
Unlike Taurus, Crest will not accept credit risk to its members or to
settlement banks 'so far as is practicable'. It will not take responsibility
for 'reporting', which means that users will have to design their own
information systems to carry necessary data in a form they can use. It will
not provide users with analysis or aggregate of bargains.
While this may require greater spending by some members, smaller
participants involved only in equities will be able to buy a specialised
personal computer package from a commercial provider, which will cut their
costs.
Mr Kent said that the question of ownership of the system would be addressed
by the committee at the beginning of February.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Clarke outlines basis for decision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor issued this statement yesterday:
Following consultation with the governor of the Bank of England, I have
decided that a further reduction in interest rates of  1/2 per cent is
sensible and fully consistent with the government's inflation target.
Since interest rates were last reduced in January 1993: M4 growth has
remained close to the bottom of its monitoring range; M0 growth has been
relatively stable recently; although the growth rate has continued to exceed
the 0-4 per cent monitoring range, in part this is the expected result of
previous interest rate reductions; house prices have risen only slightly,
although prices of financial assets have increased more quickly.
The exchange rate index is now around 3 per cent higher than at the end of
January; there have been significant reductions in interest rates in other
member states of the European Union; the growth rate of underlying average
earnings has fallen from 4 3/4 per cent to 3 per cent; underlying
inflationary pressures remain weak and inflation forecasts generally have
been scaled back significantly; market inflation expectations implied by the
yield differential between conventional and index-linked gilts have fallen
by around  1/2 per cent. . . .
Weighing up these factors, and taking full account of the measures I will
announce in the Budget on November 30, I have decided that a  1/2 per cent
cut in interest rates is warranted. I asked the governor to implement this
decision at the time he judged most appropriate. . . . From now on the
precise timing of interest rate changes will be a matter for the Bank to
decide.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Reduction gives Pounds 100m boost to small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With nearly 60 per cent of all small UK companies using bank overdrafts  -
compared with only 14 per cent in Germany and 31 per cent in France - the
reduction in interest rates will bring modest but immediate help to
businesses slowly emerging from recession.
Each one-percentage-point change in borrowing charges is calculated to
represent a Pounds 200m saving - or additional burden - to business costs,
so the prospect of Pounds 100m less going to banks and finance houses was
widely and warmly welcomed yesterday by the small-business sector.
The Federation of Small Businesses said: 'Businesses should be getting
letters immediately explaining that their loan and overdraft charges have
been cut again. If it is coupled next week with a Budget for business,
optimism about prospects for 1994 will be much improved.'
It added: 'If this means that taxes are set to rise next week, then all the
good will be totally undone. We also need to be as sure as possible that,
given the economic climate, low rates are here to stay.'
Britain's small-business organisations were quick to point out that the cost
of money - now at its lowest for them since 1972 - no longer ranked
particularly high on their list of problems.
One of the principal problems in recent months, as companies attempt to grow
their way out of the recession, has been to secure appropriate lines of
finance. The federation said: 'The cost of money could be even lower but it
doesn't really matter if you can't find someone prepared to lend to you.'
The issue of small-business finance has moved close to the top of the
business community's agenda and the Treasury and the Bank of England are
examining the availability of equity finance and credit.
The Forum of Private Business reported yesterday that 41 per cent of smaller
businesses were now recording growth in turnover, the highest level achieved
for about three years.
But it emphasised that only 10 per cent of small companies rated finance and
interest rates as their prime concern. 'There are many other issues which
the government needs to act upon if the growing business sector is to thrive
again,' it said.
The forum said that in particular it wanted action on measures to speed up
the late payment of bills, improvements in insolvency laws and the promised
reduction in regulations and red tape.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Bank chairman 'acted honestly'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fake burglary and other mysterious events surrounded the end of Wallace
Smith Trust Company, the collapsed London merchant bank, raising a 'finger
of suspicion' that it had been targeted by a thief or fraudster, counsel for
the bank's chairman told the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr William Clegg QC, said that could be why a Pounds 100m hole was found in
the bank's finances after it folded in 1991. He said that Mr Wallace Duncan
Smith, the bank's founder, had not known about it.
Mr Clegg said Mr Smith, who denies two charges of obtaining money by
deception, three of the theft of certificates of deposit, two of false
accounting and one charge of fraudulent trading with intent to defraud
creditors, had never acted dishonestly.
The trial continues today.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Banks may 'net' liquidation debts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and other financial institutions may 'net' their debts to each other
for calculating how much is owed to creditors when one goes into
liquidation, the Financial Law Panel said yesterday.
There had been concerns that insolvency practitioners would try to recover
in full the sums outstanding under swaps contracts but would refuse to
honour countervailing swaps owing to the same counterparty. The guidance
note issued by the FLP says sums owed and borrowed may be netted against
each other in calculating total exposure.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Warning on level of car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production next year is likely to be 100,000 less than the industry
planned and any significant extra taxes will destroy both jobs and output,
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot Talbot warned last night,
John Griffiths writes.
Mr Whalen, who is president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said the Budget should give priority to the continuation of
recovery, and avoid any extra burdens on industry generally.
Mr Whalen held out the prospect of the UK producing 2m cars a year annually
by the late 1990s, given a continued recovery.
But he made a blunt attack on the quality and competence of school-leavers
entering the industry. He said: 'Compared with our principal competitors our
people are still badly educated and trained. Our young people still emerge
from school with an inadequate grasp of the basics.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Move fails to calm backbench tax fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to cut interest rates pleased Conservative MPs,
but failed to calm backbench fears that the chancellor will raise taxes in
next week's Budget.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, boasted at question time in the Commons
that short-term interest rates were at the lowest level since 1977.
As opposition backbenchers pointed out that Labour was then in power, Mr
Major told them: 'Precisely, and at that time, inflation was 13 per cent,
and pensioners and savers were being robbed of 7 per cent (sic).'
Mr Major added to speculation about the possibility of Budget tax increases
by lecturing Mr John Smith, the opposition leader, on the government's
determination to close the gap between revenue and expenditure.
Questioned about the impact of increases in national insurance
contributions, announced in the last Budget, Mr Major said it was 'essential
to make sure that we remove the fiscal gap'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the reduction but said it
had been 'too long delayed and is less than industry expected, wanted or
needs'.
Mr Brown said that Britain needed 'lower interest rates as part of a clear
economic strategy, which the chancellor has failed to enunciate six months
after he took office'.
In spite of the exchanges, however, many backbench Tories privately agreed
with the judgment of Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman,
that the interest rate cut was 'no big deal'.
Mr Beith said the cut was 'a very small reduction which is hardly going to
set industry humming, and might not even be passed on fully to home buyers'.
He added: 'The danger is that it will prove to be a sweetener to a bad
Budget of crisis cuts in capital expenditure.'
Sir John Watts, the Conservative chairman of the Commons treasury committee,
said he hoped that the small size of the reduction indicated that tax
increases in next week's Budget would be smaller than feared.
He said: 'If this is only a little bit of sugar coating, perhaps we should
only expect a very small bitter pill. Certainly that would be my hope.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Further fall puts builders' supplier on firmer footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The half-point cut in interest rates was especially welcome to a builders'
merchant with high bank borrowings.
The interest rate cut 'absolutely delighted' Mr Charles Fisher, chairman and
chief executive of Sharpe &amp; Fisher, the publicly quoted builders' merchants
with 22 branches in southern England.
But he was quick to point out that real interest rates were still
historically high. 'We could afford to see another point cut.'
Mr Fisher says interest rates are 'the single most important factor'
affecting his company.
Sharpe &amp; Fisher, with a Pounds 33m market capitalisation, has about Pounds
7m of bank borrowings. Previous cuts in interest rates - and the company's
efforts to secure prompt payment - have brought down charges to Pounds
279,000 in the half-year to June, compared with Pounds 688,000 in the year
to last December.
The half-point cut, Mr Fisher hopes, will strengthen the 'patchy and fragile
recovery' in the housing market.
The company, based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, sells principally to
small housebuilders and repair and maintenance tradesmen ravaged by the
recession. 'We've had terrible experiences with customers going bankrupt,'
he says.
Bad debts rose from 0.5 per cent of turnover before the recession to 1.7 per
cent at its worst. Last year it was down to 1 per cent and has now fallen
further. Mr Fisher said: 'We've had to be very fierce, but the small trader
is not helped if his debts are allowed to accumulate.'
The company, which in 1988 halved its size by selling a do-it-yourself
chain, judges that the time is right to expand. This autumn it paid Pounds
2.15m for the Hampshire-based builders merchants division of Phillips &amp; Son
(Alton).

FT  24 NOV 93 / Effects of base rate change on savings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers may have to wait some time before they find out the effect of the
base rate change on the returns they receive from their deposits.
The normal pattern is for building societies to announce cuts in savings
rates some weeks after they reveal planned reductions in mortgage rates.
Savings rates cuts tend to be implemented immediately, however, while
mortgage reductions are usually delayed.
When rates do change it is unlikely that savers will suffer the full effect
of the 0.5 percentage point cut. Abbey National, which expects to make an
announcement after the Budget, said that given the low level of savings
rates it did not expect to cut rates for savers by the full half point
reduction.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said he expected savings rates
to fall by 0.2 to 0.3 of a percentage point. Many building societies'
instant access savings accounts pay about 4.5 per cent to 4.6 per cent gross
on deposits of Pounds 5,000, equating to a net income of 3.4 per cent for a
basic rate taxpayer.
Competitive pressures may restrict the societies' freedom of action, Mr
Wriglesworth added.

FT  24 NOV 93 / BCCI liquidators seek simpler deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Touche Ross, the liquidator to the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, is to push for a far simpler agreement on behalf of the
failed bank's creditors with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in the bank.
The new strategy is being developed following the surprise rejection on
October 27 of previous proposals by the Luxembourg courts.
Under the previous agreement negotiated with the liquidators, Abu Dhabi
would have contributed up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), in exchange for a
waiver of any legal action against it.
However, the courts refused to ratify the agreement on the grounds that it
did not treat all creditors equally and that it favoured Abu Dhabi above
others.
Any new offer is likely to exclude previous proposals to share the proceeds
of any litigation with Abu Dhabi or allow it to offset its debts to BCCI
against the money it is owed by the bank.
In a statement yesterday the liquidators said they would pursue a number of
'parallel strategies'.
The statement said: 'In particular, the liquidators intend to seek to
re-establish a dialogue with Abu Dhabi with a view to determining whether
any new plan can be developed for the benefit of BCCI creditors.'
The statement follows meetings between liquidators to the bank around the
world in the last few weeks, and discussions with its worldwide creditors'
committee at the start of last week.
The liquidators have more than two months to appeal, but it is thought
unlikely that they will do so. They could also sue the government of Abu
Dhabi.
The government of Abu Dhabi said it was willing to help find a more
equitable solution for creditors, but was unlikely to offer more money.

FT  24 NOV 93 / 'Wise men' look for a tighter fiscal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise half-point cut in interest rates yesterday was a sage move,
according to most of the chancellor's seven independent advisers. But they
will greet failure by Mr Kenneth Clarke to match it with a stiff tightening
of fiscal policy next week less harmoniously.
For Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University the move fits in with his
radical revised interpretation of what is the right policy mix for the
economy.
Prof Godley is worried about the ratio of consumption to GDP in the third
quarter - at a record high when it is meas-ured in constant prices.
'In view of the latest figures it is probably right to cut interest rates
and increase taxes with the strategic objective of cutting consumption as a
share of GDP and hopefully replacing it with exports and investment,' Prof
Godley said.
Earlier this year he cautioned against a rise in taxes, believing that this
would smother the recovery.
Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University also believes the recovery may
waver but says monetary easing, rather than fiscal tightening, is the answer
to the economy's problems. He said: 'I'm pleased, but we need more monetary
easing to head off the possibility that the recovery may be faltering. In my
view the government will be impelled to announce another half-point cut by
the end of the year.'
Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British
Industry, said: 'This is a step in the right direction. It reflects the low
numbers coming in for inflation and the fact that the recovery is less than
robust.' He would like to see a further cut in rates to 5 per cent by the
end of the year.
Mr Gavyn Davies, the City voice of the seven wise men, believes this will be
the last rate cut of the year, with the government leaving scope for another
50-basis-point cut in the first or second quarter of next year, once the
impact of tighter fiscal policy on the recovery became clearer.
He added: 'I don't think the cut means much in terms of the size of budget
tightening because I don't think it was going to be very significant
anyway.'
Another strategic element of the rate cut was the need to bring down
interest rates before the spring, when changes to various administered
prices will start to push the retail prices index, excluding mortgage
interest payments, towards the upper limit of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target range.
Mr Davies said: 'I don't think the government will ease monetary policy
while the monetary targets are under any threat at all.'
Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, said that the half-point reduction could be construed as
compensating for the modest fiscal tightening that seemed likely in next
week's Budget.
He said that by leaving the Bank to announce the details of the cut in
borrowing rates, the government was 'acknowledging the Bank's wish to become
more independent'.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Lenders hold fire until Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most building societies, taking their lead from Halifax, the largest lender,
have decided to hold fire until the Budget before deciding on mortgage rate
cuts.
Nationwide, the second largest lender, was the only one of the top 10
building societies to announce a cut in its mortgage rate, while National
Westminster Bank also announced a cut. Both said they would reduce their
standard variable rate by a quarter of a point to 7.74 per cent from today
for new borrowers and from January 1 for existing customers.
The reduction means a saving of Pounds 6.67 a month on a repayment mortgage
of Pounds 50,000, according to Nationwide.
Nationwide, which also announced a package of mortgage discounts, said a
reduction of much less than a quarter of a point would have scarcely been
worth undertaking.
Mr Brian Davis, operations director at Nationwide, said the move was
designed to help boost confidence in the housing market ahead of the Budget.
Newcastle building society also announced a cut to 7.75 per cent.
Halifax said it planned to reduce its mortgage rate. But Mr Mike Blackburn,
chief executive, said: 'We are now so close to the Budget that it makes
sense to wait and see the totality of the chancellor's package on November
30. We will then decide on the appropriate rate reductions.'
Building societies are likely to take advantage of the cut to widen margins.
Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest
society, said borrowers would 'almost certainly not get the full benefit of
a 0.5 per cent reduction in base rates'.
However, Mr White added, conditions were right for potential buyers to enter
the market. 'This latest move is further evidence that both low interest
rates and low inflation appear to have staying power,' he said.
'Potential housebuyers, who are holding back because of concern that high
rates will return, should feel much more confident now.' He added that the
society would soon announce new fixed mortgage rates taking the base rate
cut into account.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Business gives rate cut a cautious welcome: City anticipates
further reduction - IoD warns on tax increases / Budget aid sought for small
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial and Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British business gave a cautious welcome to yesterday's half-point cut in
interest rates, while City commentators said they expected a further cut in
the next few months.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'This is a welcome move which is fully justified by the recent good
news on inflation. It will help to sustain the recovery.'
Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of food and drinks group Allied Lyons, said:
'The important thing is that it's another little encouragement to consumers,
and another help to industry's cash flow in the form of lower interest
payments. But I hope the chancellor's got another half-point up his sleeve.'
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of leading housebuilder Wimpey, said that any
impact on the housing market would be more psychological than financial.
'While this cut brings mortgage repayments to their lowest level since the
1960s, affordability has not been an issue for more than a year now,' he
said.
'The question remains one of confidence in the economy and in job security.'
He added that it would be impossible to assess the impact of the cut until
next week's Budget.
The engineering industry responded with mixed feelings. The Machine Tool
Technologies Association said that any downward movement in rates was
welcome, but the recent string of half-point cuts had had no effect on
capital investment.
The Institute of Directors welcomed the news, but hoped that the modest cut
should not be used as a trade-off for further tax increases in the Budget.
Any new tax rises, it said, would be 'very bad news' and would endanger the
recovery.
The Federation of Small Businesses also welcomed the reduction in costs but
hoped it would be accompanied by Budget measures to help companies recover
from the recession.
In the City, there was general agreement that the chancellor had left room
for further cuts. Mr Brian Martin, senior economist with Citibank in London,
said 'we expect another 50-basis-point cut in December or early January.' He
added that sterling should remain well-supported by the fact that many
European countries were likely to cut their rates more sharply than the UK
in coming months.
Many believed last week's sharp drop in headline inflation from 1.8 per cent
to 1.4 per cent had provided Mr Clarke with the excuse he needed to cut
rates. Mr Peter Warburton, economist at Robert Fleming, said: 'The
government took the opportunity of the good inflation figures to make a step
ahead of the Budget.'
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said he still
believed base rates should go down to 4 per cent.
He said: 'There's a very good chance, but it could take some time to get
there.'

The ITV companies will find out at 8.30am today how the government proposes
to change the industry's ownership rules. The expected liberalisation, which
would allow some of the large ITV companies to take each other over, could
lead to the launching of immediate bid battles.
Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday licence, is expected to
bid for Central, the second largest company, in which it has a 20 per cent
stake. Granada will move against either Central or London Weekend, in which
it holds 20 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Civilian MoD cut may miss target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior defence officials admitted yesterday that the Ministry of Defence
might not meet its target of cutting 20 per cent of civilian staff by
1995-96, David White writes.
However, they rejected charges made by the all-party Commons defence
committee that the ministry would be lumbered with 'an unaffordable
civilian-manned infrastructure'. The 20 per cent target, foreseen under the
1990 Options for Change reforms, was designed to match cuts in the armed
forces.
The officials said, however, that this was not necessarily an overriding
aim. In many cases it was cheaper to fill posts with civilians than members
of the armed forces.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Insurance companies face disclosure of accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Draft regulations designed to bring disclosure in insurance company accounts
into line with other UK companies were yesterday introduced into parliament.
The regulations, which implement an EU directive on insurance company
accounts, would mean that insurance companies would have to give a true and
fair view of company assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss. Companies would also have to disclose hidden reserves.
The regulations would apply to financial years starting on or after 23
December 1994. The level of disclosure and transparency stipulated by the
regulations is similar to that already required for all other types of
company throughout the European Union.
Separately, the Department of Trade and Industry has sought comments on
revised banking accounting regulations. The changes would broaden the
definition of banking activities and transactions as currently defined in
the law.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Funding plans take colleges into market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last year further education has been subjected to one of the
government's most vigorous attempts to introduce a market to the public
sector.
In April, further education and sixth form colleges were removed from local
authority control and incorporated as independent institutions. Their
funding now comes from an education department quango, the Further Education
Funding Council (England), and from commercial companies which pay for
colleges to train apprentices.
Although further education colleges educate more than 2m students - more
than half of the UK's post-16 education - they remain almost invisible to
the public eye. Their aim is to provide vocational and academic courses for
teenagers and adults, as well as literacy and numeracy programmes.
The funding council is putting the finishing touches to a new funding
methodology, endorsed by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, which will
have four aims:
To encourage colleges to expand and compete for students.
To encourage them to retain students, rather than allowing them to drop out
without completing their courses.
To improve educational standards by awarding extra funds for higher
attainments. To remove any distinction between full-time and part-time
students in funding.
The funding council will set a 'tariff' for the number of students each
college is expected to teach. Under present plans this will come to about 90
per cent of total funding.
Colleges will be given extra money for each student they recruit in excess
of the tariff, and will lose funds if they fail to recruit enough. Most
colleges are happy with the principle of the arrangements but admit they are
concerned that the gearing towards expansion may be excessive.
Funding will also be available for good careers advice. Pupils will be set a
target attainment and colleges will be rewarded with extra funding if the
target is reached.
Funds will be distributed each term. If students drop out colleges will be
asked to refund money.
On top of these incentives from the public sector colleges will be allowed
to keep all funds they raise from local employers.
Mr Bill Stubbs, chief executive of the funding council, made clear that
these funds would not be taken into account when grants were allocated.
Colleges should therefore be able to offer competitively priced training to
employers, although this is yet to be widely tested in the market.

The relative ability of bar staff to pull a decent pint will be reflected in
their pay for the first time at a largechain of public houses.
Whitbread Inns, part of the Whitbread food and drinks group, is to link pay
to catering and hospitality qualifications in a new training package to be
launched in the new year.
The company said the minimum rate for a new bar staff entrant was Pounds
3.01 an hour. Employees completing the three stage proficiency scheme would
increase their minimum rate by more than 70p a hour.

FT  24 NOV 93 / The best grades but still no jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than a third of the 17,000 part-time students at Bilston Community
College in the West Midlands, which topped the government's league table for
vocational results, are unemployed.
Many would like to undertake full-time study but government rules on the
amount of study that an individual can undertake while unemployed prevent
this.
Government regulations prevent most individuals from doing more than 21
hours in college. To do so would mean losing their benefit.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the former secretary of state for employment,
investigated whether this limit could be removed but settled for a
numerically limited scheme called Learning for Work, which allows long-term
unemployed people to be officially available for work but to study for more
than 21 hours.
Mr Keith Wymer, the college's principal, said that some of his students were
eligible for this scheme but it was very limited.
'Our unemployed part-time students are very well-motivated to study and are
very committed to get a qualification in order to get a job,' he said. 'If
they drop out it's generally for financial reasons.'
The majority were over 18 and the most popular subjects were construction,
social work, business and finance, and languages.

FT  24 NOV 93 / U-turn on proposals for shorter teacher training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday withdrew controversial proposals to shorten the
training period for infant-school teachers to one year.
Under plans announced in June by Mr John Patten, education secretary, mature
adults with A-levels and relevant experience could have qualified as
teachers in England and Wales after only one year of training.
The 'mum's army' plans have been withdrawn after sustained opposition from
teachers' unions and parents' organisations.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the decision to drop the
plans was a further government U-turn on education. She said: 'It is a
victory for all of us who have spent months campaigning against
de-professionalisation of teaching.'
But Mr Patten is to proceed with measures to reform teacher training, with a
higher proportion of courses to be spent on practical training in schools.
Trainee teachers will also have to spend more time learning how to teach
English, mathematics and science.
Mature recruits will be encouraged to enter teaching by taking a new
one-year course to qualify as specialist teacher assistants. They will help
qualified teachers with teaching basic skills in the classroom.
Mr Patten said: 'The development of the new specialist teacher assistant
certificate will ensure that mature people who are already making a valuable
contribution as classroom assistants can extend their role and gain
qualifications to build on if they decide to go forward to teacher
training.'
There was a welcome from the teachers' unions for the withdrawal of the
'mums' army' plan and for Mr Patten's willingness to listen to teachers'
views.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'We have no objection to exploring appropriate routes by
which non-teaching staff could become teachers, providing there is no
question of diluting academic and professional standards.'
The announcement came as the Commons debated education and home affairs in
the fourth day of debate on the Queen's speech.
Opening yesterday's debate Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, underlined the
government's commitment to combatting crime, and implementing measures on
crime prevention, tougher sentences and judicial changes. He announced that
trials of a US-style expandable side-handled police baton will go ahead as
soon as possible.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, accused the government of
concentrating too much on punitive measures in their intended legislation.
'The main criticism is that they only focus on one element of a successful
strategy: the criminal justice system,' he said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Pub staff get 'on the house' exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relative ability of bar staff to pull a decent pint is going to be
reflected in their pay for the first time at one of the largest chains of
public houses.
Whitbread Inns, part of Whitbread, the food and drinks group, is to link pay
to qualifications in a new training package to be launched in its 1,600 pubs
in the new year.
The qualifications will be based on the competence-based National Vocational
Qualifications for the catering and hospitality industry. Skills to be
gained include serving food and drink.
Employers generally have been reluctant to pay their employees extra for the
attainment of work-based NVQs and the move by Whitbread will give staff an
incentive to improve their training.
Whitbread Inns said the minimum rate for a new entrant to a pub's bar staff
was Pounds 3.01 an hour. Employees successfully taking part in the three
stage proficiency scheme would increase their minium rate by more than 70p a
hour.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Further education results trigger controversy: Patten admits
national league tables are incomplete - Many claim comparisons are
impossible / Independents perform strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schools appear to achieve stronger results than further education colleges
in both A-levels and vocational qualifications, according to government
figures published today.
The figures are likely to provoke controversy as many colleges said the
differing goals of schools and colleges, and the limited information
available on vocational qualifications, made comparisons impossible.
Two statistics caused surprise. One was the performance of Sheffield, a
Labour-controlled authority with significant inner-city deprivation, which
had the highest overall A-level point score per entrant of any local
authority in England - where only pupils taking two or more A-levels were
considered.
The other surprise was the extent of the disparity in performance between
independent schools and others. Independents managed an average of 17.97
A-level points for candidates taking two A-levels or more (a grade A is
worth 10 points and an E is worth two), while state schools managed 12.85
and further education colleges 10.19.
In other words, pupils at independents could expect at least one grade more
in each of three subjects.
Independent schools are usually much more selective than state schools can
be, and this will account for much of the disparity. The results for many
relatively affluent southern authorities may have been harmed by large
numbers of pupils being sent to independent schools.
The performance figures for further education colleges have also aroused
controversy. They show that even for vocational qualifications, in which
many of the colleges specialise, they appear not to perform quite as well as
schools - with a pass rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications of
82.12 per cent, compared with the 85.84 per cent of state schools.
The Association for Colleges objected that the figures did not include
National Vocational Qualifications - directly work-related courses - which
account for the bulk of the colleges' work, or any indicators of the success
achieved in the adult literacy and numeracy programmes which they are
legally obliged to provide.
Any ranking system is open to question. In the tables below the FT has first
ranked colleges by success rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications.
Where two score equally, the college with the superior A-level performance
is ranked higher. This method must carry the serious 'health warning' that
it produces unfairly low rankings for sixth-form colleges, because they
concentrate on A-levels. For now, it is better than nothing.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, admitted the tables were incomplete. He
said the government would next year publish tables that included performance
in the new General National Vocational Qualifications ('Vocational
A-levels').

FT  24 NOV 93 / Sheffield puzzled but proud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield is in two minds about its position as the most successful local
education authority in the government's A-level league table. The
Labour-controlled city council disapproves of the tables but is nevertheless
proud of the city's achievement.
Sheffield's success came in spite of it being ranked 68th in the country for
GCSEs, and being one of the 40 most deprived authorities in England.
Mr Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, said parental attitudes were
crucial. Sheffield was an artisans' city so parents encouraged children to
acquire skills.
Mr Mike Bower, leader of the council, sees it as a triumph of planning. In
1988 Sheffield decided to 'go comprehensive' in educating the 16-plus age
group. Many schools had small, unviable sixth forms. An economy of scale was
needed to use resources better and offer more choice.
The city's six further education colleges pooled resources and started joint
marketing. Students could opt for the subjects they wanted, even if it meant
splitting their courses between different colleges.
The 'comprehensive' approach meant vocational qualifications were also
offered.
Mr Bower said: 'Our research showed many teenagers left school at 16 because
the sixth forms treated them as children. The further education colleges saw
them as adults. This made a big difference to attitudes.'
Only one thing prevented the system becoming truly comprehensive: after
local protests the government insisted that sixth forms be retained at seven
secondary schools in middle-class suburbs and two Roman Catholic ones. The
scheme went ahead without them, although they continued to produce A-level
results ahead of national average.
Last year the six colleges became one - the Sheffield College, with 4,000
full-time students. Its A-level scores are lower than those of Sheffield's
remaining sixth forms, but the combined results are better than elsewhere.
Now 53 per cent of Sheffield teenagers stay on after 16, compared with 30
per cent in 1987, and 83 per cent at Sheffield College doing BTec or City
and Guilds courses got diplomas.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Day-release courses in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The provision of day-release courses for employees of local companies used
to be an important activity for Selby College, one of the colleges that top
the government's tables for the successful provision of vocational training.
In line with a long-term trend, however, the significance of day release to
the North Yorkshire college has fallen - a 20 per cent fall in volume last
year alone.
The slack at Selby has been taken up by an expansion in the provision of
A-levels and full-time vocational study for qualifications.
The vocational study comes under scrutiny in the government's league tables
as the BTec National Diploma (equivalent to two or more A-levels) and the
City and Guilds Certificate, which is a similar qualification. Vocational
studies make up more than 50 per cent of the college's activities.
According to the government's tables colleges are marginally less well able
than schools to provide the vocational education that is being assessed. The
latest figures show colleges enjoying a 82.12 per cent success rate compared
with state school's 85.84 per cent success rate.
The trend towards full-time provision has been fuelled by two main
influences. First, the funding regime has encouraged the provision of
full-time courses by colleges and discouraged them from bidding for
part-time contracts such as Youth Training, the work-related training scheme
for 16 to 19-year-olds.
Participants on such work-related training would typically gain the
occupationally specific National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), the
attainment of which is not included in this year's college league tables.
Funding has aroused considerable anger when the government says it wants to
encourage work-related training. A new funding regime for colleges is
intended to address this problem.
Second, an increasing number of 16-year-olds are choosing to stay in
full-time education, rather than seek a job or enroll on YT. It is a
challenge to persuade them that vocational qualifications are equal in
esteem to academic ones.
Just less than half of the 2m students in further education are studying for
vocational qualifications.
Employers, according to both colleges and the awarding bodies, have a regard
for the qualifications in the league tables. BTec, one of the main awarding
bodies, said this year that only 5.7 per cent of the students gaining its
national diploma were unemployed six months later. Nearly 28 per cent went
on to further study while nearly 30 per cent went directly into employment.
Just how welcoming employers will be to the General National Vocational
Qualification, which will replace the existing qualifications, remains to be
seen.
The tables also show that, as in schools, students taking vocational
qualifications obtain superior results to those taking academic
qualifications. The government and college principals say this is not
because vocational qualifications are easier but because they are different.

FT  24 NOV 93 / School sixth forms achieve best A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schools appear to achieve a higher standard in academic exams than sixth
form colleges, government A-level figures show today.
But the complete data on all the A-level exams taken in the state sector,
available for the first time, shows that deprived areas are capable of
strong academic performance.
Candidates attempting two or more A-levels - the necessary requirement for
gaining a university place - fared significantly better in schools than in
tertiary colleges.
Using the University Central Admission System's A-level points system, where
an A grade is worth 10 and an E is worth two, candidates in English schools
managed 12.85 on average, compared with 10.19 at colleges.
When all state schools and colleges were ranked according to their average
A-level points score only 10 colleges man-aged a place in the top 200.
English education has shifted towards sixth form colleges over the last few
years. Local authorities can save money by closing several small school
sixth forms and creating one large tertiary college, a practice encouraged
by the Audit Commission.
But comparing schools and colleges is difficult, as many colleges offering
A-levels regard the exams as a sideline to more important mainstream
vocational training.
When the FT analysed the results of candidates attempting fewer than two
A-levels - who are presumably taking them as a supplement to vocational
training as this would not be enough for university entrance  - the gap was
much narrower, with school pupils gaining 2.76 points on average, compared
with 2.70 at colleges. Further, schools tend to be more selective than
further education colleges, who have born the brunt in the recent expansion
in children staying in school after 16.
The size of sixth form colleges also has to be taken into account. High
A-level averages are harder to sustain over a large number of pupils.
Thus the performance of Colchester's sixth form college is very strong. It
averaged 17.2 A-level points (in 43 different A-level subjects) over 707
pupils, and even managed to gain 15 places at Oxford and Cambridge in spite
of the presence in the town of two top grammar schools. The college offers
43 different A-levels subjects and a range of extra-curricular activities.
Also, A-level comparisons can now be made between local education
authorities.
The three authorities which have converted entirely to tertiary colleges
were all above average - Bury in Lancashire had a points score of 13.80,
Richmond, London had 13.40 and Harrow 12.30.
The close link between social deprivation and academic underperformance is
much weaker once pupils pass compulsory school age.
Sheffield's top-performing A-level score (15.91) indicates this strongly.
But the poorest performing A-level authorities - Southwark (5.63), Newham
(6.35), and Tower Hamlets (7.69), are among the 10 most deprived English
authorities on government figures.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Warning to US over tax demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The attempt by the US to seek tax exemptions in a proposed Uruguay Round
accord on services is putting the whole round at risk, Mr Peter Sutherland,
head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, warned yesterday.
The US wants the freedom to treat foreign services companies differently
from local ones for tax purposes.
Mr Sutherland told Mr Les Samuels, US Treasury assistant secretary for tax
affairs, that Washington had no support and that the exemption being
proposed was unacceptable to the other 114 participants in the round.
The issue is now expected to go for decision to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
Treasury secretary, and the US cabinet.
Mr Sutherland was reported as saying that an unlimited right to discriminate
in taxing foreign services suppliers would undermine the benefits of the
draft services accord in guaranteeing fair treatment for companies
establishing a commercial presence abroad.
The US position, announced a month ago after two years of laborious
negotiations on a tax clause for services, has infuriated other countries.
Some have already threatened to take similar exemptions for themselves. This
would leave foreign-based services companies around the world vulnerable to
tax discrimination, which would devalue any benefits they received from
better access to markets.
Mr Sutherland pointed out to Mr Samuels, who on Monday failed conspicuously
to convince trading partners of the justice of the US position, that the tax
exemption could prove 'extraordinarily counter-productive'. US companies,
being the most active abroad, would be the biggest losers.
The draft services text allows countries to tax foreign services suppliers
differently, for instance, to combat tax avoidance, provided this does not
amount to discrimination. The wording eventually adopted was supplied by the
US, Mr Sutherland noted.
Mr Samuels argued that the tax clause in the services agreement would upset
the existing system of bilateral tax treaties, and could tie the hands of
Congress in enacting new tax laws.
However, no other country, including the 50 or so with double taxation
agreements with the US, sees a threat to the existing system, while Mr
Samuels' remarks on new legislation have only added to fears that Washington
is planning tough and possibly discriminatory legislation on taxation of
foreign companies.
Mr Samuels has denied that the US has any discriminatory intentions. But, in
that case, Mr Sutherland said yesterday, why was it asking for complete
freedom to discriminate, a freedom that would also ensure that affected
governments had no remedy through multilateral disputes procedures?
With just three weeks to go to the Uruguay Round deadline of December 15,
the issue has become urgent.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Toyota replaces European parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota has been shipping Japanese-produced components to its Burnaston car
plant in Derbyshire as substitutes for UK and Continental-manufactured parts
which have failed to meet quality standards or delivery schedules, writes
John Griffiths.
Failure to meet requirements by some of the company's 200 European
components suppliers is only on a very small scale, but that Toyota has felt
obliged to do so appears to confirm the findings of independent research
projects that significant performance gaps persist between parts of the
European industry and 'world class' counterparts in Japan.
Of 500 additional UK and Continental-produced parts which Toyota has sought
to introduce on its Burnaston assembly line since production began this
year, around 20 have had to be substituted, said Mr Yukihisa Hirano,
managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK).

Vietnam's heavy industry minister, Mr Tran Lum, said Renault, Peugeot,
Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota and Mitsubishi had also
shown interest. South Korea's Daewoo is also understood to have made
proposals.
Vietnam has three motor plants - a Japanese-South Korean company assembling
four-wheel-drive cars, a joint venture between Mekong and Fiat's Iveco
making trucks and buses, and a Philippine-Vietnamese concern making Mazdas
and Kias.
Mr Martin Posth, VW board member responsible for Asia, said the plan was to
start by manufacturing about 2,000 semi-knockdown cars a year, then start
construction of complete knockdown cars. Local content would increase and
workers would get more advanced training.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Siemens and ABB expand eastward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri, two of Europe's biggest engineering groups,
have announced joint ventures in Russia and China respectively as they seek
to expand their presence in fast-growing markets, writes Andrew Baxter.
Siemens is taking a 31 per cent stake in Moscow-based Interautomatika, which
will handle the engineering, sales and marketing of its instrumentation and
control (I&amp;C) equipment for fossil-fuelled power stations.
ABB has reached agreement with Beijing-based Beijing Rectifier Plant to make
digital converter equipment for electrical drives. The venture will be
majority owned and managed by ABB.
The importance of the Asian market was underlined yesterday by GEC Alsthom,
the Anglo-French engineering group, which has won a turnkey contract of
about Pounds 255m to build a 2x100MW coal-fired station for PLN of
Indonesia.
It has also signed a Dollars 200m contract with Power Grid Corporation of
India to supply a turnkey high voltage direct current convertor station to
link the western and southern regions of the country's electricity networks.
Rolls-Royce and Westinghouse have announced the first order for their new
power generation package based on the industrial version of the Trent
aero-engine. Polsky Energy has signed a letter of intent for the package for
use in Quebec, Canada.

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Kantor and Brittan see Gatt progress -
Further round of talks next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and European Union negotiators claimed in Washington last night to have
made progress on the issues blocking agreement in the Uruguay Round and
agreed to meet again next week in Europe.
After less than two days of talks, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said he and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, had
defined the remaining issues dividing them 'in all their aspects', discussed
viable alternatives, and agreed to reach a preliminary accord to bring to
the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks in Geneva.
Their aides will continue talks in Washington this week.
Sir Leon said: 'There is a long way to go and many important concerns which
can't be met at the last minute.'
He was to meet later for a 'photo opportunity' with President Bill Clinton
but did not expect to continue negotiating.
On the agenda was the usual round of issues: agriculture, audiovisual
matters, aircraft, market access, services, rules for a multilateral trading
organisation. Mr Kantor called on the 'larger nations' and Japan to increase
their offers on market access, services and agriculture.
Meanwhile, US industry lobbyists were anxiously awaiting the outcome of
talks, fearful that their groups might be left out of a final settlement. On
agriculture, some said there were indications that the US might consider
attaching a side letter to the controversial Blair House accord to 'clarify'
the deal in a way that might satisfy French objections.
One of the most prominent lobbyists, Mr Jack Valenti, a former presidential
speechwriter and long-time head of the Motion Picture Association, was
demanding an audio-visual agreement which would free new television
technologies from EU restrictions and guarantee equal treatment for foreign
and domestic films and television programming.
Mr Valenti hinted at a willingness to compromise on the EU's current
voluntary quota system for television programmes. An EC-proposed standstill
on protection might be acceptable, he said, 'because only the French,
Italians and Spanish have any quotas, and only four or five other countries
have them in the rest of the world'.
Another issue on the agenda, market access, was getting close scrutiny from
the Semiconductor Industry Association, which has long sought an elimination
of electronics tariffs against EU opposition. The SIA saw its hand
strengthened last week when 10 of the 14 Asian-Pacific countries, including
South Korea, agreed at last week's Seattle summit to support duty-free
status for electronics providing there were 'comparable commitments from our
trading partners'.
The SIA has the support of its European counterpart for 'improvements' in
the current negotiating draft on intellectual property rights. Most
pernicious, in its view, was a 'compulsory licensing' provision which
appeared to permit a government to force a patent holder to license his
work.

Minoan Lines, Greece's largest passenger shipping operator, has placed a
Dr38bn (Dollars 152m) order for two ferries with Fosen MEK Verksteer, the
Norwegian shipbuilders, Kerin Hope reports from Athens.
Minoan, based on Crete, wants more capacity for larger vehicles on its main
route between Greece and Italy and to cut the journey time to less than 24
hours.
The Adriatic crossing has become the main link with western Europe for both
Greek exporters and tourists travelling by road since the war in Bosnia
blocked the overland route through the former Yugoslavia.
Minoan Lines said the 31,000-ton ferries would carry 200 camper vans and 150
trucks each, together with 1,500 passengers. The first will be delivered in
spring 1995.
The company operates 10 ferries in the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean
and carries over 1m passengers a year. NEWS IN BRIEF

FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Satellite operator's sell-off will make a
world of difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international commercial satellite industry is on the verge of a
transformation, thanks to a plan by Inmarsat to turn itself from a
quasi-public sector satellite operator into a private-sector company.
Inmarsat has assets of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) and annual sales of almost
Dollars 400m, which have been rising since the 1980s at more than 20 per
cent a year. If it succeeds in re-inventing itself it would be a powerful
rival in the private sector to the likes of Motorola, the US electronics
company, in the race to create a global mobile satellite network for
portable telephones by the end of the century.
The plan, revealed last month, is that the organisation's 70-plus partners -
the world's telecommunications companies and authorities including British
Telecom and France Telecom - should be able to trade their holdings.
It sounds simple, but it would mean a profound change in the way the
organisation works.
Inmarsat is the Cinderella of the satellite and telecommunications
industries. It was created by inter-governmental treaty in 1979 to plug a
gap in the fast-growing world of satellite telecoms: the provision of
telecommunications services to ships, especially those from poorer countries
which could not afford to offer even emergency satellite links.
This public-service duty has since been eclipsed by the explosive growth in
mobile telecommunications. Inmarsat's sales have almost quadrupled in the
space of five years as it has expanded into portable satellite
communications for emergency services, the media and airlines.
Inmarsat's partners believe there is huge value locked up in their holdings,
'substantially more than the (Dollars 1bn) asset value', says Mr Bruce
Crockett, chairman of Comsat, the publicly quoted US company, which is the
biggest stakeholder in Inmarsat with 25 per cent.
There is also a pressing commercial need for Inmarsat to distance itself
from its partners. Many of them are state-owned, non-profit organisations,
and private-sector companies are trying to exclude Inmarsat from sectors in
which they compete.
Inmarsat's assailants, led by Motorola, have a point. Thanks to the
inter-governmental treaty and the links with its partners, Inmarsat has tax
and regulatory advantages over the private sector.
In the past this has mattered little because only Inmarsat used satellites
and offered a single global network.
But Inmarsat's monopoly is being challenged by Motorola and other large US
electronics companies. They all want to create their own global mobile
telecommunications services, based on satellites, and they argue that
Inmarsat in its present form would be an unfair competitor.
Inmarsat recognises the threat to its operations, and is prepared to rise to
the challenge. Its director-general, Mr Olof Lundberg, says: 'If we are
going to join the commercial world, we need a new set of attitudes. We need
to remake ourselves. Several groups are now preparing to tackle us head on.'
But time is short. Motorola's consortium has already raised Dollars 100m in
cash and another Dollars 700m in pledges as the first stage in financing its
mobile satellite telephone project, called Iridium.
Inmarsat will propose what will in effect be its privatisation in the first
quarter of 1994 and, if all goes to plan, begin the process in the final
quarter.
Others may follow: Inmarsat has a sister organisation, Washington-based
Intelsat, and a pan-European cousin, Eutelsat. Their structures are much the
same as Inmarsat's.
Intelsat and Eutelsat do not face the same pressing need to change.
Nevertheless, they will be closely watching Inmarsat's progress.
If they decide to follow, the world of telecommunications will be changed
beyond recognition as buyers of telecommunications services find a new group
of suppliers knocking at their doors.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Clinton offers to hold talks with N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday offered North Korea the prospect of talks
on 'a thorough, broad approach to the issues that divide us', but insisted
the US was not relaxing its demands nor making any concessions.
'If it abandons its nuclear option and honours its international
non-proliferation commitments, the door will be open on a wide range of
issues. . .' Mr Clinton said after meeting President Kim Young-sam of South
Korea at the White House.
'If it does not, it risks the increased opposition of the entire
international community.'
Mr Clinton reaffirmed the US' 'unyielding commitment to South Korea's
security', but said the US and South Korea were willing to re-examine their
policies if North Korea was willing to allow inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor its nuclear programme.
Both Mr Clinton and Mr Kim appeared to be anxious to play down suggestions
they were offering Pyongyang a 'package deal', offering specific short-term
concessions, such as the cancellation of this year's Team Spirit joint
US-South Korean military exercise, if North Korea complied with their
immediate demands, and holding out longer-term economic and diplomatic gains
in exchange for continued co-operation.
Both Washington and Seoul agree that UN sanctions against North Korea would
not be 'a particularly attractive option'.
Foreign policy experts outside the Clinton administration acknowledge the
need to negotiate with North Korea, if only to build support among other
countries for tougher measures should the need arise.
They warn, however, about the danger of making concessions just to persuade
North Korea to remain a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
while doing nothing about suspect sites believed to be part of a secret
nuclear programme.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Congress in deadlock on gun curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Senate is almost certain to be called back into session next week to
vote on handgun controls, after several parliamentary manoeuvres failed to
break a Republican filibuster.
Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, and Senator Bob Dole, his
Republican counterpart, were still debating tactics last night on the floor
of a virtually empty chamber, almost all the other senators having gone home
for Thanksgiving. But Senator Mitchell was adamant he would not let the
Senate adjourn until January without forcing another vote on the Brady bill,
which imposes a waiting period on the purchase of handguns.
This increasingly bitter confrontation, devoted to the finest technicalities
of the bill, overshadowed the conclusion of a congressional term which
continued to hand President Clinton a number of provisional victories.
The House narrowly voted down the bipartisan Penny-Kasich bill, which would
have forced Dollars 103bn in extra spending cuts over the next five years,
and passed the president's more modest Dollars 37bn alternative. But the
closeness of the first vote, 219-213, suggests that budget-trimming has not
lost steam and that the proposed balanced budget amendment could pass next
year.
The House also approved after much delay, a campaign finance reform bill
intended, mostly through voluntary compliance, to cut the cost of elections.
Substantial differences, however, remain with the Senate version, to be
carried over until next year.
But both chambers finally agreed on a measure extending unemployment
benefits by 13 weeks to those who have used up their standard six months of
eligibility. This now awaits the president's signature. Yesterday he signed
the bill ending US sanctions against South Africa.
The Brady bill passed both chambers last week in slightly differing forms
and the House on Monday night accepted the compromise version produced by a
joint conference committee. This includes a five year life for the bill,
whereas the Republican wants it cut to four, as was contained in the Senate
bill. Mr Clinton was guardedly confident that a deal would eventually be
cut.
The extent of the pressure for tighter gun control was evident in the
announcement by Winchester, the firearms manufacturer, that it was
withdrawing from public sale one of its most destructive bullets. The Black
Talon, it said, would only be made available for the police and military .
This is the cartridge, able to pierce bullet-proof vests and expandable on
impact, that had attracted the particular attention of Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan last month. He proposed a punitive 10,000 per cent sales
tax increase on it.
Mr Howard Paster, the White House chief of congressional relations, who
played a central role in winning approval by Congress of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, surprised Washington by saying he would resign at the
end of the year for family reasons.

FT  24 NOV 93 / US plans to unite bank watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury yesterday outlined plans to consolidate the four federal
bank supervisory agencies into a single Federal Banking Commission.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the proposal would carry out
the administration's mandate to make the economy function more smoothly by
'eliminating a confusing and duplicative regulatory structure to improve
efficiency and decision-making'.
Writing in the Washington Post, Mr Bentsen said the overlapping supervisory
responsibilities of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift
Supervision were decades out of date.
'It is a drag on the economy, a headache for our financial services industry
and a source of friction within our government. It must be replaced,' he
said.
While the Comptroller regulates banks with a national charter, banks with a
state charter are monitored by their local supervisory agencies. But state
chartered banks are also supervised by the Fed if they belong to the Federal
Reserve System, and by the FDIC if they do not. Bank holding companies and
foreign banks also come under the Fed, while savings and loan institutions
are mostly covered by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
Mr Bentsen pointed out that a bank holding company today might well include
among its affiliates a state-chartered bank, a nationally chartered bank and
a thrift, and come under all four federal agencies.
He said the Fed should retain its responsibilities for monetary policy and
the payments system, while the FDIC should stay a deposit insurer.
The Treasury has separately thrown its weight behind proposals to allow
banks to open branches outside their home states, but this measure was
blocked in the Senate last week when Republicans boycotted a meeting called
to draft the legislation.
Congress has finally passed a measure to provide funds for the Resolution
Trust Corporation to enable it to complete the mopping up of bankrupt
savings and loan institutions.
A vote in the House of Representatives early yesterday morning provided
Dollars 18.3bn (Pounds 12.2bn) for the S&amp;L bailout. For more than a year the
RTC has been unable to shut down failed S&amp;Ls because of Congress's
reluctance to approve necessary funding.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Heart in Europe, hopes on Asia: Warren Christopher tells
Jurek Martin why priorities are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be wrong to infer that Mr Warren Christopher is perturbed by
suggestions that western Europe fears that the US has somehow 'gone Asian'.
But the secretary of state does acknowledge the 'perception', induced by
disagreements over Bosnia, that there have been transatlantic strains over
the last 10 months that need to be set right.
So, on Monday afternoon he invited a small group of European journalists in
for consecutive chats, the first such he has given with clear intent since
taking over at Foggy Bottom.
Wearing his trademark dark pinstriped suit, he is, as ever, supremely
courteous and if there are additional lines on his 68-year-old face there
were so many to begin with that none can be said to denote particular
fatigue. Sitting cross-legged on an upright chair in the Monroe Room, he
fiddles a little with his black pen but only once, when asked a question
about Italy, does he fleetingly refer to the briefing file on his lap.
The message - that Europe 'remains at the centre of our concerns' - is
hardly new, though the need to repeat it is intriguing. Succinct opening
remarks point out that of the six underlying principles of US foreign
policy, the first three - global growth, Russia and European security -
directly involve the continent, as does the sixth, a whole host of other
'global issues'.
President Bill Clinton, Mr Christopher notes, is going to Europe three times
next year - for the Nato summit in Brussels and on to Moscow in January, for
the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings in June and for the Group of
Seven industrial nations' summit in Naples in July. A fourth trip is also
understood to be under consideration.
Mr Christopher says it has been 'unfortunate that attempts to find a
solution to the as yet insoluble Bosnian problem have contributed to the
perception' of disagreement. But, he insists, the US 'will carry out our
obligations and take into account our vital interests'.
In the Balkans, these are 'containing the conflict' so it does not spread
south to Kosovo and Macedonia; humanitarian relief; and, if necessary and
Congress is willing, sending a large US military contingent to help enforce
any 'consensually agreed' settlement.
There are many in Washington, including perhaps the secretary of state
himself, who believe Congress will never give such approval if asked. All he
will say is 'we do not feel that we have sufficient national interest in
order to put the 100,000 troops into Bosnia that we believe would be
necessary to compel a settlement between the parties.'
But he was unrepentant about an earlier comment that he thought Washington
had been too eurocentric for too long. This was 'a recognition of the
reality of the cold war period'. Equally, 'the primacy of opportunity for
the US in Asia is a statement of fact.'
This was of minimal concern to him since US international relations are 'not
a zero sum game', in which the focus on Asia inevitably meant a 'derogation'
from Europe. It was only the accident of the G7 calendar that sent Mr
Clinton to a summit in Tokyo and then to South Korea and perfectly logical
for him to follow this up with the Apec session in Seattle last weekend and
meetings this week with President Kim Young-sam of South Korea and President
Fidel Ramos of the Philippines.
But there was nothing wrong now with transatlantic communications at the
highest level, he said. 'If you look ahead to one month from now, as Gatt
comes to the end game, or eight months from now, after the G7, you'll see
there has been much communication between us.'
On Nato, for which he is full of praise, he makes the diplomatic point that
the US thinks it important to 'reach out' to the countries of eastern Europe
and to 'incorporate them into Nato's structures in such a way that it is
healthy for them and healthy for Nato itself'. Above all, Bosnia should not
be construed as 'a failure of Nato'.
He also brushes off questions about tension between the US and the UN
leadership of its secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, only
acknowledging 'differences of emphasis' over Somalia in the now-abandoned
pursuit of faction leader General Mohammed Farah Aideed.
The UN 'faces a tremendous agenda with limited resources', and 'we remain
highly supportive' of the institution.
Individual European countries also get high praise, particularly Germany.
Disagreement over trading with Iran should not disguise 'the overriding
reality of friendship and support' between Washington and Bonn. Relations
with France were 'so much broader' than disagreements over trade, though he
adds bluntly: 'Blair House (the EC-US agricultural pact) will not be
renegotiated.' The politics of Italy are for the Italians themselves to
decide. In the aggregate a whole host of political, economic, investment and
cultural connections are too deep to be dismissed.
Mr Christopher crosses the Atlantic himself next week, en route to the
Middle East. He will attend the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe meeting in Rome and European Union, Nato and Gatt talks in Brussels.
He does not expect the sort of trouble he encountered last spring on his
ill-fated Bosnian mission.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Dominican Republic debt cut plan agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dominican Republic's bank creditors have committed themselves to an
agreement that will cut the country's bank debt in half. The accord requires
approval by the country's congress. If this is forthcoming next month, the
agreement could be completed by February, said Mr David Hilton of the Bank
of Nova Scotia, which heads the country's bank advisory committee.
Banks were offered the choice of exchanging every dollar of debt either for
25 cents in cash in a buyback, for concessional 30-year bonds carrying a 35
per cent discount to face value, or for bonds to reduce interest payments.
The accord covers Dollars 775m (Pounds 520m) of debt and Dollars 265m of
interest arrears.
The government insisted the banks' choices should in total reduce debt 50
per cent, and that has now been achieved. Some 35 per cent of the debt will
be submitted for cash, and the rest will be exchanged for discount bonds.
The discount bonds, paying interest at  13/16 point over Libor, will carry
collateral guaranteeing repayment of principal and 12 months of interest.
Some six to 10 banks have not yet committed themselves to the agreement, but
the number is not sufficient to hold up the accord, Mr Hilton said.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Growth dive adds to political jitters in Venezuela:
Stagnation in one of the world's fastest-growing economies - and in an
election year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's economy, which between 1990 and 1992 posted one of the world's
highest growth rates, has gone into a steep decline in this, an election,
year.
A combination of weak international oil prices, political upheaval and the
uncertainties posed by national elections on December 5 slowed real gross
domestic product growth during the first half of the year to a negative 2.3
per cent compared with the first half of 1992.
Some government officials are predicting full-year 1993 growth of about 1
per cent - compared with 7.3 per cent in 1992 and 10.4 per cent in 1991.
This is well below official estimates of 2-4 per cent growth made a few
months ago, and 5 per cent at the beginning of the year.
Even this may be optimistic. Many businessmen in Venezuela are expecting
worse results. 'To be sincere, I don't think we'll see any positive growth
this year at all,' said Mr Rafael Alfonzo Hernandez, executive director of
Alfonzo Rivas, a large processed food company, and a spokesman for an
important industrial association.
'Investors are on stand-by,' commented Mr Alejandro Szilagyi, a Venezuelan
business consultant who works with domestic and international companies. 'At
best, we're stagnating this year, and we could have negative growth.'
Part of this is because petroleum exports, which account for most of
Venezuela's foreign income, have been hurt by weak international oil prices.
Political turmoil during the year - including the removal of an elected
president, a wave of unexplained bombings and concern over a possible
military uprising - has damaged investor confidence in many sectors.
On the positive side, Venezuela has been able to maintain strong
international reserves as the central bank kept interest rates high.
Reserves at the end of October were Dollars 12.6bn, down 2.9 per cent from
year-end 1992 and equivalent to just over a year of imports.
Unemployment has also fallen this year - to 6.9 per cent at end-June from
8.4 per cent a year earlier, but that is likely to worsen next year as many
companies - including the state oil company PDVSA - reduce personnel.
Inflation though could rise to 40 per cent or more this year, in part
because of a 10 per cent value added tax that came into effect on October 1
as part of the government's effort to close its fiscal deficit. Even before
the tax took effect, many retailers raised prices sharply.
The government has little room for manoeuvre. Lower oil prices have cut tax
remittances by PDVSA and the central government is so low on funds that it
is postponing tens of millions of dollars in payments to local suppliers
until 1994.
Meanwhile less than two weeks before the presidential, congressional and
state elections, it is still far from clear who the next president will be
or what economic policies he will advance.
'There is considerable willingness among Venezuelans and foreigners to
invest,' Mr Szilagyi said. 'A lot of projects are waiting for the elections
to provide some clear policies for the future.' While private investment
remains active in some economic sectors, especially among foreign
telecommunications companies, it is generally down from 1992.
The four leading presidential candidates have said they would deal with key
problems such as the government's fiscal deficit, inflation, high real
interest rates, external debt, failing public services and demands for
higher wages by public sector employees. So far they have been short on
specific policies.
Former president Rafael Caldera, 77, leads the pack of 18 candidates in
virtually all public opinion polls. He has expressed strong opposition to
free-market reforms initiated nearly five years ago. However, in meetings
with international investors outside Venezuela, the ex-president's advisers
have suggested that a Caldera government might maintain some reforms and
would encourage private investment.
The other main candidates, in order of public support reflected in the
polls, are Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, 50, a former state governor who is
standing for the Christian Democrat Copei party; Mr Andres Velasquez, 40, a
labour leader and state governor who represents the leftist Radical Cause
party; and Mr Claudio Fermin, 43, a former mayor of Caracas who is the
candidate for the Democratic Action party.
Both Mr Alvarez and Mr Fermin argue that market reforms, among others, must
be continued in Venezuela. Mr Velasquez offers a mix of pro- and anti-reform
policies.
Pollsters say that a large number of potential voters (perhaps as many as
35-40 per cent) are still undecided or are 'soft', that is, they could
change their preference by election day.
The last days of the campaign have been complicated by renewed rumours of a
coup d'etat, and by a military investigation of the secretary general of
Radical Cause. The military have accused Mr Pablo Medina, a member of
Congress and long-time leader of the party, of receiving a cache of
automatic weapons stolen from a Venezuelan army base last year, and want to
court martial him as an accessory to military rebellion. Mr Medina and his
party deny the charges, saying the armed forces and others are trying to
damage his party's image soon before the election.
Radical Cause, whose members include former Marxists, is expected to obtain
a significant share of protest votes next month and to win an important
block of congressional seats. In Venezuela's confused political atmosphere,
it is not clear whether the charges will hurt the party or pull in more
votes.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Nigeria's debt arrears pass Dollars 5bn

Arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.4bn) external debt exceed
Dollars 5bn, presenting the country with its most serious economic crisis
since independence, say local economists and western creditors.
Without a rescheduling agreement, arrears will rise, external support from
donors such as the World Bank will be suspended, industry will continue to
function well below capacity, and the country's economic decline will
continue.
Prospects for an economic policy agreement with the International Monetary
Fund receded following last week's removal from office of Chief Ernest
Shonekan, and the assumption of power by General Sani Abacha.
An IMF deal is an essential condition to debt rescheduling. Agreement is now
unlikely much within a year, say creditors.
In 1992 Nigeria serviced only Dollars 167m of its bilateral debt
obligations, having averaged around Dollars 1.3bn a year in 1990 and 1991.
But by the end of 1992 its arrears in bilateral interest alone were Dollars
1bn, with interest and principal arrears reaching around Dollars 3bn. In
March 1993 the former finance minister, Mr Oladele Olashore, was summoned to
Paris for an explanation.
The position has continued to decline. In 1993, Nigeria's bilateral
creditors were owed Dollars 2.4bn in loan principal and interest payments,
nearly all of it to the Paris Club of official creditors. But by the end of
August less than Dollars 100m had been paid, say western officials. They
calculate that total external debt arrears have now reached Dollars 5bn.
Priority for external debt service goes to the World Bank, but Nigeria
narrowly avoided Bank suspension in early November when it paid Dollars
140m, or three months' debt service, almost two months in arrears.
If a member country is 60 days late in paying, the World Bank automatically
suspends all its loan operations. The Bank's loan portfolio is worth a total
of Dollars 5.8bn, of which nearly Dollars 2.3bn is yet to be disbursed.
Nigeria's net capital flows with the World Bank have been negative for the
last three years, averaging Dollars 247m a year. According to the World
Bank, its disbursements to Nigeria are slow because of bureaucratic and
legal bottlenecks, lack of counterpart funds, inefficient procurement and
design flaws in some projects.
Economists say Nigeria has run up arrears in debt service to the other main
multilateral creditor, the African Development Bank.
The other priorities for debt service are its par bonds and promissory
notes, which are being honoured, and supplier credits.
The dollar value of Nigeria's debt has grown by about 50 per cent since the
launch in 1986 of a structural adjustment programme, since lapsed. At the
end of last year it stood at nearly Dollars 30bn, equivalent to 113 per cent
of GDP.
Nigeria's new military rulers named a Provisional Ruling Council. Gen Abacha
is chairman and defence minister. Baba Gana Kingibe, running mate of
thwarted presidential candidate Moshood Abiola, is foreign minister.
Apart from justice and foreign ministers, the only civilian council member
will be Mr Alex Ibru, publisher of the Lagos Guardian newspaper, who is
named interior minister.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Swift U-turn for business emperor's life: The Elliott affair
is extraordinary, even by Australian standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life for John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman, has changed its
direction sharply.
A few years ago, he was running a multi-billion-dollar corporate empire with
interests ranging from Courage and Foster's beer to agribusinesses and
resources. Now the possibility of criminal charges looms, after a federal
court judge yesterday lifted an injunction barring the Australian
authorities from investigating or bringing a case, centred on alleged
corporate theft, against him.
The judge's ruling follows a 17-day hearing over the merits of that
injunction and could still be overturned on appeal, an option which Mr
Elliott's counsel quickly indicated would be pursued. But the delay may be
brief. The judge agreed to suspend any lifting of the injunction to allow an
appeal to be lodged in 'an appropriately short period'.
Already the 'Elliott affair' has proved extraordinary, even by the
rumbustious standards of Australian business behaviour. For Mr Elliott, who
denies any impropriety, has countered the threat of criminal charges with
allegations that the National Crime Authority's interest in the business
affairs of his former Elders IXL company has been politically motivated. The
NCA, for its part, has said that its investigation stems solely from the
possibility of serious wrongdoing.
At the heart of the imbroglio, according to statements of claim lodged by Mr
Elliott and an Elliott associate, are a series of complex foreign exchange
transactions dating back to 1988. These are said to have involved Elders
IXL, which was Mr Elliott's quoted company in the 1980s, the Bank of New
Zealand, and companies connected with executives of Equiticorp, the failed
New Zealand-based group.
The transactions between Elders and BNZ are said to have taken place in
January and September that year, and resulted in an aggregate loss to Elders
of around ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 29m). Companies connected to Equiticorp
executives, also dealing via BNZ, benefited by a like amount at similar
times.
The Elliott camp claims these deals were part of a 'normal' hedging
operation, related to Elders' exposure to sterling at that time. The loss to
Elders in New Zealand, it is claimed, was made up in the UK.
But talk of payments between Elders and Equiticorp is not entirely new. It
surfaced last year, during the trial of Equiticorp's former chief executive,
Mr Allan Hawkins, who is now serving a six-year jail sentence. Mention was
made then of a mysterious 'H-fee'. One witness said that he assumed the fee,
allegedly paid from Elders to Equiticorp, was in some way connected to the
bid situation surrounding Broken Hill Proprietary in the mid-1980s, although
he stressed this was an assumption.
Elders had snapped up a near-19 per cent interest in the steel and natural
resources giant, in April 1986; a few weeks later, Equiticorp followed suit,
buying a smaller interest which was eventually sold on to the late Robert
Holmes a Court, another Australian entrepreneur.
Whatever the outcome of potential inquiries by the NCA, assuming it is
eventually allowed to pursue them, the twist is Mr Elliott's assertion he
has been the victim of a political conspiracy. The former Liberal party
president claims this started in 1989, before the 1990 federal election, and
was designed to damage both himself and the Liberal party.
Justice Michael Foster was plainly unimpressed. In yesterday's ruling, he
described suggestions that the NCA had abused its powers and deprived Mr
Elliott of his civil rights as 'rhetorical flourish'. While the judge
acknowledged that Mr Elliott 'was being made, as he asserts, a political
target by Labor party politicians', he also said it 'would take a quantum
leap to infer. . . that the NCA had entered into an unlawful conspiracy with
politicians and the media to attack Elliott's reputation'.
With that in mind, he ruled there were no grounds for a civil court to
intervene in a criminal matter. 'That the laying of charges against the
applicants should be further delayed until the ultimate disposal of these
proceedings would, in my view, be a quite unacceptable interference with the
administration of criminal justice in the state of Victoria,' he stated
firmly.
The drama, like many of Mr Elliott's previous corporate machinations, looks
set to run.

Ivory Coast edged closer to a constitutional crisis yesterday,with the main
opposition party arguing that ailing President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is no
longer able to govern, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
State-run media maintained a news blackout on the health of Mr
Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving leader, not seen in public since
returning on November 19 from prostate surgery in Europe. The Ivorian
Popular Front, the main opposition party, says Mr Houphouet-Boigny can no
longer run the country.
Electricity workers staged a brief strike on Monday and Abidjan's main
hospitals are due to be hit by a strike today. Civil service salaries are
being paid up to three weeks late, an unprecedented delay.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Iraq keeps up shelling of marsh Arabs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iraqi troops have continued indiscriminate artillery bombardments of Shia
Arabs in the southern marshes, although aerial attacks ceased with the
imposition of a Security Council no-fly order, writes Michael Littlejohns at
the UN. A UN report, prepared by Mr Hans van der Stoehl, a former Dutch
foreign minister, is a severe setback for Iraq's case for the lifting of
sanctions.
It coincides with the current visit to New York of Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi
deputy prime minister, who is trying to convince Security Council members
his government has complied with all relevant resolutions and should be
allowed to resume unrestricted oil sales.
But Mr van der Stoehl rejected this argument. As for the Iraqi claim for
sanctions to be lifted on humanitarian grounds, he said Baghdad had refused
an opportunity to sell oil worth up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.07bn). He
blamed the plight of Iraqi civilians, including the marsh Shias, on the
Iraqi government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines' stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
for a new economic programme will resume in January, Mr Howard Handey, the
fund's representative in Manila, said yesterday.
Mr Handey added that Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, had
agreed to visit the Philippines early next year to review progress in the
negotiations and the country's economic performance.
Mr Camdessus yesterday met Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, in
Washington at the end of Mr Ramos's two-week trip to the US.
Manila's negotiations with the IMF have been deadlocked over the
government's inability to get its Congress to approve new tax measures aimed
at reducing the fiscal deficit.
The Philippines' last economic stabilisation programme with IMF support
ended in March. Negotiators failed to secure the funds for a successor
scheme. The negotiators had been aiming for a three-year, Dollars 800m
(Pounds 543m) exit programme, which would end IMF monitoring of the
Philippine economy. However, local officials have recently scaled down
expectations to another short-term credit facility instead.
The Philippines has been under pressure from its official donors to conclude
a new programme with the IMF on which further assistance could be pegged.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Israel and PLO draw the line in Jericho sand: Julian Ozanne
on talks over the size and shape of the area for Palestinian self-rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a few months Mr Yassir Arafat will take up residence in the dusty,
palm-fringed town of Jericho, the planned de facto capital of Palestinian
self-government, after nearly half a century of exile.
Yet, so far, no one knows what area around Jericho Mr Arafat and his
embryonic government will control.
Yesterday Palestinian and Israeli peace negotiators began talks on the size
of the Jericho area from which Israeli troops will begin to withdraw in less
than three weeks. It is certain to prove one of the most difficult and
sensitive issues on their long peace agenda.
The fact that the two sides are now discussing Jericho is a sign of how far
they have come and how far they still have to go to reach a protocol, due to
be signed on December 13. It will provide for a phased four-month Israeli
troop pull-out from the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho and the handover of
policing and administration to Palestinian hands. Palestinian elections are
planned for next July.
When negotiators began discussions on how to implement the historic
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord the task seemed well-nigh impossible.
Although the peace agreement provides only for an interim and partial
solution to the problem, many of the issues that have had to be solved, such
as security and claims to territorial sovereignty, cut to the heart of the
conflict.
But in the past five weeks the two sides have proceeded at a furious pace,
reaching broad agreement on a range of complex security problems such as
policing, the future role of the Israeli military and the first release of
Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. By all measures the negotiations have
been a remarkable achievement in beginning to solve one of the world's most
intractable conflicts.
Now the size of Jericho and the future economic relations between Israel and
the Palestinian economy, which is also being discussed in Paris this week,
are the most substantive issues left on the agenda.
The eventual size of Palestinian-controlled Jericho could be anywhere
between 25 sq km (the present area of the town's municipal boundaries) and
345 sq km (the size of the old British mandatory Jericho district). Israel
is pushing for the smallest possible area while the Palestinians are
demanding the full 345 sq km. For both sides the shape and size of the
Jericho area is critical.
Israeli military officials say the Jericho district includes two significant
defence lines - the Jordan line east of Jericho and the fortified hill line
west of the town. Military experts say the Jordan line is essential for
defence against external threats and are demanding Israel continue to hold a
5km strip west of the river to control the Jordan river and prevent armed
infiltration of guerrillas into Israel. The hill line, they say, is critical
to controlling the area around the town and the road to Jerusalem and has
several army facilities.
The second big concern for the Israelis is security of the Jewish settlers
who will continue living in the Jericho district. There are three Israeli
settlements close to the town - Vered Jericho, Mitzpe Jericho and Beit
HaArava. Israeli officials say they could evacuate Jericho town and the
Palestinian refugee camps of Ein Sultan and Akabat Jaber without
surrendering the two defence lines and the three settlements.
The Israelis are likely to press for three Israeli-controlled enclaves in
the Palestinian-controlled areas to protect a total of six settlements,
including the three close to Jericho town.
The Israelis also want to build a bypass road around Jericho to allow
settlers to travel on roads controlled by Israeli security and police. The
Israelis will also demand full control over the Allenby border crossing into
Jordan.
Palestinian officials say they could accept most Israeli security concerns
if Israel is generous with its surrender of a large area of territory.
Palestinian concerns about the size of Jericho focus on the viability of the
area, control of economic and water assets and access to Jordan.
Mr Khalil Tewfakji, a Palestinian cartographer, says the Palestinians are
largely concerned with economic interests and want to secure the
agricultural and tourism resources of the Jericho area and have a large
enough area to allow the construction of houses, offices and industry.
The Palestinians are pushing for the control of all major religious and
tourist sites around Jericho. They also want the area to extend to the
northern shore of the Dead Sea to allow the Palestinian entity to begin its
own salt-producing industry and to give the Palestinians a direct and
independent crossing to Jordan by ferry.
Also critical to the Palestinians, especially for agriculture, is control of
the water resources of the area, in particular the water springs at El-Ouja
and control of the Almog junction which provides access to the Dead Sea,
Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Abdullah bridge.
The Palestinians seem prepared to concede Israeli control of the 5km strip
east of Jericho along the Jordan Valley but are demanding a corridor to the
Allenby and Abdallah bridges and joint-administration of the border
crossings.
Although the Palestinians have been saying that the border between the
Jericho area and the rest of the occupied West Bank is likely to be
temporary, both sides realise there is much to play for at this stage of the
negotiations.

saying it had too many politicians and not enough experts. Mr Arafat will
now chair only an advisory council which will meet about twice a year to set
strategy. The economic council, the Economic Council for Development and

</HEADLINE>

   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
King Hussein yesterday opened the first session of Jordan's newly elected
parliament by reaffirming his commitment to the Middle East peace process.
However, he warned that full peace would not be achieved unless Israel gave
up its claim to the city of Jerusalem.
He said his government is taking 'foolproof (and) wisely regulated steps'
towards peace with Israel. But he stressed the need for dialogue among Jews,
Christians and Moslems on the future status of Jerusalem. 'We recognise no
sovereignty over (the city) except that of the almighty God,' he said.
Jordan endorsed an agenda for peace with Israel on September 14, a day after
the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel signed their agreement in
Washington. Since then, several understandings on economic relations with
Israel, the environment, water, and land have reportedly been secretly
initialled. King Hussein has acknowledged that items on the agenda will be
agreed in a piecemeal fashion but has so far ruled out talk of an imminent
unilateral agreement.
Although behind-the-scenes progress is being made, the king has repeatedly
called for urgent talks on Jerusalem. Under the PLO-Israeli deal the city's
status will not be negotiated until after a two-year interim period. The
Hashemites have strong links with the city. East Jerusalem was part of
Jordan between 1948 and 1967 and the king's grandfather and
great-grandfather are buried there. The king is personally funding
renovation work on Moslem holy sites in the city, including the Dome of the
Rock mosque.
While Jerusalem is set to be one of the more difficult sticking points
between Jordan and Israel, the kingdom's 80-member parliament should be less
reactionary to prospects of peace than its predecessor. The number of
deputies opposed to peace has fallen as a result of the multi-party
elections held on November 8.
In his speech, King Hussein said Jordan expected economic growth of 6 per
cent for this year, while inflation would not exceed 4.5 per cent.
The council of ministers yesterday unanimously endorsed next year's JD1.5bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) draft budget, Reuter adds.
The budget will be formally presented to parliament early next month for
final approval. King Hussein said local revenue in next year's budget would
cover current costs and a large part of capital costs. He pledged to
continue economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
The debt-ridden country has counted on foreign aid to reduce chronic budget
and balance of payments deficits.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Kenya is pledged Dollars 850m in new aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya was yesterday promised Dollars 850m (Pounds 577m) in new aid - with
enough due next year to cover its 1994 external financing requirement -
provided it settles repayment of some Dollars 700m in arrears.
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's finance minister, indicated that, in all but
name, he was planning a standard rescheduling of debt arrears with the Paris
club group of official creditors. He hoped Kenya would soon 'come to a
reasonable arrangement on a multilateral basis' on the debt arrears.
But the minister shied away from calling it a standard Paris club operation,
apparently for fear that this might damage efforts to restore investor
confidence in the Kenyan economy.
Of the Dollars 850m in new aid pledged by donor countries yesterday, some
Dollars 170m will be in the form of quickly-disbursed balance of payments
aid. This will, in effect, bridge the country's 1994 financing gap, provided
the arrears on past debt is separately settled. The bulk of the aid pledged
yesterday is money for development projects spread over several years, but
Kenya is due next year to get some Dollars 350m worth of project aid
resulting from past pledges.
Mr Mudavadi said there was 'no strict conditionality' attached to the aid,
but he freely conceded concerns about ethnic clashes and corruption
expressed by donors in a frankly-worded communique issued by the World Bank
which chaired yesterday's meeting.
Mr Mudavadi admitted that donors had insisted that 'elements of corruption
should be dealt with firmly'. The minister himself stressed that the
government's recent 'corrective' measures to root out corruption would be
continued, and were not just a show to placate foreign donors at this week's
Paris meeting.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Fiat to reduce workforce by 5%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, Italy's largest private group, is planning to cut 5 per cent of its
workforce in the Italian automotive sector and lay off a further 10 per cent
during the next two years.
The news was broken to engineering trades unions last night by Mr Maurizio
Magnabosco, head of Fiat's industrial operations. Earlier in the day the
unions had leaked the outlines of Fiat's proposals, which are aimed at the
crisis in the European car market.
Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, also had a meeting with Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, in which he is believed to have outlined
the Turin-based auto group's plans to tackle over-capacity and cope with job
losses.
Discussions are due to take place today with the Labour Ministry on how the
measures are to be implemented and how they can be accommodated into the
scheme of government-backed lay-offs.
Fiat is the last of the main European car manufacturers to seek cuts in its
workforce, and this is the first serious cut since 1982-83. But this year's
Italian production, yet to reflect the impact of the Punto launched this
autumn, will be little more than 1.1m. This compares with capacity of nearly
2m vehicles. Largely because of the 15 per cent decline in European sales
and the 22 per cent drop in local sales, the Fiat group this year expects
losses of L2,200bn (Pounds 888m).
Fiat Auto, the car division, employs 95,000 in Italy and a further 40,000
overseas. Mr Magnabosco said 3,800 jobs were to be cut among administrative
staff. Of these 800 would be at the group's Turin headquarters.
The aim would be to find other jobs within the group. However, the unions
were doubtful this would be possible.
Labour cuts on the factory floor will affect some 1,000 near Naples, of whom
800 will be reabsorbed elsewhere. However, the greatest uncertainty
surrounds the Arese plant near Milan, built in 1960, where production of the
Alfa 164 is due to end in 1996. Fiat said body-work at Arese would be
shifted to another northern plant, Rivalta, and this would involve 2,000
lay-offs for two years.
But Mr Magnabosco said job opportunities would be created with the
reconversion of part of Arese as an industrial park - as happened last year
with the old Lancia works at Chiavasso. Overall the bulk of the lay-offs,
some 5,000, will come from the older plants in Fiat's home base Turin.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Gaidar calls for 'protectionism' to help business

<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the
government to apply 'sensible protectionism' to the country's industrialists
and entrepreneurs.
Mr Gaidar, who led the country's move towards a free market two years ago,
said that since prices had been liberalised and the economy opened to
imports, Russian companies' demands for protection against foreign
competition showed they had adjusted to market conditions. He denied that he
had changed his ultra-liberal views over the past two years to win votes in
next month's parliamentary elections. Protection for business has been a
popular theme in the election campaign.
'When we freed prices we needed imports because we did not even have any
domestic markets,' he said yesterday. Russia's economic circumstances have
changed. Now, the government was happy to respond to pleas from its farmers
for an end to grain imports, and from other producers who now realised they
had a market to defend.
Import tariffs, which the government has steadily increased since opening up
the economy in January last year, were also a useful source of budget
revenues, he said: 'We believe that domestic markets should be protected and
we can use these tariffs to raise some additional revenues.'
He did not say which imports should be taxed, but added they should not be
punitive ones, simply fees to support domestic industry.
At the same time he vowed to resist demands to protect Russian monopoly
producers which had no domestic competition.  Nor would he isolate the
Russian economy from world markets, he said, claiming that Russia's speedy
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would help it.

FT  24 NOV 93 / French welfare in terminal state: Recession has added to the
woes of a system in need of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than 500 days and nights a small group of nurses has maintained a
protest sit-in outside the Ministry of Social Affairs on the Avenue de Segur
in Paris, with a tenacity matching the persistence of the crisis in France's
welfare state.
Neither the nurses nor the crisis will go away. The nurses, who are
protesting at understaffing and poor pay in French hospitals, promptly
bought themselves a new tent when 'someone' set their old one alight in
early November. For his part, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur,
warned this week that the deficits in the country's various welfare schemes
 -pensions, unemployment and health insurance, and family allowances - were
worse than he planned for six months ago.
The chief reason is not that French welfare benefits are lavish, though they
are so in the medical field.
The crisis has, rather, been brought on by the recession and the fact that
the funding of the French welfare state is still little changed from its
origin as a series of schemes co-financed by employers and employees.
Welfare contributions by employers and employees accounted in 1990 for no
less than 44 per cent of total French tax receipts, compared with 17.5 per
cent in the UK, and a paltry 3.1 per cent in Denmark, which funds its
generous welfare provisions out of general taxation.
The recession, the worst France has experienced for 20 years, has shaken the
financial foundation of its welfare state. The 3.24m people without jobs
(11.7 per cent of the work force) no longer have anything to contribute to
the system, which in turn seems to be part of the reason for their
unemployment. High social charges have helped price workers, especially
those with relatively low skills, out of the job market.
There is now a consensus that for reasons of equity and efficiency the
burden of France's welfare state must be shifted off company payrolls and on
to taxpayers. A start was made in 1990 when the Socialist party introduced
the CGS tax, levied on all forms of income (not just wages), paid by
virtually all French households (rather than just the 50 per cent who pay
income tax) and designed to top up the various welfare schemes.
Mr Balladur has since doubled the CGS tax rate, and begun in his 1994 budget
to shift the cost of family allowances that employers have to pay for their
lower-paid workers on to the national budget.
The prime minister said this week he wants to shift health insurance charges
in the same direction.
The recession's most obvious impact has been on the Unedic unemployment
insurance scheme, which has fallen steadily deeper into the red.
The prospect that the scheme might actually go bankrupt at a time of rising
unemployment brought action in July.
The government agreed to put in FFr10bn (Pounds 1.14bn) a year, the
employers chipped in with a further FFr9.35bn, employees are contributing an
extra FFr6bn, and though they did not have a say in the matter, the
unemployed themselves in effect contributed FFr4bn through a reduction in
dole payments. 'In theory, this is enough to keep the scheme going up to a
level of 3.6m unemployed,' says an official of the Patronat employers'
federation.
That figure is not a total abstraction, since even Mr Balladur does not
foresee unemployment coming down until late 1994.
An ageing population, coupled with a rising level of structural
unemployment, made reform of the state pension system inevitable, with fewer
people in work to pay the pensions of more people in retirement.
The government did not change the legal retirement age of 60, but instead
this summer introduced legislation extending from 37.5 to 40 years the
period which people need to work to qualify for a full state pension and
recalculated this full pension on the average of a person's 25 best-paid
years, rather than his or her 10 best-paid years. 'Strangely, pension reform
which many thought would rock the system passed very quietly,' says a senior
aide to Mrs Simone Veil, the social affairs minister.
'One reason was that the change has been staggered over 10-15 years.'
To supplement reduced pay-as-you-go state pensions, and also to create the
big pension funds which play such a big role in other countries' financial
markets, the government aims to present a plan next year to introduce
capitalised private pensions.
It may be only then that the magnitude of this year's changes to state
pensions sinks in, as the French of working age realise that they are being
asked to contribute twice over - once to those currently retired and once to
their new private pensions.
The biggest scope for savings is in health spending, which is higher than
anywhere else in Europe and second only to the US.
The French system is an expensive combination of freedom of choice (patients
can pick their doctors, doctors can prescribe what they like) and of
financial intervention by the state (which reimburses patients 70 per cent
of what they pay doctors and a bit less for medicines, while picking up
virtually the entire tab for hospital treatment).
Mrs Veil is trying to get a handle on the soaring spending which this system
produces.
Aiming to save some FFr30bn next year, she has set the rise in hospital
spending at 3.35 per cent in 1994 (compared with 5 per cent this year),
while trying to oblige hospitals to 'pay' for new equipment like scanners
with a compensatory saving like eliminating unnecessary beds.
Of the country's 500,000 hospital beds, 60,000, mainly in rural areas, are
said to be surplus to requirements. She has less direct leverage over
general practitioners working outside hospitals.
But the latter have agreed with the state health insurance agency to aim at
limiting the rise in overall health spending to 3.4 per cent next year
(compared with a 7 per cent increase this year).
Criteria are being drafted on what constitutes 'unnecessary' medical
treatment, with the threat of financial sanctions on doctors who ignore such
guidelines.
But so far it is the carrot, rather than the stick, that has been applied.
To reduce their financial incentive in prescribing pills, doctors had their
consultation fees raised on November 1.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Ciampi calls meetings to save budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, has called the main
political parties to a series of meetings today to hammer out a consensus on
the 1994 budget.
The move was prompted by hints from disgruntled Christian Democrats and
Socialists that they would withdraw support in parliament in the wake of
their parties' disastrous performance in Sunday's municipal elections.
Fears about the fate of the budget, now the central raison d'etre of Mr
Ciampi's government, provoked further falls yesterday on the stock change
and in the value of the lira. At one stage the lira passed the key
psychological L1000 against the D-Mark.
However, the Italian currency recovered slightly in the wake of Mr Ciampi's
decision to hold the special budget meetings.
It was also significant that Mr Achille Occhetto, the leader of the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the principal victor of
Sunday's poll, came out in public support of Mr Ciampi. He added: 'The
turbulence in the financial markets cannot be justified in any way by the
political and electoral events in Italy.'
This statement too played a part in calming market nerves.
As a result of the elections in 428 towns and cities, the PDS has emerged as
the one party capable of forging alliances up and down the country. This has
given it a central role as the Ciampi government winds ups business and
prepares for early general elections. The four-party coalition forming the
government's parliamentary majority accounts - after Sunday's vote - for
little more than 15 per cent of popular support. Mr Occhetto has acted
quickly to take advantage of his new position to cast himself as the leader
of a future government coalition, and is seeking to dispel long-held
prejudices against the left in government.
The discredited Christian Democrats could break apart after last Sunday's
electoral performance in which support dropped as low as 10 per cent. This
situation undermined parliamentary discipline, and many members are in no
mood to sanction budget legislation that undercuts their privileges and
those of their friends in the public administration.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Price Waterhouse to advise Russia on Lada sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Avtovaz, the producer of Lada cars, has hired Price Waterhouse as
its auditors and advisers ahead of moves beginning next month to privatise a
flagship of Russian industry.
Mr Nikolai Glushkov, deputy director of Avtovaz, said it had hired the firm
primarily to enhance the plant's ability to attract western finance.
Some 25 per cent of Avtovaz shares will be sold at an auction next month,
using vouchers which have been distributed to Russia's 160m citizens.
Another 22 per cent will be offered at a separate investment tender next
month to big corporate investors. But Mr Glushkov said he hoped to attract
foreign investors through capital increases planned for next year.
As proof of its commitment, Price Waterhouse has set up a special office of
20 people at Togliatti, the remote industrial town built specially for the
factory and its 100,000 workers. Mr Peter Rogers, a Price Waterhouse partner
responsible for the Togliatti operation, said the contract extended beyond
auditing. 'We're advising them in a broader sense. We're training their
accountants, setting up an international accounting department, and
providing a wide range of advisory services.'
Avtovaz employees and management will receive 51 per cent of the company's
present capital. Avtovaz has ambitious expansion plans and wants to produce
a new family of cars. It is taking part in a separate industrial consortium
which wants to produce a lower-quality car in the Opel Corsa range.
Mr Glushkov said Avtovaz, which last week signed an agreement for a Dollars
150m (Pounds 101m) loan from a Swiss finance company, was holding talks with
various western car makers, including Fiat, which helped Avtovaz produce its
Lada car in the first place.

FT  24 NOV 93 / EU sets working week limit: UK ready to challenge the Social
Chapter's 48-hour directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union ministers yesterday passed directives on working time,
setting a 48-hour week limit and guaranteeing mandatory time off. The
legislation also limits the time children and adolescents can work.
The meeting of employment and social affairs ministers was the first since
the Maastricht treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out on the so-called
Social Chapter, came into force.
The UK has won extensive derogations, or opt-outs, with a review after 10
and seven years respectively on both these EU laws, put through under
pre-Maastricht rules which attempted to keep the 12 on roughly the same
social policy course. The European Commission and the UK's 11 partners
yesterday also formally opted to decide without Britain about plans for
compulsory consultation with elected works councils in pan-European
countries, using Maastricht's Social Chapter.
A proposal to give unpaid parental leave of three months to both fathers and
mothers, with guarantees they would get their jobs back, was also abandoned
after being blocked by the UK. It will now almost certainly be put forward
again for approval by the 11, senior EU officials said.
Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, was jubilant and combative, claiming
that Britain was winning the argument about the cost to Europe's industrial
competitiveness of EU social legislation. 'I'm very optimistic that more and
more governments are listening to what we have to say,' he said, despite
Britain's isolation on all four measures.
Mr Hunt said the British government would be taking the working time
directive to the European Court, probably in the new year, because it had
been 'inappropriately' put through under health and safety provisions which
denied the UK its veto.
Under the measure, there are safeguards for the 2.5m British workers who now
work more than 48 hours a week who no longer wish to do so. The UK will also
for the first time be obliged to introduce laws giving mandatory daily rest
periods after six consecutive hours; a minimum daily rest period of 11
hours; at least one day a week off; no more than eight hours a shift on
average for night work; and four weeks annual paid holiday.
UK officials insisted that Luxembourg also had problems with the parental
leave plan. But this is because the tiny Grand Duchy offers eight times the
amount of time off to look after children in the Euro-plan, but without the
right of return to the same job. The 11 are happy to accommodate the
Luxembourg mix - but the exasperation with the UK at yesterday's meeting
showed that patience with Britain's blocking tactics has been all but
exhausted.
'The UK is living in the stone age,' said one EC diplomat. 'Any kind of
standards is anathema to them.'
'It's ideology rather than content,' said another, 'it's the word 'social'
that offends.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Riva fails to meet Ekostahl deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riva, the Italian steel group which is bidding to buy Ekostahl, eastern
Germany's largest steel mill, yesterday failed to meet a deadline set by the
Treuhand privatisation agency to clarify how it would modernise the plant.
Treuhand officials said they were 'disappointed' because the agency, despite
opposition from the Germany's Steel Federation, is anxious to speed up the
sale of the mill so as to secure jobs, investment, and markets for the
region.
Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned company, obtained sole negotiating
rights earlier this month from the Treuhand to buy Ekostahl, and had until
yesterday to spell out its efficiency and production plans.
The Italian company confirmed it had not responded to the Treuhand's request
for more details, but declined to explain why it had missed the deadline.
Riva is expected to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, while the Treuhand will
hold the remaining 40 per cent stake. Together they will invest DM1.2bn
(Pounds 470m) in building a hot rolling mill, the equivalent of a mini mill
with an annual capacity of about 900,000 tones.
Treuhand officials said it was unclear if the delay by Riva was caused by
last week's opposition by Britain, France and the Netherlands to proposals
put forward by the European Commission to restructure western Europe's steel
sector.
British officials yesterday confirmed that Mr Johannes Ludewig, a senior
economics advisor in the Chancellor's office, last Friday called in Sir
Nigel Broomfield, Britain's ambassador to Germany to discuss the UK's
opposition to the Commission's plans.
A British official said that opposition from Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK
industry minister, was not directed specifically at Ekostahl but at the
steel industry in general.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Brussels seeks jobs blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next fortnight, Europe's political leaders will be hit with a
blizzard of paper recommending ways to combat unemployment and spur an
economic recovery.
The European Commission is preparing no fewer than four separate studies on
these topics, an exercise which has strained the bureaucracy's powers of
co-ordination to its limits. Even supporters admit there is duplication and
overlap.
The Brussels paper trail includes a Green paper on the future of European
social policy drawn up by Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner; a
Commission document setting out 'broad economic policy guidelines' to be
adopted at next month's EU summit; a paper on the state of 'convergence'
among the 12 member states' economies; and Mr Jacques Delors' own White
Paper on employment, competitiveness and growth which will borrow liberally
from all the above.
Mr Delors, approaching his 10th and final year as Commission president, is
keen to go out on a high note. The White Paper has become something of a
last will and testament which he hopes will lift EU leaders sights above
their short-term difficulties to the long-term future of the European
economy. Mr Delors' dilemma is how to influence the debate at a time when
member states are increasingly looking for national - rather than
pan-European - solutions to their economic problems. The Bank of England's
half percentage point reduction in its base lending rate yesterday
underlined the trend. At a meeting of EU finance ministers last Monday, Mr
Delors pleaded for an open-minded debate; but his prescriptions for job
creation, such as a shorter-working week, lower retirement age, compulsory
cuts in overtime, and more 'solidarity' between those in and out of work
appeared to be given short shrift.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, dismissed the ideas
as 'folly' and claimed they would actually create more unemployment. Mr
Johann Eekhoff, Germany's state secretary for the economy, said such
measures could only be 'a short-term emergency instrument'. Mr Jean-Claude
Juncker, Luxembourg's finance minister, said shorter working hours would
send a 'negative, defeatist signal' to Europe's workers.
Similarly, finance ministers expressed concern about the difficulty in
cutting employment taxes. Though there is general recognition that it is
necessary to encourage businesses to hire labour, ministers are worried that
the loss in state revenue will have to be made up with higher taxes, such as
valued added tax or new environmental levies. There is also a widespread
reluctance to commit to specific targets either on interest rate cuts, or
the ambitious target of creating 15m new jobs by the year 2000.
Mr Delors' aides insist that the tone inside Monday's meeting was friendly,
with ministers welcoming the Commission's analysis of the structural
economic problems facing the Union. Yet the question of the prescription
persists and will form the core debate at the European summit in Brussels on
December 10 to 11.
So far, there is a curiously tentative tone to the latest drafts of the
White Paper. The opening section disavows any intention to legislate, and it
explicitly recognises that solutions must be tailored to member states'
needs. About the only strong statement the Commission makes is a rejection
of the US 'trickle-down' model of reducing income disparities and improving
job creation through more wealth creation.
Commission officials also predict there will have to be substantial
revisions of the White Book's chapter on employment. There is widespread
scepticism about claims that up to 1m new jobs could be created through
tighter environmental standards and more 'green' public and private sector
inspectors by the end of the century. Similar assertions about the potential
for employment in the arts and leisure industry are also viewed with
suspicion inside the Commission. 'They seem to want to turn Europe into a
giant Disney park,' said one official.
Mr Delors faces a delicate balancing act, uniting his fellow Commissioners
behind his own White Paper and then winning the support of the member states
for a general plan of action. He must also square the circle between his
support for the European social welfare state and the need for more labour
market flexibility. Much work still needs to be done.

<TEXT>
The European Commission should have investigated the effect of British
Airways' takeover of Dan-Air on airline competition on routes between
Britain and France, Air France told the European Court of First Instance
yesterday.
The French state carrier told the lower chamber of the European Court that
last year's takeover of Dan-Air, the troubled UK carrier, had allowed BA to
increase its share of the France-UK routes using London's Gatwick airport
from 45 per cent in 1991-92 to 61 per cent in 1992-93.
The Commission claimed in October last year that the takeover - for a
nominal price of Pounds 1 - was not large enough to fall under European
rules governing mergers. Shortly afterwards the British government cleared
the deal.
Evidence submitted to yesterday's oral hearing in Luxembourg will now be

FT  24 NOV 93 / Cuts in drugs bills 'ineffective': Merck executive warns on
healthcare spending controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European governments' efforts to cut drugs bills are ineffective and
counter-productive, according to Merck &amp; Co, the world's largest
pharmaceuticals group.
Mr David Anstice, Merck's senior vice-president for European human health,
warned at a conference in Brussels yesterday that drugs spending cuts would
not have a meaningful impact on overall expenditure because medicines
represented such a small part of healthcare spending.
Most European countries could control health spending more effectively
through other means, he argued. Many were paying large amounts for the wrong
sorts of medicines.
Doctors should alter prescribing habits to provide better value for money
for patients. This meant prescribing more innovative medicines, fewer
traditional treatments of dubious efficacy and more off-patent generic
drugs.
Only a quarter of government spending on medicines was on patented drugs.
Half, on average, was spent on over the counter non-prescription medicines -
which could be paid for by the patient - or generic pharmaceuticals from one
source. The latter tended to be traditional remedies restricted to a single
country and lacking any efficacy, Mr Anstice said.
As for patented medicines, doctors probably prescribed too many acute
therapies such as antibiotics, analgesics, and tranquillisers. On the other
hand, some illnesses such as arteriosclerosis were under-treated.
Savings could be made in distribution and dispensing for which European
governments were paying too much. Distribution and dispensing cost more than
50 per cent of the price of prescription pharmaceuticals, compared with 20
to 25 per cent in the US.
The European wholesaling industry might need to rationalise, cutting costs
and becoming more competitive. This would allow it to pass on lower costs to
government purchasers, Mr Anstice said.
Structural changes were required in healthcare delivery, he said.
Governments needed to measure the performance of healthcare delivery not
only through costs, but also outcome of treatment.
Pharmaceuticals companies which failed to keep high standards in medical
marketing should face stiff sanctions.

Bosnian Serbs yesterday blocked aid convoys trying to reach Moslem enclaves
in central Bosnia in spite of pledges by Serb leaders to allow the relief
effort to resume after a near one-month suspension, our Foreign Staff
writes. Serb military leaders yesterday held up four convoys heading for the
eastern towns of Tuzla, Srebrenica and Sarajevo, all designated UN 'safe
areas'. Meanwhile, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, cautioned
yesterday against any premature lifting of sanctions against Serbia, as
proposed by European Union leaders on Monday, in return for more land for
the Moslems. Mr Christopher said in a radio interview the Serbs had to first
make firm commitments.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Britain's managers not as good as they think, says Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last night rebuked
British managers for overconfidence in the face of figures showing their
performance to be unsatisfactory.
In a speech at the annual dinner of the Institute of Directors, Mr Heseltine
asked his audience for 'a clear recognition' that there was a gap between
the UK's industrial performance and the best in the world.
While a recent survey identified only 2 per cent of UK companies as world
class, Mr Heseltine said research showed that British managers thought they
were the best in Europe. 'The German, French, Italian and Spanish managers
thought a great deal less highly of us,' he said.
Although the survey could be interpreted as good news in that British
managers appeared to have a great deal of self-confidence, Mr Heseltine said
it might also suggest 'that we have a rather too fulsome opinion of our own
performance'.
'In particular, the rest of Europe did not think our managers were
particularly hardworking or that our companies were focused on the
marketplace.'
In spite of increases in productivity, the trade and industry secretary said
the UK was still 25 per cent behind its main European competitors and even
further behind the US. Britain's share of world trade in manufactures had
also 'declined remorselessly'. Although it had stabilised it was only about
half that of Germany.
Mr Heseltine disclaimed responsibility for the performance of trade
associations representing different sectors of industry. It was not his
fault that most were too weak to serve their members actively or to present
a case to government.
'You complain about the proliferation in the number of trade associations,
the overlapping responsibilities and the sometimes inadequate service. But
you pay for them. So if you pay, why should it be my responsibility to do
something about it?'
Mr Heseltine described the government's deregulation initiative as 'the most
productive thing it could do . . . to get off the backs of British
business'.
He indicated that when he unveiled his bill, expected this month, he would
be seeking measures to sweep away hundreds of government regulations.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Rate cut signals tough Budget: Reduction of 1/2 point to
5.5% takes the City and industry by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday set the stage for a tough
Budget next week with a half a percentage point cut in UK interest rates
which took the City and industry by surprise.
However, politicians and business leaders were divided on whether the timing
and size of the cut to 5.5 per cent suggested a Budget with tax rises
greater than the Pounds 3bn expected by many economists.
In an announcement aimed at persuading the City that changes in interest
rates will be influenced by economic events rather than political
considerations, Mr Clarke said the Bank of England would in future decide
the timing of shifts in borrowing rates.
The cut brought bank base rates to their lowest level for 21 years. It was
quickly followed by quarter-point reductions in mortgage rates by the
Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society, and National
Westminster Bank.
But the broad welcome by businesspeople and politicians for the first cut in
UK interest rates since January was tempered by disappointment that Mr
Clarke failed to adjust rates by a full point.
The move was interpreted last night in the City and Westminster as a
sweetener ahead of the Budget, when Mr Clarke had been expected to announce
a fiscal tightening of up to Pounds 3bn to curb the Pounds 50bn
public-sector borrowing requirement. Any changes announced in the Budget
will come on top of the tax increases of Pounds 6.7bn already announced for
next April.
The rate cut was authorised by Mr Clarke last week, although he left the
precise timing to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. That
practice will be followed in all future changes in interest rates as part of
a government effort to convince financial markets about monetary policy.
Sterling reacted positively, gaining 1 1/2 pfennigs on the D-Mark to close
in London at DM2.5275, and firming slightly in New York. Against the dollar
it put on more than 1 cent, finishing at Dollars 1.4855, with no change in
New York.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares came back
from a 20-point loss prior to the rate cut announcement to close 1.3 points
down at 3,069.3, below the day's highs and after a highly volatile session
marked by investor worries about the Budget. Long-dated gilts gained a
quarter of a point on theories that the rate cut would do little to trigger
inflation.
In a statement, Mr Clarke said the decision was justified by weak price
pressures, together with recent cuts in interest rates in continental
Europe. He said the change - signalled just before 10am - was consistent
with Britain's 4 per cent target for underlying inflation. It also took
'full account' of the measures he will announce in his first Budget next
Tuesday.
In a BBC Radio interview, Mr George said he had decided on the timing of the
cut against the background of the latest batch of economic statistics and
what he knew of Mr Clarke's Budget plans. 'I couldn't see any particular
reason why we should wait until after the Budget,' he said.
Commenting on the changes in presentation, Mr George said they should remove
the lingering suspicion in markets that rate changes were politically
motivated.
'I think there has been quite often a perception in the market place that
the only reason a change had been made had been for some kind of political
reason. Actually that's very rarely if ever been true in my experience.'
Officials last night stressed that the extent of changes in interest rates
would remain the province of the chancellor. In future the governor would be
allowed a period of 'between days and weeks' for putting these changes into
effect.
While the announcement was welcomed on the Tory backbenches, Mr Gordon
Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the reduction was too little and too
late. British business leaders generally applauded the move, but Mr Richard
Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a
full 1-point cut had been needed.

FT  24 NOV 93 / EU threatens to snuff out a Swedish tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Swedish devotion to wet snuff has emerged as a significant stumbling block
in the country's ambition to join the European Union.
Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for European affairs and foreign
trade, gave a warning yesterday that if Swedes were not able to continue
buying the substance, in defiance of an EU directive, it would be almost
impossible for the country to win a referendum next year supporting EU
membership.
The directive, which came into force in July, bans on health grounds the
marketing and sale of wet snuff, a tobacco derivative known in Sweden as
'snus' that is inserted between the gum and upper lip.
Oral snuff-taking is a centuries-old tradition in Sweden - something the
country is only too keen to prove to Brussels with examples of 17th-century
price lists or 18th-century snuff boxes. One in 10 Swedes is a regular user.
Last year they consumed more than 5,000 tonnes of the stuff.
The issue is very sensitive for pro-EU Swedes. One expert commented: 'It
would be like banning ouzo in Greece.'

FT  24 NOV 93 / Mortgage repayments fall to lowest level for 15 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of monthly mortgage repayments in relation to average earnings has
fallen to the lowest level for 15 years following yesterday's interest rate
cuts, reports Andrew Taylor.
Nationwide, Britain's second largest building society, reduced its mortgage
rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.74 per cent. Mortgage rates were last
this low in 1968. Most other societies are expected to make cuts, but are
waiting until after next week's Budget.
As a result, monthly mortgage repayments as a proportion of first time
buyers' average gross monthly income are expected to fall to below 13 per
cent for the first time since 1978 - when repayments accounted for less than
12 per cent of average earnings.
In 1990, first time buyers were spending more than a quarter of their
monthly income on mortgage repayments, according to figures compiled by the
Council for Mortgage Lenders and the Environment Department. The figures
take account of house prices, which have fallen sharply in recent years, as
well as salaries, interest rates and mortgage tax relief.
In spite of the fall in prices and interest rates, the housing market
remains at a low ebb. Fear of unemployment and concern about the economy are
continuing to inhibit potential buyers and depressing prices, say mortgage
lenders, house builders and estate agents.
House sales this year are likely to have risen by about only 5 per cent from
last year's low of 1.14m, according to conveyancing figures published by the
Inland Revenue. This compares with about 1.5m transactions in an average
year and a peak of more than 2m sales in 1988.
Average house prices, which have fallen by up to 30 per cent in East Anglia
and southern England since the late 1980s, will have recovered by only about
2 per cent this year, according to a forecast by Halifax, Britain's biggest
building society.
A sharp fall in inflation, which previously reduced the real cost of
mortgages, has also eroded the long-term financial advantages of home
ownership.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said: 'The
initial cost of monthly mortgage repayments may be the cheapest for more
than a decade but people no longer have the benefit of high inflation which
rapidly reduced the real cost of mortgage payments.'
In 1978 an average house cost Pounds 16,297, against more than Pounds 63,000
in the first quarter of this year; the average annual salary was Pounds
4,749 against more than Pounds 18,000; the mortgage rate was 9.55 per cent
and the retail price index rose 8.2 per cent.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Tory funds crisis forces Major to host dinners for donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis in the Conservative party's finances has forced Mr John Major to
drop a self-imposed ban on entertaining elite groups of past and potential
donors at 10 Downing Street.
After a warning from treasurers that the party has virtually no money to
fight next year's European and local elections, Mr Major is hosting a series
of dinners at Downing Street for wealthy corporate and individual
contributors.
Two dinners - with Lord Hanson heading the guest list at the first - have
already been held. Several others are planned as Conservative Central Office
attempts to persuade large companies and wealthy individuals to fund next
spring's local and European election campaigns.
The occasions have been kept a close secret because of acute sensitivity
about the party's finances in the wake of the political row over donations
from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
At the height of the row over Mr Nadir's contributions to the party, Mr
Major said he had broken with Lady Thatcher's practice of holding regular
fund-raising events at Number 10.
A group of prominent Asian businessmen sympathetic to the party was invited
to Downing Street before the last election. But the prime minister
subsequently told the party's treasurers that he felt uncomfortable with
Lady Thatcher's policy of entertaining leading supporters.
It is understood he reversed that decision in September after a warning from
two of the party treasurers - Mr Charles Hambro and Sir Philip Harris - that
such events were vital to their drive to raise money to finance next year's
election campaigns.
The Conservatives' performance in the local and European polls will be
crucial to Mr Major's long-term future. But despite an improvement in the
party's day-to-day financial position, there are fears that it will be
'outspent' in the 1994 elections.
Faced with a Pounds 15.3m overdraft, the party is reliant on large 'one-off'
donations from wealthy benefactors to finance the election campaigns. It has
already scaled back plans for poster and newspaper advertising.
Mr Hambro and Sir Philip act as hosts for the Downing Street events, which
are funded by the party in accordance with Whitehall rules. Both were
unavailable for comment yesterday.
Conservative Central Office said: 'We do not comment on donations and we do
not comment on private meetings.'
Lord Hanson, one of the Conservatives' biggest benefactors, confirmed that
he had attended a dinner at Number 10 but declined to comment further.
Senior officials said there was no direct discussion of contributions during
the dinners which are billed as an opportunity for guests to put their views
across directly to the prime minister. But guests will be contacted later by
party treasurers as part of the fundraising drive.
Most of the guests are senior executives drawn from the party's main
corporate donors. The most prominent among those are United Biscuits, Taylor
Woodrow, Glaxo, P&amp;O, Forte, Allied-Lyons and Rothman International.

FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Litigation costs put Rodime Dollars 2.14m
in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As foreshadowed at the interim stage, Rodime, the Glasgow-based disk drive
technology licensing company, fell into the red for the year to September
30. It blamed increased litigation spending and lower licensing income.
The pre-tax loss was Dollars 2.14m (Pounds 1.4m) against profits of Dollars
1.69m. Losses per share came out at 1.7 cents, against earnings of 0.8
cents.
The company is still in litigation over patent infringements with three US
disk drive manufacturers - Seagate Technology, Maxtor and Quantum. During
the year the company completed agreements with Samsung Electronics and Sony.
Mr Malcolm McIver, chairman, said that no significant agreements had been
reached in the second half as other companies deferred or delayed
negotiations until the outcome of the three cases was known.
Operating income fell from Dollars 8.69m to Dollars 4.18m.
Bank debts were cut over the year by Dollars 2.7m. The company has, however,
negotiated with the Bank of Scotland an Dollars 8m increase in its Dollars
3m revolving credit facility.
Mr McIver said that would provide sufficient resources to complete its
patent infringement strategy through litigation or negotiation.
The company produced the first 3.5 inch disk drive in the early 1980s. It
has since ceased production and is concentrating on gaining income from
licensing. During the year it completed the disposal of assets of its
subsidiaries and the renegotiation of some obligations of its offshoots
which Rodime had guaranteed.

Ares-Serono

<TEXT>
Sales and profits of Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based manufacturer of human
fertility drugs, plunged in the third quarter. Consolidated net income from
continuing operations fell 34 per cent, to Dollars 13.9m, on sales off 20
per cent to Dollars 171.5m.
The group said it had been hit by enforced price reductions on its products
in many European countries. Meanwhile, in the US many patients delayed
treatment in the hope that the costs would be reimbursed under the Clinton
administration's health care plan.
Moreover, devaluations in Italy and Spain, where the group makes nearly half
its sales, hurt the figures.
The group also pointed out that sales in the third quarter of last year were
exceptionally strong.
For the nine months, total sales were off 13 per cent to Dollars 548.3m,
while net income from continuing operations was down 11.4 per cent to
Dollars 52,942.
Sales of Saizen, the group's recombinant human growth hormone, rose 4.3 per
cent in the first nine months, while sales of Metrodin, a
follicle-stimulating hormone, jumped 25 per cent.
The company said it was investing Dollars 120m to raise its production
capacity for Rebif, recombinant human beta interferon, for use in treating
multiple sclerosis.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Oil group sees Sch1bn deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil and chemicals group, has reported heavier nine-month
operating losses and forecast an operating deficit of around Sch1bn (Dollars
83m) for 1993 as a whole.
Nine-month turnover was Sch59.44bn, down from Sch60.73bn in the same period
of 1992.
Operating losses for the nine months were Sch735m compared with Sch383m.
Restructuring, including plant closures and drastic cost-cutting measures in
the plastics and chemicals divisions, will cause extraordinary losses of
about Sch3.7bn and bring the full-year net loss to Sch4.7bn.
Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said the losses were due to the severe
recession in the chemicals business and low crude oil prices. The gas
business was the group's most profitable activity and there was a small
profit from refining.
However, the results will not affect OMV's privatisation and foreign
expansion plans. Mr Schenz said 'privatisation will not really be affected
because large investors know we have a restructuring programme'.
Almost 30 per cent of OMV is in private hands with more than half held by
foreign investors. The government plans to sell a further 20 - 25 per cent
stake to a strategic foreign partner next year before full privatisation of
the company in 1995.
The group is negotiating to buy 35 per cent of Slovnaft, the Slovak
petrochemicals company, and wants to take a stake in Magyar Olaj, the
Hungarian energy group which is being privatised.

<TEXT>
Avtovaz, the Russian producer of Lada cars, has obtained a Dollars 150m loan
from a Swiss finance company in an unusual solution to Russian companies'
difficulties in raising finance on western capital markets.
The Swiss-based Forus Services said it had arranged the seven-year loan from
its own funds and western banks including Banque Nationale de Paris, for
on-lending to Avtovaz for the modernisation of its plant at Togliatti in
Russia.
Mr Rene Kuppers, Forus' general-manager, said guarantees presented to banks
included receivables from exports of Lada cars to Latin America, the Middle
East and Europe.
But western banks themselves, which have been negotiating a rescheduling of
debts owed by the former Soviet Union, have been reluctant to lend directly
to Russian companies without guarantees from their own governments.
Forus also has a 15 per cent stake in a new Russian consortium which plans
to produce a new passenger car in co-operation with a western manufacturer
which has yet to be selected.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, has
published tough new rules to ensure greater protection for investors from
dishonest stockbrokers.
The new regulations, which come into force on January 1, will require
brokers to maintain separate accounts for clients' money, to issue contract
notes within one day of the execution of an order and to settle payments
within two days of execution.
The rules have been widely welcomed by financial institutions in Bombay.
Investors have long criticised the Bombay stock exchange, the country's
largest, and other Indian exchanges for inadequate safeguards for clients
and poor supervision of brokers' activities.
The regulations are expected to assuage the fears of foreign financial
institutions which have been increasingly active in the Indian stock market
but which have also often expressed concern about the lack of transparency
on Indian stock exchanges.
Since it was established last year, the securities board has made a high
priority of raising regulatory standards on stock exchanges. However, this
has annoyed some brokers, who felt that they were being treated unfairly by
a supervisory body which they have said did not understand the workings of
their market.
But with the support of the finance ministry, the securities board has made
steady progress in more rigorous regulation and supervision.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Furniture future for Ghana's forests: A company developing a
downstream industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Afromosia, asanfuna, iroko, utile. . . these mysterious African names for
the towering giants of Ghana's tropical forests are being tamed by a pioneer
furniture exporter in the heart of the jungle.
Scanstyle Mim is an unlikely candidate to be blazing a trail in Ghana's
attempts to add more value to its Dollars 130m-a-year timber exports.
The company's main contact with the outside world is through a crackly radio
transmitter. Ghana's national electricity grid only reached the factory in
Mim last year. Yet Scanstyle is responsible for more than 90 per cent of
Ghana's furniture exports. Its earnings are modest - Dollars 6m last year -
but the potential is huge. The company's turnover has grown six-fold since
1982. And in terms of added value, Scanstyle's furniture earns five times as
much as the same volume of unprocessed timber.
To date, however, few logging companies in Ghana have dared to follow in
Scanstyle's path. The reason, says Mr Kwabena Pepera, the company chairman,
is that logging earns more money with less risk. 'You can sell lumber to
anyone, but if an important consignment of furniture is rejected, you risk
bankruptcy.'
Mr Pepera believes many Ghanaian manufacturers find it difficult to export
because they cannot meet the quality standards demanded by overseas
customers.
But technology is only one of the hurdles in the export race. Local
manufacturers often have little knowledge or experience of marketing their
products abroad. And the financial system in Ghana is not yet geared to
providing pre-export finance or long-term capital for new plant and
machinery.
In its own small way, Scanstyle is a textbook case of how these obstacles
were overcome.
The company was set up by a Norwegian in 1968, who spotted an opportunity to
use the offcuts of a large sawmill in Mim to produce flooring and panelling.
In the early 1980s, the Norwegian decamped to Singapore, frustrated by the
government curbs on his business in Ghana. What he left behind, however, was
a knowledge of the European furniture market and the quality standards
required to keep customers happy.
'Under the old government controls,' Mr Pepera recalls, 'we could not export
a single chair. But we had Lebanese traders coming from the Ivory Coast and
paying cash to smuggle our goods through the jungle.' Times have changed.
Since Ghana embraced free-market reforms in 1983, life for exporters has
become easier. There is less red tape: export and import licences have been
abolished; foreign exchange controls scrapped; and the cedi has been
devalued, making Ghanaian exports more competitive abroad.
Scanstyle began by exporting knocked-down furniture components. It moved on
to assemble some of the garden furniture and chair parts at the factory
before shipping them in flat-pack form. With the help of a Dollars 400,000
Japanese loan, the company has bought computer controlled lathes from Italy
that will allow it to tackle more complex furniture.
Mr Pepera's main headache is the fight for logging concessions. These are
carefully rationed by the government because of deforestation of the
country. His needs are modest compared to the appetite of the Goliaths of
the logging industry, but he has only obtained permission to exploit 60
square miles of forest. He says he needs five times that area to meet export
demand.
Scanstyle's biggest market is the UK, where it sells garden furniture and
chairs in tropical hardwoods. The company also exports to Germany, Italy and
Ireland.
'The government is very strict about where and what you can cut, and the
spacing between fellings,' Mr Pepera says. 'Some of the old lumber guys have
been so ruthless that certain species are almost impossible to find. We are
importing Afromosia from the Cameroons.'
He hopes his business will expand when a government ban on the export of raw
timber comes into force in 1994. Somehow, he doubts the ban will be
enforced. Ghana is desperately short of foreign exchange, and timber exports
earn Dollars 130m a year. Logging is the biggest money spinner after cocoa
and gold.
But if the government wants to promote export diversification - a key to its
economic strategy - it is going to have to push loggers into downstream
processing.
'Fairly soon Ghana will have to take a deep breath and decide where it wants
its forestry industry to go,' Mr Pepera's son Paul, the company manager,
argues. 'Indonesia banned log exports in the 1980s and the local industry
responded with a tremendous investment drive into molding and furniture.
Indonesia's ban was what enabled the country to cross the rubicon into value
added exports.'
It is what he hopes will happen in Ghana.

European Community finance ministers have agreed to impose tighter checks on
banks, insurance companies and investment firms to avoid another BCCI-type
scandal, agencies report from Brussels.
The new rules oblige bank auditors to report any wrong-doing they spot in
credit institutions and any parent company, whatever its activity. Financial
institutions will have to have their head office in the same EC country as
their registered office so supervising authorities can control them.
The rules widen the list of bodies entitled to access to confidential
information on such institutions to barristers and accountants when making
official inquiries. The legislation still needs European Parliament
approval.

FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Forte faces even stiffer competition than first reported for its
management deal with Ciga, the loss-making Italian hotelier, came in stark
contrast to the recent rush of good news which has underpinned the solid
performance in the group's shares.
Forte announced the proposed tie-up last month, paying Pounds 33m cash and
inserting some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m
into an Italian operating company. Although the deal is currently undergoing
due diligence, Hyatt Hotels was recently reported by industry sources to be
considering a late bid, and yesterday came reports that two other US groups,
Marriott and Sheraton, were also in contention.
The shares, off 3 at 234p, are now believed by some leisure specialists to
be fully priced.
Banks suffered heavy selling, with dealers talking of a big sell note
expected this week, and saying US holders of the sector were also aggressive
sellers. Barclays dropped 14 to 561p, as did National Westminster, to 542p,
while HSBC, also upset by the weakness of the Hong Kong market, lost 13 to
725p. Lloyds fell 16 to 564p.
Abbey National, thought to be about to issue a statement on trading
prospects for the second half, dipped 6 to 403p.
Independent Insurance, the first composite insurer to obtain a listing since
the Second World War, performed exceptionally well on its debut. Offered and
placed at 225p a share, the stock price opened at 263p before easing back to
eventually settle at 255p.
Widespread market weakness hit the big composites. Guardian Royal Exchange
closed 8 off at 194p, while Royal Insurance lost 13 to 283p. General
Accident gave up the same amount to 648p.
Revived speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office may be preparing the
way for the sale of its 9.9 per cent stake in BP - well in excess of 540m
shares and worth around Pounds 1.85bn - together with nervousness ahead of
today's Opec meeting in Vienna, unsettled the shares and undermined the rest
of the oil sector.
The market's initial reaction to the KIO story was to mark BP shares down to
335p. Once the early uncertainty had passed, however, the stock price began
to rally, closing the session 2 easier at 339p after turnover of 9.9m. Shell
Transport dipped 6 to 681p and Enterprise lost 8 to 448p.
Utilities were among the best performing areas of the market as the prospect
of a series of big dividend increases later this week from companies such as
PowerGen, Scottish Power and South West Water cushioned share prices from
the effects of the general sell-off in European stock markets.
Waters, recs and power generators invariably attract substantial investment
from funds switching out of the highly geared Footsie stocks into the high
yielding and defensive sectors.
PowerGen is the first of the three utilities sector stocks to announce
interim figures this week.
The recs provided the biggest risers, with Seeboard 6 firmer at 651p, and
South West and Norweb up 4 each at 609p and 658p. PowerGen, still feeling
the effects of a NatWest recommendation to switch from the stock to National
Power, to take advantage of an overly large price differential between the
two stocks, fell 8 to 462p. Scottish Power eased 3 to 408p.
At the start of an intriguing week of results from food manufacturers, the
sector held up well in the weak market, although dealers said turnover was
thin. NatWest Securities became the latest broker to turn more positive on
the buffeted sector, believing the recent underperformance overdone. NatWest
said cyclical recovery and yield considerations make the case for shifting
from an 'underperform' to 'neutral' stance.
Among the three companies reporting this week, Northern Foods stayed at 229p
and Hazlewood Foods slipped a penny to 160p, as did Tate &amp; Lyle to 389p.
News of the break-down of the Alcazar European airline consortium boosted
sentiment in British Airways and the shares stayed firm at 409p. Reports of
an electrical fault at Eurotunnel added to the shares' slide, 13 off at
433p.
Losses and provisions at engineering group Babcock knocked the shares, which
finished 2 1/2 down at 26 1/4 p.
Press reports that BMW is interested in buying Rover - with a price tag of
Pounds 1bn being mooted - lifted British Aerospace. The shares hardened a
penny to 424p.
Tomkins, 6 cheaper at 226p, was weakened by a downgrade, said by dealers to
have come from NatWest Securities.
Specialty chemicals group Holliday Chemical Holdings plunged 51 to 174p on a
profits warning.
Publishing group EMAP bucked the trend and rose 10 to 355p after posting
increased first-half profits and saying it detected signs of a market
upturn. United Newspapers put on 7 at 529p on weekend press stories that the
group was discussing a merger with the Irish Independent group.
Theme park operator Euro Disney was again under pressure as French press
reports that some banks were trying to offload some of their debts in the
group at a hefty discount hit the market. The shares rallied from the day's
low to close 13 off at 402p.
BT relinquished 7 to 462 1/2 p, matching the decline in the FT-SE 100, with
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, said to have taken the stock off its buy
list. Vodafone eased 4 to 520p: dealers are expecting a near 17 per cent
increase in the interim, due this morning.

FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters suffers on heavy US selling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic news and financial information group Reuters Holdings reeled
following heavy international selling and the after-effects of a poorly
received international conference call at the end of last week.
Dealers said that late on Friday afternoon, UK time, one US brokerage sold
the equivalent of 900,000 shares in New York in the form of American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) - by contrast, average daily turnover for the
stock in the UK is around 1m shares.
As the sell order was being placed, Mr Peter Job, Reuters' chief executive,
was holding an international telephone-link conference call with analysts in
the US and UK. Mr Job is generally considered to have an understated style
that verges on the downbeat.
Mr Paul Norris of BZW, said: 'While the detail was positive, US investors
felt the tone of the meeting was not barnstormingly bullish enough. It
certainly went down a lot better in the UK.'
The stock was marked down sharply before the start of dealings in the UK
yesterday. It attempted to rally from the bottom in mid-morning but by then
the dreary tenor of the London market had overtaken it and the stock drifted
off to close 41 lower on the day at 1586p with relatively high turnover of
1.7m shares.

FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The erosion of the premium on the FT-SE 100 futures contract provided a
perfect opportunity for arbitrage and contributed to a day of
internationally-inspired market weakness, writes Peter John.
Fears that the US was poised to raise interest rates and prompt an investor
dash away from Europe were compounded by a 556-point slide in the Japanese
Nikkei and speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office was preparing to
sell a huge amount of UK stock.
The KIO denied the sale speculation but the rumnour set the trend for a
jittery day. The December futures contract started to trade some 10 points
down from its previous close of around 3,100, and was sold down straight
away.
December spent much of the day some three points below the underlying cash
market while dealers calculate that, at this stage in its cycle, it should
be priced some six points above cash.
The weakness was exacerbated by some institutional selling and gave a chance
for arbitrageurs, dealers who trade on the price differential between two
markets, to unwind positions they had taken when the futures were at a
healthy premium.
December drifted to end the day at 3,067 by the official close, three points
below cash, on turnover of 12,511 contracts. It continued to slide in the
after-hours session and hit 3,061 with another 3,000 contracts traded.
Options turnover was a high 50,711 contracts. BT, which was downgraded by US
house JP Morgan, was the most active stock option on turnover of 2,700 lots.
It was followed by BP with 1,900 lots.

FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: London stocks fall sharply with
global trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloomy trends in world stock markets took their toll of UK equities
yesterday, and although business volume was not heavy, share prices fell
across a wide range. UK traders rightly sensed that London would be unable
to resist the heavy fall in Tokyo and the signs of a renewed side in US
Federal bonds, and prices were marked lower from the opening.
A very slight attempt to rally was quickly halted when Wall Street opened
the new session with a fall of 35 Dow points in London hours, and the FT-SE
Index closed virtually at the day's low, a fall of 37.4 bringing a reading
of 3,070.6.
The negative influences from other global centres had to be digested by a
stock market already inclined to take cover after UK analysts had suggested
that the base rate cut so keenly expected on Budget Day, a week today, might
be postponed for a while.
The setback in equities in London, which saw the Footsie 3,100 mark
abandoned, was emphasised by significant losses in government bonds and by a
setback in bourses across Europe, with Germany hit by disappointing money
supply figures.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index abruptly reversed the recovery of the past week,
sliding 19.9 to 3,435.4. But traders' conviction that genuine trading volume
had been relatively unexciting was borne out by a Seaq total of only 455.4m
shares against 514.4m on Friday.
Yesterday's trading session appeared to reflect the host of bearish factors
which have been leaning on the London stock market for the past two weeks.
The renewed weakness in US Federal bonds reminded UK dealers of the reasons
behind the tremor suffered towards during the previous equity account.
Moreover, weakness in Tokyo underlined the implications of last week's
decision by a US investment bank to lighten holdings in the Japanese equity
market.
Near-term confidence was running low at the London close, when traders were
bracing themselves for a difficult opening to trading today if the Dow
Industrial Average continues to fall. Some stock was sold yesterday but most
of the big institutions have largely closed down trading positions ahead of
next week's Budget speech - a process hastened by Friday's problems with the
Seaq electronic system.
Particularly unsettling was the setback in UK government bond prices which
undermined confidence in prospects for Budget rate cut as well as bringing
into close focus the market's apprehension that the turn to higher rates may
come sooner than expected.
US-influenced stocks suffered the most in the shakeout, although dealers
said that share prices had been marked down too quickly for sellers to
unload stock. The problems may come later in the week, if fund managers
seize opportunities to sell if the market shows signs of recovery.
Bank shares were among the most hard hit, hit both by weakness in the
financial sectors on Wall Street and by fear that and pressure towards
higher interest rates at home will revive all the problems of bank loan
books. The sector has stronmgly outperformed the market in recent weeks and
traders were quick to take profits yesterday.
Consumer and retail stocks ended with modest losses ahead of a week which
wil bring important trading results from the sector and test confidence in
the prospects for a consumer-led recovery in the domestic economy. While
these sectors are closely linked to base rate hopes, investors have been
cautious during the run-up to the Budget and marketmakers have avoided
taking large positions.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls on fears of global
correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Losses on overseas equity markets and concern about rising long-term
interest rates depressed US stock prices across the board, although many
shares finished off their lows for the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 23.76 at 3,670.25.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 3.47 lower at 459.13,
while the American SE composite fell 7.10 to 460.88 and the Nasdaq composite
dropped 13.43 to 738.13. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 280m
shares.
Stock prices opened lower in the wake of heavy losses incurred on foreign
markets, notably Tokyo, where the leading index fell 3.1 per cent as
investors expressed fresh concern about the outlook for the Japanese
economy. The selling overseas raised fears that a major correction in
worldwide equity markets, many of which are overvalued by historical
standards, may be under way, or imminent.
On the domestic front, US investors remained troubled by rising long-term
interest rates. After posting a sharp loss on Friday, the benchmark 30-year
government bond fell again yesterday, pushing the yield up to 6.37 per cent,
it's highest level in three months.
The deepening concern about interest rates, mingled with profit-taking in
the wake of recent gains, and the growing feeling that share prices have
risen too far, contributed to yesterday's selling. On several occasions the
Dow fell more than 40 points, but each time it bounced back from its lows.
The Nasdaq composite, however, kept on falling. Secondary stocks have taken
a hammering recently, primarily because they had been the beneficiary of a
lot of speculative buying over the summer and early autumn.
Auto stocks were hard hit by profit-taking. The sector has had a strong run
recently, and investors chose yesterday to book some of the profits earned
during that rally. General Motors weakened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/4 ,
Ford Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 and Chrsyler Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars
51 7/8 .
Merck ran into heavy selling, falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 in
volume of 5.6m shares in spite of a ratings upgrade from broking house Smith
Barney Shearson.
Selected technology shares posted big declines, with Hewlett-Packard
finishing down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 71 1/2 , Motorola off Dollars 2 1/2
at Dollars 93 1/2 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 35 1/2 .
Other big stocks in the sector, however, were in good form, with Texas
Instruments ahead Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 61 and IBM up Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 52 1/8 .
Cyclical issues were also mixed. Aluminum Company of America rose Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 71 3/4 , but Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing gave up Dollars
1 1/2 at Dollars 109.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 77 but Intel
added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices were lower in heavy trading as the market resumed its
recent slide.
The TSE 300 index finished 38 points down at 4,200.2 and declines outscored
rises by 545 to 251 after volume of 76.3m shares valued at CDollars 738.2m.
After reaching a record high close of 4,302.8 on November 12, the composite
index has fallen in five of the past six sessions, amid renewed worries
about government debt and the state of the Canadian economy.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices fell, led by transportation, off 2.4 per cent.
Media retreated 2 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average tumbles
3% on economic worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting pessimism over the economy pulled down the futures market,
prompting index-linked arbitrage selling which left the Nikkei average down
3.1 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei lost 556.35 to 17,384.84, while the Topix index of all first
section stocks dropped 45.76, or 3 per cent to 1,493.83, its first fall
below 1,500 since April 1. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.70 to
1,208.42.
The index opened at a day's high of 17,905.59 and fell to a low of 17,254.53
just before the close. Arbitrage-linked selling from dealers, margin
unwinding by individuals and futures selling by institutional investors
weighed on share prices throughout the day.
Volume totaled 287.5m shares against 263m. Share prices lost ground across
the board, with declines overwhelming advances by 1,049 to 42, with 49
issues unchanged.
Investors were discouraged by the failure of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to give
details of an anticipated income tax cut. Officials also did little to help
sentiment by denying the possibility of stock market support by the
government.
The financial failure of TSD, a software development company listed on the
over-the-counter market, also sent jitters through the market. Teikoku Data
Bank, a private credit research agency, said TSD filed for voluntary
bankruptcy with liabilities totaling Y8.5bn. Mr Keith Donaldson, strategist
at Salomon Brothers, said the psychological support level for the Nikkei was
around 17,000, but added that share prices were in the bottom of their
range.
East Japan Railway plunged Y16,000, or 3.5 per cent, to Y440,000 while
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y20,000 to Y745,000.
Daishowa Paper, the scandal ridden paper company, was one of the few bright
spots of the day, rising Y100 to Y1,160. The issue had previously met heavy
selling after recent reports of the chairman's alleged involvement in a
bribery scandal.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 718.29 to 19,481.45 in volume of 16.6m
shares. Roundup
There were suggestions that overseas investors were switching their
portfolios out of the region.
HONG KONG fell back on a weak futures market. The Hang Seng index closed
down 93.30 at 9,170.64. Turnover was HKDollars 5.3bn.
On the futures market the November Hang Seng contract lost 200 to 9,085,
while December contracts lost 185 to 9,095.
SINGAPORE was slightly firmer, with the Straits Times Industrials index
ending up 4.09 at 2,096.72.
Turnover was SDollars 546.8m.
SEOUL was lower on profit-taking: the composite index shed 11.89 to 834.58.
Sammi Steel went limit-up by gaining Won400 to Won8,680 on hopes that its US
and Canadian plants will gain from Nafta.
TAIWAN fell back in active trading ahead of Saturday's local government
elections. The weighted index shed 30.15 to 4,216.94 in turnover of TDollars
25.5bn.
MANILA was boosted by a new commercial issue, but late profit-taking brought
prices off the day's peaks. The composite index rose 15.23 to 2,418.13.
KUALA LUMPUR saw Tenaga Nasional continuing to attract institutional demand
on its inclusion in Morgan Stanley's Global Index from December 2. The
shares rose 70 cents to MDollars 15.90, off a high of MDollars 16.30. The
composite index gained 4.40 to 989.40.
AUSTRALIA was driven lower by aggressive futures selling. The All Ordinaries
index lost 33.9 or 1.6 per cent to 2,049.3. Turnover was ADollars 328.4m.
News Corp fell 37 cents to ADollars 9.83and BHP 42 cents at ADollars 17.04.
NEW ZEALAND again dropped back as the market awaited the formation of the
new cabinet. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 23.9 to 2,073.32 in turnover of
NZDollars 33m. Telecom lost 12 cents to NZDollars 4.15.
BOMBAY rose above the 3,000-level to reach a record high for the year. The
BSE 30-index closed up 61.74 at 3,034.60.
BANGKOK retreated steadily during the session on reports that foreign
investors were taking profits. The SET index fell 56.78 to 1,310.13 in
turnover of Bt14.6bn.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German data is trigger for
widespread selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wave of selling swept across continental European bourses yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said that while German M3 data had
been disappointing - 6.8 per cent against forecasts of 6.6 per cent -
reducing the likelihood for further imminent rate cuts, continental markets
had performed strongly in recent weeks, a period of consolidation was likely
and one could not rule out a rebound before the year end.
Mr Albert Edwards, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, commented that there was
a movement by some institutions back into cash. The markets that looked
vulnerable to a downside, he added, were Germany in Europe and Hong Kong in
Asia.
Failure of the Alcazar talks between four airlines - KLM, Swissair, SAS and
Austrian - was another of the day's talking points.
KLM, according to Lehman Brothers, may have walked away from any possible
deal at the last moment because of changed and improved trading conditions
since the talks were initiated at the start of the year. Lehman's commented
that Delta was too great a competitor on the lucrative trans-atlantic routes
to have been acceptable to the Dutch carrier, which has made great passenger
gains in that area.
Mr Raphael Hausmann of Swiss Bank in Basle was surprised that Swissair
shares had not fallen further. However, he believed this indicated that
investors expected Swissair to resume a search for long-term strategic
alliances with other carriers.
Mr Frank Jonuschat at Kleinwort Benson commented that the Alcazar alliance
would have been ideal for the cash-strapped airline, not least because of
the links it would have provided with an American carrier. He said that
Austrian needed to find a partner and suggested that the weekend's
developments might prompt it to listen more carefully to overtures that had
been coming from Lufthansa.
KLM lost Fl 3.30 to Fl 37.20, Swissair SFr37 to SFr723, SAS/Sila B shares
SKr4 to SKr37 while Austrian rose Sch5 to Sch1,740.
MILAN fell 3.3 per cent, the political outlook clouded by the strong
performance of the left and right at the expense of the centrist traditional
parties in local elections at the weekend. The Comit index shed 17.75 to
526.56.
Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan was not surprised that the results
had weakened the resolve of foreign investors. However selling pressure by
domestic institutions was another matter, since the outcome 'was not so
different from what we could have expected,' he said.
Morgan Stanley responded by further reducing the Italian weighting in its
equity-only European model portfolio from 3.4 per cent to 2 per cent,
against a benchmark 4.4 per cent.
Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson commented that their expectations for
the market had been based on hopes that meaningful reform would lead to a
stronger lira which would lead to lower interest rates and a reduced budget
deficit: more Italian and foreign investors would then buy bonds and
equities, pushing the lira up further.
'The major caveat in this investment thesis was that reform could be stalled
if there was no formation of a political centre and if politics fragmented
on a regional basis,' they said. 'That risk had already led us to go
underweight in Italy. Now the fragmentation exhibited in these municipal
election results must be a further cause of concern for investors.'
The telecommunications issues, popular with foreigners, were hard hit. Stet
shed L238 or 6.5 per cent to L3,428 and Sip was L181 or 5.8 per cent lower
at L2,961.
FRANKFURT closed sharply down, the DAX index losing 47.37 or 2.3 per cent to
2,030,00, as analysts commented that sentiment was depressed by some
disappointing corporate news and growth in M3 data.
BASF lost DM6.50 at DM265.40, after news of a 44 per cent drop in nine-month
pre-tax profits and the possibility of a reduced dividend payment. Daimler,
down DM20.7 to DM696.7, was hit by reports, subsequently denied, that Kuwait
might sell its stake.
PARIS was beset by technical difficulties that shortened the trading
session. The CAC-40 index fell 62.62 or 2.9 per cent to 2,082.61 in turnover
of some FFr3.5bn.
Euro Disney closed down FFr1.50 at FFr35.20 on further negative press
reports.
ZURICH finished near its lows for the day as profits were taken in some of
the stocks that have seen strong demand in recent weeks. The SMI index shed
37.4 or 1.4 per cent to 2,696.5.
AMSTERDAM witnessed a generally poor performance as the CBS Tendency index
fell 3.6 or 2.6 per cent to 133.6. Hoogovens gave up Fl 2.50 to Fl 42.50
after saying that it was to make a Fl 373.5m new share issue, while the
government's stake would rise to 17 per cent from 12.3 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Ericsson puts brake on Stockholm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets were in the mood for corrections and consolidation last week,
in response to political and corporate developments.
Mexican stocks moved sharply higher in anticipation of, and response to, the
US House of Representatives vote on Nafta late on Wedneday, while New
Zealand was able to pick up much the previous week's 8.6 per cent fall, as
the political outlook finally cleared after the November 6 election.
Hong Kong was lower as profits were taken after the market's bull run and as
the war of words over the market's rating continued.
Sweden was another loser with results and forecasts from the index
heavyweight Ericcson unnerving investors and analysts alike. A nine fold
rise in nine month pretax profits a forecast that 1993 results would be
'somewhat more than double' last year's SKr1.3bn failed to impress some
analysts who had been expecting SKr3.5bn.
The disappointment was compounded by the telecommunications group's plan to
upgrade research and development expenditure next year to SKr16bn, around
SKr2bn more than many commentators had expected. The result was a 17.5 per
cent slide in Ericsson's share price over the week as a number of US houses
cut their 1994 earnings forecasts by 20-25 per cent, and a further 2.5 per
cent fall yesterday.
Mr Peter Tron of Unibank noted that the weakness spilled over to other
stocks, most notably banks and the forestry sector, with the outlook for US
interest rates contributing to the nervous state of the market.
However, he commented that Stockholm had been looking fully valued as the
year end approached, with local market indices up 49 per cent this year,
although this was limited to a 17.1 per cent rise in sterling terms in the
FT-Actuaries World index, reflecting the devaluation of the krona since
January.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark firms on M3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark firmed against the US dollar and most European currencies after
the Deutsche Bundesbank's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers
dampened hopes for near-term monetary easing, writes Conner Middelmann.
M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised 6.8 per cent in the year to the
end of October, unchanged from the September rate and at the upper end of
market forecasts. Some market participants had expected M3 to return into
the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range.
The monetary aggregate has missed its target all through this year,
undershooting it in the first three months of 1994 - largely due to
statistical distortions - and overshooting it every month since March.
The data put a damper on interest rate cut hopes and pressured the December
three-month Euromark futures contract, which closed at the day's low of
93.87, down 0.06 point from Friday.
Nevertheless, the data prompted few analysts to revise their near-term
interest-rate outlook. 'The Bundesbank is so concerned about real growth in
Germany they will continue easing,' said Mr Klaus Baader, European economist
with UBS in London, who expects the Bundesbank to cut its official discount
and Lombard rates by another 50 basis points before the end of the year.
The Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council is scheduled to meet
again on December 2 and 16.
In Germany the focus is now on November consumer price data, due to be
released later this week. The year-on-year inflation rate is expected to
have eased to around 3.7 per cent from 3.9 per cent through mid-October.
In the German money market, the rate for call money rose as high as 6.45 per
cent in early trading after monthly tax payments drained substantial
liquidity.
The Bundesbank was reported to have injected emergency funds at 6.40 per
cent via its so-called Paragraph 17 facility to ease the liquidity squeeze,
pushing the call rate down to around 6.40 per cent.
Trade in the US dollar was subdued ahead of today's national holiday in
Japan and Thursday's Thanksgiving vacation in the US. It closed at DM1.7035,
down from DM1.7150 late on Friday. In late London trading it slipped as low
as DM1.6980. Many traders say the dollar may have to fall further before its
next upwards move.
The Italian Lira dropped following the crushing defeat of the Christian
Democratic party and its allies in Sunday's municipal elections. It fell to
a low of L988.80 against the D-Mark, but recovered slightly to close at
L987.70, down from L979.0 on Friday.
According to Mr Julian Jessop, European economist with Midland Global
Markets, it was 'quite encouraging that the lira did not fall further
towards L1,000 to the D-Mark, given the focus on political uncertainty.'
This indicates that the currency is being supported by economic
fundamentals, he said.
Moreover, most political scare stories are already built into the currency,
and there is little pressure to take profits before the end of the year, Mr
Jessop said. This contrasts with Italian government bonds, which slid nearly
two points yesterday.
The French franc eased slightly against the D-Mark following the German M3
data, which also dampened hopes for any near-term rate cuts by the Bank of
France. The French central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.45
per cent at its latest repo operation, and is not expected to undertake any
easing moves independently of the Bundesbank.
Disappointed easing hopes pressured the Pibor futures, with the December
contract falling 0.11 point to 93.52 and the March contract sliding by 0.14
point to 94.29.
In Spain, market participants will be eyeing today's seven to 12-day
repurchase tender by the Bank of Spain for a possible small cut in the 9.25
per cent benchmark rate, although some felt the currency's continuing
weakness against the D-Mark would make that unlikely.
Over the weekend, Bank of Spain Governor Luis Angel Rojo said there was
still room to cut Spanish interest rates, albeit moderately and slowly.
Moreover, he argued it would be a mistake to stimulate the economy by
loosening monetary policy without tightening fiscal policy or tackling the
structural roots of high inflation.
The peseta ended at Pta80.70 against the D-Mark, barely changed from DM80.75
at Friday's close. But traders warn that Thursday's general strike in
protest against the government's plans for a social pact may weigh on the
currency, and one London trader said he saw scope for the Peseta to weaken
to around Pta82 against the D-Mark by the end of the week.
Sterling lost about a pfennig against the D-Mark after breaking technical
support at DM2.5180. It closed at DM2.5130, down from DM2.5250 on Friday.
In the money market, the Bank of England forecast an early shortage of
Pounds 1.5bn, later revised to Pounds 1.65bn. After purchasing a total of
Pounds 37m band 1 and 2 bills at 5 7/8 in the morning, the Bank bought a
further Pounds 1.092bn of bills in the afternoon and provided late
assistance of around Pounds 550m.
The December short sterling futures contract declined 0.05 point to 94.58.

FT  23 NOV 93 / The FT's New Statistics:  Wide-ranging changes are
introduced today in the financial tables published in the second edition of
the Financial Times. Peter Martin explains the new look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day, the tables of statistics at the back of the FT chart the
temperature of the world's financial markets. Changing them is not something
to be lightly undertaken. Not only are the routines of compilation built
into the day to day rhythms of the statisticians who prepare them; the
habits of hundreds of thousands of readers are also built around the
entirely predictable appearance of a particular table, in a particular form,
on a particular page of pink newsprint.
The mutual interests of consumers and producers thus tends towards a
profound conservatism. The main FT-SE Actuaries table, published six days a
week in the FT, today follows recognisably the same form as it did a
generation ago, though the index itself and the equity market it measures
have both undergone profound changes in the past three decades.
This slow accretion of statistical tradition has many advantages from the
point of view of the FT and its readers. But it has one over-riding
disadvantage: the risk that tables gradually drift, over time, away from the
relevance.
Individual tables are introduced to meet new needs, but their contents are
rarely revised as those needs change. Thus each table risks becoming a
snapshot of the set of securities, currencies and issues which were
important at the time of the table's creation, even if those have long been
superseded by later market developments.
We have therefore carefully assessed every table in the second section of
the FT, to make sure that all of them reflect the most urgent needs of the
papers' readers, and to eliminate any creeping inconsistences.
There are hundreds of detailed changes in the pages that follow. Overall,
however, there are five main themes
BONDS
The paper has now gathered together its international fixed-income coverage
on to a single page. The International Capital Markets page now carries not
just the daily reports on government bonds and the Eurobond market, but also
all the tables that support them.
Thus, the benchmark government bonds table and the FT/ISMA Eurobond service
are accompanied by the UK gilts prices, which are now laid out in a format
more suited to bond prices.
The supporting data on the UK equity market, which formerly filled a portion
of this page, has now moved. In the UK edition of the FT it can be found on
the World Stock Markets pages, and in the international edition on the
London Stock Market page.
The statistical coverage of bonds is amplified by moving the derivatives on
long-term interest rates to lie alongside the cash market.
DERIVATIVES
A standard approach has been adopted throughout the paper: in general,
tables reporting on derivatives contracts are now printed alongside their
underlying markets. Thus, futures and options on long-term interest rates
move to the Capital Markets page, equity index derivatives can be found on
the World Stock Markets and London Stock Market pages. Derivatives on
currencies and short-term interest rates remain on the Currencies and Money
page, but are clearly divided between the two sections of the page.
We have adopted standard new formats for both futures and options; the
futures format provides much better reporting of volume and open interest
figures, where they are available. Derivatives are grouped by product,
rather than by the market on which they were listed. Thus, we no longer show
a single block of contracts traded on Liffe; instead, they have been divided
up between subject areas, so that for instance French Pibor futures from
MATIF exchange are shown alongside Liffe's short-term interest futures on
other currencies.
Over time, we plan to adjust derivatives listings so as to reflect the main
contracts of interest to FT readers, regardless of where they are traded.
INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES
The main World Stock Markets tables - both those covering individual
equities and those reporting on stock market indices - have been expanded in
content, without taking up any more space. There is now scope for all
individual international equities listings to show highs and lows achieved
by the stock and to carry dividend yields and price/earnings ratios.
Initially, not all shares are accompanied by these two ratios, but we shall
be filling in the holes on this page one by one over the next few months.
There are more stock market indices, better displayed. In particular, we
have expanded our coverage of indices from emerging stock markets, both
individually and collectively.
CURRENCIES AND MONEY
This page has undergone the most radical changes. The bond derivatives and
equity futures and equity index options and futures moved to new homes, and
the space left behind has been devoted to much more comprehensive currency
coverage.
The most immediate change to strike the reader, however, is the combination
of what were until now two separate articles - on foreign exchange and money
markets - into a single market report.
The money market report has abandoned its exclusive UK focus in recent
years, providing a report on any money market developments of interest to FT
readers, with a special emphasis on the Continent. This has led to an
increasing degree of overlap between the money market report and the foreign
exchange report, since the same developments often needed to be summarised
in each place.
Combining the two will allow these two intimately entwined markets to be
reported on side by side. As before, however, we remain committed to full
reporting of UK money-market activities.
The main currency tables, the pound and dollar tables, have been greatly
expanded to show comprehensive rates for a wider set of countries, arranged
by geographical region. Mid-rates are now instantly visible, instead of
requiring mental arithmetic. The cross-rates table has also been expanded.
Derivatives on currencies and short-term interest rates have been grouped
alongside the cash markets they reflect. The FT's daily Libor rate has a new
home on the page. UK base rates are now listed in a table that also shows
comparable rates from other major economies.
TYPOGRAPHY AND DESIGN
The tables now have a consistent 'look', drawing on the FT's standard
sans-serif typeface, Helvetica. Market reports now have their own livery,
again using Helvetica, to distinguish them from news stories and news
analyses.
This supplement highlights the most important tables in the Companies and
Markets section of the FT, and explains how they work. Not all the tables in
the paper are included; but the ones which have undergone most change are
covered in the next three pages, as well as a few which are unchanged but
are at the heart of our statistical coverage.
We are conscious that many readers may find the change to the new tables
inconvenient: some tables have moved to new pages, others have taken on new
shapes. We ask you to bear with us during the early days of inconvenience,
until the new presentation becomes as familiar as the old. The old tables
stood us in good stead for many years; we say goodbye to them now only
because the time has come to usher in their replacements.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The work of reassessing and redesigning the tables has been a huge task,
stretching over two years. The undertaking owes a great deal to preparatory
work undertaken by Julian Chaffee, then on secondment to the newspaper from
FT Analysis.
As always in statistical matters, however, the devil is in the detail. The
detailed work has fallen on the table experts of FT Statistics, under the
guidance of Adrian Dicks and Gary Hayes. The changes have been accompanied
by a complete rebuilding of the computer system which holds the FT's
statistical databases, carried out by a team headed by Ian Craig. The design
of the new tables has been carried out by the FT's editorial design
department, headed by David Case, with much of the detailed typography
performed by Phil Hunt. The redesigned pages have been ushered into the
paper by Bob Garton of the editorial production team. Mike Gardner, head of
editorial information services, kept the project on track.
We are very grateful to those of our readers who have responded to our
questions about how to improve the tables, or who have taken the trouble to
write in with suggestions and comments. There are too many of them to thank
individually, but we are very conscious of the effort and time that they
devoted. Many thanks to all.

Bitter-sweet outlook for UK beet growers - The early arrival of freezing
weather is threatening to take the icing off sugar profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlikely as it may seem to those not involved in its production and
processing, the apparently cold and boring sugar beet crop generates a great
deal of heat and emotion. Paradoxically, that is especially true when, as
last weekend, growers wake up on a November morning to find their roots
covered with snow and the weather forecasters speaking of severe frosts for
the next few days.
About 40 per cent of the national crop is still in the ground and a further
20 per cent has been lifted and is stored in clamps on farms. If the weather
stays below freezing for long those roots so far undelivered to processing
factories will be vulnerable to frost and subsequent rotting. Should that
happen the beets will become unsuitable for processing and even if they are
lifted and delivered to one of British Sugars' nine factories they will be
returned to the grower at his expense. All he can do with them then is feed
them to livestock or spread them back on the land and plough them in. As a
sugar beet grower myself, I hope very much that the cold snap will be
short-lived.
Naturally enough, we growers want to deliver our roots to factories as
quickly as possible. But British Sugar, the monopoly processor, now part of
Associated British Foods, operates a system of permits to control deliveries
and match its processing capacity. On present calculations this measured
approach to what is admittedly a big crop will mean some roots are still
sitting in clamps until the end of next February or beyond.
British Sugar says growers should protect their clamps from frost and
ventilate them to stop the rotting of roots lifted after they have been
frozen in the soil. Growers say effective protection is almost impossible to
achieve and in the face of having to purchase costly covers and the probable
need, after Christmas, to hand sort every root to avoid rejection at the
factory, that British Sugar should increase its processing capacity. The
crop, say growers, should be delivered over a much shorter period, as
happens in most other continental countries.
British Sugar replies that one of the main reasons it is the most efficient
processor of sugar beet in Europe is that it runs its factories for longer -
more than five months a year, compared with only three months by many
continental processors. Growers retort that British Sugar is profiting at
their expense and that the company should not ever have closed nine
factories during the last 20 years. British Sugar counter-claims that the
nine that remain have been uprated to such an extent that they are capable
of processing far more than the previous 18. And so the arguments continue.
Strength of feeling is intensified by the fact that both sides know that the
other is making good profits out of the crop. According to a recent Midland
Bank farm planning booklet the growth margins that an average sugar beet
grower can expect to make in 1994 varies between Pounds 438 and Pounds 575
an acre. That compares with a winter wheat growth margin from Pounds 245 to
Pounds 282 an acre and for potatoes, which are much more risky, of Pounds
566 an acre.
Meanwhile sugar beet growers are well aware that British Sugar raised its
profit level from Pounds 139m in 1992 to Pounds 162m in 1993 and that the
latter figure represented two-thirds of total ABF profits. It does not
improve relationships between growers and the processor of their beets when
financial journalists describe British Sugar as 'ABF's cash cow'.
But the current prosperity of sugar beet is unlikely to last. It was one of
the few crops to escape the axe during the reform of the European
Community's common agricultural policy. EC guaranteed prices continue at a
refined sugar equivalent of some Pounds 550 a tonne. The world price is
nearer Pounds 170 per tonne and most sugar producing nations in the EC are
producing large surpluses (with the notable exception of the UK, which is
allowed to produce only half its domestic consumption).
It was intended that the sugar beet guaranteed price system should be
reformed and lower production quotas imposed by July 1 next year. Because of
complications and pre-occupations with a Gatt agreement it has subsequently
been decided to delay tackling the matter for a further year, until July 1
1995. But if the Blair House accord were to become the basis for a Gatt deal
the price of sugar beet would be cut by 16 per cent over six years and
overall EC quota entitlement reduced by 2.5 per cent per year. Needless to
say the UK industry, as a deficit producer, would fight to avoid such a
quota cut being applied across the board. Indeed there is every
justification for the UK entitlement being increased.
Whether the fight would be successful is open to speculation, the sugar
quota may well be bargained away in return for concessions perceived more
necessary for other sectors.
Meanwhile I am bound to concede that British Sugar must be right to stay as
efficient as possible. So long as it does not expect me and other growers of
sugar beet with snow-covered clamps to bear all the risks.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia calls for 8% world-wide
aluminium curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is proposing that the world aluminium industry should cut annual
production by about 1.5m tonnes, or 8 per cent, to help bring supply back
into line with demand.
Producers in the Commonwealth of Independent States would be willing to
share in this world-wide reduction but would resist any pressure for them to
bear most of the burden. This was made clear yesterday by Mr Igor Prokopov,
president of Concernalumini, the CIS aluminium association, during a
presentation at a symposium to mark the 75th anniversary of the Belgian
Non-ferrous Metals Federation.
European Commission officials suggest, however, that discussions with the
CIS aluminium industry about limiting exports to the European Union are
deadlocked. Agreement in principal has been reached about the need for CIS
export restraint, including a method of double checking by the use of both
export licences in the CIS and import licences in the EU. But 'the Russian
industry does not like the numbers being proposed', said one.
The commission, which in August imposed restrictions on CIS aluminium
imports to the end of November, hoped to complete negotiations this month.
Now it is considering whether to continue the restrictions. It feels an
EU/CIS arrangement would not conflict with attempts to get agreement between
most of the big aluminium producing countries, who are to meet in Washington
on December second.
Mr Prokopov's suggestion of an 8 per cent production cut obviously will be
repeated at the Washington meeting, which will be attended by a large
delegation from the industry, the Russian government and some of the western
trading houses that have been involved with the CIS smelters.
Yesterday he indicated that the CIS industry had accepted some of the
European industry's proposals when he said that some of Russia's smelters
would have to shut down so that their highly polluting, old fashioned
technology could be replaced. He also suggested the CIS industry would be
heavily involved in toll smelting in future, that would involve processing
raw materials supplied by western organisations, which would continue to own
those materials and the metal produced from them.
It is far from certain that the CIS industry's proposal for further
production cuts will be well received. Mr Dick Dermer, president of the
European Aluminium Association, said yesterday that a 1.5m-tonne cut would
not be deep enough. It would take four or five years to reduce world
aluminium stocks and the industry could not wait that long if every member
was to survive intact.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market looks for output cut
from Opec meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in
Vienna today, almost two months after setting a new production ceiling that
has so far failed to prop up persistently weak prices.
The optimism that followed the September agreement to put a
24.52m-barrels-a-day ceiling on Opec production dissipated as prices drifted
lower in recent weeks. The price of benchmark Brent Blend has tested new
post-Gulf war lows as it has fluctuated in the Dollars 15- to Dollars
16-a-barrel range. The Opec basket, an average of six crudes, has slumped
even lower, to about Dollars 14.50 a barrel, from Dollars 18.50 earlier in
the year.
Analysts suggest that Opec will have to make at least a temporary cut in
output to jolt bearish market psychology and break the widespread perception
among traders that plentiful supplies will be available for some time to
come. Some analysts suggest that a pro-rata cut of as much as 5 per cent of
Opec's ceiling will be needed to halt, let alone reverse the price slide.
The authoritative Middle East Economic Survey yesterday said Opec ministers
could either 'hold fast to the six-month September accord, in the hopeful
expectation that the market will pick up of its own accord as the winter
progresses', or 'bite the bullet which the market is demanding - namely to
cut the current ceiling by at least 500,000 b/d or some two per cent.'
Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London,
agrees that 'if Opec wants higher prices they have to cut production. . .
the market needs a clear signal'.
Some analysts say, however, that any cut is unlikely to give a big boost to
prices in the short term because too many factors - such as the weather and
buoyant non-Opec production - are beyond the control of the organisation.
In September Opec tried to reverse growing price weakness by raising its
ceiling to 24.52m b/d. The strategy to regain market credibility through a
higher ceiling was based on the notion that it would accommodate members
such as Iran and Kuwait who were consistently cheating on their quotas.
The higher ceiling also allowed Opec to set individual country quotas that
took most producers close to capacity, thus reducing the prospects of
serious cheating.
The ministers counted on a traditional increase in demand with the advent of
the northern hemisphere winter to mop up excess stocks, which had been built
up in part by earlier over-production by Opec states. The thinking at the
time was that strict compliance was all that would be needed to ensure
firmer prices as higher demand in consuming countries chipped away at
surplus stocks.
That strategy has been undermined, however, by a combination of plentiful
supples and continuing low demand in the main consuming countries.

Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, has rejected an Opec request
to help lift crude prices, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Norway produces an average 2.3m barrels a day but last month hit a record
2.44m b/d. It has repeatedly said it will not reduce output.
Last Wednesday, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, industry and energy minister, received
a letter from Opec Secretary General Subroto who asked 'if there is any
possibility for Norway to contribute to the efforts being made by Opec
members to strengthen the very, very weak oil prices?'
Norway last co-operated with Opec to help underpin oil prices from 1986,
when they fell below Dollars 10 a barrel, till 1990. Companies were ordered
to pump 7.5 per cent below capacity.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand slackens off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold demand slackened further in the third quarter of this year, but
remained on course to challenge the record level achieved in 1992, according
to the World Gold Council, the international gold industry's promotional
body.
Total demand in the 75 per cent of the gold-producing world where the
council operates amounted 559.7 tonnes in the July-September period, down 4
per cent from a year earlier. That followed year-on-year rises of 20 per
cent in the first quarter - when buyers were attracted by exceptionally low
prices - and 1 per cent in the second quarter.
The total for the first three quarters was up 6 per cent on last year at
1,816.5 tonnes.

Rubber producing and consuming countries yesterday agreed to start
negotiations on a new price-stabilising accord to succeed the 1987
International Natural Rubber Agreement.
The International Natural Rubber Council, which took the decision at its
meeting in Kuala Lumpur, also agreed a one-year extension of the present
pact, which was due to expire on December 28.
Importing nations consented to renegotiate the pact after producers earlier
this month yielded to their condition of a 5 per cent cut in the reference
price for current buffer stock operations.
However, producing countries have served notice that they will seek a higher
price range in any new accord, negotiations on which are expected to begin
in Geneva early next year.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: German money supply figures lower European
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher-than-expected German money supply figures disappointed many of the
European government bond markets yesterday, fuelling fears that the next cut
in key German interest rates could still be some way off.
However, the biggest movement came in the Italian market where the municipal
election results prompted a two-point tumble in Italian government debt
prices.
German government bonds lost half a point as the Bundesbank reported that M3
expanded by a seasonally adjusted annualised 6.8 per cent, unchanged on
September and outside the central bank's target range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5
per cent.
Many market participants were disappointed as they had expected M3 to show
signs of slowing down in October. Six-month bank lending jumped to a 9.2 per
cent annualised rate. 'The news of a 9.2 per cent increase in bank lending
to the non-bank private sector was especially bad', said Mr Julian Callow,
European economist at Kleinwort Benson.
While the market had hoped that the Bundesbank would cut its official
interest rates in December, yesterday's money supply news is forcing some
market players to contemplate a delay in the cuts.
However, some dealers pointed out that if the November cost-of-living
figures for the various states - due to be released later this weak - show a
fall, the Bundesbank would still have scope to ease sooner rather than
later.
The December bund futures contract traded at 99.77 by late afternoon, down
0.50 point from Friday's close.
Italian government bonds fell nearly two points before regaining some of the
lost ground as the mainstream political parties suffered a crushing defeat
in municipal elections at the weekend.
Foreign investors and domestic institutions were heavy sellers of Italian
paper, and by afternoon, rumours were circulating that the Italian
authorities were buying paper to support the market and stem a further fall.
The Liffe BTP futures contract settled at 112.64, down 189 basis points.
Dealers said the Italian bloodbath was prompted by fears that the municipal
election results would weaken the central government and jeopardise its
economic plans, creating uncertainty over the budget legislation.
Spanish government bonds lost nearly half a point in line with other
European markets on the back of disappointing German M3 figures and the
turmoil in Italy.
However, some dealers are hoping to see a quarter point easing at today's
repo, taking the rate from 9.25 per cent to 9.00 per cent.
Weakness in the continental European fixed income markets and pre-Budget
jitters pushed UK government bond prices lower by as much as  7/8 point at
the long end, in spite of the good inflation background revealed by last
week's economic data which had raised hopes of a base rate cut.
The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 slipped  5/32 to 104 1/2 by late afternoon
while the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 dropped  7/8 to 118 1/2 .
US government securities fell at the long end of the maturity range
yesterday in the wake of a mildly disappointing Treasury auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at 98
1/4 , yielding 6.376 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/32 at 99 11/32 , to yield 4.213 per cent.
Prices opened slightly firmer in the wake of some dealer short-covering, but
with sentiment fragile in the wake of upbeat economic reports, the market
was unable to hold on to its early gains.
By mid-morning, prices had slipped into negative territory along the yield
curve as dealers sold securities to prepare for the sale of Dollars 17bn in
two-year notes. The auction was not a disaster, but demand from retail
accounts was thinner than expected. Concern about the prospects for the
five-year auction, due later today, weakened prices at the long end of the
market.
The yield curve for Japanese government bonds steepened as stock market
falls and lower money market rates lifted short-dated paper. Fear of supply
in the 10-year area held back prices at the long end.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Japanese bank raises DM600m with
10-year issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Export-Import Bank of Japan made its first appearance in the D-Mark sector
of the international bond market yesterday when it raised DM600m through an
issue of 10-year Eurobonds.
The proceeds of the offering were swapped into dollars and the borrower was
thought to have achieved its ambitious funding target of 10 to 15 basis
points below Libor.
Exim's bonds were priced to yield 18 basis points over German government
bonds (bunds), reflecting the borrower's triple-A rating and its rarity
value in the market.
Lead manager IBJ said the bonds sold quickly in spite of the weakness in the
bund market. Demand from investors in south-east Asia and in continental
Europe, excluding Germany, was particularly strong, IBJ said.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they eased to 98.80 bid from a re-offer
price of 99.035 but the fall was far smaller than the half-point drop in
bunds. The spread on the bonds tightened to 16 basis points at one stage in
the afternoon.
The weakness in the German government bond market is unlikely to dissuade
more borrowers from launching D-Mark Eurobond issues. Depfa, the German
mortgage bank, plans to make its large big Eurobond offering of the year, a
DM1bn issue of 10-year Eurobonds, within the next two weeks.
The mandate is likely to be awarded jointly to a German bank and an American
bank. Depfa is aiming for a yield spread on the bonds of 25-26 basis points
over the 6 per cent bund due 2003.
Cable &amp; Wireless's well-flagged Dollars 400m offering of 10-year Eurobonds
is due to be launched today and could well be the last big corporate
Eurodollar offering of the year. The bonds, via JP Morgan, are likely to be
priced to yield between 70 and 75 basis points over US Treasuries.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Rival market gives Bombay
impetus to reform - India is to get a new stock exchange that will end a
128-year-old monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bombay stock exchange, India's largest share market, is bracing itself
for competition. Its 128-year-old monopoly of stock trading in Bombay will
end with the opening next year of a high-technology National Stock Exchange.
The NSE plans to start by trading bonds, but intends to go into equities,
the core of the BSE's business, by the autumn of 1994.
The new exchange's official purpose is to develop markets in government and
corporate bonds, which are still in their infancy in India. But the real
intent of the government's finance ministry, which is backing the NSE, is to
force the BSE to overhaul its antiquated procedures and abuse-prone
practices. As Mr RH Patil, the NSE's managing director, says: 'The BSE
brokers are very worried about us. Part of our aim will be met if other
exchanges change and reform their markets.'
Bombay brokers retort they are not scared of competition. Clients who have
used the exchange for years are not likely to desert overnight, they claim.
They say the BSE is busy on reforms to increase transparency and investor
protection under the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India,
the newly-created markets' watchdog.
Brokers do admit the NSE's formation has given the BSE a new impetus to
reform. Mr GB Desai, BSE president, says: 'The authorities have a bad
impression of the BSE. We must change our way of working. We are changing
and will be ready by the time the NSE starts trading equities.'
Mr Desai says the BSE's reputation for tolerating unfair or dishonest
practices has been created largely by the publicity given to a handful of
scandals, such as last year's affair involving Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker
who allegedly illegally diverted funds from banks into the market. Indian
companies have this year been raising record amounts in new issues; new
investors, including foreign financial institutions, have been active on the
exchange. 'Business is pouring into the BSE,' says Mr Desai. 'If we worked
only for the benefit of the brokers, would this business have come to us?'
Until now, clients have had little choice, since the Bombay exchange faced
competition only from smaller local exchanges in cities including Delhi,
Calcutta and Madras. The NSE will be a different matter.
The NSE is being established at a cost of about Dollars 6m by the
government-owned financial institutions which dominate the shareholders'
registers under the leadership of the Industrial Development Bank of India,
a development bank.
Starting in April, the NSE will trade bonds issued by the Indian government,
by public sector enterprises and by private sector companies. Secondary
trading in these instruments is now limited to an informal inter-bank
market. Most paper is held by banks and other institutions from issue to
maturity, so little trading takes place. NSE officials hope the new exchange
will encourage trading, so promoting liquidity and greater efficiency in
India's debt markets. The initial members will be about 20 banks and other
financial institutions, which will operate as primary dealers. Membership
for the NSE's equity market will be wider and will include stockbrokers.
Unlike the BSE, where trading takes place mainly on a trading floor, the NSE
will be screen-based. Its main computers will be connected to terminals in
members' offices in Bombay and - via satellite - in other cities across
India. Mr Patil says the satellite links will make the NSE India's first
national financial market.
The BSE hopes to have its own computer-controlled screen-based price
quotation system by June, albeit for a limited number of heavily-traded
shares. Trading in all actively-traded stocks is to be computerised by March
1995.
Screen-based price-setting will not revolutionise stock trading in India
unless settlement procedures are modernised. One problem - for the BSE and
the NSE - is that transactions are completed by the physical transfer of
securities via the broker. Financial institutions have a computerised
depositary for shares, but its operation is limited to a handful of
institutions.
Mr Patil says that larger brokers on the BSE see the benefits of a
transparent and efficient computerised system and will gravitate towards the
NSE. Mr Desai believes the BSE will modernise in time to retain its grip on
business. 'We plan to remain the largest exchange in India,' he says.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Increase in demand helps lift
Japanese gas groups - Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading gas companies lifted interim earnings, due to increased
demand for hot water during an unusually cold summer, and the fall in fuel
prices due to the appreciation of the yen.
However, the companies are required to pass on the foreign exchange benefits
to consumers during the second half, and are expecting lower annual profits.
Tokyo Gas saw half-year non-consolidated pre-tax profits rise 211.2 per cent
to Y14.4bn (Dollars 133m) on a 4.9 per cent rise in sales to Y367.9bn and an
82.8 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y7.5bn.
Demand for gas rose 6.2 per cent to Y270.7bn. Household gas sales rose 6.2
per cent in volume, while industrial gas sales rose 21 per cent. Fuel costs
fell 3.8 per cent to Y54.8bn, due to the rise in the yen from Y127.60
against the dollar to Y107.74. The company also saw a 3.8 per cent decline
in administrative costs to Y40.6bn.
For the full year to March, Tokyo Gas expects a 2 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y35bn on a 3.3 per cent rise in sales to Y813bn.
The company forecasts a Y1.7bn rise in its deficit of financial items, and
plans annual capital spending of Y157.6bn against depreciation of Y100bn.
Osaka Gas posted a 51.9 per cent rise in interim unconsolidated pre-tax
profits to Y10.9bn on a 3.1 per cent increase in sales to Y286.2bn.
After-tax profits advanced 15.5 per cent to Y5.7bn.
The company said a worsened balance of financial items limited the rise in
pre-tax profits. Overall gas sales increased 7.3 per cent in volume.
For the full year to March, the company expects a 1.2 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y35bn and a 1.7 per cent rise in sales to Y636bn.
Capital spending for the year is expected to total Y111.9bn, down 4.2 per
cent from the previous year.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bubble's collapse hits Japan's
builders - Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 'tenants wanted' signs plastered on buildings around Tokyo and Osaka
tell as much about the difficulties of Japan's construction companies as
their interim profit statements, which detailed rapidly slowing orders and
generally falling profits.
In the late 1980s, the so-called 'bubble era', the contractors were
aggressive developers of office buildings and resorts in Japan and abroad.
They prospered from a surge in investment by ambitious Japanese
manufacturers, which expanded plant capacity in the expectation of demand
that has yet to materialise.
The bubble's collapse has left the contractors unable to fill their own
buildings and resorts, and facing a continuing decline in orders from
private customers. To add to the woes, construction companies are at the
centre of the latest political scandal and some excluded from public works
bidding, the only area of potential growth this year.
The interim statements reveal some of the bruises, but have yet to show the
effects of the sharp fall in orders this year. In the first half, the
Federation of Construction Companies said orders were 22.3 per cent lower
than a year ago, marking three years of contraction since the peak reached
in the first half of 1990.
Kajima, the latest company to be implicated in the political scandal,
reported a 12.2 per cent fall in sales in the six months to September, and a
16.7 per cent slide in pre-tax profit. Shimizu reported a 3.7 per cent
increase in sales, but a 3.8 per cent drop in pre-tax profit and a 32 per
cent fall in net profit.
The damage was more severe at Kumagai Gumi, which saw a 25.9 per cent fall
in sales, a 74.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profit, and a 92.4 per cent plunge
in net profit, which was a thin Y323m.
Obayashi was the exception, reporting an 18.7 per cent rise in sales, and a
133.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit and a similar leap in net profit,
which it attributed to a cost-cutting drive. However, the contractor said
orders for the period were down 32.4 per cent on a year earlier.
The fall in orders was repeated at other leading contractors. Taisei said
that its orders received slipped 38.6 per cent, Kajima 24.9 per cent,
Shimizu 32.1 per cent, and Kumagai Gumi 13.4 per cent.
Private construction tends to account for about two-thirds of orders, but
contractors had hoped that three stimulatory packages over the past year
would lead to an increasing flow of public works orders.
The bribery scandals have hurt the industry through the bidding suspensions
imposed on some companies, but the damage has been larger than expected
because government authorities have delayed awarding contracts, fearing the
embarrassment that would be caused if the chosen company was implicated in
the scandal.
The trend was reflected in a 19 per cent fall in public works orders during
the first half, and the industry is hoping that delayed contracts will be
awarded early next year. But companies whose executives are alleged to have
given illegal donations to politicians could still be overlooked even if the
formal suspension on bidding is lifted.
Construction ministry officials are reviewing the 'designated bidder'
selection process for public works projects. The scheme has been blamed for
encouraging corruption among authorities responsible for designating the
bidding companies and for encouraging collusion among the companies, which
often decide the bid prices among themselves.
Private construction orders are unlikely to recover for at least a year.
Manufacturers, which account for about 20 per cent of private orders, are
continuing to cut capital spending, and new factories are likely to be
established in China or elsewhere in east Asia.
Residential demand has been rising in recent months, as reflected in a
relatively small 1.3 per cent decrease in sales at Daiwa House, which had an
11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. Orders during the period were Y476bn,
compared with Y472bn in the same period last year.
Larger contractors' profits are more closely linked to commercial building
demand, which has been undermined by the continuing flow of completions that
were commissioned during the bubble era. According to the Co-operative
Credit Purchasing Company, established by Japanese banks to clear their
property-related bad loans, commercial prices are expected to continue
falling for at least another year.
For the full year to March, Kajima is expecting pre-tax profits to fall by
29 per cent, Taisei by 34 per cent, Shimizu by 24 per cent, and Kumagai Gumi
69 per cent. Obayashi is forecasting a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to
Y60bn (Dollars 561m).

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nippon Shinpan declines 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Shinpan, the consumer credit company, suffered a 35.3 per cent fall
to Y4.9bn in pre-tax profit for the first half to September, as Japanese
consumer spending weakened during the period and the company increased
provisions for non-performing loans, writes Robert Thomson.
Turnover during the six months fell 8.4 per cent to Y2,603.9bn, although the
company said the number of credit cards issued during the period rose,
partly because of the success of a card linked to Japan's popular and
newly-professionalised soccer league.
Retail sales slipped as consumers lost confidence in the face of reductions
in overtime and smaller annual bonuses, which directly affect Nippon
Shinpan, the largest Japanese provider of credit card services.
The government, under pressure from Japanese industry, is debating whether
an income tax cut will revive consumer confidence, though a decision is
unlikely before the financial year ends in March.
For the full year, Nippon Shinpan expects a pre-tax profit of Y13.6bn,
compared to Y14.3bn last year, and a net profit of Y3.4bn, down from Y4.7bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Weak demand for office equipment in Japan and in its main overseas markets
took sales at Ricoh, the maker of copiers and information equipment down 12
per cent to Y295.2bn (Dollars 2.76bn) from a previous Y336.1bn, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
However, an improved non-operating balance lifted its pre-tax profit by 38
per cent to Y6.19bn.
Ricoh saw revenues from its copiers drop significantly in the export market,
which offset a moderate rise in domestic sales.
Information equipment was, however, shunned both in Japan and overseas,
while sales of photographic equipment took a sharp downturn in overseas
markets.
Ricoh is strengthening its overseas procurement and production activities.
However, it does not expect the market to recover significantly in the
second term despite government efforts to lift domestic demand.
The company is forecasting a 9 per cent drop in sales for the full year to
Y592bn and a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y13bn.

<TEXT>
Tata Iron and Steel, India's second-largest private company, saw first-half
net profits plunge to Rs46.3m (Dollars 1.47m) from Rs502.2m a year ago, as a
result of worldwide recession, writes RC Murthy in Bombay.
Sales rose by 2 per cent to Rs15.05bn as the company focused on exports,
which jumped to Rs3.74bn from Rs2.61bn in a year, to increase plant capacity
utilisation.
Operating profits rose by nearly a fifth to Rs2.19bn, partly due to changes
in accounting practices.
But the higher interest burden at Rs973.9m, compared with Rs786.6m, and
depreciation provisions of Rs1.34bn cut net profits drastically to Rs46.3m
from Rs502.2m in the same period last year.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australia's CSR lifts payout by
20% after strong first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the large Australian timber, building materials, aluminium and sugar
group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in first-half profits after tax
and abnormal items, at ADollars 173m (USDollars 114.2m).
Total revenue in the six months to end-September rose by 17 per cent to
ADollars 2.83bn. Abnormals were nil, compared with a ADollars 9.9m surplus
in the first six months of 1992-93.
CSR traditionally enjoys a stronger trading period in its first half.
However, Mr Geoffrey Kells, managing director, yesterday stressed that the
company expected the 'strong profit improvement' to continue into the second
half, and the overall results for the year to end-March 1994, to be
'substantially higher' than last time's ADollars 211.2m (after tax but
before abnormals).
The interim dividend is being increased by 20 per cent, to 12 cents a share.
With the figures exceeding analysts' expectations, CSR shares bucked a
falling stock market yesterday and added 2 cents to ADollars 4.70.
CSR said that the improvement came from all divisions, with operating profit
before interest, foreign exchange considerations and tax rising by 18 per
cent to ADollars 328.8m.
The core Australian building and construction materials division saw
operating profits of ADollars 127.5m, against ADollars 118.6m last time; the
North American construction materials business made ADollars 70.7m, up from
ADollars 56.1m; timber products, helped by productivity gains and higher
sales volume, more than doubled to ADollars 35.5m from ADollars 14.9m; and
aluminium, in spite of depressed prices, contributed ADollars 36.9m,
compared with ADollars 18.8m.
The weakest spot was the sugar division, where operating profits were

'intense' competition in Australia's refined sugar markets, and stressed
that it was still arguing its case before the Trade Practices Commission,
which last week provisionally ruled against a refined sugar joint venture
between CSR and Mackay Refined Sugar.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Citic arm forms China investment
vehicle

<TEXT>
Citic Australia, part of the fast-expanding Beijing-based investment
company, is joining with Hambros Australia to launch a quoted investment
vehicle which will make direct equity investments in China.
The new company aims to tap growing institutional interest in this area, and
claims to be the first Australian company to focus on equity investment in
China.
The initial funds are relatively modest - 35m shares are being issued at
ADollars 1 each. However, subscribers will also have an option to purchase
one further share, at the same price, before May 1995.
Citic and Hambros say that this is partly because of a requirement that 50
per cent of the funds raised be invested within six months. This could
become difficult if the sums were larger, given the limited scale of Chinese
stockmarkets.
The aim is for about 25 per cent of the fund's assets to be invested in
shares quoted on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges. Foreigners can only buy
'B' shares, and only 13 companies on the SHSE and 19 on the SZSE offer
these.
However, the fund notes that several new issues are planned over the next
nine months, and intends to keep around one-quarter of its assets liquid in
order to participate in these offerings. It will also put about one fifth of
the fund into unlisted groups.
The remaining 30 per cent will be split between Chinese companies listed in
Hong Kong, and companies listed elsewhere which do the bulk of their
business in China.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: US offshoot holds key to
Rhone-Poulenc - The chemical group's future depends on the strength of
healthcare company RPR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Key to the fortunes Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest chemicals group whose
privatisation issue closes this week, is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR), its 68.7
per cent-owned healthcare subsidiary.
Rhone-Poulenc's health sales, which include RPR and Institut Merieux,
generated 90 per cent of group operating profits on only 40 per cent of
group turnover during the first nine months this year.
RPR is the vast majority of Rhone-Poulenc's health sales and operating
profits. It accounted for FFr21.7bn (Dollars 3.6bn) of the health division's
FFr30bn sales last year, and its FFr3.5bn operating profits totalled 83 per
cent of the division's earnings.
The subsidiary was formed in 1990 from the merger of Rhone-Poulenc Sante of
France and Rorer of the US and, of all the mega-mergers of the late 1980s
and early 1990s, this has been the most successful. Between 1990 and 1992,
operating profits increased from Dollars 2.3bn to Dollars 4.96bn while
operating margins rose from 9.8 per cent to 16.8 per cent.
But in spite of RPR's impressive record, its ultimate success is far from
assured. Its early achievements were relatively easy.
In 1990, the group's gross margins were about 60 per cent, against an
industry average of about 75 per cent.
The group, which has been the fastest expanding company among the top 25 US
drugs groups, is now seeing a slowdown in underlying growth. Analysts expect
volume growth to be limited to about 7 per cent this year.
During the first three quarters turnover fell from Dollars 2.918m to Dollars
2.884bn. Adverse currency changes - the franc has fallen 22 per cent against
the dollar - will mean sales for the full year are likely to be flat.
Like other pharmaceuticals companies, RPR is facing a worsening environment,
with governments around the world reining in drugs spending.
Healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy, in particular, sapped sales growth,
with turnover down between 25 per cent and 30 per cent during the first half
of the year. Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive, warns that the second six
months are unlikely to see an improvement.
The group is vulnerable to the US and French markets, which represented 25
per cent and 33 per cent of sales last year. However, Mr Cawthorn insists it
will be less affected by the changes in the US than most. He argues RPR has
such a broad range of products it is not dependent upon a blockbuster that
could be attacked by generic competition.
Of reform in France, Mr Cawthorn says the government is more sensitive to
the needs of the pharmaceuticals industry than in many countries. 'It's
impossible to conceive of what has happened in Germany happening in France.
There would be a revolt.'
The group is responding by improving margins, among the worst in the
industry, and by paying off debt. Net debt, which in 1990 was Dollars 1.9bn,
is expected to fall from Dollars 774m in 1993 to Dollars 574m, according to
Paris-based brokers, Paribas.
In the medium-term, it is focusing on rapid growth through 16 key products,
new uses for existing medicines, and a global marketing strategy.
'We may be number three in Europe, but we are only number 22 in the US, and
that's not nearly as big as we ought to be,' says Mr Cawthorn.
Since the merger, RPR has tripled its US sales force to 1,000.
Japan is a strategic priority. 'We're definitely not strong enough there.
The economics of licensing your products to a Japanese group just don't work
any more, given the rising costs of developing each compound.'
The group's long-term focus is to generate growth through innovative
products that can justify premium pricing. But the immediate future is
looking thin.
Mr Cawthorn says: 'The two parents, Rorer and Rhone-Poulenc Sante, were
pretty ho-hum organisations. Rorer had no track record of developing
compounds. Rhone-Poulenc Sante had been very innovative but by 1990 the
group was no longer at the cutting edge.'
The company has twice reorganised its R&amp;D activities. After the merger, many
of the compounds in the pipeline were 'me-too' products with little to
differentiate them from drugs already on the market, he says.
The acid test of the new development will be Taxotere, an anti-cancer
compound.
'You have to be first or second to the market. We think Taxotere is
extremely exciting and only a little way behind Bristol-Myers Squibb's
Taxol.
'We used the resources freed by not developing me-too compounds to
accelerate its development,' says Mr Cawthorn.
The group is throwing all its development resources at Taxotere in a race
against time before rationalisation benefits begin to run out.
Taxotere will be filed for breast cancer and lung cancer next year in North
America, Europe and Japan within three months of each other. 'We've never
done that before,' Mr Cawthorn says.
But, in spite of the R&amp;D reorganisation, doubts persist. The company, which
spent Dollars 521m on R&amp;D last year - equivalent to 17 per cent of sales -
has focused on eight therapeutic groups.
However, it is still developing drugs that are increasingly commodities,
such as antibiotics, antihistamines, and cholesterol-lowering drugs.
To bolster the long-term future, Mr Cawthorn is trying to identify emerging
technologies. RPR's efforts to access these new technologies include a
Dollars 113m investment in 37 per cent of Applied Immune Sciences, a
Californian-based company specialising in cell and gene therapy.
'We will also collaborate with other pharmaceuticals groups,' says Mr
Cawthorn. 'We need to pool resources rather than compete.'
An example, says Mr Cawthorn was RPR's joint-venture with Chugai, the
Japanese group, to develop treatments to help chemotherapy patients. The
outcome of this long-term research effort is unlikely to be seen for at
least five years. In the meantime, most of RPR's immediate fortunes at the
molecular roulette table are riding on Taxotere.
Given the likely poor profitability of the rest of Rhone-Poulenc in coming
years, the stakes riding on this single drug are high.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: CPFP takes CDollars 135m charge
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Pacific Forest Products is taking a CDollars 135m (USDollars 101m)
special charge to write off its investment in the loss-making Gold River
newsprint mill on Vancouver Island British Columbia. Negotiations to
restructure the mill's debt have begun.
Gold River cost about CDollars 250m and during three years of operation has
been hit by low pulp and newsprint prices. The West Coast price of newsprint
is USDollars 420 a tonne, a record low after inflation.
CPFP, now independent of Canadian Pacific, owned 65 per cent of the limited
partnership set up to build and own Gold River's pulping unit, a 230,000
tonnes a year newsprint operation.
CPFP, as general partner, has pumped in operating funds since Gold River's
start up by buying partnership notes, and its interest has now risen to 85.5
per cent. The minority is held by a publishing group.
CPFP says it will continue its support until March 31, 1994.
The partnership has halted interest and principal payments on CDollars 226m
of long-term debt and begun debt restructuring talks with the banks with a
March 31 deadline.
CPFP says Gold River can be profitable with debt restructuring and a new
operating plan. Productivity is improving and the newsprint market is
showing signs of life, officials said. Last August, Canadian Pacific sold
its 60.7 per cent interest in CPFP, saying newsprint had become too
cyclical.
Analysts estimated the Gold River write-off will bring CPFP's 1993 loss to
more than CDollars 330m, against a loss of CDollars 248m in 1992.

share float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy demand for shares in Central Puerto, a semi-privatised electricity
generator, led Argentina to increase the company's share price 8 per cent,
one day before the local and international offer closed.
Mr Daniel Marx, finance under-secretary, said the issue, which closed
yesterday, was over-subscribed about 13 times. The government originally
fixed a price range of Dollars 4.50-Dollars 5.00 for its remaining 30 per
cent stake in the company and expected to raise Dollars 126m.
However, Mr Marx said yesterday the government had increased the price
ceiling to Dollars 5.40 per share, given 'a significant change in market
conditions lately'. As a result, he said, Central Puerto's prospective
price/earnings ratio has risen to about 13 years.
Central Puerto was partly privatised in April 1992, when the government sold
60 per cent of it for Dollars 92.2m to a consortium led by Chilgener of
Chile.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday reported fee income across
its European practices down 8 per cent to SFr2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in the year
to June 30.
In the UK, its biggest practice, fee income fell 3 per cent to Pounds 383.3m
(Dollars 571m) during the period. This included a 14 per cent decline in
management consultancy to Pounds 83.9m, and a 5 per cent decline in
corporate finance and recovery work to Pounds 53.2m.
Audit and business advisory services in the UK grew by 1 per cent to Pounds
137.4m, and tax consultancy by 4 per cent to Pounds 108.8m.
At 1992-93 exchange rates, the firm said its fee income across Europe was
unchanged. At these rates, management consultancy billings fell 19 per cent
to SFr306m.
Tax consultancy grew 7 per cent to SFr513m, audit and business advisory by 3
per cent to SFr1.02bn and corporate finance and recovery by 1 per cent to
SFr159m.
Mr Jermyn Brooks, chairman of PW Europe, said demand for services had been
effected by the recession, and that steps had been made to restructure and
rationalise practices.
In common with other firms, Price Waterhouse refused to provide any
information on profits.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Discover agrees compromise with
rival credit card issuer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A stand-off between two of the US's big four credit card companies was
partially resolved yesterday as Dean Witter Discover announced it was to
issue cards bearing the MasterCard logo.
DWD, which was spun off from the retailing group Sears, Roebuck earlier this
year, has been fighting both MasterCard and Visa in the courts for the past
two years. It is seeking the right to issue cards under the two payment
systems through one of its own banking subsidiaries.
Yesterday's agreement does not involve the company joining MasterCard
directly. Instead, it will issue a co-branded card with NationsBank, the
North Carolina-based bank which is eager to grow its own base of
cardholders.
The two sides have dropped all litigation against each other.
However, under the terms of their agreement, subsidiaries of DWD will be
admitted to MasterCard directly if DWD wins a separate action seeking
admission to Visa.
The Discover card, launched in 1985, has around 39m cardholders and is
accepted by 1.8m merchants in the US - nearly as many as accept Visa and
MasterCard.
The card to be issued through NationsBank, known as the Prime Option
MasterCard, will continue DWD's strategy of issuing 'value-based' general
purpose cards - those with no fees and low interest rates.
Following the huge success of Sears' Discover card, which also pays holders
a rebate, many similar cards have been issues by banks and others under both
Visa and MasterCard.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Toyota warns of continued decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, the leading Japanese carmaker, forecast yesterday that its earnings
would 'bottom out' in the current financial year to the end of June 1994.
'We believe that Toyota then can achieve a gradual upturn in earnings,' said
Mr Hiroshi Okuda, Toyota executive vice-president responsible for finance.
However, he warned that growth in Japan would be slow, and the domestic
industry would have to be restructured. 'Growth will be slower than the
growth we took for granted in the 1970s and 1980s. Automakers will not share
equally in that growth.'
With 11 domestic vehicle makers, the Japanese industry was 'pretty crowded',
said Mr Okuda. 'If the yen remains strong and domestic demand remains weak,
not all of these automakers will survive in their present form.'
Toyota's pre-tax profits declined by 25 per cent in the year to the end of
June, to Y322.2bn (Dollars 3bn), and are forecast to fall steeply again this
year under pressure from the sharp appreciation of the yen and the
continuing decline in the domestic Japanese market.
Mr Okuda forecast that by 1995-96 (the year to June 1996) Toyota would have
restored its pre-tax earnings to the level of 1991-92, when they totalled
Y427.9bn.
Toyota would need another year of strenuous efforts to cut costs to offset
the impact of the strong yen, Mr Okuda told financial analysts in London.
Cost-savings achieved through streamlining operations and reductions in
fixed costs had amounted to Y160bn in the last financial year, he said.
He forecast Toyota's growth would be strong in emerging markets such as
south-east Asia, where the group has sold more than 300,000 cars and trucks
in the last financial year, to claim market share of around 20 per cent.
This week it is establishing a finance subsidiary in Thailand.
New car sales in Japan, which have been falling for three years in
succession, were expected to begin to recover in 1994, said Mr Okuda.
He said Toyota did not plan any redundancies in Japan. To streamline
production, it was cutting the number of its model specifications by 20 per
cent, and component variations by 30 per cent.
Toyota had the strongest financial position in the world auto industry, he
claimed, with total liquid assets with a book value of Y2,100bn. In
addition, the Toyota group's securities portfolio had a hidden reserve (the
market value in excess of the book value) of Y1,600bn.
Toyota will begin UK output of a hatchback version of its Carina E next
month. UK production will reach 400 units a day, or an annual rate of
100,000 during the first half of 1994.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ruling on Paramount takeover
deferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Delaware judge yesterday delayed until at least Wednesday an important
court ruling in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for entertainment group
Paramount Communications.
Judge Jack Jacobs, of the Delaware chancery court, told companies involved
in the case that he needed more time to consider last-minute information,
including some provided by Paramount directors.
The case involves a challenge by QVC Network, the television shopping
company headed by Mr Barry Diller, to the terms of a Dollars 9.4bn friendly
merger agreement between Paramount and cable television group Viacom.
QVC has made a hostile Dollars 10.7bn offer for Paramount, and has asked the
court to lift poison pill provisions of the merger deal which would require
it, in the event of a successful takeover, to pay Viacom some Dollars 600m.
Viacom's tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares had been due to
expire at midnight last night, with QVC's offer closing on Friday night.
Viacom's offer has now been extended to midnight on November 24, and QVC's
to December 1.
Yesterday's action preserved, at least for now, the time advantage enjoyed
by Viacom's tender offer, though this could change if the judge were to find
in QVC's favour.
Fund American Enterprises Holdings is in preliminary talks on the purchase
of part or all of Xerox's Talegen Holdings insurance unit, Reuters reports
from Chicago.
Talegen, formerly Crum and Forster, is a property-casualty insurer. 'The
talks are in the early stages,' said Fund American.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two US hotel chains enter
contest for Ciga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two US hotel groups yesterday declared an interest in the Italian-based Ciga
luxury hotel group, which last month announced it was negotiating a deal
with Forte of the UK.
ITT Sheraton and Host Marriott said they were interested in the
highly-indebted chain, which is the subject of a restructuring plan
organised by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank.
Forte said last month it would take over the management of Ciga's 35 hotels
in Italy, Austria, France, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain.
In return, it would pay Pounds 33m (Dollars 48.6m) and insert some of its
own luxury hotels, with a value of about Pounds 125m, into an Italy
operating company. Forte is carrying out a due diligence examination of the
chain.
The Forte plan has, however, had a mixed reception among Ciga's banks, many
of which have not received interest on the group's net debts of more than
L1,000bn (Dollars 595.6m) for months.
Ciga's Italian bankers have kept a low profile, in spite of frustration at
delays in presenting the Mediobanca rescue plan. While concern not to offend
Mediobanca has probably been the main cause of their inaction, the apparent
lack of alternatives has been the other.
Foreign banks have been more assertive in voicing their dissatisfaction.
Matters have been made more difficult by Ciga's complex ownership structure.
The company, which is listed on the Milan bourse, is controlled by Fimpar,
the quoted financial holding company majority-owned by the Aga Khan.
A group of lenders to Fimpar have taken legal action to freeze its Ciga
stake. They have argued that any Ciga rescue package should take their
interests into account. They have sought representation in the negotiations.
Only one foreign bank, Barclays, has lent to both Ciga and Fimpar, and it is
by far the most vociferous of the dissidents. Last month, it indicated
opposition to the Mediobanca plan and criticised the bank for not examining
alternative offers. Mediobanca, which traditionally refuses to talk to the
press, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Host Marriott confirmed yesterday it was in discussions over the possible
acquisition of Ciga. It said Marriott International, its sister company,
could operate some or all of the hotels.
ITT Sheraton said it was looking for properties to complement its business
and a bid for Ciga was 'under preliminary review'.
Forte countered yesterday that its luxury hotels made it more compatible
with Ciga than the other two groups. It said, however, that it would not
overpay for the chain.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Varity doubles net earnings to
Dollars 22m

Shares in Varity, the US automotive, farm and industrial machinery group,
advanced yesterday after it said earnings more than doubled in the third
quarter.
For the three months to the end of October, the group posted net income of
Dollars 22.2m, or 49 cents a share on a fully-diluted basis. It beat
analysts' forecast of about 40 cents. In the comparable period of 1992,
earnings were Dollars 10.5m, or 23 cents a share.
After the announcement, the stock added Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The advance partly reflected Varity's moves to concentrate on core
manufacturing businesses. As a result, revenues were lower at Dollars 692m,
against Dollars 844m a year ago. However, the decline was attributable to
several disposals last year. When adjusted to exclude discontinued
operations, sales in the 1992 quarter were Dollars 656m.
The restructuring, together with a series of stock moves, helped the company
slash interest expense to Dollars 8m, from Dollars 35.3m in the year-earlier
period.
All three of Varity's main operating groups - Kelsey-Hayes, an automotive
parts supplier; Perkins, a diesel-engine manufacturer; and the
Massey-Ferguson farm-equipment division - contributed to a 23 per cent jump
in operating income.
The performance by Kelsey-Hayes, the world's largest producer of anti-lock
braking systems, was particularly encouraging. Sales were up 14.3 per cent
to Dollars 297m, suggesting a growing acceptance of such braking systems
among car manufacturers.
In the first nine months, Varity posted a net loss of Dollars 98.5, or
Dollars 3.17 a share. With the effects of accounting changes and early debt
retirement excluded, net income was Dollars 49.3m, or Dollars 1.13, on a
fully-diluted basis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican finance ministry has has given the go-ahead to two new banks,
bringing to 11 the total number of authorisations granted this year.
The government hopes the moves will put more competitive pressure on those
former state-owned banks that were privatised last year and the year before.
Next year, US and Canadian banks will be permitted to set up their own
subsidiaries in Mexico, under the terms of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta). This will open up the market still further.
The finance ministry has complained about the high spreads between interest
rates on savings and loans earned by Mexican banks, and has partly blamed
the credit crunch and economic slowdown this year on uncompetitive practices
in the financial sector.
The finance ministry also approved four mortgage associations, and three
savings and loans groups, in an effort to stimulate housing market.
Mortgages are difficult to obtain in Mexico, and rates are well above those
earned on deposits.
The two new banks are: Banco Regional de Monterrey, of Jaime and Manuel
Rivero Santos, and Banco Invex, of the brokerage of the same name.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo tries to defuse revolt
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo made a final push yesterday to defuse a shareholder revolt against its
proposed merger with Renault by saying it had received new assurances from
the French government on the most controversial aspects of the deal.
It said France had confirmed it would not use its golden share against
Volvo, providing the Swedish group did not try to lift its stake in the
group to more than 35 per cent.
This confirmation, aimed at removing fears of a dilution in Volvo's stake in
the group, would be written into the agreement, it stated.
Volvo added that a reaffirmation by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, of a target date for the privatisation of Renault in the second
half of next year, subject to market conditions, carried more weight than
earlier assurances on the subject.
Mr Balladur's comments, contained in a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Mr
Carl Bildt, were published for the first time yesterday. Mr Pehr
Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, said: 'The Volvo board feels that two
important questions have now been clarified.'
He believed the assurances would be enough to persuade sceptical Swedish
institutional shareholders to back the deal. Their hostility to the accord,
centred on the golden share and the privatisation timetable, forced Volvo to
delay a meeting to approve the deal until December 7.
However, Aktiespararna, the small shareholders association which initiated
the revolt, said the golden share provision still compromised the value of
Volvo's shareholding in the merged company.

Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to bolster its balance
sheet through a Fl 373.5m (Dollars 196.5m) issue of new shares, expanding
the loss-making company's capital base by 37 per cent.
The transaction involves a series of offers to Dutch and foreign
institutions, retail investors and the Dutch state, which will take up
nearly a third of the new shares.
After the offers, lead-managed by ABN Amro and SG Warburg Securities, the
state's stake will rise to around 17.1 per cent from 12.3 per cent.
However, Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said this will bring ownership of
Hoogovens by public authorities back to the level that prevailed until July,
when the City of Amsterdam sold off its 5 per cent stake to domestic and
foreign institutional investors.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Shortfall in US pension funds
shows big increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shortfall in the 50 US corporate pension funds with the biggest deficits
had climbed from Dollars 29bn to Dollars 38bn by the end of last year, and
is projected to have grown to as much as Dollars 50bn now.
The figures will add to support for proposed legislation which would force
companies to cut the scale of their pension fund deficits, in turn eating
into their reported profits and cashflow.
The latest figures on the scale of the underfunding were disclosed by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which guarantees benefits in private
sector funds.
Falling US bond rates largely account for the worsening position of US
pension funds. Long-term interest rates are used to discount future pension
liabilities to calculate their current values. As this discount rate falls,
the present value of the liabilities rises.
'With interest rates declining, companies should have been contributing
larger amounts to their pension plans to keep their liabilities manageable.
Our reforms will require it,' said Mr Martin Slate, executive director.
Given the one percentage point fall in the 30-year US bond yield since the
start of this year, the combined deficit is likely to have grown
considerably larger. General Motors, for instance, calculates that a one
percentage point fall adds Dollars 5bn - 6bn to its liabilities.
GM once again topped the PBGC's listings. As others, such as Chrysler, have
moved to cut the underfunding of their plans, the scale of GM's pension fund
deficit now dwarfs those of other companies. Last week GM announced its
intention to transfer Dollars 5.7bn worth of shares into its pension fund.
The PBGC figures differ from those published by companies because they are
calculated on a termination basis, and assume the funds are forced to buy
annuities at current market rates to cover all their future liabilities.
Based on its own calculations, GM's deficit was Dollars 14bn at end-1992 and
will be Dollars 24bn by the end of this year as a result of lower bond
yields.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Further staffing reductions at
Enichem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enichem, the chronically loss-making petrochemicals arm of Italy's Eni
energy and chemicals group, yesterday said it would cut its service and
support staff by 10,000 within at least four years.
Mr Marcello Colitti, the chairman, said the cuts were separate from job
losses caused by any plant closures involved in the group's future
rationalisation. He added that the cuts were part of Enichem's preparations
to sell or privatise most of its operations.
'The future of the company depends upon rationalisation. There is no point
hiding the truth. Unless these businesses have the potential to make money,
nobody is going to invest in them,' said Mr Colitti.
Last week, the group announced expected losses this year of around L2,200bn
(Dollars 1.3bn). In spite of cost-cutting, the company lost L1,052bn in the
first six months, against L721bn in the same 1992 period.
'The cost of producing a kilogram of polyethylene at the moment is about 75
pfennigs, and the sale price is DM1. We just can't afford the overheads we
have at the moment. I'm not happy about it, but don't let's fool ourselves.
We cannot expect private investors unless we are making money,' said Mr
Colitti.
Enichem is prepared to sell or put into joint ventures nearly all its
businesses, including the polyethylene, polyurethane and polystyrene
operations. The group is also looking for partners for its elastomers
business. Enichem's fibres and detergents businesses are already quoted.
Mr Colitti said Enichem would keep its core ethylene production. But the
group was keen to reduce its stake in the downstream operations as far as it
could, while still ensuring the subsidiaries would use Enichem's raw
materials.
'Enichem will virtually be dissolved. It could become virtually a small
holding company with a few petrochemicals activities,' said Mr Colitti.
Some subsidiaries, such as detergents, were ready for disposal, while others
like the elastomers required more cost-cutting. Many required more complex
rationalisation and might require a joint-venture and capacity
rationalisation.
'There's far too much petrochemicals capacity in Europe. There are simply
too many plants. Consolidation is inevitable and unavoidable and, I believe,
a welcome consequence of market globalisation,' said Mr Colitti.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: BASF likely to cut dividend
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals group, is likely to cut its dividend again this
year and expects business to remain weak before turning up in 1995,
according to Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman.
Pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of 1993 were down 44 per cent at
DM607m (Dollars 354m), mainly because of a 10 per cent sales decline in
Europe, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the total, he said.
German operations were showing operating losses, and would be liable for a
considerably lower tax bill.
The group cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 last year after pre-tax profits
fell 41 per cent to DM1.24bn.
Profits had also been hit by heavy start-up and development work on the
group's gas business and plants at Schwarzheide in eastern Germany, Antwerp
and Mexico.
Group sales, down 5 per cent overall at DM30.7bn in the nine months, were
helped by a 7 per cent rise in north America which stemmed partly from the
acquisition of Mobil's polystyrene business.
While Mr Strube gave no clear forecasts for the full year, or the dividend,
he said sales in August and September were around 5 per cent higher than in
the same two months of 1992, marking the first improvement this year so far.
'Volumes and earnings are beginning to stabilise at a low level,' he said.
'We have probably reached the bottom of the slope, but it is too soon to
conclude that we have started up the other side.'
Earnings power was still being dampened by slack demand and low prices
resulting from over-capacity and increasing imports from low-cost countries.
Sales of plastics and fibres, BASF's biggest business sector, fell 9 per
cent to DM7.3bn because of a 19 per cent drop in Europe, including a 23 per
cent slump in the domestic market.
Chemicals, accounting for 13 per cent of total sales, remained one of the
group's biggest earners, Mr Strube said. A 9 per cent decline in Europe was
partly offset by a 15 per cent revival in north America.
Confirming further labour cuts and closures in Germany - continuing a
programme which had helped reduce fixed costs by DM600m so far this year -
he signalled greater concentration in future on developing the chemicals
business abroad.
While some 45 per cent of spending in this sector, excluding oil and gas,
had been focused in Germany in recent years, the proportion would be cut to
35 per cent in a new medium-term plan. China was playing a particularly
significant role in the company's internationalisation, he noted.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Krone devaluation hits Carlsberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Price competition and krone devaluation prevented Carlsberg from translating
a 29 per cent increase in the volume of beer sold in the year ended
September into matching increases in profits and turnover.
Turnover increased by 4.2 per cent to DKr15.59bn (Dollars 2.29bn) from
DKr14.95bn, including excise taxes. Operating profits dipped to DKr1.08bn
from DKr1.16bn, although after net financial income, pre-tax profits rose by
DKr18m to DKr1.36bn.
The results also include a DKr200m charge to meet structural changes 'in
anticipation of ever-increasing competition affecting the brewing industry
in Denmark and especially abroad'.
Earnings per share were up slightly to DKr14.24 from DKr13.36, but the
group's return on equity slipped slightly to 13.7 from 14.6 per cent.
Carlsberg is paying an unchanged DKr3 per share dividend.
The increase in turnover was held back by currency changes. If exchange
rates had been stable, pre-tax profits would have been about 8 per cent
higher than the published figure, Carlsberg said.
Carlsberg-Tetley, the group's UK joint venture, is included in the accounts
for nine months. The venture contributed to a significant increase in beer
sales in the UK, Carlsberg said.
Intensifying competition will have an adverse effect on future earnings,
partly because of higher marketing expenditures, said Carlsberg.
However, the group expects to consolidate its position as an important
player on the international brewing scene in the second half of the decade,
it said.

deficit

<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil and chemicals group, has reported heavier nine-month
operating losses and forecast an operating deficit of around Sch1bn (Dollars
83m) for 1993 as a whole.
Nine-month turnover was Sch59.44bn, down from Sch60.73bn in the same period
of 1992. Operating losses for the nine months were Sch735m compared with
Sch383m.
Restructuring, including plant closures and drastic cost-cutting measures in
the plastics and chemicals divisions, will cause extraordinary losses of
about Sch3.7bn and bring the full-year net loss to Sch4.7bn.
Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said the losses were due to the severe
recession in the chemicals business and low crude oil prices. The gas
business was the group's most profitable activity and there was a small
profit from refining.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Lebanon to raise Dollars 300m
in Eurobond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Lebanese government plans to raise Dollars 300m, through its first
Eurobond offering, to help rebuild Beirut.
The proposed issue of three-year Eurobonds is the latest attempt by prime
minister Mr Rafik Hariri's government to meet the costs of a Dollars 13bn
national reconstruction programme, dubbed Horizon 2000.
Foreign aid has been well below the levels needed to finance the 10-year
programme. Commitments to date from the EU, the United Nations, the Opec
Fund, Arab institutions and others amount to Dollars 1.4bn and are linked to
specific projects.
The World Bank has pledged Dollars 175m and the Lebanese government hopes a
meeting of a Bank-sponsored consultative group, scheduled for December, will
result in more aid.
However, following the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, Lebanon's plans are likely to suffer as the donor
community switches its attention and funds to the reconstruction of the
occupied territories. Furthermore, until progress is made between Israel and
Lebanon in their peace talks, substantial aid is unlikely to be forthcoming.
As a result, the Lebanese government has turned to the international capital
markets. Earlier this month, Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set
up to rebuild the centre of Beirut, launched a Dollars 650m international
equity offering, one of the biggest public share issues in the region.
Lebanon's bonds are likely to be well received because of its relatively low
foreign debt of Dollars 300m and its gold reserves, which stood at Dollars
1.5bn at the end of 1992. Bankers say Lebanon has not defaulted on any
international loans since the start of the civil war in 1975. Merrill Lynch,
the US securities house, is arranging the offering. The bonds are likely to
be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis points over US treasuries.

FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens plans share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to bolster its balance
sheet through a Fl 373.5m (Dollars 196.5m) issue of new shares, expanding
the loss-making company's capital base by 37 per cent.
The transaction involves a series of offers to Dutch and foreign
institutions, retail investors and the Dutch state, which will take up
nearly a third of the new shares.
After the closure of the offers, which are being lead-managed by ABN Amro
and SG Warburg Securities, the Dutch government's stake in Hoogovens will
rise to around 17.1 per cent from 12.3 per cent currently.
However, Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, noted that this will bring ownership
of Hoogovens by public authorities back to the level that prevailed until
July, when the City of Amsterdam sold off its 5 per cent stake to domestic
and foreign institutional investors.
Mr van Veen said Hoogovens had decided against holding a rights issue
because it wanted to raise the maximum amount possible. If it had opted for
a rights issue, it would have had to offer a discount to the market price.
The price of the new shares, to be fixed by December 3, is expected to be
roughly equal to the company's price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
At Friday's closing price of Fl 45, the issue would be worth Fl 373.5m.
Yesterday, Hoogovens' shares fell by Fl 2.50 to Fl 42.50.
Hoogovens' share price has doubled since March, helped by keen interest from
foreign investors and foreign stockbroking firms.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK growth gives lift to Kenwood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in UK sales helped Kenwood Appliances, the household appliance
manufacturer, lift interim pre-tax profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 5.35m.
The figure for the six months ended September 1993 compared with a pro forma
Pounds 5.03m. The Hampshire-based group was floated in June last year.
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said the group had produced 'a solid set of
results.' UK turnover had improved by 12 per cent as consumer spending
recovered after a flat two years.
Exports had also advanced strongly, with both the Kenwood Chef and food
processors performing well.
Overall turnover rose by 21 per cent, from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 55m.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 6.08m.
The latest pre-tax figure included Pounds 400,000 of exceptional items,
reflecting changes in the group's distribution systems in the US and
Germany.
The group's products will be distributed in the US by the Rival
Manufacturing Company from January 1, while a sales operation is being set
up in Germany.
Mr Parker said this reflected the board's decision to concentrate the
international sales effort on Europe and the Far East. He described the Far
East as offering the most exciting opportunities.
Last year Kenwood paid HKDollars 36.5m (Pounds 3.2m) for Tricom, a supplier
of small kitchen appliances with a factory in China's Guangdon province.
Last month it paid Pounds 4.33m for Precision Engineering (Reading), which
includes Waymaster, a maker of water filters and kitchen scales.
Mr Parker said the group was on the look-out for further acquisitions along
similar lines.
Interest payable of Pounds 332,000 compared with a pro forma Pounds 232,000.
Earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 9.6p. The interim dividend of 3p
compares with 1.5p paid last time for the part of the period when the
company was listed.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold falls Dollars 67,000 into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bakyrchik Gold, which was floated in August to exploit a gold mine in
Kazakhstan, reported a loss of Dollars 67,000 (Pounds 45,000) for the period
since its incorporation in April to the end of September.
The balance sheet shows cash of Dollars 12.5m, which is expected to be
committed to the Bakyrchik Joint Venture with the Kazakhstan government by
the end of the financial year in March.
The Bakyrchik mine, in which BK Gold has 40 per cent and management control,
has one of the world's biggest gold deposits with 28.1m tonnes of ore
containing 9.1 grams of gold a tonne.
The first gold to be delivered under the venture is expected next summer.
Mr David Hooker, chairman, said yesterday that the company was upgrading the
capacity of its plant for the first stage of the project from 100,000 tonnes
per year of ore to 150,000 tonnes per year while remaining within the same
budget.
However, the average grade from the first ore to be processed would be 7.2
grams of gold per tonne - lower than the ore body average.
A feasibility study for stage two of the project, under which 1m tonnes of
ore a year would be processed, was well under way and was scheduled for
completion in May.
Stage two would be underpinned by the first stage, but shareholders would be
asked for about Pounds 70m some time next year.
Bakyrchik's share price yesterday closed 6p higher at 213p.
The placing in August of 7.5m shares was priced at 120p, valuing the company
at about Pounds 18m.
Only five days later Chilewich, a New York-based trading organisation and
joint owner, sold most of its 25 per cent stake.
Minproc, the Australian resources and engineering group which was BK Gold's
other joint owner, owns 23.7 per cent.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hire services lifts Allen to Pounds 1.28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp profits increase from its hire services side helped Allen, the
Wigan-based housebuilding, hire services and contracting group, lift pre-tax
profits by 50 per cent in the six months to September 30.
The rise, from Pounds 855,000 to Pounds 1.28m - a figure forecast at the
time of the Pounds 5m placing in September - was struck on turnover up 23
per cent at Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.7m).
On prospects for the second half and beyond, Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman
and managing director, said: 'No forecasts, but we're smiling, aren't we?'
He added that he felt the worst of the recession was past.
Hire services raised operating profits by 61 per cent to Pounds 472,000
(Pounds 293,000), of which acquisitions accounted for Pounds 75,000. The
division's turnover advanced from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 5.07m.
So far, Allen has spent Pounds 713,000 of the Pounds 2m earmarked from the
placing for the hire services side; it bought Centahire's six depots in the
north-east of England at the beginning of the month.
Contracting profits fell to Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 421,000) on turnover of
Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.3m).
Mr Greenhalgh said that the 2 per cent margin achieved was 'fairly
remarkable in the industry', while Mr Ken Fox, deputy managing director,
added that the margin was about one point better than he had expected.
Mr Greenhalgh thought that there would be no recovery in the sector until
late next year.
He said he expected the contracting and hire services divisions to expand by
acquisition and housebuilding organically.
Housebuilding made more at Pounds 822,000 (Pounds 759,000) on turnover up at
Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 6.2m). Completions grew to 144 (105) units.
Some Pounds 2.5m from the placing has been put aside for the landbank, which
is expected to grow to 35 or 36 sites by next November.
The property side made Pounds 83,000 (Pounds 41,000) on turnover of Pounds
395,000 (Pounds 330,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 3.87p (2.85p).
The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.65p on the enlarged capital, and the
board is intending to pay a final of 3.35p for a maintained 5p total.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O links with Swire to invest Pounds 54m
in Chinese container port
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, the UK transport and construction
group, and Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong property and aviation conglomerate,
yesterday joined forces to invest HKDollars 615m (Pounds 54m) in a southern
Chinese container port.
P&amp;O and Swire Pacific said they would each acquire 25 per cent of the Shekou
Container Port from China Merchants, a Hong Kong-based shipping and trading
group, and China Ocean Shipping. From the beginning of next year, P&amp;O will
operate the port.
Shekou port is situated on the west coast of the Shenzhen special economic
zone, just north of Hong Kong, on the Pearl River. It acts as a feeder port
to Hong Kong's deep water container port.
The port is capable of processing 550,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent
units) annually; expansion currently under way will more than double
capacity by the end of 1996. P&amp;O said yesterday that it and China Merchants
would acquire the increased capacity.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O chairman, said yesterday that the investment represented
P&amp;O's first sizeable step into the management and ownership of materials
handling facilities on the Chinese mainland. It is the first in a series of
planned acquisitions in accordance with strategic expansion in Asia, he
said.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire Pacific, said the Shekou facility would
complement Hong Kong's container handling facilities. 'There is no question
that the Pearl River delta is the fastest growing manufacturing area in the
world and that Shekou container terminals is ideally situated to service
this demand,' he said.
China Merchants, which began developing Shekou in 1978, will retain a 32.5
per cent interest in the port, China Ocean Shipping will have a 17.5 per
cent interest, while P&amp;O and Swire will each own 25 per cent.
In April last year, P&amp;O sold China Merchants an 8.1 per cent stake in Modern
Terminals, an operator of Hong Kong's container port, for Pounds 55m. Swire
owns 13 per cent of MTL.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Filofax at Pounds 1.27m as margins rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filofax Group, the personal organiser company, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up from Pounds 950,000 to Pounds 1.27m in the six months to the end
of September.
'Operating profit has increased by 38 per cent and that 38 per cent derives
very simply from an increase in sales and an increase in margins,' said Mr
Robin Field, chief executive.
'It's about providing a useful product to real people,' he added.
Earnings per share dropped to 4p (4.3p) as the company almost exhausted
available tax losses and took a charge this time of Pounds 375,000 on a
'conservative' rate of 30 per cent.
The board declared an increased interim dividend of 0.75p (0.5p). Mr Field
said he had every confidence in a strong performance during Christmas and
beyond.
The company aims to broaden its product range over the next three to five
years. 'Over time as the thing grows, we would expect it to become more
broadly based and to cease to rely on just the one product,' said Mr Field.
Sales rose 34 per cent to Pounds 8.31m (Pounds 6.18m), but the results did
not portend the return of the yuppie. 'We have never sold much to yuppies.
Our ideal customers are busy housewives - female, social, domestic
customers,' Mr Field added.
Gross margins increased reflecting improved purchasing efficiency and the
continued move towards selling directly to retailers.
Filofax spent about Pounds 3m in cash on three acquisitions in the last four
months, including its Swedish and German distributors just before the
September half-year end which together contributed Pounds 375,000 to sales.
The company received Pounds 35,000 (Pounds 56,000) in interest and expects
to have a positive cash balance at the year end.
Filofax also announced a change of brokers from UBS to Hoare Govett. UBS
said it was very disappointed by the move.

<TEXT>
A full order book and improved margins helped James Cropper, the
Cumbria-based paper and board maker, report interim profits almost doubled
at Pounds 1.14m pre-tax, against Pounds 595,000.
There was an added benefit from lower interest rates as finance charges for
the half year ended September 25 fell from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 631,000.
Turnover was Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 20.3m).
Earnings per share were 9p (4.8p); the interim dividend is raised to 1.1p
(0.975p) to reflect the company's confidence that the poor trading
conditions of recent years have abated. Directors stressed, however, that it
should not be taken as an indication of the level for the full year.

in the six months to end-September.
Both Hewetson Floors and Contract Flooring Sales recorded losses for the
period. However, Mr Peter Price, chairman, said all companies made a profit
in September.
Turnover was Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 14.3m). After tax and preference dividends
losses per share were 0.16p, against earnings of 2.09p. The interim dividend
is maintained at 0.5p.

Acquisitions boosted Shani Group, the fashion supplier, to pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.44m for the year to July 31, compared with Pounds 1.96m.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 12m to Pounds 20m, including Pounds 7.98m from
acquisitions. During the year the USM-quoted company acquired the Lampert
and Admyra women's coat and suit businesses. The year end is being changed
to October 31 because of the seasonal nature of the purchases' businesses.
Operating profits from continuing businesses fell to Pounds 1.14m (Pounds
1.43m) but a Pounds 1.05m contribution from the acquisitions brought the
total to Pounds 2.19m.
From earnings per share of 11.3p (9.2p) the total dividend is raised to 5.3p
(4.4p) with a proposed final of 3.5p.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Babcock Pounds 9m in the red and interim
omitted - Outcome hit by Pounds 21m provision for higher than expected costs
at Drax and closures in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Babcock International, the energy contracting, facilities management and
materials handling group, yesterday announced a Pounds 9.2m pre-tax loss for
the six months ended September 30 and confirmed it would pass its interim
dividend.
The loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 16.6m a year earlier, but
was expected following Babcock's announcement on September 9 that it would
make a Pounds 20m pre-tax provision which would produce a first-half
deficit.
The provision emerged at Pounds 21m, and covered higher than expected costs
on Babcock's Pounds 400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation contract at National
Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire, along with closure costs for
Babcock Africa's non-core mining activities.
Losses per share for the half year were 1.77p, compared with 2.02p earnings
last time, when an interim dividend of 1p was paid.
The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 26 1/4 p yesterday.
The company maintained its cautious stance on the final dividend, repeating
that a decision would be made in the light of the outcome for the year as a
whole. Last year's final was 1.1p.
In spite of the latest results, Mr John Parker, Babcock's new chief
executive, said he was 'quite encouraged' by what he had found at the
company after seven weeks in charge.
The former chairman and chief executive of Harland &amp; Wolff joined Babcock on
October 4, along with Mr Nick Salmon, a former GEC Alsthom executive, who is
Babcock's new managing director.
'There are some very good businesses at the core of Babcock,' said Mr
Parker, ' and some of them are world class.'
He said the problems at Drax and in Africa had overshadowed a good
performance elsewhere, but the Drax project was going extremely well, with
the first two of the six sulphur absorber towers due to be handed over next
month.
Babcock said discussions with National Power on the final contract revenue
were expected to last until completion of the contract in spring 1996, but
Mr Parker said: 'I believe National Power is a satisfied customer.'
Babcock's energy division, which includes the Drax contract, saw first-half
profits drop from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 1.2m.
In contrast, the process division, formerly known as the contractors group,
boosted profits from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.5m, and also yesterday
announced Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) of oil production and refinery
development contracts from customers in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
The facilities management division, which includes the management contract
for the Rosyth royal dockyard in Scotland, lifted profits from Pounds 3.2m
to Pounds 4.2m.
Materials handling performed well in spite of difficult markets, said
Babcock. Profits fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.2m, reflecting
rationalisation and closure costs. Babcock Africa profits were virtually
unchanged at Pounds 2.4m.
Babcock noted that the tax charge for the half-year was Pounds 2.6m higher
than normal. While the provisions were expected to attract a full deduction
for tax, in the UK they displace ACT already paid and relieved against
corporation tax liabilities.
COMMENT
Babcock's new management team have their feet under the boardroom table but
are not yet ready to make grand pronouncements - the results of their
strategic review will be revealed at about the middle of next year. In the
meantime caution abounds, a sensible strategy in light of the difficulties
predicting the outcome of contracts such as Drax. The latest results put
Babcock on course for full-year profits of between Pounds 3m-Pounds 6m
pre-tax, slightly lower than some recent forecasts, and the tax implications
of the provisions may even produce a small loss per share for the year. The
final dividend, if it comes, may be small too.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bousted makes Pounds 593,000 at nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boustead, the industrial products and technical services group acquired last
year by Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, yesterday
reported sharply lower operating profits from continuing operations for the
nine months to September 30.
However, after various costs and profits mainly associated with the sale and
closure of businesses, and reduced interest costs of Pounds 193,000 (Pounds
690,000), profits at the pre-tax level improved from Pounds 117,000 to
Pounds 593,000.
The group, which has undergone a substantial restructuring under its new
management, announced at its interim stage in September that it planned to
move its year-end to March 31 in order to conform with Jack Chia-MPH's
accounting year.
Operating profits from continuing operations for the nine-month period fell
from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 73,000 on turnover from continuing businesses of
Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 44.3m). Discontinued and closed operations added Pounds
3.13m (Pounds 16.1m) to turnover but reduced operating profits by Pounds
12,000 (Pounds 992,000.)
Boustead warned in September that its results for the third quarter would
show a downturn because of seasonal factors. However, Mr Geoffrey Hall,
chief executive, said that the sharp fall in European automotive sales had
substantially exacerbated that trend this year through its effect on
Boustead's component and plastic moulding businesses.
Earnings per share of 0.1p compared with previous losses of 0.4p. The
interim dividend is maintained at 0.35p.
Earlier this month Boustead announced plans to sell its 65.4 per cent
holding in Bousteadco, its Singapore-based subsidiary, to Jack Chia-MPH, for
Pounds 12.8m subject to shareholder approval. Following the proposed sale,
Boustead would have net cash balances of about Pounds 10m.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: 'Investor fatigue' affects latest Lloyd's
trust offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just one third of the shares allocated to private investors in the
Angerstein Underwriting Trust, the Lloyd's investment trust, were taken up.
Separately, only 62 per cent of the shares on offer to intermediaries were
taken up in Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust.
The figures highlight the difficulties in attracting investor interest in
such high numbers to take advantage of the introduction of corporate capital
to Lloyd's, the insurance market.
NatWest Markets, which sponsored the Angerstein trust, said that 67.5m of
the 75m shares on offer had been placed with institutional and other
investors. Of the 22.5m shares available to the public, 7.7m were taken up.
The offer was not underwritten, but 67.5m of the shares were placed with
institutions, with a 'clawback' for those which investors took up.
Mr Chris Huggins, a director, said: 'It's always disappointing when you
don't get all the money you wanted. Investors are showing general tiredness
with the new issues market. Relative to other Lloyd's trusts, we think this
is pretty good.'
Abtrust received applications for 4.6m of the 7.5m shares offered to
intermediaries. The full 30m share subscription was placed, with clawback
for that available to intermediaries. It will raise Pounds 28.35m net.
Mr Christopher Holdsworth Hunt, a director of Peel Hunt, the sponsors, said:
'We suffered a bit of investor fatigue. The orange has been squeezed dry.
But in the circumstances we are happy.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hanson Industries agrees sale of Axelson
for Pounds 56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson Industries, the US arm of the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday
confirmed that it had agreed to sell Axelson, which makes equipment for the
oil industry.
The buyer is Wheatley TXT, an oilfield services group, which will pay Pounds
56m, including Pounds 1.8m of long term debt.
The sale is the first in a disposal programme of peripheral businesses on
which Hanson has embarked, expected to raise about Pounds 500m for the
group, which is looking to reduce debt.
Axelson was acquired in 1984 when Hanson bought US Industries. In the year
to end-September Axelson made an operating profit of Pounds 6m on sales of
Pounds 40m. Axelson's net book value is Pounds 14m, and Pounds 6m of
goodwill was written off when it was acquired, so there will be an
exceptional gain on the sale of about Pounds 35m.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fisons takes action after improper sales
practices are shown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment group, yesterday said it had
dismissed one employee and disciplined another following the discovery of
improper sales practices.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said an internal investigation had shown
four examples of impropriety involving doctors who had been offered
inducements to prescribe the company's products.
'The most serious allegation was the one of bribery,' said Mr Scroggs. 'Two
doctors said they were offered money, while another said he was offered a
book token for nursing staff books. This is clearly not acceptable.'
The company had conducted an inquiry focused initially on the seven-strong
West Midlands sales force, but it had been extended throughout the UK
organisation, said Mr Scroggs.
'It's difficult to prove a negative, but we are as confident as we can be
that we have not had widespread bribery.'
Mr Rick Tiller, the West Midlands area sales manager who had been suspended,
had been reinstated. He was not implicated in offering financial inducements
to doctors, Mr Scroggs added.
Press reports earlier this month of excessive hospitality to doctors, were
unfounded, said Mr Scroggs. Any hospitality had been within the guidelines
set by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
Suggestions there had been a 'slush-fund' to entertain doctors were also
erroneous. Promotional funds were available for local meetings, but these
were not against the ABPI code.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho restates profits to meet new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the trading conglomerate, has revised upwards its 1992 pre-tax
profits by Pounds 34m to Pounds 114m because of changes in UK accountancy
rules.
The group said its results to September 30, to be announced in January,
would encompass the changes and it was restating its 1992 figures on the
same basis.
The changes involve the new FRS3 reporting standard and the Urgent Issues
Task Force report on accounting for operations in hyper-inflationary
economies. Under FRS3, companies must distinguish between continuing and
discontinued operations.
The restated figures show that the group's operating profit of Pounds 159m
in 1992 comprised a profit of Pounds 116m from continuing operations and
Pounds 43m from discontinued operations.
The pre-tax profit from continuing operations was Pounds 39m and Pounds 75m
from discontinued operations. The net profit from discontinued operations,
after tax and minority interests, was Pounds 60m, while continuing
operations made a net loss of of Pounds 18m.
Lonrho's disposals during 1992 included Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight
forwarder; George Outram, the Glasgow-based newspaper group; and Scottish
and Universal Newspapers.
Companies are no longer permitted to release surpluses on the revaluation of
assets to profits. As a result, the net extraordinary gain of Pounds 78m
from disposals is reduced to Pounds 41m, but is taken above the line,
boosting pre-tax profits.
Under UITF9, which deals with profits in hyper-inflationary economies,
Lonrho's operations in those countries have been adjusted to reflect current
price levels in the country concerned.
The effect of this change is to reduce 1992 pre-tax profit by Pounds 8m and
profit after tax and minority interests by Pounds 5m. In addition, Lonrho
has adopted a more prudent policy of using the closing year-end exchange
rates for all areas, rather than weighted average exchange rates. Pre-tax
profits are reduced by Pounds 10m and profit after tax and minority
interests by Pounds 7m.
Lonrho also changed its treatment of platinum group metal stocks. This
increases 1992's pre-tax profits by Pounds 11m, and profit after tax and
minority interests by Pounds 8m, but there would be no material effect on
1993 profits.

Forte has reached agreement in principle to sell its 50 per cent stake in
Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico, which holds the remaining half-share,
writes Michael Skapinker.
The company said the sale would be completed by the end of this year. It
provided no financial details, but the price paid for Forte's stake is
believed to be about Pounds 40m.
Forte bought the stake in 1987. The joint venture is responsible for 84
company-owned restaurants and 220 franchised outlets in the UK.

<TEXT>
An extraordinary general meeting of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, was
adjourned yesterday, without a word from a shareholder, to be resumed after
next Monday's annual meeting, writes Maggie Urry.
The meeting was told by Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, that he would make a
statement next week about the company's position. He said it would be unfair
on absent shareholders to say anything before then. The adjournment motion
was passed on a show of hands.
The recently-formed shareholder action group was not represented. It is
plans to advocate voting against the acceptance of the annual report.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Novel cash exercise at Butte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a cash-raising exercise almost certainly unique to the UK, Butte Mining
has sold to a group of investors the rights to some of the proceeds it hopes
to collect from a lawsuit in the US.
Butte is seeking damages of more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 201m) and asks
that these be tripled to about Dollars 1bn under US anti-racketeering
legislation.
The UK group said it had raised Pounds 1.3m gross by issuing 1.9m
zero-coupon, three-year loan notes with additional rights.
These rights effectively give the investors, who include clients of
Derivative Securities, 38 per cent of the first Dollars 10m of any proceeds
from the lawsuit, 12 per cent of proceeds between Dollars 10m and Dollars
20m and 5 per cent of proceeds exceeding Dollars 20m.
Butte has previously revealed that Deutsch &amp; Frey, its US contingent-fee
attorney, is entitled to one third of the gross proceeds from the
litigation. The management team is entitled to a further 5.25 per cent but
of that 4.5 per cent would be paid only on proceeds above Pounds 15m.
Money from the loan note issue will be used to fund the running costs of the
group until the lawsuit comes to trial. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said
it would give Butte the bare minimum a public company required to keep going
for another 2 1/2 years. 'The defendants won't be able to starve us out
now.'
Butte has sold most of its assets and has only two full-time and three
part-time employees. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said he and Mr Graham Andrews, finance
director, who are both working half-time for half pay, 'have kept the
company going so far on air and credit cards.'
The loan notes have a nominal value of Pounds 1 each and have been issued at
67 1/2 p to give holders the equivalent of a 14 per cent gross compound
return at the end of three years. They are also redeemable at any time at
the company's option at a 14 per cent discount to the nominal value.
Security is a first floating charge on Butte's assets.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Electronics side behind 53% rise to Pounds
20.4m at Diploma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Diploma dipped 3p to 563p as the electronics, building components
and special steels group announced a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 20.4m in the year to September 30. This time
last year the shares stood at 344p.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, ascribed the group's general health to the
concept of service. 'People talk of service, but don't understand it.
However, if you do, you get better margins. From better margins, you get
good cash flow, which feeds the cash position.' Cash at the end of the year
had risen Pounds 2m to Pounds 28m, and adjusted profit as a percentage
return on sales was 13.5 (12.6) per cent.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 158m (Pounds 132.3m).
As previously, the main engine of growth was the electronics division, where
profits rose to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 8.4m) on turnover up at Pounds 104.1m
(Pounds 77.8m). Macro, the active components distributor, and - more
modestly - Nortronic, in passive components, shone. Both increased market
share and Macro, with the administration of Anzac now absorbed, lifted
turnover by 35 per cent and profits by 50 per cent.
Anachem, bought 18 months ago for Pounds 7.7m, lifted turnover and profits.
Mr Thomas said he was interested in building the pharmaceutical side into
the group's fourth arm. Customers' capital expenditure had fallen on both
sides of the Atlantic, but new products and exchange rates helped recovery
over the 12 months.
The best performer in the building products side was again IG Lintels,
though this also started slowly. Mr Thomas said Diploma did not want to
'wait for better times. We can make things better by investment'. The
division's profits were Pounds 7m (Pounds 6m) on turnover of Pounds 42.8m
(Pounds 43.4m).
Special steels lifted profits to Pounds 1m (Pounds 700,000) on turnover
static at Pounds 11.1m, again adversely affected by the oil services sector.
Cost reductions helped here.
Lower rates shrank interest receivable to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 2.1m) and
earnings per share advanced to 24.9p (19.4p). The final dividend is lifted
to 8.5p (7p) for a total up 23 per cent at 12p (9.75p).

Development Securities, formerly Clayform Properties, said yesterday it had

The property investor and developer which has shoe retailing interests, said
it had noted recent press comment about an alleged DTI investigation into
dealings in Clayform shares.
It said it welcomed any such investigation, but was not aware that either
the company or its directors were subject to one. Each director had
confirmed to the company that neither he nor those connected with him had
dealt on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information in the shares
on or about June 11 1993.
However, it said that as a result of the general uncertainty concerning the
above matter, the proposed share issue would be postponed 'for the immediate

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hilclare cash call as deficit is trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilclare, the USM-traded manufacturer of lighting and security products,
yesterday called for Pounds 315,000 net via a rights issue and also reported
reduced losses for the half year to end-September.
The cash call is through the issue of up to 1.07m new shares on a 2-for-7
basis at 36p apiece. The existing shares closed 5p lower at 43p.
The issue is underwritten by Wise Speke. Proceeds will be used to provide
working capital and to reduce debt.
The deficit for the opening half was cut from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 45,000
pre-tax. Turnover totalled Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.31m). Losses per share
emerged at 0.9p (1.7p).
Directors said the loss reflected 'normal seasonal' influences in the core
lighting business and continuing difficult trading conditions.
However, the company was now benefiting from the 'seasonal upturn' in demand
for lighting products which was expected to continue through the winter
months.
Directors expected a 'satisfactory' full year performance and said they
intended to declare a dividend of not less than 0.5p (same) on the enlarged
capital.

<TEXT>
Shares in Alexander Proudfoot yesterday rose 4p to 63p after the board made
a statement following the recent decline in the management consultancy's
share price, which last week fell over 22 per cent to 59p.
Directors said they had noted the recent fall in the shares, but knew of no
reason for the decline, save that volumes of dealings in the shares had
traditionally been limited and some sales had recently taken place.
In September, the shares fell sharply after profits from continuing
operations tumbled to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 13.2m) in the first half of 1993.
Proudfoot said yesterday that this position had stabilised and trading had
been steady during the second half.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Profit warning cuts Holliday share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holliday Chemical Holdings, maker of industrial dyes and speciality
chemicals, which came to the stock market in March, yesterday issued a
profits warning that triggered a 23 per cent drop in its share price.
The price closed 51p down at 174p which is below the 195p flotation price.
Strong price competition meant Holliday Chemical's Spanish subsidiary would
make only a marginal contribution to profits after financing charges in
1993.
On a pro-forma basis, the group would only make a similar profit to that
achieved in 1992, directors said.
Mr Michael Peagram, the founder, chairman and largest shareholder with a 20
per cent stake in the company after the float, was named in September as
Venturer of the Year, an award sponsored by Cartier, The British Venture
Capital Association and the Financial Times.
Analysts immediately cut forecasts of full year profits from Pounds 14.5m to
Pounds 12.5m, and for 1994 from Pounds 18m to Pounds 15.5m. Earnings per
share estimates fell respectively to 11.2p and 13.6p, putting the shares on
a 10 per cent prospective discount to the market.
Mr Peagram said the problem was clearly identifiable and contained within
the Spanish subsidiary, which is responsible for 25 per cent of group sales.
Holliday would have been able to handle small reductions in prices through
cost saving measures.
But average dollar selling prices in the third quarter for generic
pharmaceutical and veterinary products had fallen by 10 per cent because of
competition from India and China.
While Holliday had noted at the time of interim statement in August that the
Spanish subsidiary's performance was disappointing, the extent of the
problems had not been visible at the time, Mr Peagram said.
Some analysts said the market reaction was overdone. 'It is still a well
managed company,' said Mr Lucas Herrmann of James Capel. 'The reaction is
harsh but not surprising; Holliday does not have a track record (as a quoted
company) to fall back on.'
Mr Peagram defended the company's award. 'We got the Venturer of the Year
award for our past record of which there is no doubt,' he said. 'There is
now a tough business climate out there.'
Holliday was still looking at growing with the help of some acquisitions Mr
Peagram said. 'We have got to re-establish the credibility bit first and
make people happy to be along with us.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Emap 12% ahead at Pounds 16.6m - Gradual
improvement in advertising revenues apparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday gave its most
optimistic assessment of the state of the advertising market for three years
as it announced a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
16.6m.
Mr Graham Ross Russell, the chairman, warned that the immediate outlook for
profits growth would depend on the strength and timing of the general
economic recovery.
He added, however: 'We are beginning to see for the first time in three
years a gradual improvement in advertising revenue in some areas.'
Newspaper situations vacant advertising, for example, was up and this month
actually jumped by 25 per cent to 30 per cent while advertising in business
titles covering broadcasting and the media was forging ahead.
Other business titles, particularly those linked to the construction
industry, were showing no such signs of growth.
The 12 per cent growth in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 2 and
the qualified optimism about the future of the advertising market helped
boost Emap's share price by 10p to 355p.
Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, last
night said she was looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 46m for the full
year giving earnings of 17.8p per share.
Emap's figures include the cost of investment in launches of Pounds 4.9m
this time compared with Pounds 2.1m in the same period last year.
Earnings per share, adjusted for non-operating exceptional items, rose 13
per cent from 5.4p to 6.1p. The interim dividend is increased by 8 per cent
to 2.25p.
Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, conceded yesterday that all of Emap's
titles would feel the pressure if the government decided to put VAT at a
rate of 17.5 per cent on all publications. However, because the 'vast
majority' of the group's titles were market leaders 'in relation to our
competitors I have no fears'.
The most dramatic change came in business publishing where operating profit
rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.8m on turnover up 42 per cent. More than half
the improvement came from the acquisitions of Thomson business titles which
helped to improve margins from 4.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
Operating profits of consumer magazines rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 11.1m,
newspaper profits were virtually constant at Pounds 4.6m while commercial
radio was up 33 per cent to Pounds 400,000.
First half losses in Emap's exhibitions business increased from Pounds
800,000 to Pounds 1.6m but the company remains committed to the exhibitions
business although closer links between exhibitions and business magazines
are expected in future.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Guardian falls to Pounds 11.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half year pre-tax profits at the Guardian Media Group, formerly The Guardian
and Manchester Evening News, fell from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 11.5m in the
six months to October 2, with results depressed by the acquisition of The
Observer.
The privately-held company improved sales to Pounds 121.6m (Pounds 94.2m).
Guardian Media said the acquisition of the UK Sunday title had had a
'temporary deleterious' effect on trading results.
The company, which was renamed to reflect its 'wide media interests', said
it had made good progress in merging The Observer's commercial and pre-press
production operations with those of the Guardian.
This had improved costs and revenues and the full benefit would begin to
emerge by the end of the financial year.
'Trading generally has been satisfactory given the prevailing economic
background and there are now indications that some improvement may be seen
in the second half of the year.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Failure of one component blamed for SE breakdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of a year-old component in the London Stock Exchange's Seaq
automated price display system was largely responsible for a four-hour
breakdown on Friday, the longest such glitch in the exchange's history.
The stock exchange has declined to explain publicly the cause of the
failure, saying it was a matter between itself and its clients. But
yesterday, marketmakers and information providers, which carry stock
exchange prices, expressed frustration at the lack of an explanation.
Former stock exchange officials, familiar with the workings of the ageing
Seaq system, said the failure of a chipcom hub in the exchange's ethernet
network was to blame. The network, an ingredient in most integrated computer
systems, helps parts to communicate with each other.
'The ethernet is like a plumbing system,' said one former employee. 'It's
what connects the parts to each other. In order to work they all have to
talk to each other and in the right sequence.'
The chipcom hub helps the sequencing of information. When the component
failed, it was left to Andersen Consulting, who are responsible for
servicing the Seaq network, to straighten out the problem. The former
officials said that because Andersen Consulting is relatively new to the
system - it was appointed in April 1992 and is advising the exchange on how
to replace it - it was not able to correct the fault quickly. Andersen was
not available for comment yesterday.
Since Seaq was installed in 1986, most of the technical staff responsible
for its creation have left the exchange. However, despite its age and
difficulties in coping with very active trading, it has proved resilient and
marketmakers have had few complaints about its effectiveness.
However, they expressed concern about last week's breakdown. 'It has a
terrible effect on our business because clients have become used to
identifying bargains on a screen,' said the head of marketmaking at one
firm. He estimated the firm's business fell by a third on Friday.
Previous breaks in service at other leading exchanges around the world have
been the result of either an external disaster - such as a water main break
in Chicago - or the exchange's inability to cope with volatile or highly
active markets.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Water chief departs abruptly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH West Water yesterday surprised the market with the abrupt departure of
its chief executive, Mr Bob Thian.
The privatised water utility said Mr Thian had left the company over a
'difference in management styles' between the chief executive and the board.
The shares fell 12p to 527p.
It is widely believed that the relationship between Mr Thian and the
recently appointed chairman Sir Desmond Pitcher was particularly strained.
Sir Desmond is described as a hands-on manager who likes to take control.
This is believed to have caused some friction with the equally hands-on Mr
Thian.
Associates who had been in close contact with the two men in recent weeks
said it was obvious that the relationship was under considerable pressure.
Mr Thian's aggressive management style is also believed to have alienated a
number of the company's non-executives. Matters came to a head on Friday. Mr
Thian - who had only on Thursday been planning publicity meetings this week
in advance of the interim results on December 9 - left suddenly after a
meeting with Sir Desmond.
Mr Thian, who joined North West in January 1990, was the architect of the
utility's international water and waste water business. The group has this
year won more international water and waste water contracts than any other
UK utility.
Since privatisation North West has spent Pounds 160m in building an
environmental engineering division, and a process equipment and
instrumentation business based in the US.
It is likely that Mr Thian's pay-off will be substantial. He was on a
three-year rolling contract, with annual remuneration of Pounds 284,000. He
also had options on 235,500 shares.
Sir Desmond will assume Mr Thian's responsibilities until a replacement is
announced. Speculation has centred on Mr Derek Green, managing director of
the core utility operation, as a possible candidate. The finance director,
Mr Bob Ferguson, will take control of the international and non-regulated
businesses.
The company reassured investors that the interim profits would be in line
with expectations. Analysts are forecasting about Pounds 135m pre-tax,
against Pounds 131m, and a dividend rise of 7.3 per cent to 7.65p.

FT  23 NOV 93 / KLM falls on rights issue talk

Shares in KLM Royal Dutch Airlines fell heavily yesterday in response to
prospects for a rights issue following the collapse of the Alcazar merger
talks.
KLM, whose talks with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and
Austrian Airlines ended on Sunday, said it had no plans to pursue another
European partnership.
It also said it would be looking at a share issue, in which it could count
on the participation of the Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent. Mr
Pieter Bouw, chairman, said: 'When the time is ripe, we will go to the
market.'
The talks broke down after KLM insisted the new European carrier should
co-operate with the Dutch carrier's US partner, Northwest Airlines. The
other three preferred Swissair's US partner, Delta Airlines.
KLM's shares fell by 8 per cent yesterday to close at Fl 37.20.
Dutch unions have suggested KLM could seek to raise Fl 1bn (Pounds 358m).
Analysts believe the issue would be closer to Fl 500m. KLM's current market
value is just over Fl 1.9bn.
SAS said yesterday it was likely to deepen co-operation with Swissair and
Austrian Airlines. The airline, which incurred a nine-month loss of
SKr11.3bn (Pounds 941m), said it would cut costs by up to SKr2.5bn,
including shutting 12 routes and selling 17 aircraft, to get back to profit
in 1995.
One way forward would be to extend the European Quality Alliance established
four years ago with Swissair and Austrian Airlines which covers co-operation
on services to eastern Europe, Africa and South America.
SAS must also seek a chief executive. Mr Jan Carlzon, chief executive for 12
years, stepped aside in September and will not return to SAS now that
Alcazar, behind which he was a driving force, has failed. His successor, Mr
Jan Reinas, was named only as a stop-gap until Alcazar was completed. He
will become president of Norsk Skog, the Norwegian forestry group, in April.
Moody's has put SAS under review for possible downgrade, affecting Dollars
1.2bn of long-term debt currently rated A2.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Blenheim revamps management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blenheim Group, the acquisitive international exhibition organiser which has
seen its share price drop by more than 40 per cent this year, yesterday
announced a management reshuffle.
Mr Philip Soar is stepping aside from his post as chief executive to become
director of planning and strategy. Mr Staffan Svenby, 49, a Swede who joined
the UK group in 1991, has been appointed managing director.
Blenheim, once a highly rated stock, suffered a blow to its credibility in
September after BZW, joint broker with Credit Lyonnais Laing, cut its profit
forecast for the second time in three months.
There was irritation in the City that the reduced profits outlook emerged so
soon after a convertible share issue in June, in which Blenheim raised
Pounds 75.8m to fund acquisitions.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman and founder of Blenheim, denied speculation by
some analysts that Mr Soar was being blamed for the group's derating. Mr
Buch said: 'If anyone was going to carry the can, they would have been
sacked.'
He said Mr Svenby was a hands-on manager and would pursue the group's policy
of trying to get closer to the needs of consumers.
Mr Svenby joined the group when Blenheim acquired his company, Sydexpo, one
of Sweden's few independent exhibition companies. He was appointed to
Blenheim's main board in February and earlier this year became chairman of
the company's executive committee.
Mr Soar, who joined Blenheim as managing director in 1990, is credited with
improving computer systems and management controls at the group, which had
expanded rapidly through acquisitions mainly in the France and the US. He is
to concentrate on developing medium and long-term strategies, especially in
information provision, new technologies and marketing.
Mr Buch was keen to dispel City concerns that Blenheim might be entering
business publishing in a big way. The chairman said it would limit itself to
providing publications for exhibition users.
Mr Ulrich Kromer has also resigned as an executive director, following the
merger of Blenheim's Swiss interests with Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch
publishing group.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Banks start to scramble for safe borrowers: John Gapper
finds that competition is hotting up in the corporate lending arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is history repeating itself? After three years spent recovering from the
disasters of the late 1980s, European banks are displaying signs of
returning to the past. The strongest evidence has emerged in lending to
large companies, where competition is becoming more fierce.
One example came earlier this month when an Dollars 800m loan to Pechiney,
the state-controlled French aluminium group, was heavily over-subscribed by
banks wanting to join syndicates. Large creditworthy companies - those
perceived as single A or above - are being offered loans at rates well below
those prevailing two years ago.
The slipping of margins has evoked memories of the late 1980s, when a
lending push by Japanese and other foreign banks led to intense competition.
Pressure eased in late 1990 after a wave of corporate failures shocked
banks. Some withdrew, margins were pushed up and loan covenants tightened.
But lending competition has now resurfaced. While banks could get margins of
more than 50 basis points (half a percentage point) above the London
inter-bank offered rate (Libor) a year ago, investment grade companies are
now seeking lending in the mid-30s above Libor, and even lower.
Mr Hugh Paton, head of credit marketing and execution for JP Morgan in
Europe, says there has been a 'pronounced contraction in spreads' for high
quality companies. Mr Stanley Hurn, Midland Bank's head of loan syndication,
says the margin for investment grade companies this year has been the
upper-30s over Libor, but 'the benchmark is being challenged. Banks are out
there wanting to do business.'
There are a number of reasons for the narrowing of margins. The first is
that loan demand remains weak - relatively few well rated companies want to
borrow. Activity has been stronger in the commercial paper and medium-term
bond markets as old debt has been restructured.
The potential supply of loans has also increased. British banks have noticed
the re-emergence of some foreign banks which pulled back from London at the
end of the last decade. European banks have also become more active.
In addition, most banks have more lending capacity. The capital of US banks
has been considerably strengthened by a favourable yield curve, and European
banks have started to rebuild the capital weakened by loan losses in the
1980s.
The hunger for loan assets is increased by the fact that many fixed-term
loans from the late 1980s are being repaid. 'Many banks whose balance sheets
expanded in the 1980s are now seeing a big run-off, and they are left with
holes in their books they want to fill,' says Mr Paton.
This also means banks are feeling stronger because the yield on their
portfolios has risen. 'A substantial proportion of loans churn every year
and banks have seen a significant pick-up in yields,' says Mr Peter Newman,
managing director of corporate banking at National Westminster Bank.
The rekindling of competition has shown itself in narrowing margins, in the
way loans are structured and in the terms of loan covenants, such as the
ratio of interest payments to a corporation's income.
Mr Neil Harland, managing director of corporate banking at Barclays, says an
example of more favourable loan structures is that banks are again becoming
willing to lend to holding companies, rather than having loans directly
secured on the operating subsidiaries which produce the income to meet
interest payments.
Covenants which were tightened considerably after the defaults of the 1980s
are also starting to loosen. Banks say that single A companies are chafing
at the tough restrictions when facilities come up for renewal, and insisting
on re-negotiation.
All these trends seem to undermine banks' claims that they have learned
their lessons and are no longer willing to compete for lending which does
not provide high enough returns to cover risk. However, the implications are
not as clear as they appear.
An important aspect of lending to large investment-grade companies is that
it is one of the least risky activities. Banks say the strong competition
for such borrowers reflects a new aversion to high-yield, high-risk lending.
Mr David Harrison, Lloyds Bank's senior general manager for corporate
banking, says that margins have only narrowed for the lowest-risk loans. 'As
soon as you get below the As, you find people are much more cautious about
risk. At that point the pressure on margin is secondary.'
He believes this emphasis on low-risk lending shows that banks are not
slipping back into ill-calculated competition. 'I do not think it is a
dangerous scene. I have heard people say 'here we go again' but I do not
subscribe to that view.'
Nonetheless, the margins on loans to highly rated companies are starting to
approach the point where some bankers question whether they cover the cost
of capital. That implies that banks would be wise to exercise caution if
margins slip further, no matter how assiduously they are concentrating on
quality borrowers.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Levitt pleads guilty to one charge of fraudulent trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Levitt, the former chairman of the Levitt Group, the collapsed
financial services company, unexpectedly altered his plea yesterday and
admitted he was guilty of fraud.
His admission - to a single charge of fraudulent trading - came eight days
into his Old Bailey trial throughout which Mr Levitt had maintained his
innocence. Yesterday's admission followed four days of legal argument in the
absence of the jury.
It is not expected that Mr Levitt will be sentenced until later this week.
He was released on bail until today. He made no comment as he left the court
with his wife Diana.
His three co-defendants, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Robert Price and Mr Alan McNamara,
all former Levitt Group directors, still face a similar charge of fraudulent
trading. However, Mr David Cocks QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, told the
court that following Mr Levitt's plea, the three men, who have also pleaded
not guilty to the charge, may 'wish to consider their positions'.
At the start of the trial, the prosecution had alleged that Mr Levitt had
been guilty of fraudulent trading in three respects in a failed attempt to
keep his ailing company afloat.
The SFO claimed that Mr Levitt had illegally injected Pounds 21m of funds
into his company, produced false accounts to overstate its profits and
fraudulently misled Fimbra, the regulators for independent financial
advisers.
Yesterday, the jury were recalled to hear Mr Levitt plead guilty to the
third particular of the charge - the fraudulent misleading of Fimbra. The
jury of six men and six women were then directed by the judge to bring in a
guilty verdict against him.
The part of the charge admitted by Mr Levitt alleged that he showed Fimbra
accounts, invoices, letters and minutes of a Levitt Group board meeting that
were false, misleading and deceptive. He had done this in an attempt to show
that fees of almost Pounds 21m had been received by the group as a result of
his personal advisory work.
Described by the prosecution as 'a past master as a salesman', Mr Levitt
built up his company from small beginnings in the 1970s to a successful
concern recording profits of Pounds 8m in 1988.
However, by 1989, the prosecution claimed, it was in desperate financial
trouble and heading for collapse. Between January 1989 and June 1990, the
group incurred losses of Pounds 13m.
In the 18 months before its collapse in December 1990 with debts of Pounds
34m, it was 'riddled with fraud, forgery, deception and downright
dishonesty', Mr Cocks had argued. Mr Levitt had been the 'architect' of the
fraud, he had said.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Delors and Clarke in row over work-sharing: Brussels' chief
appeals for open-minded approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, last night clashed
with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, over the principle of work-sharing
to combat the unemployment crisis in Europe.
Mr Delors accused Mr Clarke of being 'unconstructive' and rejected the
chancellor's charge that a short working week and job-sharing would lead to
even higher unemployment.
At a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, Mr Delors appealed for an
open-minded debate on how to save jobs and create new employment. He said
there were 'no miracle cures' but made clear he would resist efforts to
water down his proposals ahead of next month's European summit in Brussels.
Although the majority of finance ministers agreed broadly with the
Commission's analysis of why there are more than 17m people out of work in
the EU, they voiced doubts about some of Mr Delors' prescriptions. These
included reductions in employment taxes, work-sharing and a general desire
for lower short-term interest rates.
Mr Clarke delivered an outspoken attack on work-sharing as a means of saving
jobs. This provoked an angry retort from Mr Delors who said: 'There is
always a question of winners and losers (for him). Why this obsession of Mr
Clarke?'
The row between Mr Delors and Mr Clarke erupted after Mr Delors submitted a
25-page summary of the white paper on competitiveness, growth and
employment. The paper is expected to be the centrepiece of the December
10-11 meeting of heads of governments.
German officials attacked the explicit notion that a 2-3 per cent cut in
interest rates would speed a recovery on the grounds that it could be seen
as an attack on the Bundesbank.
Mr Clarke said 10 out of 12 ministers had raised objections to shorter
working hours. These ideas were more likely to increase unemployment rather
than save jobs, because they presumed there was a need to ration employment
in Europe.
After hearing Mr Clarke's prediction that the white paper would require
substantial revision ahead of the summit, Mr Delors accused Mr Clarke of
ignoring work-sharing developments on the Continent. The French government
was discussing similar measures with trade unions and so was Volkswagen in
Germany.
A leaked copy of the employment section of the white paper stresses the
central importance of work-sharing in combating high unemployment and holds
up the Netherlands as a model.
It cites Commission figures on the apparent link between reducing hours and
creating jobs. Between 1983 and 1991 the average hours worked per person per
week in the EU fell by 3 per cent - just over one hour. But in the
Netherlands the reduction was 13 per cent, an average of five hours per
week. The Netherlands experienced a rise in employment of 30 per cent, 'more
than half of which seems to be attributable to the fall' in working time.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Threat of legal action as BSI fails to fly kitemark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The British Standards Instit-ution appears to have been caught in that
embarrassing situation: do as we say, not as we do.
The BSI, which co-ordinates the writing of standards for UK industry, is
being threatened with legal action for failing to employ subcontractors with
the BS 5750 kitemark for the painting of its new London headquarters.
Under BS 5750, a standard devised by the BSI itself, companies are certified
if their management systems meet certain quality and efficiency standards.
S. Lucas, one of two spray and painting contractors in the London area with
the kitemark, claims neither of them was invited to tender for the contract,
worth more than Pounds 100,000. It went to an unaccredited company.
The controversy is small beer compared to that raging between BSI and its
members over BSI ambitions to increase its powers and the fees of its
directors. BSI lost its chief executive earlier this year and faces a
government review of its activities.
But the refurbishment of an undistinguished former IBM office block in
Chiswick, west London, could land BSI in the courts. Under its royal
charter, the BSI has a duty to 'prepare and promote the general adoption of
British standards'. S. Lucas is threatening to seek judicial review of BSI's
'outrageous' behaviour unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming.
BSI said yesterday that 75 per cent of the subcontractors were BS 5750
accredited. Mr Ram Mylvaganam, BSI marketing director, said: 'Since only 1
per cent of UK companies have BS 5750 we can be accused of being too
favourable to accredited companies, not the opposite.'
John Laing, main contractor for the renovation, said it had 'endeavoured' to
use BSI-accredited companies, and 'bel-ieved that BSI was aware' it was not
doing so for the painting.

A number of local factors depressed equity markets yesterday: UK Budget
worries, Italian elections, disappointing German money supply data and a
crop of poor statistics from Japan. But the unifying feature remains the
fear that rising bond yields will staunch the flow of US money. It is
curious that equity markets should be so worried at the impact on interest
rates of the still quite modest US growth prospects. On this perverse logic,
they should be hoping for a fresh US downturn next year. Could the resulting
liquidity flow really be the only way to sustain international markets at
present bloated levels?

The strong rise in advertising revenue at Emap's consumer magazines and
regional newspapers in the past few months must have had creative types
twanging their red braces with excitement. It would be tempting to believe
good times are back for advertising agencies and media stocks. Emap's
extravagant share rating certainly suggests as much.
But Emap's experience is likely to prove particular rather than general,
reflecting the focused readership its publications offer advertisers.
Whether Emap can sustain growth in circulation revenue by raising cover
prices above the rate of inflation must remain its chief concern, however.
Even if the chancellor refrains from slapping VAT on printed matter next
week, it seems likely it will follow eventually. That will forestall further
price rises. Yet Emap has proved to be a canny operator. Further
acquisitions and launches should keep it ticking along. The media sector as
a whole is unlikely to prove as perky.

FT  23 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Blenheim Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blenheim Group has picked up a healthy dose of sceptical comment in recent
years. With the market gun-shy about 1980s growth stocks it is not hard to
see why. Blenheim expanded rapidly by acquisition and then wanted to
'smooth' earnings by bringing forward profits on exhibitions yet to be held.
It switched its year-end to give a 16-month reporting period, which made
year-on-year comparisons difficult. It also raised Pounds 76m in convertible
preference shares only to see profits forecasts downgraded three months
later.
Such things happen, and much of the uncertainty is reflected in the
company's share rating. Yet none of it will comfort those of a nervous
disposition. The news that its chief executive, Mr Philip Soar, is standing
aside to become director of planning and strategy is thus just one more
thing to worry about. Staging exhibitions is an attractive business, which
can generate substantial profits, but any idea that it is immune to the
economic cycle is far-fetched. Blenheim's reliance on France and Germany
means that the company faces tough markets for the next couple of years.
One of the most alluring features of the exhibition business is its strong
cash flows, with customers paying up to a year before costs are incurred.
The continuing cash outflow from Blenheim, albeit arising partly from
acquisitions, will make the downturn that much more painful.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Miserable nine-month results from BASF and the prospect of another dividend
cut are a reminder of how bad conditions in European chemicals have become.
Since BASF went into the downturn with more than half its production in
Germany and a strong bias towards petrochemicals - where the erosion of
prices is worst - the cycle has been especially cruel. A meeting of European
petrochemicals producers this week could help stop the rot.
An agreement to close ethylene capacity would help stabilise prices in
plastics. The failure of similar efforts in steel is a reminder of the
formidable political obstacles to closure, especially where state-owned
producers are involved. One can only hope that the risks of not reaching an
agreement are, in this case, enough to force a decision. With BASF's new
Antwerp cracker poised to start production, there must be a risk of another
downward lurch in prices unless action is taken.
If prices can be stabilised, cost-cutting should contribute to a modest
bounce in profits next year. The stock market may by then have the scent of
recovery. BASF outperformed the German market by 30 per cent during 1987,
two years ahead of its last peak in profits. Even allowing for capacity
reductions in Europe and good news on growth, though, the market's
willingness to anticipate good news could be sorely tested. It is difficult
to see the next profits peak coming until well into the second half of the
decade.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho lifted the veil a little further yesterday, though one suspects its
restated accounts were motivated more by the obligation to comply with new
accounting standards than crusading zeal on the part of its audit committee.
At one level the changes are welcome. It is surely right to take into
account the high inflation and depreciating currencies of developing
countries where Lonrho trades. The pre-tax hit of Pounds 18m, though, also
raises the question of how far profits have been flattered in previous
years. Somewhat more unsettling is the restatement of profits under FRS3.
Net extraordinary items of Pounds 78m from disposals under the old system
shrink to only Pounds 41m when they are moved above the line as exceptionals
under FRS3. The difference is accounted for by the change whereby profits on
disposals are no longer taken against cost but against the value at which
the assets are carried in the books. There is an indication here of the
extent to which assets have been revalued in the past to shore up the
company's balance sheet.
This does not matter insofar as disposals have always been at a profit to
book, though Lonrho conveniently wrote down the intangible value of its
Scottish newspaper titles around the time they were sold. The precise
gearing figure also matters less than ability to raise cash to service debt.
The restated net loss from continuing operations of Pounds 18m after
minorities is hardly encouraging in this respect. Mr Dieter Bock will have
to look hard for the resources to take his revolution forward.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Threat of legal action as BSI fails to fly kitemark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Standards Institution appears to have been caught in that
embarrassing situation: do as we say, not as we do.
The BSI, which co-ordinates the writing of standards for UK industry, is
being threatened with legal action for failing to employ subcontractors with
the BS 5750 kitemark for the painting of its new London headquarters.
Under BS 5750, a standard devised by the BSI itself, companies are certified
if their management systems meet certain quality and efficiency standards.
S. Lucas, one of two spray and painting contractors in the London area with
the kitemark, claims neither of them was invited to tender for the contract,
worth more than Pounds 100,000. It went to an unaccredited company.
The controversy is small beer compared to that raging between BSI and its
members over BSI ambitions to increase its powers and the fees of its
directors. BSI lost its chief executive earlier this year and faces a
government review of its activities.
But the refurbishment of an undistinguished former IBM office block in
Chiswick, west London, could land BSI in the courts. Under its royal
charter, the BSI has a duty to 'prepare and promote the general adoption of
British standards'. S. Lucas is threatening to seek judicial review of BSI's
'outrageous' behaviour unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming.
BSI said yesterday that 75 per cent of the subcontractors engaged in the
refurbishment were BS 5750 accredited. Mr Ram Mylvaganam, BSI marketing
director, said: 'since only 1 per cent of UK companies have BS 5750 we can
be accused of being too favourable to accredited companies, not the
opposite'.
John Laing, main contractor for the renovation, said it had 'endeavoured' to
use BSI-accredited companies, and 'believed that BSI was aware' that it was
not doing so for the painting.
Laing is itself BSI-accredited, but said it knew of only one London-based
company with the kitemark at the time of tender. It was not invited to
tender.
The BSI standard has been adopted by 20,000 UK companies, but few painters
and decorators appear to be among them.
Mr Danny Lucas, a director of S. Lucas, said BSI's action would 'discourage
many unregistered firms from seeking BS 5750' and called on the institution
to 'act decisively to restore credibility'.
Industry estimates suggest fewer than 20 per cent of private clients ask
contractors or consultants to be quality accredited.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Personal View: Price fixers need a dose of disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bankers are the biggest price fixers of all. Day by day they conduct
huge operations in the money markets to hold short-term interest rates close
to their chosen peg. The top fixer, the US Federal Reserve, has held the key
overnight rate at its peg of 3 per cent for more than a year. At least the
Federal Reserve is the most accountable among central banks for its actions.
The next biggest fixer, the Bundesbank, meets only the lowest standards of
accountability. In view of the international importance of its policy
actions, these standards need urgently to be improved.
The discretionary power now wielded by central banks - either independently
or as agents of the finance ministry - in the choice and defence of interest
rate pegs is far greater than was historically the case. Under the gold
standard, rates floated in response to the scarcity or abundance of metallic
reserves. After the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, discretion
was limited - at least in the important cases of the Federal Reserve and
Bundesbank - by the respect given to money supply targets.
Indeed, in the first decade of the floating D-Mark-dollar rate, from the
mid-1970s to mid-1980s, the German and US central banks experimented by
abandoning any attempt to peg money market rates even over short periods.
The stimulus to this experimentation was a rapid acceleration of inflation.
Important overnight rates were allowed to float as the central banks
concentrated on hitting the target set for growth in monetary reserves. Once
the inflation upsurge passed in the 1980s, experiment gave way to
adjustments of interest rates, triggered by any significant deviation of the
money supply from the central banks' medium-term targets.
The recent loss of respect for monetary targetry has increased central
banks' rate-fixing power. Yet the accountability of the rate-fixers,
essential for upholding both democratic principles and operating efficiency,
is in general poor and in some cases virtually non-existent.
Accountability should not be confused with independence. The Bundesbank is
renowned for its independence from government. But the accountability of
German monetary policy is near zero. Bundesbank council members give
speeches and take questions at press conferences. But the minutes of the
council's deliberations become public only after a 30-year lag. Further,
they are so concisely edited as to leave out some of the detail in which
market participants and monetary historians are keenly interested.
Bundesbank council members do not have to cope with questions from any
parliamentary body. No freedom of information legislation applies whereby
academic critics could sift through the record and examine Bundesbank
efficiency in setting monetary policy.
Perhaps the biggest error in recent German monetary history was the
Bundesbank's failure to raise its discount rate for nearly a year after the
announcement of monetary union between East and West Germany in February
1990. Yet the reasoning behind this mistake has not been revealed to the
public.
What was the attitude when Bundesbank officials, such as the current
president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, were promoted recently? If appointees such as
Mr Tietmeyer had been obliged to undergo questioning by a Bundestag
committee before confirmation, it would be a spur to good decision-making;
and the public might have learnt more about another troubling episode - the
raising of the discount rate in July 1992. As we now know, by then the
German economy had slipped into recession.
The situation for US central bankers could not be more different. The
Federal Reserve's misuse of power in 1990-91, when the key overnight rate
was adjusted downwards at a glacially slow pace rather than being allowed to
fall steeply at once, has been blamed for an unnecessary recession and the
subsequent lack-lustre recovery. .
Congressional discontent with the Federal Open Market Committee has come to
the boil and tough new proposals for accountability are on the table,
including full and immediate disclosure of discussions at policy-making
meetings.
There can be little hope that the European Monetary Institute, likely to be
firmly under the wing of the Bundesbank when it is set up in Frankfurt next
year, will be a force for increased accountability. To mark a more promising
beginning for the new era in European monetary policy-making, the Bundesbank
should hang the words of Jeremy Bentham on the wall of its council meeting
room: 'Without publicity, no good is permanent.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / High hopes for the seamy side of life: Michael Smith
examines the prospects for the shape and size of the UK coal industry after
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after promising what it called the ultimate privatisation, the
sale of the coal industry, the UK government is ready to deliver. After last
year's false start, when its plans were delayed by a public outcry over pit
closures, ministers are determined to end the state's 46-year ownership of
coal.
A bill will be presented to parliament shortly, possibly this week, and what
remains of British Coal should be in private hands by early 1995 at the
latest.
What, then, will be the size, shape and ownership of the industry in the
second half of the decade? And how vulnerable will the government be in
parliament over such issues as miners' pensions, regulation and safety.
Arguments over protecting workers' pensions caused the government
considerable difficulties in its railway privatisation bill this autumn. The
scope for similar ructions in the coal sell-off were highlighted recently
when the trustees of the mineworkers' Pounds 7.5bn pension scheme identified
17 'areas of concern' over government proposals. They want to 'ensure that
the real value of benefits continues to be protected' against increases in
the cost of living.
Further controversy could be stirred by the government's plans for a Coal
Authority to supervise the licensing of privatised mines. Conflict is
expected over the authority's role in deciding whether to grant licences.
Will it examine companies' safety records or just look at the highest bids?
The government is sensitive to Labour party charges that pit safety has been
compromised in the drive for efficiency.
Despite such potential embarrassments for the government in the
parliamentary debate over privatisation, few observers expect the sell-off
to be sunk. The structure of the industry will be shaped not through debates
in Westminster but through government talks with the would-be buyers of
British Coal.
Ministers have decided to offer British Coal for sale as five separate
regions - Scotland, the north-east, Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales. But
they argue that their priority is to let the market decide the shape of the
industry. Companies will have to bid for every pit and opencast site in the
region of their choice. The government has chosen this method because in
theory it opens the industry up to competition. However, it leaves open the
possibility that one company could bid for all regions successfully and thus
recreate a single entity.
British Coal fears that fragmentation would lead to cut-throat rivalry
within the industry at a time when competition from other energy sources,
including gas and nuclear power, and from imported coal will be intense.
'If the government splits up coal, then it really will kill it,' says one
British Coal executive.
Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman of Caledonian Mining, a mining equipment
manufacturer which is a potential bidder, has similar fears. 'The industry
will be beaten into the ground through competition if British Coal is broken
up,' he says. Mr MacLeod adds that he is interested in being part of a
consortium to buy and manage British Coal, but if it is broken up he would
'only want a couple of mines'.
Similarly, the British Association of Colliery Management, which represents
middle and senior managers, hopes to co-ordinate a series of regional
buy-outs on behalf of members, with the aim of combining them into a single
company.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has not ruled out the possibility of a single
organisation emerging after the bidding process, but he and other ministers
are thought to favour the split into separate regions. Their thinking has
been influenced by criticism over previous utility privatisations that
overpowerful monopolies or duopolies have been created in the gas and
electricity sectors.
Offering the business for sale in five regions is the most likely way of
attracting a significant number of buyers, Mr Eggar believes. By splitting
up the sale, the government has responded to emerging companies such as RJB
Mining, based in Nottinghamshire and recently floated on the Stock Exchange,
and Ryan International, with interests in Wales and the north-east of
England, which might be interested in bidding.
The government has also increased the chances of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers having some stake in the industry. For instance, the UDM might
be able to launch a management buy-out for the Nottinghamshire mines. Such a
consideration is important because many ministers believe the government
owes a debt to the union for keeping mines open during the 1984-85 strike.
Regional privatisation also offers buy-out possibilities to British Coal
managers at positions lower than board level. In selling off the company,
the government is anxious to avoid a simple transfer of the organisation to
the private sector with its structures and management intact. It believes
fresh managers are needed but is keen to encourage the second tier of
British Coal management to join the bidding.
The recent contraction in the industry has contributed to the exodus by many
disillusioned executives and managers, but there is still enthusiasm among
some for the sell-off. Mr Bryan Riddleston, British Coal's opencast director
in Wales, is among those who might bid for the region in which he works.
When he talks about anthracite, a naturally smokeless fuel mined in Wales,
he refers to it as 'black diamonds'.
'It is what everyone wants to get their hands on at privatisation,' he says.
'It is the best anthracite in the world. The management here (in Wales
opencast) all want to be involved in the business after privatisation,
although it is too early too early to say whether we will want to be
employees or running the business.' He says, however, that he wants to see
how the government will assess responsibility for any future claims arising,
for example, from subsidence.
If he is satisfied that he will not be saddled with enormous liabilities,
then, like all other bidders, he will look closely at the future market for
coal. There is little cause for cheer, particularly after 1998 when
contracts with the UK's two electricity generators end. Caminus Energy, the
UK consultancy, suggested in a report to the government this year that the
total annual sales for British Coal's successors in England and Wales could
be as low as 23m tonnes or as high as 54m.
The lower figure would inevitably lead to further pit closures above British
Coal's current rationalisation programme, which is likely to leave only 12
to 15 pits out of about 30 still in operation. Caminus's gloomier forecast
would result in perhaps just half a dozen working pits.
Given such uncertainty, why would mining companies want to bid for any of
the regions?
The answer is that some in the industry believe Caminus's higher forecast
may be attainable and even beatable. In the short term, there is also scope
for considerable profit in each region. In Scotland, where British Coal has
just signed a five-year agreement with Scottish Power to supply 2m tonnes of
coal for Pounds 400m, there is also some medium-term certainty.
Like the Wales and north-east regions, the Scotland package will contain
considerable amounts of opencast, which is much cheaper to mine than deep
coal. On the other hand, Yorkshire and the Midlands are attractive because
they are likely to contain all but perhaps three of the 12 to 15 remaining
deep mines which provide the lion's share of coal to the generators, whose
power stations are concentrated in those regions.
All five regions should have contracts with the generators, ensuring their
value to potential investors. 'Some may turn out to be short-term businesses
but they can still make a lot of money over three years,' says Mr Dieter
Helm, director of the consultancy, Oxford Economic Research Association.
The government may thus find that its coal sell-off proceeds more smoothly
than some observers have anticipated. The big question remains what British
Coal's successors will do with the pits after the electricity contracts
terminate in 1998. If markets in the UK continue to contract, the likelihood
is another big round of mine closures. Then, privatisation will be seen as
nothing more than a prelude to the slow death of an industry rather than the
regeneration the government says it intends.

Tricky moment at yesterday's Queens Moat Houses extraordinary general

adjournment of the meeting, a thinly attended event. Advised by the
adjudicator that seven votes were in favour and four against, Metcalfe
announced the motion did not have the 50 per cent support it needed. He was
quickly put right. But shareholders, facing massive dilution through a debt
for equity swap, can hardly have been comforted by the chairman's display of
mental arithmetic.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: Return to sender
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Observer would love to be able to break the news that the secretive
Rothschild group recorded an income of Dollars 3.3bn last year. But sadly
that claim is as bogus as all the others contained in a prospectus that has
turned up in Monaco and Zurich using the Rothschild name to solicit funds
for investments in eastern Europe.
For instance, the document, inviting investors to part with their cash in
exchange for 'guaranteed' annual returns of 25 per cent from east European
property, is covered in versions of the house emblem, the five arrows.
Allegedly chaired by Prince Rainier of Monaco, whose 'signature' and photo
adorn the president's statement, the fictitious board is not short of
illustrious fellow directors - one Eisenberg Rothschild, obviously a long
lost relation, is joined by a Quandt, allegedly part of the BMW family, and
a von Bismarck.
A sharp solicitor's letter normally does the trick but no one knows who to
send it to in this case, which explains why Barons Edmond and David de
Rothschild and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild have had to resort to advertising
across Europe to disassociate themselves from the rogues in the first place.

So much for the Scandinavians' fabled ability to sink their differences when
all around them seemed to be losing their tempers. When Jan Carlzon, the
Swedish architect of the ill-fated Alcazar project, got up to put across his
point of view at Sunday's press conference he was quickly shot down by a
Danish superior.
The diplomatic incident between Carlzon, the former chief executive of
Scandinavian Airline Systems, and SAS chairman Tage Andersen was triggered
by a seemingly innocent query about what Carlzon planned to do next. 'I am
less worried about my own future than about the future of the four
airlines,' replied Carlzon.
This is the sort of statesmanlike statement one might expect from a big
picture man like Carlzon but it clearly incensed Andersen, who turned an
angry purple and retorted that the SAS board is 'not worried about the
future of SAS'. Assembled newshounds were told that if they had any further
questions about the future of the airline they could put them to the
chairman and not to Carlzon.

<TEXT>
Hard to know whether Bob Thian's abrupt ousting from North West Water says
more about Thian himself or about the company's newish chairman Sir Desmond
Pitcher. Both have pretty inflated opinions of themselves.
Thian, who joined at the beginning of 1990, prides himself on his
international outlook, and, having spent most of his working life abroad,
despises little Englanderism. Sir Desmond, angling for the job of Mr North
West (region, as well as water) in his third age, recently observed that he
was 'a natural' for the chair of the region's largest company. Littlewoods
staff remember him fondly as both a grandee and a bit of a meddler.
The company denies any personal spats, claiming that as it 'matures' it
needs someone with a less centralised, tight-reined approach. Let's hope the
maturation process will include keeping the next chief executive a bit
longer.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: What's your poison?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Here's a problem Agatha Christie never considered: how to get rid of a jar
of strychnine - legally. It may not be an everyday problem, but the
experience of a north London colleague who found such a jar in his fuse
cupboard suggests there may be a need for a poisoner's charter.
The label gave instructions on poisoning moles written in 1964 by a former
resident: mix with earthworms and use as bait. But on balance we'd rather
have live children than dead moles.
However, the local chemist didn't want to touch it, and nor did the police,
who weren't even concerned as to its whereabouts. The pharmacy at the Royal
Free Hospital tried to find out who could handle it and rang back after an
hour suggesting the Ministry of Agriculture. The man from the ministry
wasn't interested and thought it was a job for Camden council's
environmental health department. No luck there either. But how about the
hazardous waste department of the London Waste Regulation Authority?
Preliminary investigations were not encouraging. An answerphone handled the
inquiry. But when one of the staff of the few remnants of Ken Livingstone's
GLC rang back service couldn't have been better. What's your poison, and how
soon can we collect it?
Is Citizen Ken's Charter working better than William Waldegrave's?

FT  23 NOV 93 / Leading Article: The future of the forests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the flak caused by railway privatisation and the decision to shirk
postal privatisation, the UK government might be thought mad to be
considering privatising forests. Ministers' and MPs' postbags are already
bulging with hostile letters, even though a decision on whether to privatise
is still far away.
The essential problem is that the Forestry Commission, whose woods cover 5
per cent of the country's surface area and provide 14 per cent of its timber
needs, does more than saw logs. It affords exercise for ramblers, facilities
for holiday-makers and habitats for birds. The forests can also look good,
though many of the commission's monotonous sitka spruce plantations are
eyesores.
These non-timber benefits cannot always be commercialised. It is, for
example, impossible to impose 'hotel charges' on nightjars or red kites.
Devising a toll system for ramblers would also be tricky. The fear is that
private owners would neglect the non-timber aspects of forestry, since they
would be unable to earn profits from them. People might be stopped from
roaming through the woods and birds' breeding grounds destroyed.
But forest privatisation is not quite the crack-pot idea it seems on first
sight. It could help convert the Commission, which has been a constant drain
on the public purse during its 75 years of existence, into a dynamic
enterprise. Privatisation would also bring into the open the costs of
meeting environmental objectives, which are currently hidden by opaque
accounting practices.
Recreational potential
The scope for a more commercial approach is great. The commission's
bureaucratic culture has been blamed for high costs by comparison with
private-sector foresters. Recently it was criticised by the National Audit
Office for prematurely felling trees, so foregoing Pounds 11m a year in
revenue. It has also failed to make the most of its recreational potential,
cutting the number of log cabins during the 1980s despite growing demand and
high profitability.
Privatisation would, of course, need to protect those interests which might
be neglected by the narrow pursuit of profits. This could be achieved
through a mixture of regulation and financial incentives. Ramblers could be
protected by a 'right to roam' in privatisation contracts. Natural habitats
could be preserved by paying private owners to maintain sites of special
interest, just as some farmers do. And ancient woodlands such as the New
Forest, whose non-timber benefits dwarf their timber potential, could be
transfered to a national forest parks authority.
Public money
Critics say such an approach would not work. It would be impossible to write
regulations that were sufficiently flexible to meet all environmental
concerns. They also fear that, once the profitable parts of the estate were
sold, the government would be unwilling to find cash to support loss-making
forest parks or bribe the private sector to stay green.
Privatisation would certainly make the costs of providing environmental
benefits transparent, so allowing a proper discussion of whether the public
is getting value for money. In some cases, it might be obvious that money
was being wasted. But, in others, the fact that environmental advantages of
forestry were more clearly identified could lead to a justified demand for
more public money.
Devising a proper structure of regulation and incentives will not be easy.
It would therefore be best to go first for a half-way house under which the
commercial and regulatory aspects of the Forestry Commission were fully
separated. This would build on a partial division of the commission into a
Forest Enterprise and Forest Authority, which came into effect last year.
But it would go further in that the enterprise would acquire a corporate
structure and be subject to the same rules as private forest owners.
This would provide time to debug the regulatory structure and put the
enterprise's accounts into shape. Once this had been done, ministers would
be free to consider wholesale or partial privatisation. By offering
shareholders incentives such as discounts on log cabin holidays,
privatisation might even be seen as a small triumph of popular capitalism.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Italy's tide of protest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Italy's post-war political system has been a knotted ball of
intricately-woven string, then Sunday was the day when it finally
unravelled. Municipal elections to select mayors in 428 cities completed the
political demolition of the long-ruling Christian Democrat party. Still more
strongly than in the referendum on electoral reform in April and the
municipal polls in June, the vote showed the unstoppable momentum of protest
against the country's scandal-tainted mainstream parties.
The swing to the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the
neo-Fascist MSI party, coupled with the fresh momentum behind Mr Umberto
Bossi's Northern League, led yesterday to sharp falls on Italian financial
markets. The result was, however, hardly unexpected, in view of the
widespread discrediting of the political apparatus during the past two
years.
The established parties are passing through inevitable catharsis, as part of
more general change. After the progress already made during the past year
towards political and economic reform, there is room for hope  - although
not yet conclusive evidence - that a new system will emerge, stronger, more
stable and less self-serving than before.
If Sunday's result were repeated in the general elections expected in early
1994, the four parties behind the coalition government of Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi would gain no more than 15 per cent of the vote. The aim of electoral
reform, which will introduce a largely majority voting system for the next
election, is to produce a more coherent and stable constellation of parties
better able to modernise Italy's industrial and administrative structure and
regain public confidence.
Chief anxiety
In contrast, the chief anxiety on the financial markets yesterday was that
the next parliament could be dominated by untried political groups united
only by their tendencies towards populist extremism and (in the case of the
Northern League) separatism. There is also concern that the setback for the
government parties could complicate still further Mr Ciampi's task of
steering his tough 1994 budget through parliament. Two senior ministers have
already said they will resign if the budget is not passed by the end-year
deadline.
These fears cannot be lightly disregarded, but the risks should not be
exaggerated. The swing to the neo-fascists in southern Italy was far more a
signal of rejection of the Christian Democrats than a revival of a
Mussolini-type movement. The dictator's photogenic granddaughter, standing
in Naples, indeed, did less well than expected.
Principal victor
The principal victor on Sunday, the PDS, has shown it can run successful
local alliances with parties such as the Greens and Radicals. Although the
ex-communist party's economic policies, in particular, need much sharper
definiton, it is on the way towards becoming the main standard-bearer of
Italian social democracy.
Benefiting from a clear lead over the Christian Democrats in reorganising
its structure and its leadership, the PDS has yet to face the force of a
reconstructed party of the centre, which could still emerge under Mr Mario
Segni, the ex-Christian Democrat head of the April referendum movement. But
there is no reason why a PDS-led government next year would produce policies
fundamentally different from those undertaken by Mr Ciampi.
No party likely to take power next year seems disposed to reverse the
process of reforming wage legislation, restructuring the civil service and
welfare spending, and reshaping the budget. The PDS, for instance, would be
unlikely to halt the privatisation programme or reintroduce the scala mobile
system of wage indexation dismantled in 1992.
Whatever government is in charge will face an arduous agenda. Precisely
because the challenges are so large and so evident, they cannot however be
avoided. For 45 post-war years, the rules of the Italian political system
were geared to keeping the Communist party out of office. Now that the old
system has collapsed under its own disrepute, it would be a cause of neither
surprise nor alarm if that party's successor became the first to take power
under the new one.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TADATOSHI AKIBA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a member of the Japanese Diet from Hiroshima, I am particularly
concerned about the wisdom of proceeding with reprocessing at Thorp. I thank
my counterparts in the British parliament for answering my and my
colleagues' open letter to them by submitting a motion in the House of
Commons stating that it is a matter of urgency that our two governments
'negotiate an acceptable outcome to prevent the production of surplus
plutonium' at Thorp.
I would like to clarify that our open letter (the number of Diet members
signing has now increased to 18) does not dispute the Japanese and British
governments' policies. Rather, we ask them to explain logically why there
are so many contradictions on this issue if their figures and assessments
are indeed reliable.
Japanese plutonium is already in surplus even without Thorp. The Science and
Technology Agency, responding to my request, released on October 1 the most
comprehensive information to date on current stocks, showing it at 4,530
kgs. Nearly three tonnes of this belongs to the electric utilities with no
concrete plans to implement its use.
Japan's policy of having fuel reprocessed abroad is very much a waste
disposal policy. Because of Japan's experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
people rightly fear the effects of radiation. Siting of new nuclear power
plants takes an average of 24 years. Nuclear waste disposal sites are wanted
even less. To have been able to ship in excess of 5,000 tonnes of nuclear
spent fuel to the UK and France for reprocessing has been a blessing to the
Japanese nuclear industry. Japanese utilities remain silent about the fact
that all waste produced after reprocessing at Thorp is due to return to
Japan. Ethical Japanese will be obliged to inform you that there are no
plans whatsoever for re-accommodating the low and intermediate level waste
generated by reprocessing at Thorp. BNFL argues that this waste will be
'substituted' for high level waste, but this scheme is not in place. Also,
our government has never admitted such proposals are being discussed.
Both the Japanese and British governments are ignoring important realities.
Good politics as well as good science must start from looking at realities
as they are. Members of the Japanese Diet as well as the British parliament,
therefore, have a duty to awaken our two governments to objective facts so
that they would negotiate on Thorp.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL LEVENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Surely, the debate over whether to switch on Thorp has entered the
theatre of the absurd. It is now clear that plutonium would be produced at
Thorp in quantities far exceeding the capacity or the willingness of
electrical utilities to consume it (Letters November 8, 11 and 15). No
matter] BNFL continues to press the government for permission to operate
Thorp, arguing it can make a profit by holding utilities to reprocessing
contracts negotiated at a time when uranium seemed to be scarce and
plutonium the only way to keep electricity-generating reactors running.
Now that non-weapons-usable uranium fuel is clearly in ample supply, is
there no way to avoid switching on Thorp and compounding the plutonium
danger?
Britain's prime minister, John Major, can still opt for prudence and sanity.
Instead of turning on Thorp's plutonium spigot and hoping for the best, he
can engage in some enlightened market testing. At Sellafield, there are
already more than 30 tons of plutonium extracted from the spent fuel of
reactors operated by British nuclear utilities. Since these reactors are not
technically suited for recycling plutonium, why not offer it to BNFL's
utility customers in Japan and Germany to test the true demand for plutonium
before reaching a decision on Thorp? At this point, they seem to support the
start-up of Thorp so long as the resulting plutonium and radioactive wastes
remain in Britain.
The likely result of market testing will be no demand for plutonium in
commercial power reactors (they run on uranium), very little demand for
plutonium in R&amp;D activities, and a very large demand (and large fees) for
continued storage of spent fuel at Thorp until permanent repositories can be
opened to dispose of the unreprocessed fuel in the countries of origin.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and Technology Agency's Atomic
Energy Bureau says (Letters, November 15) 'the prospect that Japan will have
no surplus of plutonium, including that from Thorp, is strictly maintained'.
He cites figures of plutonium supply and demand contained in the Atomic
Energy Commission's report of August 1991 on nuclear fuel cycling in Japan.
Unfortunately, the demand estimates in this report are no longer regarded as
credible inside or outside Japan. They imply that, between 1991 and 2010,
10-20 tonnes of plutonium will be consumed in fast reactors. But the Monju
reactor is having teething troubles, and no site has yet been found for the
larger Demonstration Fast Breeder Reactor. They imply that close to 10
tonnes will be consumed in the Demonstration Advanced Thermal Reactor,
construction of which has not yet begun and for which the utilities have
little enthusiasm. And they imply that 50 tonnes of plutonium will be used
to fuel conventional thermal reactors, when utilities have serious qualms
about the political and operational viability of this programme, and when
total consumption to date has been 44 kilograms in fuel assemblies tested in
the Mihama and Tsuruga reactors.
My assessment (Letters, November 11) that Japanese plutonium surpluses could
approach 20 tonnes by the year 2000 and 40 tonnes by 2010 if current
reprocessing plans are implemented may therefore be conservative. But if Mr
Moriguchi is correct and no Japanese surpluses are in prospect, why did Mr
Kaneko (November 8) decide to draw attention to the need to store Japan's
plutonium 'for some time' at Sellafield? Do their statements become
compatible if a distinction is drawn between Japan's plutonium surplus and
the surplus located in Japan, the idea now being to keep the latter to a
minimum by holding the former in Britain and France?

<TEXT>
Sir, As a member of the European Parliament's energy committee and
rapporteur on two reports on Sellafield and Safeguards (1988) and Sellafield
Reprocessing and Nuclear Transport (1993) for the parliament, I would like
to comment on the full page advertisement you printed (November 16) from the
chairmen of 10 Japanese electricity utilities with contracts for
reprocessing of their irradiated nuclear fuel at the Thorp plant at
Sellafield.
There is insufficient space to correct all of their misrepresentations on
nuclear waste management, plutonium demand and the safety standards for
nuclear transport adopted by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). I do think,
though, that it is important specifically to address the myopic assertion
that 'all nuclear material from Thorp, including plutonium, would be
strictly controlled by the British government, Euratom and the International
Atomic Energy Agency in the United Kingdom and by the Japanese Government
and IAEA in Japan'.
In my 1988 report on nuclear safeguards at Sellafield it was demonstrated
that the UK had deliberately excluded safeguards inspectors from
Sellafield's most sensitive areas for 13 years from 1973. It has since been
claimed that the safeguards regime is now more transparent at Sellafield. In
BNFL's own submission to the second consultation period on Thorp over the
summer, it claims that 'Euratom safeguards inspectors have been given access
to verify all aspects of the Thorp design'.
This claim is purportedly based on a paper prepared by three BNFL and five
Euratom experts. I have asked BNFL for a copy of this paper on at least
three occasions over the summer and it has yet to send it.
In the European Parliament's call for the 1994 Euratom safeguards budget to
be increased by Ecu 12,980m to cover large-scale plutonium processing
plants, it explains that 'plutonium stocks in the Community have almost
doubled from 151 tonnes in the four years since 1988'.
Further separation of at least 50 tonnes of plutonium in Thorp over its
first 10 years of operation, much of which is destined to be returned to
overseas customers, will further exacerbate the problem.
The recent concerns expressed by members of the US Congress, Japanese Diet,
the European Parliament and the Rand Corporation study released on 17
November, about plutonium proliferation, present a powerful protest against
Thorp.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fibre losers in Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The contention that 'Clinton got his (Nafta) backing at a bargain
price' (November 19) ignores massive potential costs for developing
countries.
Clinton's vow to extend the phase-out of textile quotas must put in question
the US's willingness to submit to General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
disciplines and to share some of the gains from the Uruguay Round with the
Third World.
Textiles and clothing account for about a quarter of the total manufactured
exports of developing countries. For nearly 20 years the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA) has discriminated against this vital sector.
Almost all developing countries' gains from the Uruguay Round come from the
ending of the MFA. Without a good textile agreement, much of the Third World
is likely to face net losses.
The current Uruguay Round text is already problematic. The MFA phase-out
happens over 10 years, with most of the benefits coming at the end, and
northern countries will be allowed to apply 'safeguards' for another eight
years. To extend this time period still further is unacceptable. To give way
to protectionist lobbies now puts in question the willingness of the US to
reduce protectionism in 10 years' time.
Without a fast timetable for MFA reform the Uruguay Round package does not
look attractive to developing countries.

Sir, 'Joe Rogaly is right to call for a new Beveridge Report,' writes Frank
Field. 'The overall effect of our present welfare state is unsatisfactory
not only because many benefits are paid at a relatively low level but
because its provisions trap into poverty an increasing number of people . .

<TEXT>
Professionals must be slapped about a bit from time to time. Whenever we
consumers neglect this solemn duty, our lawyers, doctors, accountants,
architects, engineers, chemists and so on become idle, complacent and
greedy. They bury their mistakes and, too often, one of us.
I learned how to handle such predatory beasts early in life, after returning
a solicitor's invoice with the words 'Are you joking?' scrawled at the foot
of the page, near the total. A few weeks' silence ensued. Eventually the
bill came back, halved. Everyone should try this. Go on. Question a
professional's fee this very morning. What can you lose? Or try going
elsewhere. You may have much to gain. Based on years of experience, my first
port of call is a 'designer' rather than an architect, a computer program
rather than an accountant and anyone rather than a lawyer.
This may not be the tone expected by the Royal Institute of British
Architects, which gave me a seat, lunch and coffee at its seminar on
professionalism last week. The purpose was evidently to make the point that
the professions are in 'crisis' and that a bit more respect for them would
not only be beneficial to all mankind; it would bathe the earth-mother Gaia
herself in a roseate glow. Several speakers, many from the audience,
supported this view. The enemy was quickly identified. It is that old devil
the free market. Thatcherism, it seems, destroys the professional ethic.
People who follow a vocation cannot be expected to sully their hands with
commerce.
There may be something, although not much, in this. Professor Harold Perkin,
author of The Rise of Professional Society: England since 1880, gave as a
foundation text the following passage from Adam Smith: 'We trust our health
to the physician; our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the
lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people
of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as
may give them that rank in society which so important a trust requires.'
Trust is the word. Professor Perkin, who teaches at Northwestern University,
Evanston, Illinois, reminded us that when you purchase the services of a
professional the familiar caveat emptor, let the buyer beware, becomes,
credat emptor, let the buyer believe. What? Believe accountants, not enough
of whom are in jail, or doctors, who cover up lethal mistakes made by their
fellow practitioners, or lawyers, who practise only to deceive? Well, yes.
At the end of the day we have little option.
This point was made by Mr Michael Burrage, who lectures at the London School
of Economics. He has studied the French, Russian and American revolutions,
noting that in each case the professions were destroyed by the new regimes.
For a while it was possible to practise law or medicine without any training
or qualification, or reference to any rules or set of ethics. The inevitable
re-invention of professional associations was not initiated by
self-interested professionals, but by the state and public opinion. The
re-establishment of the French legal profession was begun by the Jacobin
Club when in 1792 it established a 'Committee of Official Defenders of the
Friends of Liberty and Equality'. Even Stalin revived the old Russian
colleges of advocates. In the US the state governments, spurred by private
foundations and the press, sought to reconstitute the medical profession.
Legislation to control legal practice came from the west before there were
any bar associations.
The two ancient professions may survive, but what of the 40 other
professional bodies recognised under English law in the 19th century, or the
further 120 that have sprung up in the 20th? They cannot all justify
self-regulation, barriers to entry, and try-on pricing. According to Sir
Gordon Borrie, this was recognised in the late 1970s, when the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission tackled restrictions on advertising by accountants
and solicitors and fee-rigging by architects. Sir Gordon, who was
director-general of Fair Trading from 1976 until last year, smashed the
opticians' hold on their trade in 1982. He sees the OFT report of that year
as a turning point in attitudes to professionalism. The ending of the
solicitors' monopoly over conveyancing was a subsequent triumph.
Yet the professions have not been obliterated. The BMA is still with us,
fighting a rearguard action against every change, however progressive.
Doctors have long resisted handing simple functions, like renewing
prescriptions, over to nurses. The lawyers have fought Lord Mackay, the
would-be liberaliser of their trade, to a standstill. The top civil servants
remain to be tamed: we shall see how they dispose of open competitive
advertising for their jobs. Mystique, a hold on the nuts and bolts of
procedure, gives them powers beyond reason.
Against that, the Treasury has done more to unnerve Britain's professions
than any MMC or OFT report. Academics can no longer rely on tenure: they
must accept short-term contracts and often have to find their own sponsors
to fund them. The National Health Service is a wondrous mechanism for
keeping down the remuneration of doctors and nurses. It has now become the
state's instrument for placing managerial overlords above professional
medical staff. The accountants reign supreme in public services. Legal aid
is squeezed. The recession, combined with compulsory competitive tendering,
has created a new tribe of formerly-employed architects. Teachers, under the
government's latest bill to control their training, may be wholly
de-professionalised. Expect untutored young trainees to stand before the
blackboards. They are cheaper than the professionals they will replace.
This is a pity. Provided that they behave themselves, professional societies
could be a better safeguard against malpractice than either regulation by
the state or the power of the market. As Professor Perkin points out, in
post-industrial society, where knowledge is the principal factor of
production, professional skills have become more valuable. Purist proponents
of the market will say that where there is transparency consumers will judge
which practitioners are safest, or who gives best value. In some instances
this is surely correct. When the government gets the mechanics right,
testing and league tables may help parents to judge where the best teachers
can be found. But only doctors can detect mistakes made by their colleagues.
The trick is to insist that they expel bad practitioners. Solicitors, who
apparently have to be serial embezzlers to get a slap on the wrist from
their peers, should be struck off or fined for bad service. If teachers want
to be professionals, they must take similar medicine.
Some professions are learning the lesson. Rabbi Julia Neuberger told us that
the first 10 days of the course at Harvard Business School is spent on
ethics. There is similar insistence in the law and education schools. In the
medical school 'values education' is paramount. This makes sense. Without an
ethos, special knowledge alone is not enough to justify the benefits of
professional exclusivity. As Sir Gordon intimates, associations that accept
commercial reality while maintaining a moral purpose are most likely to
survive.
There is a good reason why they should. The disaggregation of society, its
breakdown into self-seeking individuals linked only by cash transactions, is
troubling many in the West, notably in Britain where it seems likely to go
furthest. However minimalist a state may become, it is better kept in check
if it is not the only source of civic authority. Reformed professional
associations could be advocates of the public interest. We will have to keep
slapping them about until they get the message.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fragrant, but complex, monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DIANA GUY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Both your leader writer ('Perfume cartel', November 12) and, indeed,
your legal correspondent ('Whiff of controversy hangs in the air', November
16) appear to be under the impression that a 'complex monopoly' and a cartel
are the same thing. In fact, under the admittedly rather convoluted
provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973, unless the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission finds that there is a 'monopoly situation' (a technical term
defined in ss. 6 to 8 of the Act), it has no jurisdiction at all to pursue
an investigation under the monopoly provisions of the Act.
In a simple case, there will be a 'monopoly situation' if one person has 25
per cent or more of the market; however, there will also be a 'monopoly
situation' if two or more companies together have 25 per cent or more of the
market and they all 'conduct their respective affairs' in a similar fashion.
In the latter situation, there is a so-called 'complex monopoly'.
In the recent inquiry into fine fragrances, it was clear from the outset
that the MMC would almost certainly conclude that there was a 'complex
monopoly' as all the suppliers of fine fragrances operated some form of
selective distribution. Indeed, many of the perfume houses, including
Parfums Givenchy which I represented, made no serious attempt to argue the
contrary view before the MMC.
On the other hand, we argued very vigorously indeed that the 'complex
monopoly' did not operate in any way against the public interest. After an
extremely thorough investigation which extended over a period of nine months
and which involved consideration of evidence from many different sources,
not just the perfume houses, the MMC concluded that it was indeed the case
that nothing which it had found was against the public interest.
Superdrug and others had, of course, mounted a very effective campaign in
the press and elsewhere in support of the contrary view. It is perhaps only
to be expected, therefore, that when the MMC's findings failed to match the
expectations fuelled by that campaign, it came as a surprise to many people.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Education - mixed ability assessment
must be fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As we have advised parents for many years and are increasingly being
consulted by companies on the educational options best suited to their
families, we are acutely aware of the A-level league table dilemma
highlighted by Peter Gallie, headmaster of the John Taylor High School
(Letters, November 15).
With about 35 per cent of students changing institute or school at 16, some
schools may aim to improve their A-level ratings by rejecting entries from
marginal students or insisting that they enter as private candidates. It is
for this reason that the Conference of Independent Further Education has
asked us to audit all their members' A-level returns before they are
released to the press and potential students.
The government has made an important contribution to raising standards by
insisting on a core curriculum and the publication of exam results. The next
essential stage is the measurement of added value so that schools that are
good with mixed ability pupils are assessed fairly.
This could be achieved through changes in the brief of school inspectors and
we, like other independent organisations, are considering bidding for
inspection contracts if we can be sure that academic and traditional
achievement criteria, rather than politically correct standards, are the
ones being inspected and assessed.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Terence Trent D'Arby - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pop history is littered with the corpses of talented artists who promised
much with their first albums only to falter when asked to repeat the trick.
The unspoken question dogging Terence Trent D'Arby's current tour is whether
the American singer has managed to recapture the touch which made his 1987
debut, The Hardline according to Terence Trent D'Arby, an award winning
million seller.
On the evidence at the Brixton Academy the jury is still out. Although he
has matured as a songwriter, the quality of the material remains uneven. His
best new songs are slow and reflective, and his current single, 'Let me down
easy', is as nice a piece of piano balladry as the charts have seen all
year.
In performance D'Arby saves this gem for the encore, seated, solo and centre
stage, at the key boards, yet elsewhere his image as a soft and sensitive
artist is undermined by an arrogant and self-important personality. He
passed most of the early part of the evening draped in a shiny cloak,
dramatically peeled away to reveal white Lycra tights and a naked torso
studded with pectorals worthy of Chris Eubank. Like Eubank, D'Arby shares a
weakness to project himself as 'simply the best'.
He seemed unwilling to endear himself to the audience, staying tight lipped
between songs and disdainful of the need to please. To make things tougher
for himself his new up tempo numbers sounded surprisingly limp, and owing
much to rival Lenny Kravitz, who has exploited the black pop rock market
which 'Hardline' helped to open up. Incidentally, the tribe of pop
sociologists might like to speculate why D'Arby, like Kravitz, appeals
mainly to a white audience. Brixton was attracting an away crowd on Friday.
It is too soon to say whether D'Arby has secured his reputation on this
trip. He still has to decide whether to continue to play out his
unconvincing stereotype as the street punk, or settle instead for the more
restful role of the serious singer songwriter.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Low rent but high brow - Lynn MacRitchie admires the
video installation works of Gary Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The work of Gary Hill, now showing at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and
that of Bill Viola which follows next month at the Whitechapel Gallery,
London, should convince anyone still in doubt that video, for all its low
rent, low brow connotations, can be used to create beautiful, thoughtful
works of art.
Hill, born in California in 1951 and originally trained as a sculptor at the
Art Students League, Woodstock, New York, has been working with video for 20
years. His installations created in the last three have won him a reputation
of world standing, sealed by the acclaim accorded 'Tall Ships' at Documenta
9 in Kassel last year and repeated at the Whitney Biennial in New York
earlier this, which is one of the five works featured at Oxford.
He has succeeded in using a medium which has often been dismissed as
peripheral to the artistic mainstream to create artwork of beauty and
profundity. Looking at his work is not quite so straightforward as looking
at a painting, however. Three installations, 'I Believe It Is An Image In
Light Of The Other,' 'Tall Ships' and 'Learning Curve' all require the
spectator to become part of the piece, whether stepping in to a dark tunnel
to activate the ghostly figures which animate 'Tall Ships', threading
through the hanging cathode ray tubes of 'Image in Light of the Other' or
sitting at a modified school desk to gaze at the endlessly crashing wave of
'Learning Curve.'
But participation by the viewer does not seem, as it can do in some
interactive pieces, strained or uncomfortable. Instead, physical engagement
becomes part of the process of understanding the works, revealing the
complexity of their formal organisation and also contributing to their
impact. The viewer must step into a dark enclosure to trigger the
projections in 'Tall Ships', a series of figures which come forward and
return the spectator's gaze before finally turning away, as if unsatisfied
with the encounter. The cathode ray tubes of ' . . . in Light of the Other',
1991-92, are the only source of light in the installation and viewers must
weave through their electric glade to read the texts on the books spread on
the floor beneath.
Hill has developed these complex works by using video to examine the
relationship between image and text, initially in single screen tapes such
as 'URA ARU', where words are run backwards and forwards over the visual
image. The power of the installations, however, lies in his way of opening
out his video work from the the single screen to become part of mixed media
compositions with a wider reference to traditional painting or sculpture.
The figures in 'Tall Ships', for example, could be a living mural while his
use of the naked body as subject is part of the long humanist sculptural
tradition. His chosen tool, the video camera, allows that tradition to move
into the era of the electronic image.
In 'Inasmuch as it is Always Already Taking Place', 1990, for example, 16
cathode ray tubes of various sizes are tumbled together in a specially built
wall niche. Each is the size of the part of the body which is shown on the
screen, normal television size for the stomach, tiny for the tip of a
finger. They sit in their alcove glowing blue, mysterious, like the bones of
a saint. This is no desiccated memorial, however, but living flesh, rising
and falling as it breathes, the separate parts combining to create a
metaphor for, in Hill's words, 'the meeting ground of the physicality of the
body, space and time.'
Another physical experience, that of surfing, underlies the concept of
'Learning Curve,' 1993, specially commissioned for this exhibition. In his
California youth, Hill was a keen surfer, and wanted to explore the
experience of riding 'the perfect wave', dependent on a momentary harmony of
mind, body and nature, as a symbol for the 'opening out' of the mind
immersed in the flow of thought. Hill has adapted a school desk so that its
surface stretches out some 15 or so feet in front, sloping gently upwards.
At its highest point rises a low horizontal screen, on which is projected
the video image of a constantly breaking wave.
The piece is a departure from the other works, inviting the viewer to
contemplate not the image of a thinking body but the concept of thought
itself, 'feeding back to the viewer,' Hill explained to me, 'in the endless
becoming of the wave.' Hill's work is remarkably successful in juggling with
philosophical concepts expressed through technology.
This is perhaps because he is prepared to be as ruthless with his medium,
stripping down the complexities of the video monitor to a few fragile glass
tubes, as he is with his own body, which he subjects to his camera's
unflinching gaze. This old fashioned artistic honesty, in which both subject
and technique are pushed to their limits in the attempt to achieve a
successful formal resolution, results in works of power and conviction, as
well as beauty.

There can be few publicity stunts as cost-effective as that of the K
Foundation which has promised to give Pounds 40,000 to the losers of
tonight's Turner Prize, itself worth Pounds 20,000. The prize, for an
outstanding piece of work by an artist under 50 (an amazing piece of
'ageism') will be awarded during the C4 culture series Without Walls (9.00).
We are told that the larger amount for the losers will be announced during a
commercial break in the programme. Whether it really happens is almost
irrelevant: the point about the tawdriness of such money awards has already
been made.
40 Minutes (BBC2, 9.50) is also about art. Were you aware that you and I
have been supporting Peter Howson in Bosnia as he acts as official war
artist? Nor was I. Do you suppose we also employ official war sculptors?
Official war alternative comedians? If not, why not? According to the
programme's billing, Howson's impressions 'bring fresh perspective to the
tragedy of civil war'.
Omnibus (BBC1, 10.20) is about conductors, some of whom it seems are paid
more than the entire orchestras in front of them.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Messiaen's final swan song
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high point of the Barbican's in memoriam festival for Olivier Messiaen
was naturally the British premiere of Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela . . . , his last
major work. The New York Philharmonic commissioned it, and first played it
in November last year, six months after the composer's death at 83. On
Sunday Eclairs had a resplendent performance by Kent Nagano and the London
Symphony on Sunday, so finely prepared and projected as to forbid the easy
response, 'There goes Messiaen re-cycling himself again]'
Messiaen always did re-cycle himself, of course. At least from the 1940s,
material from earlier pieces - not just themes and chord sequences, but
particular tropes and whole movement-formats - recurred regularly in his new
ones: often because of some devotional significance that they had for him,
like sacred 'Leitmotiven'. Since Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela ('Illuminations of
the beyond') is a devotional work par excellence, we expected most of the
familiar elements again, and we got them in profusion.
In the music of a composer with such a highly coloured but restricted
vocabulary (original though it was), all that self-quotation has sometimes
seemed risky. Even in Messiaen's late mega-'opera' on St. Francis, there are
long stretches which sound routine simply because we have known them from
long before. Yet in Eclairs . . . the echoes have a silvery new ring,
touched with a soft new grace.
That might be a sentimental illusion, the effect of knowing that this is an
old composer's last testament (as he surely meant it to be); but I do not
think it is. There is a parallel between Eclairs . . . and Stravinsky's last
pieces: a degree of unforced compression and seeming simplicity, which
renders the sense of the music utterly transparent. With the Messiaen that
must be owed partly to the refined luminosity of his orchestration
(especially in Nagano's beautiful handling), but that is not all.
Notoriously, Messiaen adored the hieratic manner - which always made room
for minatory thunderings and ultra-sweet quasi-kitsch. Here, however, the
old impassioned gestures are reduced to potent hieroglyphs. For more than an
hour, the eleven movements of Eclairs . . . (some very short, none very
long) pass by in beatific serenity, like panels in a moving frieze, whether
in brazen tones or ethereal ones. No hectoring, no over-insistent poignancy
(but lots of birdsong); and the proportions are concise and masterly. Love
Messiaen or loathe him, this is a quintessential work.
Last two concerts in Messiaen series November 29 &amp; December 10, London

FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: The Purcell Experience - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was Roger Norrington's seventh 'Experience' weekend. The format of
talks, exhibitions, chamber and orchestral events provides the opportunity
for audiences to immerse themselves in a composer's mind and music.
This year's focus of attention was Purcell, which meant that the
'Experience' also counted towards the South Bank's celebrations leading up
to the composer's tricentenary in 1995. If such a prestigious national event
can call forth the funds, we may yet get a full re-enactment of what
extravagance really meant in Restoration theatre. This weekend could only
hint at it with its closing performance of The Fairy Queen.
Before the main event a lecture examined how Shakespeare's A Midsummer
Night's Dream was trimmed, coiffured, given a virtual short-back-and-sides
to suit late 17th-century fashion. An example of how individual lines were
rewritten was especially telling, not least because on this occasion we were
to get Elkanah Settle's version of the play together with Purcell's music,
both complete, though unstaged - a full four-hour entertainment, which
overran vastly.
The re-coupling of play and music is for special occasions only. There is
barely any connection between the two, except the overall feel of the period
spectacle, best judged when seen (if ever again) with the lavish sets and
costumes that were an integral part of the show. The interesting feature at
the Queen Elizabeth Hall was how vividly the neutered portions of the
Shakespeare still held the attention - a plus point for some lively acting.
Any thinking conductor of Purcell these days has his opinions on the texts
and Norrington is no exception. For The Fairy Queen he re-ordered a couple
of items. He has no double-bass in the London Baroque Players. And he
prefers high tenors (Howard Crook and Mark Padmore, nicely contrasted, both
able and musical) to counter-tenors.
After a couple of very characterful performances of this piece recently in
London from Les Arts Florissants and the Gabrieli Consort, it seemed at
first that Norrington might be on the dry side. The Schutz Choir was not
placed ideally forward. Nor were all the female soloists as well parted as
Lorraine Hunt, who had a few uncertainties as to where the music was going,
but none at all about her voice, a full, gleaming, far from standard baroque
soprano.
By the end, however, all doubts had faded. Norrington had given us humour
without vulgarity, variety without gratuitous extra colouring, the passing
shortcomings of his rivals. How inventive a score this is, full of magic,
comedy and feeling - in so many ways a worthy parallel to the Shakespeare
play it so naughtily misrepresents.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Ballet Imperial - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We hear those first grand, declamatory chords of Tchaikovsky's second piano
concerto. The Opera House curtains part, and there is the Eugene Berman
front-cloth: a balustrade, the basin of a fountain frozen in winter's grip,
a distant dome.
Then through the gauze we see the double-headed eagle, the flambeaux and
pillars, and in front of them the facing diagonals of dancers, who are the
courtiers in the ritual that is to follow. They make formal bows to each
other, and this vision of St. Petersburg as a symbol of imperial power and
imperial art casts its spell. We are in some great gallery of the Winter
Palace; and outside, the sublime city gleams in the frozen northern light.
George Balanchine made Ballet Imperial in 1941 as a comment on the old
repertory - and the old world - in which he had been reared as a student in
Petersburg, and, I would venture, as testimony to his belief in its
continuing significance. (The occasion was a wartime tour designed to take
American classic ballet to South America: it is ironic that the piece showed
American dancers performing an essentially Russian work. Concerto Barocco,
the other creation for the tour, was truly American, in exposing
Balanchine's New World classicism).
The choreography is an exhilaratingly beautiful realisation of the score.
The diamond flash of the pianism defines the ballerina role, with its parure
of brilliant-cut entries, as, too, the joyous bravura demanded of the
subsidiary trio of a second ballerina and two men. The elegiac slow movement
shows the leading danseur as a prince to whom the ballerina appears as a
vision (it is resonant of Sleeping Beauty's second act). The final allegro
is marked con fuoco, and Balanchine calls for fire in step to match
Tchaikovsky's blaze of notes.
The piece is a marvel, as we have known ever since Balanchine mounted it at
Covent Garden in 1950, when it was given the superbly evocative Berman
designs, happily restored last season. It has, in the past, also been danced
with the combination of stunning prowess and classic authority that is the
key to its identity. Moira Shearer, Nadia Nerina, Antoinette Sibley, and
Michael Somes and David Blair in the cavalier's role, have led tremendous
casts. On Saturday afternoon it returned to the stage: I think it a work so
vital for the Royal Ballet's health, so challenging and rewarding, that it
ought never to be long absent from the repertory.
With a sense of charity proper at this time of year, I must assume that what
we saw was a singularly dismal dress rehearsal. The corps de ballet looked
ragged, undisciplined, with lines erratic, and such positions as attitudes
entirely at odds in a group of four danseuses. Patterns were cramped, and
this in a ballet where the interplay of lines is vital. The principals
seemed to me unsuited or unprepared for their tasks: what should have been
grandiloquent, elegantly brilliant, was inexact or anxious.
Only Sarah Wildor, as one of the two demi-soloists in green, showed what the
ballet could be: her aristocracy of manner, the distinction of every step,
were ideal. And I record with pleasure that certain niceties of the
choreographic text, which were overlooked at last season's revival, have
been restored.
This programme also brings back Tales of Beatrix Potter. A large number of
tots and their minders were audibly enraptured by what they saw. It is, I
reluctantly suppose, decent enough entertainment for infants. I cannot
believe that adults should be expected to spend 70 minutes watching pork
chops on the hoof and assorted vermin scampering about the Opera House
stage, masked, padded, in the throes of rampant cuteness.
It is, of course, a money-spinner for Covent Garden - and no worse
indictment can there be of current funding than that such tosh be seen in an
Opera House. In future, let the Royal Ballet take a theatre every Yuletide
and engage any jobbing dancers who may be around, to appear in it as a
cash-raising exercise. (It would probably run as long as The Mousetrap. They
might call it Claptrap.) It is unworthy of the Royal Ballet, and of Covent
Garden.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Limits set on competition rules -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week gave three important rulings which
limit the application of Rome Treaty competition rules in the context of
national laws restricting competition.
Two cases concerned national rules prohibiting the use of rebates and other
discounts or means of promotion by insurers and insurance intermediaries, in
particular in the form of passing on insurance agents' commissions. The
third concerned government price fixing for road transport.
The Court said it was well established that member countries were precluded
by the Treaty from adopting or maintaining measures capable of eliminating
the useful effect of the competition rules.
It confirmed that this would be infringed if a member country required or
encouraged the conclusion of agreements restricting competition, reinforced
the effects of such agreements, or removed the state character of any
regulation by delegating enforcement to private parties.
But the Court said the rule would not be infringed in the absence of any
connection between the national regulation and any business behaviour
otherwise caught by the cartel prohibition.
The issues arose in criminal proceedings before a Dutch court and two German
courts.
In the Dutch case the Dutch insurer Ohra was prosecuted for breach of a
national insurance intermediaries' regulation prohibiting insurance
companies from granting commissions, rebates and other benefits in kind to
anyone other than an intermediary. Ohra had advertised and granted to their
insureds various financial benefits, including the waiving of insurance
contract fees and free or reduced price credit cards.
The ECJ ruled the Dutch law neither required nor encouraged the conclusion
of an unlawful agreement by insurance intermediaries. Nor did it reinforce
any existing agreement since no agreement existed in the civil liability,
sickness, pension and life insurance classes covered by Ohra. Since the
regulation itself contained the prohibition, enforcement could not be said
to be delegated to private parties.
In the German insurance case a fine had been imposed on a Mr Meng, an
intermediary who infringed German law by passing on to his clients
commission paid to him by insurers. The ECJ gave the same interpretative
ruling as in the Ohra case.
In the second German case, dealing with road transport rate fixing, the ECJ
upheld the German system of rate fixing as a purely national regulation
outside the scope of European competition rules. The Court said although the
rates decided by the public authority were recommended by industry
representatives, those representatives acted as independent experts acting
on considerations of the public interest neither as parties to an agreement
nor in place of the state.
In spite of detailed arguments put before the Court by the European
Commission and by all 12 member states, the ECJ left undecided a number of
issues.
One concerned the reasons for its narrow interpretation of previous case law
on member country obligations in the context of European competition law
given its approach to regulation of the public sector and businesses granted
special rights.
Cases C-2/91, Meng; C-185/91, Reiff; and C-245/91, Ohra, ECJ FC, 17 November
1993.
Vat on advertising services
The ECJ has clarified the VAT rules applicable to advertising services in
three cases brought successfully by the Commission against France, Spain and
Luxembourg. The Court ruled the exception enjoyed by advertising to the
general rule that services should be taxed in the country where the provider
of services was based applied to all forms of promotional activities
connected with advertising. Thus all such promotional activities should be
taxed in the country of the recipient of the service.
Cases C-68/92, C-69/92 and C-73/92, Commission v France, Luxembourg and
Spain, ECJ FC, 17 November 1993.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Airlines opt to fly on a wing and a
prayer - Compensation leaves travellers cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's airlines broke ranks last November to become the first in the world
to lift the ceiling on compensation paid to the victims of international air
disasters. Ten Japanese airlines led by Japan Air Lines abandoned the
compensation cap of Dollars 140,000 for each passenger which they had
adopted under the 1929 Warsaw Convention.
The JAL initiative followed 21 years of failed industry attempts to raise
compensation limits governed by the convention and the 1966 Montreal
Agreement, which sets a limit of Dollars 75,000 for each passenger for
flights to and from the US. Warsaw Convention limits range from Dollars
10,000 to nearly Dollars 140,000 and are seen as too low and an
embarrassment to most airlines and their insurers in the event of a crash.
Although JAL seemed under pressure to break the ceiling for international
flights after lifting the ceiling for domestic flights in 1982, and having
paid out average settlements believed to be in the region of Dollars 850,000
a passenger to the victims of the 1985 JAL Boeing 747 crash, it was widely
thought the Japanese decision would force other big airlines to follow suit.
Aviation industry observers predicted public pressure would force other
airlines to act. A year later, however, no airline has followed the Japanese
initiative.
According to Mr Peter Martin, aviation lawyer with London solicitors Frere
Cholmeley Bischoff who pioneered the revised conditions of carriage for JAL,
the main excuse offered by the airlines for sheltering behind the
anachronistic Warsaw and Montreal compensation limits is that the insurance
costs of removing or raising the compensation ceiling would be prohibitive.
He says airlines are reluctant to go to the insurance market for quotations
as they fear they can't afford it. But in fact airlines ought to be able to
obtain cover from the market at a reasonable price.
First, with an average of 1,000 deaths a year from aviation accidents
against 300m passengers carried, the risk is very small. Second, insurance
represents about 1 per cent of fixed costs split 50/50 on hull insurance and
liability cover. So the increased cost of raising the limits as a percentage
of operating costs is likely to be very small.
However, he accepts that the airlines' reluctance to approach the market
must be seen in the context of generally increased premiums as insurers take
advantage of a rising market. According to Willis Corroon Aerospace, a
leading buyer of airline insurance, many airlines which renewed their
policies on October 1 paid steep increases. On average, international
airlines are facing increases of about 60 per cent in the cost of insurance
cover.
Airlines have also held back from unilateral action to raise or remove
limits pending the outcome of several European and airline trade association
initiatives.
In February, the European Commission indicated that it was interested in
promoting a special contract for European airlines which would raise limits
to Ecu 300,000 or Ecu 500,000. Again, airlines are concerned about the
insurance costs.
The European Civil Aviation Conference undertook its own study and
recommended an increase in the limits from Ecu 100,000 to Ecu 250,000 to
take account of inflation over 22 years. Insurance costs are said to be the
stumbling block.
The International Air Transport Association has advised its airline members
that before they can begin discussions about bilateral or multi-lateral
special contracts to bypass compensation limits, anti-trust immunity is
required from the US competition authorities.
Official IATA policy is that MAP3, the third Protocol to the Montreal
Agreement, should be brought into force. MAP3 would raise the Montreal limit
from Dollars 75,000 to Dollars 130,000 and allow its sovereign signatories
to set up 'supplemental compensation plans' (SCPs). This would give rise to
a two-tier system: airlines would be responsible for the first Dollars
130,000 for each passenger; and the SCP would provide compensation above
that amount for which passengers would pay an enforced levy.
The practical view, however, is that MAP3 is a dead letter. MAP3 cannot come
into force until it has been ratified by at least 30 states, which is
regarded as unlikely unless the US supports the move. Washington's position
on compensation is unclear, but it is generally accepted within the industry
that the US will not now ratify MAP3.
There is some support for the Japanese initiative in the US but airlines
emphasise they cannot discuss the possibility of raising or removing the
ceiling on compensation without anti-trust immunity, which is not available.
All these delays in acting to change the outdated limits mean that if there
is a big air disaster it will be followed by protracted litigation and by
settlement delays.
The 1988 Pan Am disaster at Lockerbie provides a good example, Mr Martin
says. Five years after the disaster the issue of compensation is still
unresolved. The New York Second Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled
on Pan Am's appeal against a finding that it was guilty of 'wilful
misconduct'; if found guilty compensation could be paid exceeding the
Montreal limits.
The industry is lucky that there have been no big air accidents this year,
he says, but statistically one is overdue.
The beauty of the Japanese scheme is that it ought to significantly cut the
delay in obtaining compensation by removing the need to litigate in most
cases. Victims and their families will be able to negotiate settlements
directly with airlines which will take responsibility for recovering money
from aircraft and engine manufacturers.
Mr Martin says it is astonishing that airlines do not act individually or
collectively. It is inconceivable that US anti-trust authorities would take
action against airlines discussing measures to benefit the travelling
public. And he insists insurance must be available on the world market at a
reasonable price.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the past 12 months is that the
Japanese initiative appears to have left the travelling public cold.
In theory, the absence of any limit on liability or higher limits ought to
have a big impact on consumer choice and could offer airlines that adopt it
a competitive advantage. The problem is that airlines cannot easily
advertise the concept that in the event of a death, some airlines will pay
more compensation than their competitors.
Surveys of the factors influencing choice of airline among business
travellers show that the public is more interested in efficiency -
convenient scheduling, punctuality, and speed of check-in - than with
security, liability, and insurance. Until that changes, world-class airlines
will be free to hide behind compensation limits not available to other
industries of comparable size and profitability.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Green log book for land use histories
 -Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's decision in March to abandon plans to set up registers
of contaminated land has left property owners, occupiers, investors and
financial institutions with a problem. When they come to sell, let or
mortgage their land, increasingly these days they will be asked, or will be
asking, detailed questions about past uses and possible or actual
contamination. The registers would have provided a source for some of this
information. Now it will have to be sought elsewhere.
Physical surveys of the land can be carried out to establish if it is
contaminated, but without a history of a site it will be all too easy for
even the most comprehensive survey to choose the wrong location from which
to take samples and to test for the wrong contaminants.
To counteract these problems, City solicitors Norton Rose have devised and
developed a 'green log book' (akin to a service history of a second-hand
car), which will allow land owners and occupiers to create land use
histories and to keep an up-to-date record of present use. The log book
would not only cover contamination of the ground but also uses of the land
which pollute air or water and which as a result could have polluted
adjoining land.
With more environmental legislation in the pipeline and the costs to
industry of clean-up soaring, Norton Rose predict a green log book will
become an essential record for owners and occupiers, whether or not their
uses of the land involve contaminative processes. The firm says responsible
businesses could make the log book available to regulatory bodies as
evidence of compliance with environmental legislation and monitoring
procedures. It would also demonstrate a commitment to best practice.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Project control by disc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and other donors and lenders lose large sums on overseas projects
because no one can check paper and computer records to see if contracts were
awarded to best effect.
Linesman, in Nottingham, England, has spent four years developing a way to
change that, while getting projects completed more quickly and efficiently.
The company supplies software for personal computers which can help control
projects, from the initial ordering to the hand-over of equipment to users,
with maintenance information on disc. The software pulls together the common
equipment required for different sites, making it feasible to place larger
orders with manufacturers, instead of smaller ones with many different
suppliers.
Under the system, bidders for contracts make their offers on disc. The
buyer, or whoever is financing the deal, can easily scan the offers; if a
competent supplier bid the lowest but did not get the job, this becomes
plain. The software also helps plan how best to collect equipment for
shipping - not to a warehouse but to the sites where it will be used.
Tecquipment, a UK company, is using Linesman software to equip 120
laboratories in 33 Turkish universities with more than 55,000 pieces of
equipment of 3,500 different kinds.
The software is also being used on a USAID-funded scheme for equipping seven
agricultural schools in Egypt and on World Bank-funded schemes in Hungary
and Kazakhstan.
Kevin Whitt, Linesman's managing director, spotted the need for the
company's system while selling educational equipment in the Middle East. He
realised this was often delivered without the appropriate information and
saw the importance of reforming the whole procurement process.
He formed Linesman after winning a competition for a procurement system for
Hong Hong's University of Science and Technology.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Pilots of the airwaves - Radio networks are
slowly becoming accepted and may revolutionise communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pocket telephones ring in railway carriages, pagers beep in the middle of
conferences, fax machines even spew out messages in the boot of a car. Radio
communications, it would seem, are everywhere.
So it was with disappointment that critics greeted the August launch of
Apple Computer's Newton, a personal digital assistant, or PDA for short. It
soon became apparent that the book-sized message pad could only send brief
messages and only then to another Newton located nearby using low-powered,
infra-red beams.
The problem for Apple was not that there were too few methods of
communication, but too many. 'Imagine you were on the Newton development
team. What communications would you have put in?' asks Larry Taylor, manager
of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple's European research and
development centre. 'In Utopia, there would just be one means of
communicating which would meet everyone's needs. Unfortunately it's not like
that.'
In Europe alone, Taylor points out, there are at least four digital radio
systems beginning operation. In the US and Japan, further new services
proliferate.
A further hitch has been the size of the plug-in equipment needed to bring
communications - bigger than the PDA itself. However, the PCMCIA card, an
electronic board about the size of a credit card, should soon enable the
Newton to communicate over mobile telephone networks or even PC networks,
using the latest radio local area networks (Lans).
PCMCIA cards, which conform to standards devised by the Personal Computer
Memory Card International Association, are already widely used in electronic
diaries and organisers for delivering stored information. Now, says Jim
Derbyshire, director and founder of Cambridge-based Symbionics, the radio
communications development specialists, they have become the enabling factor
for PDAs. 'The emergence of that de facto standard opens up the ability for
radio communications.'
Taylor acknowledges the appeal of such a system. 'With half a dozen PCMCIA
cards you could cover just about everything.'
Companies such as AT&amp;T/NCR and Olivetti, which manufacture radio-based Lans
to link PCs by radio rather than wire, believe PCMCIA cards will be on sale
by the middle of next year. They are looking to PDAs and notebook PCs to
elevate radio Lans from their present Cinderella role into mainstream
computing.
'Personally, I think we will see them becoming widespread as the decade
moves on,' says Andrew Bud, division manager of wireless systems at
Olivetti.
Even when PCMCIA cards are available, there will still be the problem of
whether enough applications are available to ensure consumers and businesses
want to buy the PCMCIA cards, says Bud.
Taylor agrees that it is a 'chicken and egg' situation, but believes a third
factor has to be in place - the infrastructure. 'Newton falls squarely into
the infrastructure black hole.'
Today's widespread cellular radio systems are analogue, not the digital
systems needed for the easy transmission of data. The coverage offered by
the pan-European digital telephone service GSM is patchy and its UK
derivative, PCN - the Mercury One-to-One service - is still novel.
Although radio Lans have been mooted for several years, problems defining
the standards and the lack of allocated radio spectrum has meant they are
also in their infancy. 'Getting into market was actually the hardest thing,'
says Bud.
Other factors have hampered the acceptance of radio Lans, not least the
recession, says Adrian Ridley-Jones, senior consultant at Logica.
'Organisations have already identified the structures needed and have Lans
in place. Existing Lans have to be phased out before organisations will look
at radio Lans in earnest.'
There are obvious advantages to having a radio network rather than a wired
one in the office. PCs can easily be moved from desk to desk without the
need for re-wiring. Anyone with a PDA or notebook PC who has official access
to the network can retrieve data or print documents from anywhere in the
building - in a meeting, for example.
'My best friends are rats, asbestos and bureaucrats,' says Bud. Rats gnaw
through cables, walls filled with asbestos cannot have holes drilled in them
and bureaucrats list buildings, so preventing cabling from being installed.
A fourth growth area for radio Lans, he believes, will be
'architecturally-challenged buildings' - anything with solid concrete
pillars and little space for ducting.
Where radio Lans have been installed to date, it has been to extend
corporate wired networks, says Justin van der Lande, marketing manager at
AT&amp;T/NCR for Wavelan, its radio Lan. However, he concedes, 'there hasn't
been a dramatic take-up of product'.
A further factor slowing down sales has been the confusion over the
different systems and the frequencies in which they operate. In Europe, the
Olivetti system operates in a frequency band at around 1.9 GHz, the
frequency allocated for cordless telephones. The Olivetti system, on the
other hand, operates at 2.4 Gig, in the ISM (industrial, scientific and
medical) band.
In the US, the ISM band is available, as are frequencies at 18 GHz. Last
month the regulatory authorities also announced that the 1.9 GHz slot would
be available for radio Lans as well as mobile telephones. However, some
modifications will have to be made to the European equipment to enable it to
work to US rules.
The good news is that both the US and European standards organisations have
recognised the importance of adopting a single frequency and a single
standard for the next generation of radio Lans - dubbed hyperlan - which
will operate at very high speeds. A draft standard for hyperlan will be
published by the end of 1994.
Even given the goodwill on both sides, it will be some time before such a
standard is converted into products which can be purchased. 'High-speed data
will be a long way down the line - post-2000 and something,' says John
Davis, group leader in the mobility services sector at BT's Martlesham
research laboratories.
'For quite a long time we're going to get low-speed systems. You could
probably use those for your Newton, but they're of no use if you've got a
workstation and you're shipping computer-aided designs backwards and
forwards.'
Further worries for potential radio Lan users include eavesdropping and
interference with the data. And following the scares in the US linking the
use of mobile telephones with cancer, manufacturers could face health scares
as well.
Ridley-Jones dismisses such fears, saying the power output needed to
transmit data such short distances - up to 50m - is negligible. 'There is
talk that over 1W is cause for concern,' he says, but points out that the
military regularly transmits data at more than 50W. In effect, says
Derbyshire, radio Lans will operate on average at one hundredth of a watt -
compared with 2W for a portable telephone.
Derbyshire believes many of the problems facing radio Lans are cultural as
much as technical. 'It needs three people to work together: the computer
manufacturer, the PABX manufacturer and the provider of the plug-in card.'
In the US, in particular, he believes it is a battle between the computer
and telecoms companies. 'There's a high level of politics in it. Computers
become phones and phones become computers.'
Derbyshire says the problems will eventually be overcome. 'It will happen
because market forces will dictate it.'
Taylor is also optimistic, even about what he calls 'Star Trek'
applications. 'It would be nice to think you could get public access to
things such as maps when you're lost in the street,' he muses. 'Personally
I'm convinced that the benefits of being able to communicate without having
to plug into the wall are enormous.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Window opens for IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM has just announced 'OS/2 for Windows', a version of its personal
computer operating system that sidesteps Microsoft. Until now, IBM has been
paying about Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.40) to Microsoft on each copy of OS/2
sold, for a total of about Dollars 80m.
OS/2 for Windows will deny Microsoft tens of millions of dollars in future
royalty payments as IBM puts its marketing efforts behind the 'Windowless'
version of its operating system. IBM expects OS/2 for Windows to double the
monthly shipments of OS/2 by the end of December.
'Most PC users already have a copy of Windows and have already paid the
licensing fee. There is no reason why they should pay twice for software
they already have,' says an IBM representative. OS/2 for Windows allows the
IBM operating system to merge with a PC user's copy of Windows 3.1, allowing
Windows, Dos and OS/2 applications to run on the same system.
However, IBM could face potential problems with this approach.
'I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft produces a future version of Windows
that prevents other operating systems from hooking into it,' says Jesse
Berst, industry analyst and editor of Windows Watcher newsletter.
John Roberts, group product manager for Windows at Microsoft, says that OS/2
for Windows users might face problems running some business applications
that use Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding technology, allowing
different applications to share the same data.
IBM says it has found no significant problems in running Windows
applications.
IBM will continue to sell a version of OS/2 that includes the current
version of Windows, but once Microsoft releases new versions, IBM will no
longer have the rights to include updated Windows software in OS/2.

Gerry Grimstone, who joined Schroders from the Treasury seven years ago, has
moved out of the investment banking division to head the newly created
international financing and advisory department. Whereas investment banking
handles UK mergers and acquisitions and flotations as well as overseas M &amp; A
work in those countries where the bank has a local presence, Grimstone's new
domain has taken charge of equity capital market activities worldwide.
Current assignments include advising the Greek government on the
privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE and the Italians on the
INA life assurance company sell-off.
Grimstone's department falls within the new international finance division
under group managing director William Slee. Bernard Dewe Mathews, who looks
after international projects and contractor advisory and financing
activities, heads the other department, to be known as the international
projects department.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tina Townsend has been appointed the new chief executive of the Business and
Technology Council, one of the bodies which validates vocational
qualifications.
She succeeds John Sellars, who has led Btec from its inception in 1983.
Townsend takes up her appointment in February 1994 from her present post as
chief executive of the National Health Service Training Directorate. Her
recent experience of leading a major organisation through a period of change
will be apposite for Btec which is at the forefront of change in vocational
education in an effort to meet the government's national education and
training targets.
Townsend, 46, started her career as a lecturer in vocational education and
training at the University of Wales and was a senior research officer with
the Manpower Services Commission. She joined the NHS Training Authority as
director of research in 1984.
She said yesterday: 'Britain's need for a fully motivated and technically
equipped workforce has never been greater.'
A self-financing organisation, Btec was set up in 1983 by the then
Department of Education and Science with the aim of promoting and developing
quality work-related programmes.

FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Walker takes over at Swalec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new group chief executive of South Wales Electricity, Andrew Walker, is
clearly a man who ignores the herd and sails his own course.
In 1975, a time when many students and young people were campaigning against
companies - in particular Barclays Bank - for their connections with South
Africa, Walker, recently graduated from Cambridge, showed an independent
mind and went off to Johannesburg to work for the South African Chamber of
Mines. His task was to increase gold mining productivity, using his
engineering degrees.
At 42, Walker, a former pupil at Ampleforth, now takes over at South Wales
Electricity, recently re-named Swalec, a company with a market
capitalisation of some Pounds 660m.
He joins on Thursday though he will actually take over in January 1994,
following David Jones's move to be chief executive at the National Grid
Company.
Walker has long had ties with electricity generation, having been sponsored
by the Central Electricity Generating Board during his first degree. While
in South Africa he joined Dowty, remaining with the company through a
variety of posts until leaving in August this year.
Swalec had been talking to Walker about taking up the new post for the past
six weeks. According to Wynford Evans, Swalec's chairman, Walker will be
expected not just to 'control our core business but also to lead in
developing our opportunities in cable, television and telephony, as well as
to pull our contracting subsidiaries in better order'.

FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Thomas Cook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Rider has been appointed managing director of Financial Institution
Services at Thomas Cook.
Rider, 40, joins the travel and financial services group from Storehouse,
where he was group finance director, as well as being finance director of
British Home Stores. Previous jobs were also in the retail sector as
financial controller at Woolworths and at House of Fraser.
A move to Thomas Cook's retail travel chain would have kept Rider in a mass
consumer industry. His responsibilities on Thomas Cook's financial side
will, however, be somewhat different. The subsidiary he will head provides
travellers' cheques, foreign currencies, drafts and wires to about 8,000
financial institutions.
Rider concedes that his new job is in a different line of business from his
previous positions. But he says his retail background will help him fulfil
Thomas Cook's aim for the subsidiary, which is to improve customer service.
Another change is the move from a quoted UK company to an organisation
controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank and LTU, the German travel group.
Rider says that although he will no longer have to deal with shareholder
matters, Thomas Cook is sufficiently large to provide him with other
challenges.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Feeling the pinch - The
death-knell is sounding for many of Japan's subcontractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kiyoshi Ikeda, owner of IKD, a small machine-tool and precision parts maker
in Ota, Tokyo, sighs as he looks out at his neighbourhood from an office
above his factory. 'The area used to be full of other businesses like ours.
At night we all used to go drinking at the local yakitori shop. Now it's
empty most nights,' he says.
Ota, populated mainly by small manufacturers and subcontractors of large car
and electronic companies, is one of Japan's deteriorating mini-industrial
districts. In these areas, small-business confidence has recently sunk to
lows last reached during the 1975 recession.
According to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private credit research agency,
bankruptcies at small and medium-sized businesses are up 30 per cent on the
previous year, compared with about 4 per cent at large companies.
On top of the economic slump, Japan's subcontractors, which make up 56 per
cent of the country's small businesses, have been hit by restructuring at
larger corporations. Much of this was planned in the early 1980s but the
changes were never implemented as the economy boomed later in the decade.
The effect of the restructuring is that leading manufacturers are making
fewer model changes and lengthening their product cycles. Components are
designed to be shared among a number of models, while the big companies are
starting to produce many of the parts and components themselves.
Meanwhile, the appreciation of the yen is accelerating the move to
lower-cost production centres overseas, leaving smaller subcontractors
behind.
As a result, many large manufacturers are reviewing existing relationships
with their subcontractors. Mazda, the car manufacturer, for example, is
cutting its first-tier suppliers from 62 companies to 16, while Isuzu is
telling its suppliers to reduce their reliance on the company.
Until now, the competitiveness of large Japanese car and electronics makers
had been supported by pyramid keiretsu, or corporate grouping structures
consisting of four to five layers of subcontractors. Sony has about 100
first-tier subcontractors and Toyota Motor has more than 300. These in turn
are supplied by scores of second- and third-tier smaller businesses. These
small companies have been a vital source of flexibility, allowing not only
employment stability in large companies but bearing the brunt of price cuts
by agreeing to sharp cuts in profit margins during the hard times.
Close co-operation in the research and development of a new product allowed
large manufacturers to procure high-quality, low-cost products. At the same
time, subcontractors were able to acquire sophisticated technology, allowing
even small concerns such as Ikeda's to use computerised machine tools.
Because of this reliance and the lack of formal contracts, most suppliers
are now vulnerable. Car and electronics makers may be telling subcontractors
to diversify and reduce dependence on a sole customer, but many are
exploiting the situation.
There are many stories of small companies forced to choose between slashing
prices or being cut off the pyramid. Business associations which support
small enterprises claim many large companies are breaking a law which
forbids them from cancelling orders to subcontractors without due notice, or
demanding discounts on goods at the time of payment. 'There are lots of
cases under the surface, but most small companies cannot complain for fear
of angering the larger companies,' says the National Federation of Merchant
and Industrialist's Organisations.
Large manufacturers say they have no control over what happens beyond the
second tier of suppliers. 'We only deal with our first-tier suppliers and as
far as we know, we are abiding by the rules,' says Nissan Motor. The Japan
Communist Party, currently lobbying for the rights of subcontractors, wants
regulations at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry changed so
that the manufacturer at the head of the pyramid takes responsibility for
businesses within the whole structure.
If there is little prospect of regulatory protection, the chances of
economic salvation also look fairly remote. Hopes of a recovery in the
economy in the second half of the year have receded as fears over falls in
real income among workers have depressed consumer confidence. Initial hopes
of a recovery boosted commercial lending to small businesses with capital of
Y100m (Pounds 629,000) or less and workers of 300 or less by 15.1 per cent
during the April to June quarter. But the trend failed to last and bankers
do not expect demand for funds to recover in the near future. In order to
avoid interest costs, small companies are liquidating deposits rather than
applying for new loans.
Even though Japan's small manufacturers managed to survive two oil shocks in
the 1970s and the surge of the yen in the mid-1980s, many fear there may not
be a way out of the current business downturn. According to a study by the
Small Business Finance Corporation, more than 60 per cent of a sample of 840
subcontractors said they would seek salvation from their parent companies
during the endaka (or the 'high yen' recession) in 1986. The most recent
survey by the same organisation, however, indicated that more than one fifth
of 1,600 businesses polled did not know what to do, while 43.1 per cent said
they would try to diversify business relationships.
Miti, which established Japan's post-war manufacturing industry, is aware of
the negative consequences of the demise of small businesses. However, the
ministry, which virtually established Japan's economic success with its
strong guiding hand, has lost the control it once had over industries as
corporate Japan has become increasingly international and powerful.
Moreover, the squeeze on small businesses comes as many business owners are
ageing and many younger Japanese, captivated by the image of suit-clad
businessmen clutching a portable telephone, are avoiding jobs at smaller
businesses. Ikeda sums up many attitudes. 'I've gone through a few
recessions but everyone is saying this one is different. Besides, we're all
growing old. We don't have the energy to fight any more,' he says.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Hungary for UK exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is to export its know-how on enterprise agencies to Hungary in an
attempt to help the former communist country foster entrepreneurship.
Final plans are still being worked out, but the main principles were
revealed last week in Budapest by Tony Faint, a senior civil servant
involved with the UK's Know-How Fund for assisting the development of market
economies in the former eastern bloc.
Faint was addressing a conference organised by the OECD and B'nai B'rith, a
UK-based Jewish charity which frequently lends its own members - many of
them former refugees from eastern Europe - as small business consultants
Three years into market reforms, the conference was told, many of Hungary's
small and medium-sized businesses are short of working capital. Many have
already mortgaged their assets so they have little collateral to offer their
banks, which are themselves short on liquidity.
'But we need partnership, not assistance,' Peter Szirmai, president of the
Association of Hungarian Entrepreneurs, emphasised. 'We don't have enough
experience.' What he says his members do not want, however, are more
consultants with services to sell; they cannot afford them.
Kata Koves, vice-president of the Hungarian women entrepreneurs'
association, said: 'My experience is quite frightening. Most of our 400
members live without a business plan and from hand to mouth.'
The UK's enterprise agencies developed out of a similar need. Sponsored by
government, local authorities and the private sector, their role was to
offer free advice. Hungary is already following the UK pattern by planning a
network of similar agencies.
Faint said the UK would concentrate on making the Hungarian network strong,
with proper training, using Durham University Business School and links to
experienced agencies in Britain, possibly with exchanges of staff.
'We also want to help development of entrepreneurial attitudes and practice
in the general population,' he added. He cited Shell's Livewire scheme,
which helps train young entrepreneurs for self-employment, as an example.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stronger growth in the
country / A look at rural and urban employment patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the last three decades employment in rural manufacturing companies has
been growing relative to their urban counterparts. This is not so much due
to relocation, but because firms in the country have been taking on
proportionately more workers.
At last week's Small Firms conference in Nottingham, a question posed was
whether this growth in rural jobs is economically sustainable or whether
businesses there may be fundamentally inefficient.
Using evidence from companies that have survived and grown over a 10-year
period, researchers David North and David Smallbone of Middlesex University
showed markedly different employment generation patterns.*
A 200 per cent increase in sales for a London company, for example, led to
only a 66 per cent increase in employment; a similar sales rise for a rural
business would have tripled the number of additional jobs.
'Whilst small and medium-sized enterprises in urban areas would appear to
have a similar ability to achieve growth as firms elsewhere, they are more
likely to achieve it in ways that minimise the number of additional workers
employed directly by the firm,' Smallbone says.
There are some obvious constraints on urban firms. Wage levels are higher in
towns and cities; there is also a greater opportunity to subcontract, while
rural companies have to be more self-sufficient.
The research also shows that urban firms tend to adopt growth strategies
that deliberately avoid taking on labour.
Smallbone says the research does not have specific policy implications. It
nevertheless suggests that those who see small firms as an important source
of job creation should acknowledge the different employment patterns.
On the subject of business - as opposed to employee - growth the conference
heard a new paper on the Business Start Up Scheme (the name now given to
what was originally the Enterprise Allowance Scheme and not to be confused
with the forerunner of the Business Expansion Scheme).
The EAS/BSUS was launched in 1981 as a means of supporting unemployed people
wanting to make the transition to self employment. It was later handed over
to the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) to administer.
Research by Shailendra Vyakarnam and Robin Jacobs, of Transitions, a
management research and development group, however, suggests much of the
effort has been misplaced.** Many individuals backed by TECs have failed and
few of those which survive ever progress beyond micro-businesses.
'There is evidence to suggest that growth businesses are started by teams
and not by individuals,' says Vyakarnam.
'It is time to take another look at the start-up process and see if it is
possible to re-design the delivery of support.'
The idea that teams rather than individuals are more likely to produce
businesses capable of growing is not new. Indeed when Compaq, the US
computer group, was founded a decade ago it adopted the team approach and
described itself as a 'big business starting small'.
Studies carried out in Essex and Hertfordshire demonstrate that most
putative entrepreneurs do not recognise the need for teams. The vast
majority of people considering a new business had not discussed their ideas
with anybody beyond their immediate family, the research showed.
Vyakarnam argues that the government might have a better chance of
supporting companies capable of growth if it reduced support for some of the
TECs' traditional start-up programmes and backed programmes that help build
teams.

The National Association of Head Teachers has warned Mr John Major of the

It has told the prime minister: 'Not nearly enough has been said about the

Mr David Hart, general secretary, said teachers had less and less time to

Lord Tebbit last night accused Britain's political establishment - the
government and the opposition parties - of disorientating and destabilising
the nation.
The former Tory minister and party chairman claimed that parliament was
'living on borrowed time', subservient to Brussels and impotent. He said:
'What are we to make of a governing party which, with the full support of
the two opposition parties, had dedicated itself to the dissolving of the
superglue of nationality?'
Lord Tebbit also warned that Britain was 'drifting towards becoming a
largely pagan society' in which some churches were blessing homosexual
liaisons and where polygamy was recognised when once bigamists were
criminals.

The BMW six-cylinder diesel engine is widely recognised as one of the best
car diesel engines in production.
It is understood that BMW is also in negotiations with General Motors Europe
to supply the diesel engine for use in GM's new generation Opel and Vauxhall
Omega executive car to be launched next year.
Rover uses its own 2.5-litre direct injection diesel engine in its Land

FT  23 NOV 93 / Welsh council reform to be delayed a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will delay the implementation of local government reform in
Wales for a year in what could be an embarrassment for Mr John Redwood, the
Welsh secretary.
Mr Redwood had intended to make a statement confirming the decision last
night, at the end of the Queen's Speech debate in the Commons on local
government reform.
However, protesting Liberal Democrat MPs prevented him from delivering most
of his speech as they forced a technical vote which used up the time he
needed at the end of the third day's debate on the Queen's Speech. Mr
Redwood said he was 'appalled by the unnecessary division'.
The delay in implementing the measures, which will create unitary local
authorities in Wales and Scotland, has been caused by pressures on the
parliamentary timetable for legislation.
The government originally proposed that its bill to reform local authorities
should become law in the spring, to be followed by elections to the new
shadow councils in Wales next June.
But although the bill will be introduced in the House of Lords as early as
next week, it is unlikely to be debated by the Commons before next February
 -leaving political parties with too little time to campaign for Welsh
elections in the summer.
Ministers expect the legislation to be enacted in the current session. But
government officials said yesterday the Welsh polls would probably take
place in 1995, with officers taking up their posts in 1996.
Speculation over the postponement dominated yesterday's Commons debate on
local government. The government plans to set up 21 new authorities to
replace eight counties and 37 districts in Wales. In Scotland, ministers are
planning 25 councils, replacing nine regions and 53 districts.
Introducing the debate, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said a
single-tier system would reduce the public's confusion over the services
that were provided by particular authorities.
However Mr George Robertson, in his first Commons appearance as shadow
Scottish secretary, accused the government of indulging in a 'gerrymandering
extravaganza' in the way it had drawn boundaries for the new authorities.
The Council of Welsh Districts, which has broadly welcomed the reform
proposals, said last night that it was disappointed by the postponement.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Lloyd's agrees payment scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The governing council at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday
ratified in principle the structure for a settlement of legal claims by
loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets underwrite the market.
No public announcement was made because a number of details must still be
finalised including the exact size of the settlement to be offered and its
timing.
It is understood, however, that errors-and-omissions insurers, who cover
agents against legal awards for negligence, recently agreed to contribute at
least Pounds 300m to a deal.
Agents in the market have been asked to provide information to the council
by Wednesday on the exposure of individual loss-making Names in past
underwriting years. Meanwhile, talks continued on the future of two troubled
syndicates managed by Merrett Underwriting Agency Management, which in turn
could threaten the Merrett Group.
Efforts have so far proved unsuccessful to persuade members' agents to
provide sufficient new capacity to Merrett's two biggest syndicates, 418 and
1067.
The syndicates' problems were aggravated last week by the collapse of a deal
under which Travelers, the US insurance company, would have offered support
to Merrett.
This could mean the two syndicates are too small for their members to write
business in 1994. Agents were believed late last week to be offering Pounds
32m or Pounds 33m compared with this year's figure of Pounds 150m and an
estimated minimum requirement of Pounds 50m.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Private mines hope to win Pounds 300m damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private opencast coal miners in the UK believe they could win more than
Pounds 300m in damages after a recommendation to the European Court of
Justice over a dispute with British Coal involving royalties and prices.
The court's advocate-general, in a written opinion, has strengthened
independent companies' belief that they have a strong case for arguing that
British Coal's royalties and charging regime distort competition.
Disclosure of the case in Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter, came as
British Coal announced plans to close Littleton colliery in Staffordshire,
until recently considered one of its core pits, with the loss of more than
500 jobs.
The European Court case arose after British Coal suggested HJ Banks and
other companies could not seek remedy under competition rules of the EC
Treaty where that treaty was more extensive than the European Coal and Steel
Community Treaty.
However the advocate-general has suggested that the EC Treaty may be
applicable 'even though the products concerned fall in principle within the
scope of the ECSC Treaty.'
Banks and other companies have for several years been mounting a legal
challenge to what they consider to be British Coal's excessive royalty
charges and the alleged low prices it offers them for coal.
The European Court is expected to rule on whether it accepts the
advocate-general's opinion later in the year. If it agrees, the matter will
be referred to the UK High Court, which asked for the European Court's
judgment.
Coal UK says some independent companies' fortunes would be transformed if
the decision over royalties and charges went their way. For some, the claim
against British Coal is their most valuable asset.
The advocate-general says he can 'well imagine that the imposition of an
unreasonably high royalty rate or an unreasonably low purchase price for
coal extracted is capable of preventing, restricting or distorting normal
competition'.
Meanwhile the future of Wearmouth colliery in Sunderland was put in doubt
when British Coal said a reconvened meeting would be held to discuss the
pit's prospects.
Wearmouth was one of 12 pits reprieved by the government in March and has
been market tested in the past few months in an attempt to win extra sales.
In addition managers told local union officials that efficiencies needed to
be improved at Ellington colliery in Morpeth, Northumberland, if the pit was
to secure its future.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Ulster peace 'only by political deal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace in Northern Ireland can only come through a political settlement, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday, as
wrangling continued between London and Dublin over the pace of the peace
process.
Speculation mounted that the Anglo-Irish summit might be put back from the
December 3 date favoured by Dublin after Downing Street gave its clearest
hint yet that more time may be needed to set the framework for a settlement.
Officials sought to lower expectations of the Dublin meeting and said much
work on any draft communique was still to be done.
Detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement fall far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint
responsibility in the administration of the province, while recognising
Dublin's aspirations to a united Ireland.
In London, Lord Tebbit, the former Tory cabinet minister, sought to pour
more cold water on the Major-Reynolds initiative, telling an audience of
Tory rightwingers that the IRA would only lay down its arms for a deal that
undermined 'the union of Ulster within the United Kingdom'.
'So unless there is a willingness somewhere within government to undermine
that union . . . I find it difficult to understand why those in authority
speak of the prospects for peace,' he said.
The Irish government would not be satisfied with anything that did not
'advance the cause of the alternative union - that of a united Ireland'.
In Belfast Sir Patrick denied that differences between London and Dublin
were widening.
He said the people of Northern Ireland were 'longing for an end of violence
and they are longing for a political settlement that will enable people in
this divided community to live more tranquilly together'.
His remarks came a day after Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
stressed in a television interview the possibility of achieving peace before
a political settlement.
The Army confirmed yesterday that many soldiers in Northern Ireland have
abandoned helmets in favour of berets as part of a policy to 'soften' their
public image.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Small companies to shun Cadbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The majority of smaller quoted companies do not intend to comply fully with
the Cadbury code of corporate governance, says a survey by accountants
Coopers and Lybrand released yesterday.
Of a sample of 84 medium-sized and small listed companies outside the top
350 FT-SE companies, 55 per cent said they did not intend to follow every
aspect of the code. Eighteen per cent said they were making no changes.
Intention to comply declined with company size. Nearly two-thirds of those
with turnover below Pounds 50m a year said they would not comply fully,
falling to 42 per cent for those above Pounds 50m and 17 per cent for the
top 200 FT-SE companies, according to an earlier survey.
Companies expressed concern about the burdens and costs of implementing the
Cadbury code and said its introduction was too swift. The elements of the
code which they planned not to comply with were tied to those with which
they disagreed in principle.
One-third opposed the recommendation for boards to have at least three
non-executive directors and 58 per cent disagreed with the idea; 30 per cent
did not intend to comply with the requirement for an audit committee; 12 per
cent did not plan to make a clear division of responsibilities at the top of
the company; and 11 per cent had no plans to create a remuneration
committee.
Sir Brian Jenkins, a senior partner with Coopers, said: 'As things stand,
smaller companies will face the stigma of stating non-compliance with the
code which in many ways has been developed with the larger company in mind.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Builders launch quality forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction industry leaders yesterday launched an initiative to stamp out
building defects which they say cost the industry more than Pounds 1bn a
year.
The Construction Quality Forum will draw its members from developers,
contractors, architects, subcontractors and building material producers.
These will be expected to pool information on defects in a new national
database to be established by the forum.
Task forces from the industry and the government-sponsored Building Research
Establishment will be established to resolve any common problems which
emerge.
The Department of the Environment, mainly through its construction
sponsorship directorate, has provided Pounds 100,000 to establish the scheme
which is expected eventually to become self-financing from selling services
and from fees levied on members.
The project, to be run by the Building Research Establishment, is supported
by building insurance companies as well as contractors and property
developers.
Mr Paul Shepherd, managing director of Shepherd Construction said: 'The cost
to the industry of defects is greater than the combined profits of all
contractors. There is therefore real scope to in-crease financial
performance.'

Regions hit by the rundown in defence industries are to receive Pounds 15.5m
in European Union aid, provided the money is committed before the end of the
year, Stewart Dalby writes.
The aid will be matched by Pounds 16m from central local government or
private sector funds.
The aid can be used for such purposes as retraining personnel and
redeveloping redundant defence sites.
The EU money has come from both the European Regional Development Fund and
the European Social Fund, the main structural funds that apply to the UK.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday it had received more
than 250 project applications.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Chalker hardens line over aid to Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday warned the Serbs that they risked air strikes and a
withdrawal of humanitarian aid unless they were prepared to make territorial
concessions to the Muslims in Bosnia.
Baroness Chalker, Foreign Office minister, told the Lords: 'If there is no
breakthrough in the discussions in Geneva next Monday and the lack of
co-operation persists, parties must understand that the humanitarian
commitment from the world at large will not continue indefinitely.
'The onus is now on the Serbs to make further territorial concessions to
meet the Muslim demands in the Geneva talks.'
Speaking during the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech, Lady Chalker
declared: 'The Bosnian Serbs are being pressed hard. They understand that if
they resume the strangulation of Sarajevo, they face the prospect of air
strikes.
'And sanctions on Serbia mean that Belgrade also faces a bleak winter, not
only the Muslims in central Bosnia.'
Her comments appear to underline a hardening of the government's position
over Bosnia.
Last week Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned the warring
factions in Bosnia that they could not expect humanitarian aid to continue
indefinitely if there was no progress towards peace. And Lord Owen, peace
envoy in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday reiterated his view that the world
community would have to decide how long it could sustain intervention in
Bosnia.
Lady Chalker was speaking after a meeting of EC foreign ministers in
Luxembourg yesterday, at which Mr Hurd made clear that sanctions could not
be relaxed without some territorial concessions by the Serbs and Croats. She
said: 'There may be in the future a possible suspension of sanctions, but
there is a need first for territorial concessions.'
She warned that hundreds of thousands of lives were at risk from the bitter
winter. Some 2,700,000 Bosnians were reliant on humanitarian aid, with more
and more becoming dependent as the weather deteriorated.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has again written to Mr
Hurd to press the need for opening Tuzla Airport as a vital point of entry
for supplies into central Bosnia.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Treasury minister's nice little earner: Faith in the
recovery could be bolstered by 'Dorrell's mill'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With industrialists lining up to tell Mr Kenneth Clarke about their
difficulties, news of a manufacturer which has doubled profits during the
recession while keeping its UK workforce constant is guaranteed to put a
spring in the chancellor's step.
To hear about Faithful, a Worcester-based clothing group, the chancellor has
only to consult Treasury colleague Mr Stephen Dorrell, the company's former
chairman and one of the few government ministers with direct experience of
manufacturing.
The minister retains an office at the company which has been owned by the
Dorrell family since the 1840s, and has a 20 per cent shareholding. He drops
in to the main Worcester factory - known in Whitehall as 'Dorrell's mill' -
every few weeks to talk to senior managers. He says this gives him a 'window
on the world' of industry.
Faithful has just under 10 per cent of the UK's Pounds 100m-a-year workwear
business selling clothes worn mainly by men working in factory and service
jobs. Among its 500 customers are Harrods, ICI, Nissan, Boots, British Rail,
Vickers, Volvo and Smiths Crisps. The spread of contacts, according to Mr
Dorrell, gives him 'a broad-based set of anecdotes about the economy'.
Mr Dorrell worked for the company full-time as export director prior to
entering parliament in 1979 and was non-executive chairman between 1984 and
1987, taking over from his father Philip who is now president. His father
also owns a fifth of the company, as do Mr Dorrell's brother and sister,
both of whom are directors. His mother is chairman.
Mr Peter Warr, Faithful's managing director, joined the company 30 years
ago. He says that in the minister's 12-year spell as a director until 1987,
he played a full part in formulating Faithful's business strategy, which is
partly based on building sales in continental Europe. A third of this year's
sales will come from the company's two factories in the Netherlands, which
are run by Mr Dorrell's brother Alan and account for 50 of the company's 350
employees.
Mr Dorrell, the 41-year-old financial secretary to the Treasury and a rising
political star, is using his knowledge of manufacturing to help improve the
Treasury's lacklustre image in the business world.
Mr Toby Ackroyd, operations director of the Association of Independent
Businesses, a lobbying group, says that Mr Dorrell's knowledge of industry
comes through in informal discussions. Mr Ackroyd, who met the minister
recently to offer his views about the Budget, says: 'He's got a good
understanding of the tech-nical aspects of business.'
Another fan is Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser at the Engineering
Employers Federation, which met Mr Dorrell last month. Mr Thompson says:
'For the first time in 10 years of discussion with the Treasury, I came away
with the impression that someone there understood what we were saying (about
conditions in industry).'
Faithful's recent experience in seeing a gradual pick-up in demand - though
with competition still intense in a market which has declined by about a
fifth in volume during the recession - has helped to inform Mr Dorrell's
view that the recovery is on course with price pressures subdued. The
company expects sales of Pounds 15m this year, and turned in a pre-tax
profit last year of Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 11.3m.
With the Treasury keen to see inflationary pressures minimised, Mr Dorrell
is no doubt pleased by the tight cost control at his family company.
Faithful's machinists are paid an average of about Pounds 140 a week,
roughly half the average gross pay of UK manual workers although close to
the going rate for the clothing sector.
Costs of the Dutch operation, based in Doetinchem, are also kept down by
shipping cloth to factories in Morocco, Tunisia and Poland where much of the
unskilled assembly is done by low-paid workers.
The incomes of Faithful employees are, however, topped up through a
profit-sharing scheme established in the 1950s which last year paid out
Pounds 210,000.
Faithful has also moved into high-value, specialist products - a field which
to some degree shields the company from competition from low-cost importers
 -such as the jacket it makes for Shell oil tanker drivers. By being fairly
stylish and made from relatively expensive materials it sells for Pounds 22,
roughly three times the price of a mass-produced competing product. Faithful
has also moved into specialist areas such as static-proof clothes for people
making microchips.
In 1988, before the recession, Faithful made about 1,500 types of product in
fairly large batches. Last year the comparable figure was 2,500, many of
them made in short runs to the specification of particular customers.
What Budget advice does Mr Warr have for Mr Dorrell and the chancellor? He
says: 'I hope taxes won't go up because this would have a negative effect on
the the recovery.'
Mr Warr is not among those calling for an immediate cut in interest rates
because he thinks they might have to go up soon should inflation increase.
He worries, however, about the government's presentational skills: 'I've not
seen much evidence that it has a business plan.'
Mr Warr says the Bank of England should take control of interest rates from
government ministers. Although he praises Mr Dorrell as 'perfectly straight,
someone you would buy a used car from', this trust does not extend to all
members of parliament. Mr Warr says: 'The economy is too important to be
left to politicians.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Postal ballot results backfire on government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Postal strike ballots, made compulsory by the government on September 1,
have produced a high voting turnout among workers and have normally given
the leadership of the union involved the mandates for the industrial action
they have sought, according to the independent Electoral Reform Ballot
Services.
The findings will come as a blow to ministers who believed unions would find
it hard to secure high turnouts and support for strikes with the
introduction of compulsory postal ballots.
ERBS said that in the first 120 ballots it held for unions after the new
legal requirement came into force, an average of 73.1 per cent of union
members participated. 'This is a remarkably high turnout,' said Mr Owen
Thomas of ERBS yesterday.
Before this year's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, unions had
been required by law since 1988 to hold workplace ballots of members. In the
past, only a few trade unions held postal ballots for industrial action -
rather than for elections of officials - and the turnout in these ballots
tended to be low - often less than 30 per cent.
'The unions are clearly using the postal ballots as a valuable negotiating
technique in their bargaining with employers,' said Dr Bob Simpson, of the
LSE's centre for economic performance, last night.
'The figures show that they have been surprisingly quick to accommodate the
latest legal changes which many thought they would have difficulty dealing
with.'
In as many as 78 per cent of the postal strike ballots the majority of trade
union members participating backed their union's call for action. In 62
cases (51.7 per cent) the union sought a mandate for strike action only and
in only seven cases (5.8 per cent) for action short of a stoppage.
Few of the ballots actually led to strikes. Unions and employers appear to
be taking advantage of the new statutory seven-day period of notice between
the ballot result and start of the industrial action to resolve their
differ-ences.
The strike ballots have been held in most of Britain's main unions,
including the TGWU and GMB general unions, the AEEU engineering union, the
MSF technicians union, the UCATT construction union and the RMT transport
union.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Legal actions on BCCI jeopardised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal actions and payouts to creditors in the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International could be jeopardised in squabbles over access to
essential documents, following the Luxembourg ruling against the
liquidators' plans late last month.
Most of the background papers vital to the legal actions brought by the
liquidators at accountants Touche Ross against BCCI's auditors and the Bank
of England are held by the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder
in the bank.
The surprise ruling from the Luxembourg appeals court on October 27 has now
threatened to put new obstacles in the way of access to these documents by
the liquidators.
A translation of the full text of the hearing, which was circulated late
last week, accused Abu Dhabi of breaking Luxembourg law by refusing to hand
over documents to liquidators.
So far, Touche Ross has had relatively free access to the papers, most of
which have been held under strict security conditions in Abu Dhabi where
they were moved during the late 1980s.
But this co-operation is threatened now that the liquidators may be forced
either to ask Abu Dhabi for a greater financial contribution for creditors
or to threaten to sue it.
One senior professional involved in the case said yesterday: 'There is a
grave danger that the shutters will go up all round. Everybody has got
themselves into an almighty wrangle.'
The government of Abu Dhabi has so far paid several millions of pounds and
co-ordinated most of the legal and accounting work necessary in preparing
the legal actions, although they have been publicly carried out in Touche
Ross's name.
As part of the 'contribution agreement' negotiated in early 1992 with BCCI's
liquidators, Abu Dhabi would have handed over up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) to creditors, but would have taken a half share in any proceeds from
successful legal actions - a point the Luxembourg courts ruled unjust to
other creditors.
BCCI's Treasury operations - and related papers - were moved from London to
Abu Dhabi in 1987. Other essential documents on the workings of the bank and
its systems have been systematically moved there since.
One professional from the liquidators' side admitted there could be problems
over access, but said: 'We would not have issued our statements of claim
unless we had evidence to back them up.'
Touche Ross has begun legal actions against the former auditors to BCCI:
Price Waterhouse, Ernst &amp; Whinney, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, and
Interfiduciaire, a firm which audited the bank in Luxembourg.
It has also sued the Bank of England for failing in its regulatory duties on
behalf of creditors, and begun a separate action against National Commercial
Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating
officer.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Ministers finalise shape of ITV ownership rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has decided what it intends to do about the future of the ITV
ownership rules, and only the manner of the announcement is now in doubt.
It is still unclear whether the heritage department will make an
early-morning announcement to the stock exchange, because of the price
sensitive nature of the decision, or whether the announcement will be made
first to the Commons. Discussions over the mechanics of the long-awaited
announcement will probably rule out a statement today with tommorrow or
Thursday now most likely.
The department declined yesterday to give any indication of the content of
the announcement, but all the signs are that it will involve a significant
change in the rules, allowing large ITV companies to own two large licences
and one small one. An advertising revenue ceiling could also be imposed to
limit one company to 25 per cent of all television advertising. Protection
for HTV and Scottish from takeover by other large ITV companies is expected
to be combined with an insistance that no one company can own both London
licences.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, appealed yesterday
to the government to protect competition in the selling of television
airtime.
Mr Grade said he would be 'very, very concerned' if there were a single
television sales point for London or a single sales point selling more than
25 per cent of ITV advertising revenue.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Unions demand more staff at Customs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil service unions repres-enting Customs and Excise officers called on the
government yesterday to hire an extra 3,000 staff to help combat drug
imports and recover an estimated Pounds 1.7bn in lost revenue for the
Treasury from the non-payment of value added tax.
Contrasting the widely publicised government crackdown on alleged social
security fraud with the lack of similar action on VAT evasion, Mr Geoff
Lewtas, Customs and Excise secretary for the CPSA clerical union, accused
ministers of applying double standards.
The civil service unions estimate that every VAT inspector costs about
Pounds 25,000 a year to employ, but raises Pounds 360,000 a year in
additional tax. 'Their level of productivity has increased consistently over
the years at a rate of 25 per cent annually, well above the increase in
salaries,' the unions argue.
They calculate that if an extra 1,700 VAT inspectors were employed it would
produce more than Pounds 1bn in additional VAT revenue collected for the
Treasury.
The unions point out that Customs have made a 40 per cent cut in VAT
inspections since 1990 and cut 600 staff. Their demand would mean a rise of
30 per cent in current staff levels.
The unions also want an increase of 1,000 in the number of staff trying to
prevent the import of dangerous drugs into Britain and bootlegging.
They claim that a more rigorous clampdown on smuggled alcohol and cigarettes
would lead to a Pounds 500m improvement in lost revenue with an extra Pounds
250m from the loss in revenue from legal cross-border shopping.
The Customs and Excise Department said it could not comment on the union
claims. It added that competitive tendering had succeeded in making cost
savings in catering and printing.

FT  23 NOV 93 / BR casts doubt on EU safety directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior British Rail official yesterday accused the European Union of
basing its rules on working hours on received wisdom instead of facts.
Large parts of the EU's working time directive, which will be passed today
in Brussels, were not based on actual research about the effects of night
work and long shifts, said Mr Gareth Hadley, head of employee relations at
BR.
Revealing the results of BR research into 7,500 safety incidents, Mr Hadley
said there was no evidence of an increase in safety risks from working
shifts up to 12 hours, or working high weekly hours.
The BR research, covering more than 50m train-driver hours, found that the
eighth to 12th hours of shifts were lower-risk than earlier hours and that
the peak risk period was in the second to fourth hours.
The research found no link between lack of breaks and accidents. It says
there is some evidence to suggest that the highest risk of an accident comes
soon after a break.
The EU working time directive imposes conditions on working more than 48
hours a week, requires breaks after six hours' continuous working, and also
limits night shifts to eight hours. But it does not apply to the transport
sector.
The BR research found there were no greater risks from working at night, but
did establish that 'the highest risk of the more severe safety accidents was
at midnight'. This, however, was not linked to hours-into-shift fatigue.
Elsewhere the arrival of the working time directive - which does not become
law for three years - was welcomed. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the
Trades Union Congress, said: 'This directive means employers will no longer
be able to deny workers three weeks' paid holiday a year.'
By 1999 three weeks' statutory holiday will rise to four weeks, but it is
not clear whether that will apply pro rata to part-time workers or whether
it will apply at all to people working only a few hours a week.
In the UK 2.2m employees have no paid holiday, but fewer than 20 per cent of
these work 16 hours or more per week and have at least one year's continuous
service with an employer. But even if most of those 2.2m are excluded from
the directive, nearly a quarter of full-time UK employees still have less
than four weeks' holiday, say employment department figures.

FT  23 NOV 93 / ITC issues invitation to apply for a new cable licence in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday issued the first invitation
for four years to apply for a new cable licence in the UK.
The franchise, for the west Kent towns of Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Tunbridge
Wells, is the first to be advertised under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. This
means that the 'local delivery licence', as new franchises will be known,
will go to the highest bidder.
Apart from the annual bid - there is no minimum figure - applicants will
have to pay a percentage of their income from advertising and television
subscriptions. In the case of west Kent it will be zero in the first five
years, 2 per cent for the following five years and 6 per cent for the last
five years of the 15-year licence.
Encom, whose majority shareholder is Bell Canada, has expressed an interest
in the west Kent franchise. It already holds franchises in areas such as
Dartford and Bexley in Kent.
The latest cable figures show that by October 1 the number of homes
subscribing to modern cable services had passed 500,000 for the first time.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Radio 1 'viable' with ads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC Radio 1 would be viable if it were funded by advertising revenue, but
large and medium commercial radio stations would be hit, says the Henley
Centre for Forecasting.
Research for the Radio Authority and the Association of Independent Radio
Companies shows that if Radio 1 were transferred to the commercial sector it
would increase total radio advertising by around 20 per cent in real terms.
The Henley researchers believe that this would increase total annual
national radio advertising from Pounds 97m to Pounds 116m at 1992 prices.
'However, Radio 1 will be able to command a substantial cost premium. This
means that a commercial Radio 1 will steal revenue from existing services,'
the report says.
Radio 1 would take Pounds 53m or 26 per cent of total commercial radio
revenue of Pounds 204m at 1992 prices.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Unit trust sales up sharply to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unit trust industry had its best October on record last month, with net
sales reaching Pounds 845.9m. They were up from Pounds 668.6m in September
and far higher than the Pounds 37m in October last year.
It is already a record year for the industry, with October's figure taking
net sales for the year to Pounds 7.8bn. That compares with Pounds 6.3bn in
1987, the previous record for a calendar year.
The 27 per cent increase in net sales over the month was caused mainly by
strong retail demand according to the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds (Autif). Net sales to retail investors were Pounds 575m, up
from Pounds 411m in September. The increase in institutional net sales was
less marked, from Pounds 257m in September to Pounds 271m.
Retail interest in unit trusts has been sustained by relatively low interest
rates, and further increases in net sales of unit trusts are likely if Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, cuts base rates further.
Mrs Victoria Nye, director of communications at Autif, said: 'As long as
interest rates are low, we expect unit trusts to become increasingly
attractive to private investors looking to increase their returns over the
long term. Another cut in base rates will put more pressure on the investor
looking for income.'
A number of new fund launches in the international growth sector in October
made these the best-sellers to retail investors, but Mrs Nye did not expect
this to be sustained.
The second most popular funds, and the most popular in the year to date,
were UK balanced funds which offer a mixture of bonds and equities. The
least popular continued to be Japan funds.
The highest net inflow from institutions was into UK Smaller Companies
funds. The highest net outflow among institutions was from European and
Japanese funds.
Gross sales of unit trusts in October were Pounds 1.6bn and re-purchases
Pounds 756.4m. The number of unitholder accounts has increased steadily over
the year from 4.35m in January to 4.89m last month.

FT  23 NOV 93 / 50-year rail franchises urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Franchises to run parts of British Rail should be for at least 50 years
rather than the expected maximum of 15 years, Mr James Sherwood, chief
executive of Sea Containers, the shipping company, said yesterday.
Mr Sherwood, speaking at an FT conference, also called on the government to
repackage franchises so that each contained a mix of profitable and
unprofitable routes which could be operated without subsidies or price
controls.
Sea Containers operates the Orient Express, which runs on BR tracks and is
considering bidding for BR routes to the south-west of London.
Mr Sherwood said 50-year franchises would allow operators to make a good
return on rolling stock, which has a 30-year life. The franchising director,
responsible for monitoring franchises, should have power to terminate early
the contract of any operator not meeting required standards.
He warned that privatisation of BR was likely to lead to closure of
provincial services which could be better provided by buses, and the demise
of the British Transport police, whose work could be taken over by cheaper
private-sector security guards.
Mr Sherwood called on the government to drop its proposal to allow
competition between operators on the same route. 'There is already enough
competition for rail from road and air; we don't need any more.'
Mr Sherwood said he was concerned that the government had underestimated how
much capital would be required to maintain a rail network. 'If rail staff
come with Pounds 100 of capital each in a buy-out, we will have a
deteriorating system,' he said. 'Big companies must come in and invest
billions of pounds to improve it.'
The conference, on the economics of rail privatisation, heard a call for
companies operating train services to be allowed to own and operate the
track - the government proposes that BR's track will be owned and run by
Railtrack, a separate organisation.
Mr Brian Cox, a director of Stagecoach Holdings, a bus operator which is
considering bidding for franchises, called on Railtrack to subcontract some
of the services it will provide back to the franchisees who run the tracks.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said he wanted to see rail
franchisees set up an association of train operating companies to take a
lead in discussing issues such as complementary ticket systems and sharing
of stations.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Companies reject Major's view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies blame their recent difficulties on the domestic economy rather
than the worldwide recession or high exchange rates, a survey claims. It
says they do not share Mr John Major's view that the wordwide recession is
to blame for Britain's woes.
The chief failings in the UK economy are cited in the survey as low consumer
confidence and high interest rates.
The survey of more than 600 companies was conducted last spring by the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London Business
School. 'Although the prime minister and the former chancellor (Mr Norman
Lamont) have repeatedly blamed Britain's woes on the worldwide recession,'
it says, 'the results suggest that the view from the front was focused
primarily on their domestic origins'.
More than half of the companies - mostly large manufacturing groups - said
they had been severely affected by the recession, and almost half expected
it to last for at least another year. Companies blamed their problems mainly
on economic factors rather than their own actions, though a significant
minority blamed the merger boom of the late 1980s and excessive expansion on
their own part.
Actions taken in response to the downturn largely depended on how badly
companies had been damaged, the survey says. The worst affected were most
likely to take financial steps such as disposing of assets, cutting
dividends or raising fresh capital.
The report says the findings offer little comfort to those who believe
recessions help industry by making it leaner and fitter. 'There has been a
major retardation in the rate of investment in plant and equipment and there
has been widespread disruption to normal methods of labour-force
organisation,' it says.
The public remains uneasy about the strength of the recovery according to a
Gallup survey of consumer confidence conducted on behalf of the European
Commission, Emma Tucker writes.
Although expectations have not dropped significantly from October's sharply
lower levels of confidence, only a quarter of respondents expected the
general economic situation to improve over the next 12 months.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Iraq probe told of data for Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher was kept informed about Iraq's military procurement
programme by her intelligence chiefs even though crucial intelligence was
kept from some Whitehall officials and enforcement agencies, the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Eric Beston, a senior Department of Trade and Industry official, said
that in early 1989 the then prime minister had seen intelligence 'digests'
which suggested the involvement of British companies in Iraq's attempts to
build up its nuclear capability.
The 'digests' refer to the reports of the Joint Intelligence Committee, the
Cabinet Office's main intelligence arm to which the heads of the
intelligence agencies belong.
Mr Beston said that a Whitehall subcommittee called the Working Group on
Iraq Procurement was set up to monitor the Iraqi military programme.
But it was wound up after a short period because the intelligence services
withheld information from it.
'The minutes of the committee began to fall off,' Mr Beston said. 'We never
did get anyone from M15.'
He also gave details of mistrust and inter-departmental rivalries
undermining the functioning of a second committee which included Customs
officials and which was also meant to improve the efficiency of intelligence
dissemination within Whitehall.
He told the inquiry that Customs officials attending this second committee,
known as the Restricted Enforcement Unit, felt that other agencies were not
telling them what they knew.
'On occasions Customs felt they were giving more than they got. There was a
certain rivalry between agencies,' Mr Beston said.
Mr Beston, who was formerly responsible for export controls and licensing on
goods at the DTI, was a key witness in the trial last year of three former
director of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tool manufacturer.
He told the inquiry that as a result of the trial he had seen a number of
government documents confirming that information had been withheld by the
intelligence agencies.
During the trial the government tried to stop the publication of the
documents, but their decision was overturned on orders of the judge.
Lady Thatcher's role in the arms-for-Iraq affair was never clarified during
the Matrix-Churchill trial. This collapsed after it emerged that businessmen
who had been prosecuted for illegally exporting arms for Iraq had been
working for UK intelligence.
But Mr Beston is the latest witness to suggest that the official knowledge
about Britain's involvement in the arms trade with Iraq in the 1980s was
widely shared at cabinet level. Yesterday's evidence has also refocused
attention on the role of the intelligence agencies in informing the
government.
The inquiry continues.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Teachers scorn workload change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The workload for teachers in testing seven-year-olds for the national
curriculum in England and Wales has been halved by the Schools Curriculum
and Assessment Authority in a further attempt to persuade unions to abandon
their boycott of the tests.
But the announcement met scepticism from the unions. Mr Doug McAvoy, general
secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the biggest teaching union,
said: 'Our members are used to inaccurate estimates of the time needed to
carry out tests being made by government bodies.'
NUT members voted overwhelmingly last week to continue boycotting the tests
despite concessions already announced by the authority.
The other two main teachers' unions, the ATL and the NASUWT, both plan to
continue the boycott, which last year forced the government to abandon plans
to publish league tables for performance by schools based on the tests.
Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the authority, said: 'We want to work
with teachers in improving the tests yet further. We have focused on those
skills that really need testing. If children don't master these skills then
all their future development is built on sand.'
He said the tests, which cover English (or Welsh) and mathematics had been
simplified administratively, but would in no way be simpler for pupils to
answer.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, said the changes were 'a
sensible simplification' but added: 'Every parent knows that children
progress at different paces. What we have to be careful about is that the
tests do not become an annual academic sheepdog trial.'
Mr McAvoy claimed that shortening the tests did not necessarily improve
their educational soundness.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Chill winds blow through hill farm incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wind is bitter at the top of Mynydd Caerau where Mr Richard Howells is
herding sheep. Mr Howells is at the sharp end of farming, trying to make a
living on the steep, shale-strewn Welsh hills.
Next week he faces cuts in government support which helps to keep three
generations of his family tending 2,500 sheep and 50 cows on the hills above
Port Talbot. About half of Mr Howells' income comes from the taxpayer - the
bulk from Brussels and the rest from the UK government in the form of the
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance. It is this second part that farmers
fear will be cut when Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, makes a
statement expected on Budget day.
Mrs Shephard argues that hill farmers like Mr Howells have seen large
increases of up to 40 per cent in their income over the past year following
rises in Brussels payments and the devaluation of sterling.
But Mr Howells says he makes little more than the Welsh farmer's average of
Pounds 7,000 a year out of his 1,800-acre farm, although he does employ his
son and one other full-time worker as well as his 80-year-old father. The
National Farmers' Union reckons that the overall real incomes of hill
farmers have just clawed their way back to the levels of 1988.
'It seems that just as you manage to make a step forward, you are cut back,'
says Mr Howells. 'I've been investing in the farm for the first time in
several years by putting lime on the fields, which I should do every year,
and I won't be able to afford to do that if the support is cut.'
The government has little discretion over its Pounds 2.4bn agricultural
spending as most of it is dictated by the European Union. But the Treasury
has set its sights on the Pounds 130m support to 50,000 farmers in upland
areas. The livestock allowance was cut by more than Pounds 2 per sheep last
year to Pounds 6.50 per ewe. But it can still make the difference between
profit and loss for many hill farmers.
Farm groups warn that cuts in income support are turning people away from
the land, particularly in poor upland areas where there are no other jobs.
'We're talking about the confidence to remain on the land in these poorer
areas,' stresses Mr Tim Bennett, a North Wales hill farmer who represents
producers in less favoured areas at the NFU. 'The average age of the hill
farmer is over 50 and the government is showing it has no long-term
commitment to these communities.'
A study by the University of Wales at Aberystwyth shows that about 250 jobs
in rural supply industries depend on every 100 farmworkers. It estimates
that for every Pounds 10,000 generated on a hill sheep farm, a further
Pounds 20,000 is earned in the local economy.
The NFU also points to the benefits of attracting tourists to upland areas
such as the Lake District.
But should the taxpayer continue to fund Mr Howells as a guardian of the
landscape when all the mines in his valley were closed 15 years ago? Hill
farmers stress that they make a valuable contribution to UK agriculture,
providing over 60 per cent of strong breeding stock which is sold to more
profitable lowland farms. 'I regard the subsidy to these areas as an
investment,' says Mr Howells.
His income does not look like going up much this year as increases in
Brussels payments and a slight rise in cattle prices have been offset by a
drop of around Pounds 5 per sheep in lamb sales and a collapse in wool
prices.
Hill farming is not an enviable way of life. Mr Howells' day of hard manual
labour often starts at 5am and ends 14 hours later. He would like to be free
of government support, but realises he never will be. Still, he says: 'I was
born here; I think most farmers will stay as long as it's possible.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Nissan seat supplier to shed jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ikeda Hoover, the supplier of car seats to Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland
plant, is to make redundancies among its 490 Wearside employees.
The job cuts, discussed yesterday between Ikeda Hoover management and the
company council, the workforce negotiating body, are in response to Nissan's
decision to halve production from Sunderland until March because of the
downturn in sales of new cars in continental Europe.
A spokesman for Ikeda Hoover, a joint venture between Johnson Controls and
Ikeda Busan, said the number of jobs to go was still under discussion. The
company hoped the redundancies would be voluntary.
Ikeda Hoover was set up on Nissan's 800-acre site in 1986 to supply the car
plant. It is one of a number of suppliers located near the plant which
constantly feed components to the car production line.
Another of these suppliers, exhaust system and catalytic converter producer
Calsonic, made 37 employees redundant last week because of Nissan's
production downturn. Its Washington plant's production has been halved until
March, but the remaining 108 employees are being kept on full pay.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Delay plea on Crest ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Bankers' Association yesterday said that the question of which
body runs Crest, the new paperless securities settlements system, should be
left open until the system has operated for some time.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, the association's president, said ownership 'should
not be resolved at an early stage'. Crest, details of which will be
disclosed this week, should 'get up and running' first.
Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said there was a 'serious
risk' that a body put in charge before Crest started running would want to
make changes and there would be further delays.
Ownership of the Crest system, devised by an advisory committee sponsored by
the Bank of England after the collapse of the Stock Exchange's Taurus
system, has been the subject of wide debate.
The committee, whose findings are expected to be sent to market participants
tomorrow, is not thought to have addressed ownership in its initial paper.
This will be dealt with in a paper due to be completed in February. There is
thought to be support in the committee for the Bank to run Crest for the
first year.

subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday said he was 'concerned'
that the US position in the Uruguay Round in favour of curbing government
subsidies could undermine the president's high-priority technology
programme.
In a shift from Reagan-Bush ideology, Mr Brown is planning a number of
government industry schemes, which would help fund technological research
and development.
Yesterday the secretary announced the formation of an environmental
technologies export programme, with Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) available for
industry in government matching research and development grants this year
rising to Dollars 1.4bn in 1997.
The current Gatt negotiating text would limit basic research subsidies to 50
per cent, but applied research grants would have to be cut to 25 per cent.
Commerce Department officials have been aware for months of the
contradiction of President Clinton railing against Airbus subsidies while
proposing new aid for US industry.
According to Mr Brown, it is finally 'getting some attention' from US trade
negotiators, who have sufficient time to change US course in the current
Uruguay Round talks.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US fights its corner over tax demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US's top tax official met international trade negotiators at length in
Geneva yesterday in an attempt to justify his country's wish to have the
freedom to treat foreign services companies differently for tax purposes
from local companies.
The proposal - for a US exemption from the obligation under the proposed
Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation to provide 'national
treatment' on taxes for foreign service providers operating in the US - has
provoked a storm during the final stages of negotiation in Geneva. 'Trade
negotiators in Geneva may not be tax experts, but they are not fools,' one
negotiator said.
Negotiators claim the US demand, which would be illegal under the rules of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if it were applied to
manufactured goods, would torpedo Uruguay Round efforts to liberalise trade
in financial services. This in turn would hobble plans to bring services
trade within the scope of Gatt rules for the first time in the Gatt's
45-year history.
Mr Les Samuels, assistant secretary for tax affairs at the US Treasury,
faced a barrage of criticism at a four-hour meeting with negotiators in
Geneva. These ranged from claims the US wants to have its cake and eat it,
to threats withdraw offers to open up financial services markets.
The US official commented after the meeting that Washington preferred to
rely on 'tried and tested methods' of agreeing cross-border tax
arrangements, embodied in 56 bilateral tax agreements with countries around
the world. 'The Treasury is concerned about ambiguities in the (Uruguay
round) language, and how it might impact its ability to pass laws. We should
stick with what we have got and not go off the cliff into the unknown,' he
said.
Asked why none of the 56 countries with whom the US has tax treaties
supported the US position, Mr Samuels said there was 'a difference in
balancing trade objectives with tax objectives'.
One trade negotiator attending the Samuels meeting yesterday said: 'We have
already gone a long way to accommodate US concerns in the draft agreement.
To be told at the eleventh hour that even this is not acceptable has caused
a major and violent reaction.'
The US move prompted Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, to voice
concern about 'certain positions which have been taken recently on financial
services (which) may prove to be utterly counter-productive'. He added in a
formal statement: 'Unless there is an urgent review of these positions, not
only will the effort we have made. . . . to improve existing offers falter,
but the important progress that we have already achieved may begin to
unravel.'
Mr Samuels will meet Mr Sutherland today. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
secretary, has faced pressure from both Senate and Congressional committees
to examine tax treatment of foreign companies. Many in the US accuse foreign
companies of dodging payment of US taxes by using transfer pricing policies
that minimise the value added by US operations, and hence the local tax
liability.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Boost for UN drive to cut costs of trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World trade could receive a sharp 'boost' from a UN symposium on trade
efficiency to be held in the US next October, the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (Unctad) said yesterday.
The symposium will focus on the use of technology to encourage more
companies, especially smaller ones, to enter international trade, and to cut
the costs and paperwork involved in overseas transactions. These costs,
currently estimated at around Dollars 300bn (Pounds 200bn) a year in global
terms, could be cut by Dollars 75bn or 25 per cent within 10 years by
simpler procedures and more electronic or 'paperless' trading, according to
Unctad.
The centre-piece of the symposium will be the rapid development of trade
points, centres which bring all the services needed by exporters under one
roof. Over 80 rich and poor countries now have or are planning trade points,
which cost anything from Dollars 30,000 to Dollars 1m to set up.
The centres bring together in one place government departments, customs
authorities, chambers of commerce, banks, insurers, freight forwarders and
other agents in trade transactions. Companies have access to computerised
information on markets, potential clients, tariffs and trade rules and, from
next year, to an electronic network linking trade points worldwide.
Delegates from about 70 countries met in Geneva last week to make plans for
the trade efficiency symposium, which will be held in Colombus, Ohio. The
trade point in Colombus, inaugurated last month, is a 'virtual' trade point
linking users and service providers electronically.
Ms Elizabeth Shelton, who chaired last week's meeting, said yesterday that
trade points had already proved their worth. In Algeria, the number of
players in international trade had expanded from 20 to 2,500. Mr Torbjorn
Blomfeldt, secretary general of Finpro (Finnish Committee on International
Trade Procedures), said last week that a typical trade transaction involved
27 different parties, 60 original documents and 360 document copies. 'The
procedures are so complicated smaller companies are hesitant to enter
international trade', he said.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Foreign investment projects in Hungary top
Dollars 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The value of foreign investment projects in Hungary topped Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2bn) by the middle of this year, and companies with foreign
participation have become a dominant force in the national economy,
according to the UN Economic Commission for Europe*. They now account for a
fifth of all Hungarian enterprises and a sixth of total value added.
However, their overall performance has been poor, with net profits in the
latest year down two-thirds from the previous year, the ECE says. This
reflected generally difficult trading conditions in Hungary; Hungarian
companies without foreign investment suffered an even sharper decline.
Most of the losses were in manufacturing, which accounts for 55 per cent of
all overseas investment in Hungary, concentrated in the food and tobacco,
textiles and clothing industries.
The biggest investors in Hungary, which remains the largest single
recicpient of foreign capital in eastern and central Europe, are Germany
(18.4 per cent), Austria (18 per cent) and Belgium (16 per cent). The US
accounts for about 5 per cent of the total.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Sparks fly in steel clash - Issue is
deadlocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over steel between the US and the European Union is expected to be
one of the most contentious items addressed by Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU
trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in their
Washington talks which began yesterday.
The issue threatens to pose a serious obstacle to a wide-ranging package of
market-opening measures for industrial goods in the Uruguay Round of global
trade talks, due to end on December 15.
Negotiators from 36 leading steel producers meeting in Geneva last week
failed to make progress in negotiating a multilateral steel agreement (MSA),
on which a provisionally agreed zero-tariff deal for steel depends.
Zero tariffs for steel are a hefty slice of the value to the EU of the US
tariff offer, without which officials say the deal would be seriously
unbalanced.
The MSA talks are deadlocked over US insistence that allowable subsidies,
such as those for environmental improvement, plant closure and research and
development, should be actionable under domestic anti-subsidy laws. The MSA
as drafted would outlaw most subsidies to the industry, alongside a 10-year
phase-out of tariff and non-tariff barriers to steel trade.
The EU and others, still smarting from a string of anti-dumping and
countervailing duty suits on their exports brought by the US steel industry
last year (most of them later rejected), want strong MSA provisions to
prevent further harassment and immediate agreement to lift duties.
Both sides have made limited gestures of flexibility but a sticking point
has been Washington's refusal to deny its steel industry the right to
petition the government for action.
A senior US official said a new working draft would be presented to the next
MSA meeting in December, but expressed little optimism.

FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: China's telecoms regime under pressure -
An internal challenge to an old monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A struggle is under way for control of China's telecommunications industry.
On its outcome depends the size and shape of potentially the world's largest
telecommunications market.
The Beijing government wants to quadruple the number of telephone lines from
20m to 80m by the year 2000 - an addition equivalent to three times the
existing network in the UK. China has barely one telephone line per 100
people, compared with 49 per 100 in, for example, Hong Kong.
However, a highly centralised system, together with a blanket prohibition on
involvement by western network operators, makes Beijing's target unrealistic
without far-reaching reforms.
Local officials - led by the mayor of Shanghai - are calling for a
relaxation of current regulations amid increasing signs of support from key
utility and economic development ministries.
Mr Huang Ju told leading western telecoms operators recently that he would
like to arrange a 'pilot' project in Shanghai under which foreign operators
would invest in building and operating a new network.
Under the existing regime, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
(MPT) has a virtual monopoly on telecom operations. Overseas telecom
equipment manufacturers have been allowed in through joint ventures, but
network operation - the heart of the industry - is closed to all but MPT
agents.
Executives of telecoms operators such as AT&amp;T (which supplies equipment to
the Chinese market) and Cable &amp; Wireless (which has a majority stake in Hong
Kong Telecom) dream in public almost daily about the potential of the
Chinese market.
Now, the domestic battle between Beijing ministries and local leaders may
before long lead to a change in policy on those and other foreign operators.
'There is a lot of pushing and pulling within the different ministries,'
said a western telecoms executive in Beijing. 'The MPT is putting a fairly
strong block against more participation by others.'
The immediate issue at stake is the MPT's absolute grip on domestic
operations. Three ministries (electronic industries, railways and electric
power), together with the People's Bank of China, the People's Liberation
Army and other Chinese enterprises are attempting to forge an alliance to
create a second national telecoms network apart from that run by MPT.
Interpretations differ over whether the second network would be wholly
public or use dedicated lines to link several ministries, industries and
enterprises. Either way, it would break the MPT's monopoly and give a
powerful stimulus to telecoms development.
The PLA is a prime mover behind the project. It already controls all China's
air-wave frequencies, is the largest satellite dish manufacturer and is
heavily involved in the cellular phone and paging industries.
So far, though, only one company has made inroads into the MPT's monopoly.
Ji Tong, a domestic company established by the Ministry of Electronic
Industry earlier this year, has obtained approval to establish pager and
data communications services linking up with the telephone network.
If it gets an MPT licence, Ji Tong has ambitious plans to develop a wide
range of pager, cordless phone and data services markets. 'We can provide
customers for the services and link into MPT's backbone network,' said Ms
Liang Mei, Ji Tong's senior engineer.
Ji Tong is also spearheading a project known as the 'three goldens', a
series of telecommunications infrastructure schemes to link various
ministries and industries.
The first, called the 'golden bridge', is a national electronic data
network; 'golden customs' is an electronic data interface for companies
involved in foreign trade; and 'golden banking card' is for a network
similar to that provided by automatic teller machines in western countries.
Another company, Lian Tong, which is jointly owned by the Ministry of
Electronic Industry, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Electric
Power, is believed to be engaged in discussions with MPT for a licence to
start a second network.
Western diplomats believe MPT's power to thwart such schemes is waning.
Indeed, the ministry is itself undergoing radical re-organisation. Over the
next few years, it will be divided into two: one part to regulate the
industry and determine prices for telecoms companies, the other to
manufacture and operate services.
'China is facing a crossroads where the price of more accessible, affordable
communication is less political influence,' says a western analyst in
Beijing. 'But basic operation and ownership will have limits for a long
time.' Western companies would be unlikely to be allowed in as anything but
minority joint venture partners for the foreseeable future.
Lord Young, chairman of C&amp;W, who was present at a recent conference in New
York where Shanghai's Mr Huang spoke, said there was unlikely even to be
pilot projects with western operators 'until the current battle is won -
which could be months or far longer'.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in
Hong Kong, said Mr Huang's view underlined the 'unsustainability' of
existing policy. 'It could spell the end of the MPT monopoly, and open very
significant opportunities for overseas telecom companies within a relatively
short time scale.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Pyongyang plays high-stake nuclear poker game: Sanctions
could trigger a conflict in the most heavily-armed area on earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of the US and South Korea are expected to make a last-ditch
attempt to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme
when they meet in Washington today.
In an effort to defuse the mounting tension between North and South Korea,
President Bill Clinton and President Kim Young-sam are likely to offer to
suspend the joint annual Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea. In
return, they will seek a resumption of international inspections of North
Korean nuclear facilities and talks on de-nuclearisation of the Korean
peninsula.
The deal could pave the way to settle a dispute sparked by North Korea's
threat to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. If Pyongyang
offers proof it has ended its nuclear arms development programme, the US has
suggested it might grant diplomatic recognition and provide economic aid.
The latest US initiative follows a statement by North Korea that it would
consider a package of simultaneous compromises with Washington. Both sides
are racing against time. A possible declaration in the next few weeks by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that North Korea has broken
nuclear safeguards by refusing to accept inspections could force the UN
Security Council to consider economic sanctions on Pyongyang. That might
trigger a hostile response by North Korea and lead to a conflict in the most
heavily-armed area on the planet.
'A war on the Korean peninsula might last only a month and end in the defeat
of North Korea, but the destruction would be unimaginable,' a western
diplomat said. Whether such an apocalyptic event will occur depends on North
Korea's true intentions in provoking the crisis and the west's response to
it.
The prime aim of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme seems to be to ensure
survival of North Korea and the ruling family of President Kim Il-sung.
North Korea is confronting increased problems in the post-cold war world.
Its economy has shrunk by an annual 5 per cent in the past three years.
Reports persist of disturbances caused by food shortages. Abroad, collapse
of the socialist bloc has left the North isolated, as witness the recent
140-1 vote in the UN General Assembly urging Pyongyang to comply with
nuclear inspections.
The North has lost the support of one key ally, Russia, and relations have
cooled with another, China, after Moscow and Beijing set up diplomatic ties
with Seoul. Even the North's conventional military force, although bigger
than the South's, is ageing, while Seoul rapidly modernises its army.
It is an insecure North Korea that views nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantee of its continued existence. 'It's the last card they have left to
play,' says Mr Adrian Foster-Carter, director of the Leeds University Korea
Project.
But how Pyongyang plans to use that card is open to question. Some of those
who favour a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear issue argue that
Pyongyang may be intent on taking South Korea by force once it completes the
development of nuclear weapons. Possession of nuclear missiles aimed at US
military bases in Japan might force the US to think twice about supporting
Seoul in a conflict.
But other analysts believe North Korea would never risk invading South Korea
again as it now lacks powerful allies. Instead, Pyongyang is engaged in a
high-stakes game of diplomatic poker, using its nuclear programme as a means
to win concessions.
These would include US diplomatic recognition, which would imply
international acceptance for the permanent division of Korea, and western
economic aid. Adding to the uncertainty over North Korea's nuclear programme
are varying estimates of how close Pyongyang is to producing a nuclear
weapon. US intelligence estimates range from a few months to five years.
Whatever North Korea's nuclear intentions are, the US has based its
opposition to Pyongyang's possession on two main grounds: one, it would deal
a blow to efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. North Korea's acquisition
of nuclear weapons, despite being a signatory to the nuclear safeguards
treaty, would encourage others to violate the agreement; two, the US fears a
renegade North Korea could provoke a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia by
forcing Seoul and Tokyo to follow suit. Pyongyang might also emerge as a
supplier of nuclear technology to other anti-western nations.
The US has few options to stop North Korea's nuclear programme. A
pre-emptive attack on the North's Yongbyon nuclear facilities is highly
unlikely; it would almost certainly precipitate an attack on South Korea.
Economic sanctions are also questionable. China may veto a sanctions
resolution in the UN as it tries to extend its influence in the region by
protecting North Korea. The US is urging Beijing to support sanctions if
China's efforts to intercede with the North Koreans fail.
Even if sanctions are imposed, they could be ineffective. North Korea's
border with China, its chief outside source of oil and food, is porous.
Moreover, sanctions could provoke an attack by North Korea. 'Sanctions are
regarded as being perilously close to an engagement of war and the North may
see no alternative but to fight,' one diplomat said. For this reason, China,
South Korea and Japan are urging the US to be cautious over sanctions.
The US so far has pursued a conciliatory approach to solving the nuclear
inspection issue. But pressure is growing in Washington for the Clinton
administration to adopt a tougher approach if North Korea refuses to accept
IAEA inspections soon.
'The Clinton administration is already being criticised for being weak on
foreign policy; to some in Washington the offers to North Korea smack of
appeasement. I don't know if the administration could sell diplomatic
recognition to the US public and media even if North Korea accepts full
inspections,' one US official says.
If North Korea is engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship, it may have to decide
soon whether to accept the present package of US concessions, instead of
holding out for more and risking seeing them disappear.
Washington and Pyongyang may be seriously seeking a negotiated solution to
the dispute, but the situation is still fraught with possibilities for
miscalculation, and for conflict.

Korean Air yesterday said it would not act on a government order to transfer
equipment and technology for assembling engines for the American UH-60 Black
Hawk helicopter to Samsung Aerospace.
The Korean Defence Ministry announced yesterday that Samsung Aerospace would
become the sole engine manufacturer for a second order of 57 Black Hawk
helicopters. Korean Air was appointed by Seoul in 1990 to assemble the first
81 UH-60 helicopters and engines bought by the country's armed forces.
South Korea's main airline, which has ambitions of developing aerospace
manufacturing, argued the transfer of the licensed technology cannot be done
without the approval of General Electric of the US, the engine's original
manufacturer. Korean defence officials said, however, they foresaw no
problem from GE in transferring the license to Samsung.
The ministry said the measure would save Won10bn (Pounds 8m) by bringing
both engine parts manufacture and engine assembly to Samsung.

President Bill Clinton said yesterday he planned to discuss a 'new approach'
to North Korea at his meeting in Washington today with President Kim
Young-sam of South Korea, Our Foreign Staff reports.
The US has been reported to be considering a less confrontational approach
over North Korea's refusal to accept international inspections to ensure its
nuclear programme remains frozen and that it is not moving to acquire
nuclear weapons.
Speaking at a White House press conference Mr Clinton said: 'It was obvious
to me that no one in the region wants North Korea to become a nuclear power,
so we're going to do everything we can, in close consultation with the
countries most affected in the region, to try to find a resolution to this.'
He said he expected to announce an initiative after meeting Mr Kim.
Mr Clinton discussed the issue with several Asian leaders in Seattle last
week.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Kenya asks donors for 'substantial' support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya is seeking 'substantial' financial support to clear external debt
arrears and close projected gaps in the balance of payments, Mr Musalia
Mudavadi, minister of finance, told a donors' meeting in Paris yesterday.
The consultative group meeting, chaired by the World Bank, is the first
since November 1991, when donors froze new aid until the government
implemented political and economic reforms.
The intervening two years had seen 'fundamental political and economic
change', Mr Mudavadi told the conference. He did not, however, set a target
for aid pledges. Debt arrears, thought to total Dollars 700m (Pounds
475.5m), will not be negotiated at the Paris meeting, but discussed directly
with creditors.
Mr Mudavadi appealed for help in meeting a food shortfall of 1.25m tonnes,
from July 1993 to September 1994, which will cost Dollars 200m. The shortage
has been caused by poor rains.
Reviewing developments in the economy, the minister said the government had
completed a policy framework paper which had been put to the IMF and World
Bank.
Inflation had been brought down from 100 per cent to 50 per cent, and the
underlying rate on a three month annualised basis was 24 per cent.
Acknowledging that this year's budget deficit of 6.1 per cent of GDP was
high, the minister said the government planned to bring this down to 2.9 per
cent in 1994-95.
Spending cuts would include a reduction in state employees, by 16,000 a year
over the next three years.
Donors acknowledge significant progress in recent months.
As well as curbing inflation, Mr Mudavadi has liberalised trade, floated the
shilling, and cracked down on financial wrong-doing in the banking sector.
He has even managed to dislodge some of the worst abusers of public office
from their sinecures at the Central Bank and certain parastatal companies.
But donors yesterday expressed concern about ethnic clashes in which more
than 1,000 people have been killed, with Kikuyus taking the brunt of the
casualties. Mr Mudavadi gave details of a Dollars 20m programme to assist
the victims.
Diplomats were cautious in their response yesterday, suggesting that the
restoration of fast-disbursing aid will be modest, and linked to further
progress in economic reforms.
Japan spearheaded Kenya's financial rehabilitation last month with a new
Dollars 77m credit. The World Bank has about Dollars 120m in suspended
programme assistance; the IMF another Dollars 60m. Together, these funds
should help cover Kenya's balance of payments gap next year.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Nigeria arms sales to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain, Germany and other European Union countries are expected to maintain
existing arms sales contracts to Nigeria despite last week's assumption of
power by General Sani Abacha, the country's defence minister.
European foreign ministers are preparing a joint response to the forced
resignation of Chief Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's civilian head of government,
but are understood to have ruled out a ban on current arms supplies. At
least two European countries have substantial arms contracts with Nigeria.
Britain is supplying 150 Vickers tanks under a deal negotiated two years
ago. The order is thought to be critical to Vickers' Newcastle factory,
where 750 jobs would be lost if the plant closed.
The Nigerian Air Force is understood to have ordered Air Beetle training
aircraft made by the German manufacturer Dornier, cancelling the provision
in the 1993 budget to buy 36 Slingsby Firefly aircraft at a cost of N500m
(based on exchange rate of N20 to the dollar). The British-built Fireflys
were the only defence item specified in the 1993 spending plan.
A local press report said the new order is for 100 German aircraft (64 more
than budgeted) and would mean one trainer for each trainee pilot in the air
force.
In a confidential report to the Shonekan administration, delivered at the
end of August, a committee appointed to monitor state spending warned that
the country's defence ministry had run up 'huge debts' which the government
would be hard pressed to meet.
Gen Abacha' action was strongly condemned by Mr Douglas Hurd, British
foreign secretary. He deplored 'the decision of the Nigerian military to
reverse the democratic process in Nigeria and to dissolve all democratically
elected institutions. . . Mr Hurd went on: 'Military dictatorship cannot
solve Nigeria's problems. This is a serious step backwards, not only for
Nigeria but for Africa as a whole.'
A package of limited international sanctions was introduced earlier this
year, after President Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June presidential poll
and extended military rule beyond the promised August handover date. He
subsequently stood down after extending Mr Shonekan's tenure as head of an
interim government, which promised fresh election in February and a handover
in March.
In response, Britain suspended visas to military members of the government
and ended military training programmes.
In an address to the nation shortly after taking office, Gen Abacha promised
a constitutional conference in the coming months but has not given a new
date for civilian rule.
Nigerians returned to work on Monday after the main trade union federation
reached an agreement with the government on domestic fuel prices and called
off a week-long strike.

President F W de Klerk said the session 'might in all probability be the

FT  23 NOV 93 / Brokers' pilgrimage fails to stop the fall: Mysticism and
some material facts affecting the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixty officials from leading Japanese brokerage houses made a pilgrimage
earlier this month to the Grand Shrine of Ise, the sanctuary of the Shinto
sun goddess, to try to stop the fall in the Tokyo stock market.
It didn't work. Yesterday the Nikkei 225 index fell to an eight-month low of
17,384.84, down 14 per cent from a month ago.
'It feels like August last year (when the market hit a six-year low),' says
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. 'Liquidity is
being drained from the market and the government is doing little to help.'
The catalysts for the fall have been technical, as they were last year. The
October listing of East Japan Railway, the largest flotation since 1987,
drained liquidity from the stock market. A shift in trading from the Nikkei
225 index to the Nikkei 300 index has also caused investors to unload stock
excluded from the new index, which has exaggerated the fall.
Such selling has been felt strongly in a market lacking support from public
pension and insurance funds. In addition, overseas investors, who were
attracted to the market since the yen's appreciation against the dollar
earlier this year, are no longer buying as the yen has started to retreat.
Technical factors aside, underlying confidence over the economy and
corporate earnings has continued to deteriorate and investors have become
increasingly uneasy at the price of shares. After a spate of poor earnings
estimates for the year to March, prospective price-earnings ratios were
pushed as high as 95 at the end of October.
Many of the companies that reported interim earnings during the past few
weeks have revised downward their profit estimates for the latter part of
the year. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, pre-tax
profits at 1,237 leading businesses are expected to fall 21 per cent for the
year to March and there are fears a recovery may not be seen until late next
year.
Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer, says the market's support
levels lie around 17,000 on the Nikkei 225 or 1,430 on the Topix index, 4.2
per cent below yesterday's close. Many analysts are disinclined to predict
how low the market could fall if shares do pass through these points.
With bank lending already weak from slack demand for funds, government
officials have repeatedly refused to support the stock market, arguing that
the effects on the financial system are limited.
However, the impact of a further market fall on business sentiment could be
devastating as companies may no longer be able to treat unrealised profits
on shareholdings as a buffer against poor earnings. Further erosion of such
unrealised gains could spark profit-taking. Banks, which want to use profits
on long-term shareholdings to cover losses from write-offs of their mounting
bad loans, are also likely to need to realise profits before share prices
fall further.
For a full recovery in share prices and investor confidence, an upturn in
the economy is essential but, what is more important, corporate leaders need
to implement aggressive restructuring to cut unwanted costs. For the past
year, leading companies have been announcing cost-cutting plans consisting
of restraining capital investment, shuffling staff and curbing production.
All have seemed half-hearted by western standards.
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management,
says the stock market will bottom out around April next year when companies
depart from the Japanese corporate tradition of life-time employment and
start shedding staff. 'The stock market is sounding its bell, warning that
earnings will not recover unless companies make that big decision,' he says.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Gloom gathers over recovery for Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A fresh set of gloomy Japanese economic indicators yesterday coincided with
the second biggest decline in share prices this year.
The 3.1 per cent fall in the Nikkei average, to its lowest since early
March, came amid gathering gloom over the prospects for economic recovery
and corporate earnings next year, although selling for technical reasons
played a part.
Economists across Tokyo are preparing to downgrade their forecasts for 1994,
but are split over whether gross national product will stagnate or grow
slightly, after stagnating or falling this year.
Disappointment that a recent government report on tax reform failed to set a
date or amount for an income tax cut was a factor in yesterday's fall in
share prices, analysts said. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister at the finance
ministry, who attributed the fall to uncertainty over company profits, said
the government would not take steps to support the market.
The Japanese economy's short-term prospects slipped into reverse in
September after having briefly touched the mid-point between growth and
decline in August, the Economic Planning Agency, the government's official
forecaster, said yesterday.
Its latest monthly diffusion index of leading economic indicators, which
measures the next six months' outlook, slipped to 36.4 on a scale of 100 in
September. In August, the index hovered at 50. Within the index, the main
components to switch from forward into reverse were job offers and sales of
consumer durables. Corporate confidence continued to wither for the fifth
month running.
Separately, the agency disclosed more evidence of the weakness of consumer
demand, with a 1.7 per cent decline in household spending in real terms in
September, compared with the same month last year, the fifth month of
decline.
Meanwhile, wholesale and retail sales fell by 4.1 per cent year on year in
the three months to September, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said. That is the seventh quarter of decline in a row, the longest
fall in commercial sales for 20 years. These figures will increase pressure
on a divided government to act over income tax.
'If the government does not change its attitude and cut taxes, all we can
expect is a stagnant economic situation next year,' Mr Hirohiko Okumura,
chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said.
Mr Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, said: 'Everyone
has written off this year's decline in the economy. The doubts now are about
next year; there is a big split of opinion.' SG Warburg is forecasting a 1
per cent increase in GNP for the next fiscal year.
Another factor in the stock market decline was investors' concern that
industrial companies have not cut costs severely enough, Mr Peter Tasker,
chief strategist at Kleinwort Benson, warned. 'It is OK to hold a lot of
surplus staff if there is a turnaround. But if the recovery does not come,
this becomes a serious drag on earnings.'

<TEXT>
Opposition parties yesterday hinted they might set up a Senate inquiry into
foreign ownership of Australia's press in light of the controversy over
dealings between the Keating government and media baron Mr Conrad Black.
Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the minority Australian Democrats party, said
the 'whole process' of determining foreign ownership rules in the media
should be examined. Mr Richard Alston, the opposition's communications
spokesman, said an inquiry was being 'seriously' considered.
The concerns centre on a decision by the Keating cabinet to allow Mr Black
to raise his holding in newspaper publisher John Fairfax from 15 to 25 per
cent. The issue resurfaced after disclosures that Premier Paul Keating
demanded 'more balanced' reporting in Fairfax-owned newspapers as a
condition to considering any increase in Mr Black's then stake.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Korean Air defiant over helicopters: Assembly of Black Hawks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Korean Air yesterday said it would not comply with a government order to
transfer the equipment and technology for assembling engines for the
American UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter to Samsung Aerospace.
The Korean Defence Ministry announced yesterday that Samsung Aerospace would
become the sole engine manufacturer for a second order of 57 Black Hawk
helicopters. Korean Air was appointed by Seoul in 1990 to assemble the first
81 UH-60 helicopters and engines bought by the country's armed forces.
South Korea's main airline, which has ambitions of developing aerospace
manufacturing, argued that the transfer of the licensed technology cannot be
done without the approval of General Electric of the US, the engine's
original manufacturer.
Korean defence officials said, however, they foresaw no problem from GE in
trans-ferring the license to Samsung.
Korean Air also claimed the change would disrupt its current production of
the UH-60 engines.
Samsung already provides some key UH-60 engine components to Korean Air,
which is part of the Hanjin business group.
The Defence Ministry explained that the measure would save almost Won10bn
(Pounds 8m) by concentrating both the manufacture of engine parts and engine
assembly under Samsung.
The decision comes at a critical point as South Korea's aerospace companies,
which also include Hyundai Precision and Daewoo Heavy Industries, are
seeking foreign technology to expand their activity into civilian aviation
and achieve the government's goal of transforming South Korea into one of
the world's 10 biggest aircraft manufacturers.
The Korean aerospace industry now largely consists of assembling US military
aircraft under license and supplying components for foreign-built passenger
jets.

He said they were dismissed from government departments and state-run

The cabinet also decided yesterday to hold a census of Pakistan's rapidly

that Egypt had agreed to supply Israel with 2m tonnes of natural gas a year

'There is no mention of any pipelines or agreements to supply certain

FT  23 NOV 93 / Peru seeks Dollars 7bn debt overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's economy and finance minister, Mr Jorge Camet, meets the country's
leading commercial bank creditors in New York today following the approval
of a law which will allows bank debt to be used as payment in
privatisations.
Mr Camet and the banks, led by Citibank, are aiming to initiate
renegotiation of Peru's Dollars 7bn debt with about 230 international
commercial banks.
Peru's Congress approved the law, under pressure from the administration of
President Alberto Fujimori, on Friday.
However, it left in place a potential stumbling block to the negotiations
with the banks by postponing debate over recognition of a controversial
Dollars 20m loan. The loan from Chemical Bank and American Express, made in
1984 for the purchase of two steamships, was repudiated by ex-president Alan
Garcia on the grounds it was fraudulent.
In Lima, the new legislation drew fire from some economists. They say it
confuses two contradictory objectives: the reduction of Peru's total debt
stock and the attraction of more bidders to the sluggish privatisation
programme. They accuse the banks of exerting pressure on the government to
benefit from the spiralling value of Peru's debt paper in the secondary
market.
Three years ago, Peruvian secondary debt was quoted at an all-time low of
around 4 cents on the dollar. By February this year it had climbed to 20
cents and now stands at about 54 cents, even though Peru's capacity to pay
is unchanged. The country's entire foreign debt totals some Dollars 22bn.
The precise amount of the commercial debt has yet to be determined.
Principal is only Dollars 2.7bn, but interest and penalties since Peru
halted service have pushed the total to between Dollars 6.5bn and Dollars
7bn.
According to economy ministry figures, the new law frees more than Dollars
10bn of secondary debt paper for privatisations.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Cuba set for 'collective government'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba is changing its method of government to a more collective form of
administration, according to Mr Roberto Robaina, the foreign minister.
Speaking in Jamaica at the weekend, he said the switch from dependence on
the leadership of one person - a situation that has existed for the past 34
years - was part of the political and economic changes being implemented by
President Fidel Castro's administration.
The changes would mean that the country's future would not depend on a new
person appearing to succeed President Castro, but on a strong collective
leadership.
Mr Robaina, who is making official visits to several of Cuba's neighbours,
is himself reported to be favoured by Mr Castro to play a prominent role in
the island's political leadership, and could be the next president.
Earlier this year President Castro said he hoped it would not be 'necessary'
for him to be president when his current term expired in five years.
'Fidel has been urging this change for a long time,' Mr Robaina said. 'There
are now many of the younger generation involved in this leadership project.'
The minister gave no details of how the collective form of government would
work, nor who would be involved. Diplomats in Havana said yesterday the plan
to move from strong individual leadership was an attempt by President Castro
to forestall any internecine fights among aspiring successors.
The government, which has been seeking private foreign investment in Cuba's
embattled economy has introduced several economic changes in the past six
months, allowing private and co-operative farms and permitting Cubans to
hold and use foreign currency.
Mr Robaina denied the changes were the result of US pressure.
'My country is suffering not only from the economic blockade by the US but
also from the collapse of its economic relationship with the former Soviet
Union,' he said.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Supporters of statehood for the District of Columbia were yesterday claiming
a symbolic victory even after the House of Representatives voted down a
proposal to bestow full democracy on the nation's capital.
Sunday's 277-153 vote came as no surprise. Only one Republican supported
statehood, along with about 60 per cent of the Democrats voting.
In reality, the prospects of DC ever gaining full independence, meaning two
senators and at least one House member as well as greater financial
autonomy, never stood a chance.
The capital's budget is still mostly determined by Congress, supplemented by
local property and sales taxes. Its mayor and city council are elected by
popular franchise, as is the delegate it sends to the House, whose vote,
however, is not counted if a result hangs on it. The 600,000 residents do
vote in presidential elections, however.
Mr Jesse Jackson, a leader of the statehood movement, complained the White
House had not worked hard enough for the lobbying campaign, though President
Bill Clinton is on record as supporting independence. But the DC delegate,
Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, said she was 'ready to declare victory right
now', mostly because the House debate was the first time either chamber had
considered statehood in full session.
The principal Republican objection is a natural aversion to creating two new
senators, both very likely to be liberal Democrats and probably black.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill to reform the
financing of election campaigns, agreeing to voluntary limits on spending
coupled with a vague promise of public funding for candidates.
The proposal split the House along party lines, with the Republican minority
criticising the measure as a sham reform that would favour incumbents
against their challengers, and thus help the Democrats preserve their
majority.
The bill passed yesterday would impose a voluntary spending ceiling of
Dollars 600,000 on campaign spending by candidates for the House, with
another Dollars 200,000 for those who win their party primaries by less than
20 percentage points.
It would limit campaign contributions from political action committees
formed by companies or interest groups to Dollars 200,000 and curb the
'bundling' of contributions, when a single group or lobbyist packages
individual donations.
Although the bill offers Dollars 200,000 of vouchers to pay for television
advertising to candidates who accept the limits, it gives no way of paying
for them, and few members of Congress are likely to go on record in a
separate vote as favouring public financing of elections.
However, since the Supreme Court ruled that mandatory campaign spending
limits were an unconstitutional curb on free speech, the only way of giving
meaning to spending limits is through a carrot such as public financing.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday persuaded both sides in the American
Airlines dispute to accept binding federal arbitration. In a surprise
announcement, he said the airline's flight attendants had agreed to end
their five-day strike that had threatened to disrupt travel during the
Thanksgiving holiday period.
American said it expected to resume a full schedule of flights today
although it warned passengers to expect continued delays.
Under the deal brokered by White House staff, a federal mediator acceptable
to both the management of American Airlines, the second largest US carrier
after United, and the flight attendants union will make binding decisions to
resolve the contract dispute over pay, working conditions and fringe
benefits.
Only 24 hours earlier the airline rejected a suggestion by the Association
of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 21,000 workers at
American, to request emergency federal mediation to resolve the stand-off.
Mr Clinton, who has wide powers to intervene in transport matters, said at a
White House press conference: 'This company and its employees are a very
important part of American economy, a very important part of the airline
sector that has been troubled for the last couple of years and that is a
very important part of our high-tech future.'
Mr Robert Crandall, the chairman of American, said: 'The president's
proposal of binding arbitration is much less troublesome than the threat of
a presidential emergency board.' However, he repeated his misgivings about
the arbitration process, saying that 'those who would create a final
solution to the dispute have no long-term stake in the future of the
company'.
Mr Crandall said American's decision to accept arbitration also reflected
the president's personal intervention.
'It is clearly unusual for the president to intervene in a matter of this
type. In view of his national responsibilities, we think his requests are
entitled to great deference.'
As part of the deal brokered by the president, American and the union agreed
that all employees would return to work under pre-strike conditions. A
series of work-rule changes instituted after the union's contract expired at
the end of last month would remain in effect.

Curacao has voted overwhelmingly to remain within the Netherlands Antilles
federation, rejecting the options of being an overseas possession of the
Netherlands or of political independence, reports Canute James from
Kingston.
The vote at the weekend was to determine whether the 170,000 people of the
Caribbean island wanted to follow neighbouring Aruba which left the
federation four years ago. The islands are a growing offshore banking and
financial services centre, and also depend on tourism.
The Dutch Caribbean islands are responsible for all aspects of their
administration, except foreign and military affairs which are controlled by
the Dutch government. Persistent reports of official corruption and
laundering of drug money have caused the Hague to consider increasing its
influence in local affairs.

Mexico's centre-right opposition National Action Party has chosen Mr Diego

candidate in next year's presidential election, writes Damian Fraser from
Mexico City.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is from the faction of PAN which supports
co-operation with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. He
negotiated with the PRI the recently approved democratic reforms, criticised
by many in PAN and on the left.
The candidate was elected with 65 per cent of the vote of party members. The
PRI has been in power for 64 continuous years, and is overwhelming favourite
to win next August's election.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is little known outside Mexico City, and his aloof
manner may put off many voters. His candidacy has been widely interpreted as
a help to Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential aspirant from the leftist
Party of Democratic Revolution.

popular franchise, as is the delegate it sends to the House, whose vote,
however, is not counted if a result hangs on it. The 600,000 residents do
vote in presidential elections, however.
Mr Jesse Jackson, a leader of the statehood movement, complained that the
White House had not worked hard enough for the lobbying campaign, though
President Bill Clinton is on record as supporting independence.
But the DC delegate, Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, said she was 'ready to
declare victory right now', mostly because the House debate was the first
time either chamber had considered statehood in full session.
The principal Republican objection is a natural aversion to creating two new
senators, both very likely to be liberal Democrats and probably black, given
the District's political and racial composition. But even prominent
Democrats like Mr John Dingell from Michigan argued in the debate that
federal interests in the capital city needed the continued protection of
Congress.
More than that, there is a common perception that DC is badly governed as it
is, particularly in its attempts to combat violent crime, now running at an
all-time high. Last month, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly asked for powers to call
in National Guard reservists to help police the streets, but was rebuffed by
Mr Clinton.
Successive DC governments have also been scandal-prone, especially that of
the previous mayor, Mr Marion Barry. He served a jail sentence for narcotics
offences, but once released was promptly elected to the city council and
retains a sizeable local following.
The principal pro-statehood argument is that it is anomalous that the
residents of DC, more numerous than in half a dozen other states, are not
fully enfranchised.

<TEXT>
A Canadian court has fined the local subsidiary of Japan's Sumitomo Chemical
CDollars 1.25m (Pounds 641,000) for taking part in an international
conspiracy to rig the market in forest insecticides, reports Bernard Simon
from Toronto.
The fine against Sumitomo brings total penalties imposed on three
multinationals involved in the arrangement to CDollars 5.4m. Chemagro, a
subsidiary of Bayer, the German chemicals group, was earlier fined CDollars
2m for two separate infringements. Both companies pleaded guilty.
Sumitomo and Chemagro arranged in the late 1980s to share the market for a
chemical insecticide used by provincial forestry agencies and private
companies in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The conspiracy was uncovered
when US-based Abbott Laboratories disclosed its involvement in another
arrangement with Chemagro.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Cuba set for 'collective government'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba is changing its method of government to a more collective form of
administration, according to Mr Roberto Robaina, the foreign minister.
Speaking in Jamaica at the weekend, he said the switch away from dependence
on the leadership of one person - a situation that has existed for the past
34 years - was part of the political and economic changes being implemented
by President Fidel Castro's administration.
The changes would mean that the country's future would not depend on a new
person appearing to succeed President Castro, but on a strong collective
leadership.
Mr Robaina, who is making official visits to several of Cuba's neighbours,
is himself reported to be favoured by Mr Castro to play a prominent role in
the island's political leadership, and could be the next president.
Earlier this year President Castro said he hoped it would not be 'necessary'
for him to be president when his current term expired in five years.
'Fidel has been urging this change for a long time,' Mr Robaina said. 'There
are now many of the younger generation involved in this leadership project.'
The minister gave no details of how the collective form of government would
work, nor who would be involved. Diplomats in Havana said yesterday that the
plan to move away from strong individual leadership was an attempt by
President Castro to forestall any internecine fights among aspiring
successors.
The government, which has been seeking private foreign investment in Cuba's
embattled economy has introduced several economic changes in the past six
months, allowing private and co-operative farms and permitting Cubans to
hold and use foreign currency.
Mr Robaina denied the changes were the result of US pressure.
'My country is suffering not only from the economic blockade by the US but
also from the collapse of its economic relationship with the former Soviet
Union,' he said.
'In a changing world it is necessary for everyone to find his own way. Cuba
is inserting itself into the world economy and not just trying to settle its
relations with the US.'
Cuba was willing to discuss the economic embargo with the US, but would do
so on the basis of 'mutual respect' and without preconditions, he said. 'We
have always been in a position to talk and the only condition which we have
strongly stated is mutual respect,' he said.

FT  23 NOV 93 / UK seeks delay on EU laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain yesterday called for a delay in complying with European Union
legislation on cleaning up sewage on the grounds that the Pounds 10bn cost
was five times higher than originally calculated.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor, told EU finance ministers that his request
was part of a British campaign to review - and possibly roll back - existing
EU laws on cost grounds.
Mr Clarke served notice that the UK intended to identify other environmental
and social legislation which he believed was burdening industry
unnecessarily.
The UK aim is to invoke the principle of 'subsidiarity' in the Maastricht
treaty which calls for power to be devolved from Brussels to the lowest
appropriate national, regional or municipal level. 'We need to open up the
whole area,' Mr Clarke said.
The 1991 urban waste water directive sets down a goal for cleaning up sewage
in cities by the year 2005. Mr Clarke made clear that the principle of
cleaner water was 'perfectly worthwhile', but only within an extended
timetable.
The Conservative government agreed to the 1991 directive, but Mr Clarke
suggested that the environment secretary at the time, Mr Michael Heseltine,
had in retrospect made a mistake because the cost of compliance had shot up
from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 10bn.
The Chancellor said the UK's request for a new timetable was justified in
order to avoid the costs of compliance being passed on to the UK consumer.
He was also pressing for finance ministers to be more closely involved in
monitoring EU legislation which placed new burdens on industry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consensus that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin should remain Russian prime minister
after the elections next month is emerging among Russian reformers,
including leaders of Russia's Choice, the party led by Mr Yegor Gaidar,
first deputy prime minister and economics minister.
Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a colleague of Mr Gaidar in Russia's Choice and head
of the Federal Information Centre, said he could see Mr Gaidar remaining the
'engine of reform' while Mr Chernomyrdin 'stood on the captain's bridge'.
Mr Chernomyrdin said in a weekend interview: 'I feel the full support of the
president in carrying out my duties.' He called for reforms to take a more
'social direction'.
Other pro-reform blocs, such as the Party of Unity and Accord led by Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, have urged Mr Chernomyrdin to remain as prime minister. Mr
Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister and leading member of Mr
Shakhrai's party, said last week that Russia's Choice would soon endorse Mr
Chernomyrdin.
Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, Mr Poltaranin's deputy and a leader of Russia's Choice,
said yesterday the group's position was to leave the choice of prime
minister to the president, and make no nomination themselves. But if
Russia's Choice, at present leading in the polls, does well in the
elections, Mr Gaidar and his supporters may feel themselves strong enough to
insist on his being chosen.
Against this, Mr Chernomyrdin is now regarded by reformers as having changed
his view on crucial issues - as on privatisation - and to now be an
enthusiast for many of the measures Mr Gaidar himself wishes to bring in. A
former energy minister, he is regarded as less abrasive than Mr Gaidar.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Kozyrev warns Armenia over aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, yesterday threatened Armenia
with 'something other than persuasion' if it did not curtail its support for
the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. It had
reached a limit, he said 'beyond which ..lies direct harm to Russia's
national and state interests'.
This is the first time a senior Russian politician has directly threatened
retaliation against Armenia for its sponsorship of the Karabakh independence
movement, a sponsorship the republic has always denied. It comes after an
incident at the weekend when Mr Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's mediator in the
Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict, came under fire and two Azeri escorts were
injured.
At a hastily-summoned news conference, Mr Kozyrev demanded a public apology
for the incident from Mr Levan Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia's president, along
with the punishment of those responsible. He threatened an end to Russian
aid if the apology were not forthcoming.
Armenia is heavily dependent on Russian assistance, especially over fuel.
Mr Kozyrev said his concern was motivated by the recent advance of the
Armenian forces far beyond the enclave's borders to take wide swathes of
Azeri territory, causing floods of refugees.
The conflict threatens to involve both Turkey and Iran on the side of
Azerbaijan. The stage seems set for pressure on Armenia to take part in
talks to end the conflict.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two unfinished office blocks were sold by the Kuwait Investment Office
yesterday for a fraction of their market value to creditor institutions and
to the parent company of one of the KIO's earliest domestic partners.
Called the Gateway to Europe because the towers lean towards each other, the
prestigious property at the northern end of Madrid was purchased by Caja de
Madrid, the city's savings bank, representing a syndicate of 24 financial
houses, and by FCC, a construction group. The buyers paid Pta16.6bn (Pounds
81.4m) at an auction held by receivers acting for Prima Inmobiliaria, the
property unit of the KIO's Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras.
Two earlier auctions for the property held by the receivers had attracted no
bidders when they had set reserve prices of of Pta85.9bn and Pta63bn. Under
domestic receivership rules, the third auction set no price and the only
buyers were Caja de Madrid and FCC which each acquired one of the blocks. An
estimated further Pta7bn will be required to complete the towers.
Prima Inmobiliaria, whose subsidiary Urbanor owned the site of the twin
towers and was developing the office blocks, went into receivership a week
after Grupo Torras declared itself bankrupt with debts of Dollars 2.1bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) in December last year. The crash of the KIO's Spanish holding
remains highly controversial owing to protracted disputes between its past
and former management, and is the object of complex court litigation.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Italy's political earthquake swallows up the centre ground:
Voters take revenge on corrupt politicians; Post-war ruling parties
humiliated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular collapse of the Christian Democrats in Sunday's municipal
elections has created a huge vacuum in the centre-ground of Italian
politics.
Local elections have traditionally mirrored closely voter loyalties in
general elections in Italy. There is nothing to suggest that Sunday's poll,
covering a quarter of the electorate in 428 cities and towns, might be an
exception.
Voters have swung in almost equal proportions to leftist coalitions and
individual right-wing parties. Every party associated with running the
country in the post-war era has been humiliated.
The outcome, clearly predicted by opinion polls, was scarcely surprising
given the discredit heaped on the ruling parties after 18 months of non-stop
revelations of monumental political corruption.
Indeed, it is remarkable the corruption scandals should have taken so long
to eat into traditional electoral habits, especially in the centre and south
of Italy. In local elections in June, the Christian Democrats nationwide
held on to over 20 per cent of the vote against 29 per cent in the April
1992 general elections.
This time the Christian Democrat vote has fallen to around 10 per cent
nationwide and it controls no major city administration. Their Socialist
allies along with their two other minor partners in the coalition supporting
the Ciampi government are close to extinction.
The speed of change is perhaps best measured against the minimal
fluctuations in party votes in the 30 years up to 1993. The Christian
Democrat vote never moved more than six percentage points.
Significantly, the polls over the past month have recorded a steady increase
in the polarisation of the vote away from the Christian Democrats, and this
trend seems to have been accentuated on polling day.
On the left, if such ideological labels still carry meaning, the formerly
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) has proved it has both the
organisation and the appeal to forge successful alliances up and down the
country. The PDS is also reaping the benefit of having been the first of the
traditional parties to reform itself, rejecting the Communist Party name in
1991 in favour of a Social Democratic image.
The PDS has relied in most cities on linking up with the Green and Radical
parties, and sometimes the referendum reformist movement of Mr Mario Segni,
as well as dissident Christian Democrats, as in Trieste, and hardline
ideological rivals, Reconstructed Communism, as in Taranto. These alliances
have been able to muster on average 40 to 45 per cent of the vote.
On the right, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has
demonstrated convincingly that it can obtain 30 per cent of the vote
throughout the north and be the largest party. The party has also begun to
push down towards the centre, doing well in a key city like Genoa - even if
the League is unlikely to wrest the prize of the mayor's seat in the
December 5 run-off.
Because all other parties 'ganged up' against the League, it may not be able
to obtain as much municipal power as it would like. Nevertheless, the League
should benefit considerably from the new laws for national electoral laws
introducing a first past the post system. And although regionally based, it
can claim around 20 per cent of the national vote and rivals the PDS for the
role of largest national party.
Just as the League has benefited from the discrediting of traditional
parties in the north, the neo-fascist MSI has proved it can do the same in
the centre and south. The MSI has done extraordinarily well in Rome and
Naples, gaining over a third of the vote and becoming the largest single
party.
The MSI has since the fifties been strong in southern Italy, running second
or third behind the Christian Democrats and Socialists. But the sudden
increase in its support is seen entirely as a protest vote to humble the
former Christian Democrat and Socialist potentates. The confused ideas of
the MSI, which look with nostalgia to Mussolini for inspiration, have played
little role in its new appeal.
Quite simply, if voters did not wish to endorse the PDS ticket in cities
such as Rome out of visceral mistrust of the communists, the MSI on Sunday
was about the only alternative. Moreover, it has not been smeared by
corruption, largely one suspects because it has been excluded from power by
the traditional parties.
If translated into a general election, Sunday's result would cut the share
of the vote of the four-party coalition supporting the government from 47
per cent to below 15 per cent. This makes the composition of parliament even
more out of tune with electoral opinion and complicates the task of the
Ciampi government. It makes early elections inevitable.
However, the full impact of the local elections will not be felt until after
December 5 when the municipal run-off elections take place. This will be a
key test for the PDS to demonstrate as in Turin in June that it can appeal
beyond the Left and attract a centre vote. If it can, the party will be well
placed to claim to lead the next coalition government - on Sunday's poll
there would be no alternative combination.
But the collapse of the traditional centre also leaves room for someone like
Mr Segni, the former Christian Democrat, to step in and pick up the pieces -
and retrieve votes from the MSI and League.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Ukraine shivers as energy dwindles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's rapidly dwindling energy supplies have prompted the prime
minister, Mr Yefim Zviagilsky, to call for an 'economic state of emergency'
to force energy saving measures.
The energy ministry has warned that Ukraine has reserves for just one month.
If nothing was done to help import gas and oil, the ministry said, Ukraine
'could expect an Armenian winter' - referring to last winter when Armenians
lived without heat and electricity during their war with Azerbaijan.
Ukrainian enterprises have already been asked to reduce the gas they use by
30 per cent, and some factories have been ordered to halve their energy
consumption.
Bankrupt Ukraine, reliant on Russia for about 90 per cent of its oil and
gas, owes its eastern neighbour about Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) for energy.
Negotiations to swap debt for Ukraine's share of the Black Sea fleet have
stalled and the republic has no money for energy shipments.
According to the energy ministry Dollars 300m worth of oil and gas is needed
immediately, and it is urging the government to resume negotiations with
Russia for special winter deliveries. It calculates that Dollars 9bn worth
of oil and gas will be needed to get through 1994 without factory closures.
Russia has been raising energy prices in an effort to stop its subsiding of
former Soviet republics. It currently charges Ukraine about 70 per cent of
world prices - in roubles, rather than Ukraine's currency, which has lost
more than 80 per cent of its value in the past three months.
But the Ukrainian economy has been too weak to absorb these price shocks.
Kiev subsidises electricity for the domestic market by about 90 per cent,
and is thus unable to cover the cost of energy imports with receipts from
its sale.
Instead, the republic's leaders have used export earnings from agriculture
and metals. But their recent currency control policies have discouraged
official exports, leaving state coffers empty. Ukraine is only earning
Dollars 15m a week, and it needs around Dollars 20m a day for energy.
Ukraine's domestic energy sector provides about half the country's needs,
but is experiencing difficulties. Nuclear power stations are plagued by
shortages of fuel and safety concerns. Coal mines are nearly exhausted and
are controlled by politically active unions who frequently strike.
The energy crisis is now dominating parliament, and has prompted a special
energy producers' congress and an emergency cabinet meeting on the subject.
Some argue that the government needs to issue more credits, but as the
parliamentary chairman, Mr Ivan Plyshch, points out: 'If you want paper, the
so-called legal currency, I can give the order for the printing presses to
start running right away. But that would only add to hyperinflation.'
Ironically, the energy crunch is forcing Kiev's Soviet-style leaders to
contemplate the previously unthinkable: closing down inefficient industries.
'Since we can't stop heating homes or supplying agriculture with fuel, we
must close down a number of high-energy-use enterprises,' said Mr Vilen
Semenyuk, energy minister. 'The only other choice is to get more fuel.'
Meanwhile, with temperatures touching minus 20'C, Ukrainians are adjusting
to power cuts and colder homes and offices in the worst winter for 50 years.

Germany's coalition partners will today decide whether to accept fresh
proposals for compensating former property owners in east Germany. If
accepted, it could pave the way to ending a two-year-old dispute which has
hindered investment in the region.
The proposals, drawn up by a working group led by Mr Friedrich Bohl, head of
the Chancellery office, would increase the amount of money paid to former
owners, as well as abandon a controversial tax penalty which would have been
imposed on those receiving compensation.
The compromise package will leave the finance ministry with a deficit of
DM10bn (Pounds 3.9bn). But it could speed up investment in eastern Germany
which has been plagued by outstanding property disputes. Fewer than a
quarter of eastern Germany's 1.2m claims on 2.6m titles have been resolved.
Those who had property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and
by the communists between 1949 and 1990 are entitled to full restitution or
compensation. Owners of property expropriated by the occupying Soviet forces
between 1945 and 1949 cannot get their land back. But under the latest draft
proposals, they will receive the same levels of compensation.
The Compensation Fund, set up to pay former owners, will be increased by
DM4.5bn to DM17bn, and financed partly by income earned by the Treuhand
privatisation agency.
Those entitled to compensation will receive coupons which can be cashed in
from 2004. The value of the coupons will be based on the 1935 valuation of
property.

FT  23 NOV 93 / German heavyweights enter the ring for telecom networks

Three of Germany's largest companies have forged an alliance to exploit the
liberalising European telecommunications market.
Mannesmann, the engineering group, RWE, the energy-based conglomerate, and
Deutsche Bank, the country's largest bank, said yesterday they had formed a
consortium to offer telecoms networks to corporate clients in Germany, from
next January. The services on offer will include voice telephony, data
transmission and valued added services such as electronic mail.
The services are not yet available beyond individual corporate clients,
because the public network is still run as a monopoly by state-owned
Deutsche Telekom. But the move represents an important challenge to Deutsche
Telekom which controls the public voice network in Germany. Its monopoly is
due to be removed in 1998 when telecommunications are liberalised in the
European Union.
The consortium, which requires approval by Brussels, is led by Mannesmann,
which already operates a mobile telephone network in Germany and which will
have 50 per cent of the new company. Deutsche Bank and RWE Energie will each
own 25 per cent.
It will establish a client base which should be able to develop its own
voice network to compete with Deutsche Telekom once telecoms are fully
liberalised.
'This is showing that competition for basic voice services is already
starting ahead of liberalisation' a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom said.
RWE, Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank also announced they would set up a second
consortium to bid for a licence to operate a mobile network for data
transmission. This consortium is led by RWE, which has long expressed its
intention to diversify into the growing telecoms market. It will also
include Telia International, the Swedish group offering data services and
Cofira, which operates a mobile telephone network in France. The consortium
will offer private clients the possibility to transmit data via a mobile
network.
At the moment, only Modacom, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, operates such
a network, in place since the beginning of the year. But the German post and
telecoms ministry is due to issue a second licence by the end of May, thus
adding fresh competition in the area of mobile telecoms, which is already
liberalised in Europe.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Market fall blamed on money growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpectedly strong growth in German money supply during October was blamed
partly for a sharp fall in the Frankfurt stock market yesterday, but
economists were divided over its impact on prospects for interest rates.
Provisional Bundesbank figures showed the broad M3 measure, seasonally
adjusted, expanded at an annualised 6.8 per cent, unchanged from September,
and still above the bank's 6.5 per cent ceiling.
Stock exchange traders, concerned that further interest rate cuts may be
delayed, marked down stocks. The blue-chip Dax index fell 47.37 points (2.28
per cent), to close at 2,030.
Money market operators saw the rising dollar as a potential hindrance to
early cuts in the Bundesbank's key discount lending rate, last reduced 0.5
to 5.75 per cent a month ago.
But economists said continuing weakness in the German economy and falling
inflation would encourage the central bank to stick to its established
policy of cautious easing.
Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in
Frankfurt, said he expected November inflation in west Germany to fall to
3.6 per cent compared with 3.9 per cent in October.
Figures from the federal statistics office yesterday showed west German
producer prices unchanged in October, though still 0.3 per cent down on a
year earlier.
Bundesbank private-sector lending rose at an annualised 9.2 per cent in the
six months to the end of October, against 8.2 per cent in the same period to
the end of September.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Petrochemicals Europe face difficult future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's petrochemicals industry is facing a fundamental decline in
competitiveness, according to Mr Edward Wilson, vice-president strategic
planning of Dow Europe.
'The problems on the horizon loom large and the social and economic
consequences are frightening,' he said. The region's trade surplus in
petrochemicals was shrinking as imports grew faster than exports, European
chemical output was slowing, while the Pacific region had become the
fastest-growing chemical producing area, he told the Financial Times
petrochemicals conference yesterday.
Europe was suffering from high monopoly energy pricing, high-cost, low
productivity labour, high environmental costs, and a punishing tax regime,
said Mr Wilson. In addition, the sector suffered from a lack of pipeline
infrastructure to transport low-cost ethylene to low-cost downstream plastic
manufacturers.
'American ethylene manufacturers are earning twice the amount on their
investment as the best European counterparts. The average return on
investment in 1991 for North American producers was 28 per cent, compared
with a European average of 13 per cent,' said Mr Wilson.
A pick-up in the growth of the world economy next year would not bring back
petrochemical operating rates back to peak levels before 1997 or 1998, said
Mr Wilson. Certain sectors would continue to be troubled. Demand for PVC
would be flat for the rest of the decade because of public pressure to
reduce the use of chlorine, he warned.
Poor pricing was not the root cause of the industry's problems, but rather
the reflection of those problems. The industry needed to rationalise, but
the traditional method of looking at the viability of ethylene plants was
flawed. Normally, analysts only looked at costs. If back-integration with
refineries, logistics and the choice of downstream products were analysed a
different picture emerged.
'Under current conditions there is a Dollars 200 difference per tonne of
ethylene between the best and worst European plant, but there is a Dollars
1,000 difference between the lowest and highest margin,' said Mr Wilson.
The determination of the Italian and French governments to privatise their
petrochemicals companies should allow former state companies to participate
in facing up to the industry's crisis, said Mr Wilson.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Sainsbury's links promotion to Sunday working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, has told its managers promotion
prospects may depend on their willingness to work on Sundays if parliament
agrees to deregulate weekend trading.
The warning appears in a memo to branch managers from Mr Colin Harvey,
Sainsbury's retail sales director, a copy of which has been passed to the
FT.
The memo, which sets out Sainsbury's plans for changes to management
contracts, says Sunday working will become 'a way of life' if the
government's Sunday trading bill succeeds.
Mr Harvey assures staff that reluctance to work on Sundays will not affect
the company's assessment of career potential. However, he says exposure to
larger stores is important to career development. 'Willingness to work on
Sundays will obviously be one, although clearly not the only, factor that we
have to take into account when making appointments to such stores.'
The issue of employment rights - including promotion prospects - will be
crucial to the success of the bill. Ministers say the draft bill protects
employees who refuse to work on Sundays from being denied training or
promotion.
The branch manager who passed the memo to the FT said he wanted to expose
concern about Sunday working arrangements among retail managers throughout
the industry.
'If this is indicative of the retail trade, then there really is no
protection for the family rights of management within this sector,' he said.
Mr George Robertson, Sainsbury's solicitor, said the company was committed
to continuing the voluntary working arrangements applying in stores which
already open on Sundays.
'Good managers are hard to come by. We have to put them in the right place,
and whether or not they wish to work on Sundays would be only one of the
things that we have to take into account,' he said.
However, the memo prompted concern among critics of the bill which offers
four options for deregulation, ranging from tight control to a free-for-all.
Mr David Alton, a leading Liberal Democrat opponent, said it demonstrated
'the unbearable pressures being placed on employees to work on Sundays.'
Ms Joan Ruddock, of Labour's front bench, plans to question Sainsbury's
about the memo. 'The question that needs to be asked is whether this means
that a manager who is not willing to do Sunday duties cannot have a
management role,' she said. Sainsbury's has endorsed a code of practice
published by the Shopping Hours Reform Council which gives protection to
employees who refuse to work on Sundays. A Sainsbury's briefing document
last year also pledged that 'all Sunday working is voluntary'.
It continued: 'We are committed to ensuring that staff do not feel
pressurised into working on Sundays. There is no discrimination against
those staff who do not want to work on Sundays.'

FT  23 NOV 93 / Major acts to boost prince's envoy role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday pledged to improve government
co-operation with royal visits to Britain's trade partners.
He was said to be 'keen' to do everything possible to assist Prince Charles,
whose frustrations over lack of official co-operation were reported in
yesterday's Financial Times. 'If it is put to us that there are problems, we
will investigate them,' Downing Street said.
Embarrassed officials revealed that Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister,
will meet Prince Charles soon to discuss how he can help in promoting
exports.
The officials said the prince's comments - made during his recent tour of
the Middle East - had taken ministers by surprise.
The government resisted parallels between the prince's dismay and the shabby
treatment of royalty in Michael Dobbs' To Play the King, currently on
television.
Officials said suggestions that the Prince of Wales was being 'frozen out'
because of his marital difficulties and veiled criticisms of government
policy were 'fiction'.
Downing Street said: 'The prime minister is very keen to develop British
exports overseas, and as far as that involves using members of the royal
family he would be very keen to do that.'
Nevertheless, the prince's public expression of his complaints shocked
Whitehall, which replied by giving examples of government co-operation with
overseas visits by royalty.
The prince has tried with little success to encourage UK government
departments to take a more strategic approach to his overseas visits, which
he feels could be better exploited.
His private office has been making fresh attempts recently to improve links
with Whitehall, particularly through the DTI, which has launched an
ambitious programme of export promotion events.
Mr Needham's meeting with the prince is expected to explore ways of ensuring
that co-operation between the DTI and the prince is given a higher priority.
The DTI said the meeting was planned before the prince's frustrations over
lack of government support for his role as a commercial ambassador were
reported.
However, the prince's office believes the DTI has not understood the full
potential of the prince in helping to promote British companies and products
overseas.

FT  23 NOV 93 / EU offers Serbia deal on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday backed a Franco-German plan to offer Serbia a
gradual suspension of United Nations sanctions in exchange for more land for
Bosnia's embattled Moslems. It was the union's first joint action under the
Maastricht treaty.
Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg alongside the Western
European Union, the EU's embryonic defence arm, also threatened force to get
aid through Bosnia.
Last night, though, UN soldiers were reported to be preparing to start
delivering food to civilians after the Bosnian Croat militia commander, Mr
Ante Russo, agreed to allow safe passage of aid convoys.
Aid deliveries were suspended four weeks ago after attacks on convoys, and
Bosnia's huge refugee population faces catastrophe as winter takes hold.
The 12 foreign ministers, with Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, and
commanders of the UN peace force, have invited military and political
leaders of the warring parties to Geneva on Monday to discuss humanitarian
aid and steps towards a peace settlement.
The US and Russia are being invited to Geneva.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'We are very anxious not to get
into any tangles, as we did earlier in the year with the Americans', when
the US and Europe clashed over Washington's plan to lift the UN arms embargo
on Bosnia and to bomb Serb positions.
Ministers made clear that they were offering only a progressive phasing out
of sanctions on Serbia and its ally Montenegro. That will be conditional on
Serb, and possibly Croat, surrender of some of the land seized from Bosnian
Moslems; a ceasefire; and undisturbed passage for aid convoys and airlifts
into Tuzla, Mostar and Sarajevo.
The total suspension of sanctions, in accordance with UN Security Council
resolution 871, would be contingent on a deal being reached over the Serb
enclave of Krajina in south Croatia, and over Belgrade's domination of the
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.

FT  23 NOV 93 / European markets slip on rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in securities markets in Japan and the US brought setbacks in share
prices throughout Europe yesterday. Disappointing money supply statistics
from Germany increased apprehension that global interest rates might be
about to turn upwards.
In London, the FT-SE 100 Share Index fell 37.4 points to 3,070.6 and
analysts began to question whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would
be able to deliver the cut in domestic interest rates that has been widely
predicted in the Budget.
Wall Street opened sharply lower, but recovered to close 23.76 down at
3,670.25. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 6.38 per cent
from 6.33 as signs of a stronger economy brought back fears of inflation.
In Germany, the DAX index of leading stocks shed 2.3 per cent, while in
France the CAC-4O index tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The markets had earlier
been undermined by a 3 per cent fall in Tokyo.
Analysts said the German money supply figures indicated there was now less
scope for interest rate cuts before the end of the year. They warned of a
further share price fall if German inflation data later this week turned out
to be disappointing.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Italy's poll rout sparks sharp fall in lira, shares:
Coalition support collapses as left and far right make sweeping gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italian financial markets fell sharply yesterday after the former communists
and the far right made sweeping gains in local elections as ruling parties
suffered an unprecedented collapse in support.
Shares on the Milan bourse declined an average 3.2 per cent and the lira
weakened in the belief that the rout of parties backing prime minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi would increase political uncertainty ahead of a general
election expected early next year.
The weekend polls, which covered a quarter of the electorate in 428 cities
and towns, resulted in a severe mauling for every party that has ruled Italy
since the second world war.
According to preliminary returns, the long-dominant Christian Democrat vote
fell to no more than 10 per cent - less than half its showing in local polls
in June. The election rebuff left the Christian Democrats and their three
allies in the ruling coalition with less than 15 per cent of the vote,
against 48.8 per cent in the 1992 general elections.
The big beneficiary was the Democratic Left (PDS), the former Communist
party, and the leftwing alliances it sponsored.
On the right, the protest vote in central and southern Italy swung heavily
in favour of the neo-fascist MSI. The MSI is expected to pick up about 30
per cent of the vote in Rome and Naples.
In northern Italy, the populist Northern League continued to attract a
protest vote.
The Christian Democrats have now lost control of every big city
administration, including Palermo, the Sicilian capital, where Mr Leoluca
Orlando and founder of the reformist movement, La Rete (The Network)
obtained a remarkable 74 per cent to become mayor in a clear rebuff to the
dominance of the Mafia.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, Christian Democrat leader, said: 'The defeat was very
severe, very bitter and much bigger in scale than one could imagine.'
On the basis of Sunday's poll involving 11.1m voters, a quarter of the
electorate, the sole political force likely to muster a coalition to govern
Italy after an early general election would be the PDS. But the PDS is the
heir to the former Communist party of Italy (PCI) and since 1947 the
political and business establishment has fought to prevent the Communists
from entering government.
Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, sought to calm fears that Italian
politics had polarised between left and right. He said he was anxious to
co-operate with forces in the centre.
The markets believe that the collapse in support for the coalition parties
is likely to weaken Mr Ciampi's authority as his government, mainly
technocrats, seeks to win approval for the 1994 budget. There are also fears
that the privatisation programme will be slowed or altered.
The Milan bourse saw its largest single decline since November 1992 in the
wake of the European currency crisis. However, the shares of quoted
companies in which the state is due to sell off its stake fared worse.
The lira had already weakened last week, influenced by opinion polls
predicting a shift of voter allegiance. However, the sheer scale of the
shift was underestimated and the lira fell to L988 against the D-Mark
compared with L975 last week.

FT  23 NOV 93 / EU backs plan to restore land to Bosnian Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday backed a Franco-German plan to offer Serbia a
gradual suspension of UN sanctions in exchange for more land for Bosnia's
embattled Moslems. It was the Union's first joint action under the
Maastricht treaty.
Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg alongside the Western
European Union, the EU's embryonic defence arm, also threatened to use force
to get aid convoys through Bosnia.
Aid deliveries were suspended four weeks ago after attacks on convoys, and
Bosnia's huge refugee population faces catastrophe as winter takes hold.
The 12 foreign ministers, along with Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, and
commanders of the UN peace force, have invited military and political
leaders of the warring parties to Geneva on Monday to discuss humanitarian
aid and the steps towards a peace settlement.
The EU plan has been discussed with Washington, and the US and Russia are
being invited to Geneva next Monday. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
said 'we are very anxious not to get into any tangles, as we did earlier in
the year with the Americans', when the US and Europe clashed over
Washington's plan to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia and to bomb Serb
positions.
Ministers made it clear yesterday that they were offering only a progressive
phasing out of sanctions on Serbia and its ally Montenegro. This will be
conditional on Serb, and possibly Croat, surrender of some of the land
seized from Bosnian Moslems, a ceasefire, and untramelled passage for aid
convoys and airlifts into Tuzla, Mostar and Sarajevo.
The total suspension of sanctions, in line with UN Security Council
resolution 871, would be contingent on an agreement being reached over the
Serb enclave of Krajina in south Croatia, and over Belgrade's domination of
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.
The presence of Bosnia's contending militia commanders at the Geneva meeting
was seen yesterday as vital to the plan's prospects. Last Thursday, Mrs
Sadako Ogata, the UN high commissioner for refugees, gained agreement from
the Bosnian parties' political leaders to reopen main aid supply routes this
week, but they are still blocked.
The EU now wants local military commanders to sign up to last week's
agreement, and for UN forces to be able to take military action - including
from the air - against 'uncontrolled elements' who flout it.
Of the three main contributors of troops to UN forces in Bosnia, France
emphasised that using force was not excluded, while Spain said militia units
breaking any accords reached in Geneva would be treated as 'irregulars'. Mr
Hurd said 'there might be action' against those breaking agreements but
'that was a matter for judgment'.
He said General Jean Cot, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, who briefed
ministers yesterday, had made clear 'the impossibility of forcing aid
through against sustained opposition'.

A Johannesburg gun battle in which Mrs Winnie Mandela's driver-bodyguard was
shot dead beside her was a non-political street quarrel, police said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Soweto.
But the African National Congress called for further investigation of the
possibility gunmen had tried to kill Mrs Mandela, the estranged wife of the
ANC leader.
A total of 18 shots were fired in the fight which took place in a street
crowded with revellers attending a festival. Mrs Mandela was unharmed.

Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a former finance minister and a prominent
Christian Democrat in Naples, has admitted receiving illicit funds, writes
Robert Graham in Rome.
In an interrogation by Milan magistrates at the weekend - the first under
new rules loosening parliamententary immunity - he admitted receiving up to
L5bn (Dollars 3m) from Ferruzzi-Montedison.
The Ferruzzi family claimed the money was part of L150bn paid to politicians
to facilitate the sale of the group's stake in Enimont, the chemicals joint
venture with Eni, the state oil concern.

The new share settlement system proposed for the City of London will cost
about half as much as the Stock Exchange's failed Taurus project, according
to details to be unveiled later this week. But because the new system will
be much less sophisticated, companies are likely to have to spend more
developing their computer link-ups.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Pacific rim ushers in 'brave new era for trade': Leaders
foresee wider economic partnership after historic summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Pacific rim countries, meeting in an unprecedented summit at the
weekend, set out a vision of economic partnership which they said would give
the Asia Pacific region a new voice in world affairs and would spearhead
global growth in the 21st century.
Although they stopped far short of establishing a formal economic community,
the leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping indicated
gathering momentum by agreeing to meet again in Jakarta in 1994 and calling
a meeting of finance ministers in the first half of the year to discuss
macroeconomic developments and capital flows.
The heads of government of the US, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Brunei, together with ministers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, met for six hours
in a replica of an Indian log longhouse on Blake Island, near Seattle.
The summit, held at the invitation of President Bill Clinton, was symbolic
of the rapid growth of Asian economies and Pacific trade. It was remarkable
for its studied informality, with few prepared statements and plenty of
chats in small groups.
The leaders issued a 'vision statement' which steered well clear of the many
bilateral problems dividing Apec members and contained few specific
commitments, but said: 'Our economies are moving toward interdependence and
there is a growing sense of community among us.' The region, they noted,
accounts for 40 per cent of the world's population and 50 per cent of its
gross national product.
The statement's vagueness underlined the nervousness of Asian countries
about creating new formal structures for co-operation, and particularly
about agreeing to anything which could be interpreted as submitting to US
domination.
However, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said the summit had
'diminished fears some countries might have had about the US and its motives
and the whole development of Apec.'
Mr Clinton said: 'We've agreed that the Asian-Pacific region should be a
united one, not divided. We've agreed that our economic policies should be
open, not closed.'
The leaders were emphatic that they were not attempting to establish an
exclusive trade bloc and that they were determined to win a strengthened
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Most Apec countries, in a bid to
give impetus to talks on the Gatt Uruguay Round, offered new tariff cuts in
an agreement hammered out by ministers in Seattle last week.
Mr Clinton said: 'We want Europe to work with us to get a good Gatt
agreement by the end of the year. That's the message we want to send to our
European friends.' Gatt negotiators in Geneva are seeking an accord by a
December 15 deadline.
Mr Winston Lord, the US state department official responsible for Asia, told
reporters: 'I think we will look back in ten or twenty years time and
consider that this leaders' conference was a turning point in the
Asia-Pacific.' Apec members were, he said, moving towards forming a
community 'in the sense of a family and in the sense of shared purpose.'
The US enthusiasm for partnership with Asia underlines Mr Clinton's
recognition of the region's growth and the need for the US to be involved in
it for the sake of its future prosperity. However, he also emphasised that
the US was stepping up its focus on the pursuit of human rights and
democracy, as well as market access.
Mr Clinton's bilateral meetings with China's President Jiang Zemin and Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, produced no new commitments.
China's insistence that the US should not link trade and human rights issues
found an echo with virtually every other participating country.
Nevertheless, the leaders agreed to establish a Pacific Business Forum which
would identify areas in which trade and investment could be facilitated,
particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. They will also establish
a programme to develop regional co-operation in higher education.

Important inflation data in Germany this week will affect the market's
perception of how quickly and how soon the Bundesbank is likely to lower its
lending rates.
Attention today will focus on the October M3 growth rate with many believing
it will fall within the 4.5-6.5 per cent target range for the first time
this year. The consensus forecast suggests M3 in October will rise by 6.7
per cent.
Later in the week, the Federal Statistics Office releases the preliminary
cost of living index for November. In the year to October, cost of living
inflation was 3.9 per cent, its lowest since June. Analysts expect the index
to have risen 3.7 per cent in the year to November.
The last week before the Budget in the UK brings few economic statistics,
but the Confederation of British Industry releases its November industrial
trends survey on Friday. It will give a clue as to whether or not the UK is
enjoying a non-inflationary recovery with strong exports. On Thursday, the
CBI produces its forecasts and recommendations for the Budget.
In Spain, third-quarter unemployment is forecast to be about 23 per cent.
This measure comes from a quarterly survey based on a rather loose
definition of unemployment. A poor figure will probably boost the bond
market in the expectation that pressure will increase for lower interest
rates.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Germany triggers wave of
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Deutsche Bundesbank's repo rate reduction last Tuesday triggered a wave
of money market easing across Europe, writes Conner Middelmann.
The Bundesbank's two-week repo rate fell by nine basis points to 6.29 per
cent on Tuesday. That was followed by Thursday's announcement of a 6.25 per
cent fixed-rate repo for this week, which was seen as a signal from the
German central bank that while rates will continue to fall, they will only
ease gradually.
The Bundesbank's rate cut, preceded by a unilateral Danish rate reduction on
Monday, was followed in the course of the week by cuts in money market rates
in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Norway and Portugal.
Some say this may continue in the near term if the D-Mark stays weak against
its partners in the European exchange-rate mechanism, allowing them to trim
their rates further.
France is eyed as a prime candidate for near-term easing, especially since
its currency strengthened markedly against the D-Mark over the last week.
The franc closed at FFr3.4690 on Friday, up from FFr3.4830 a week ago.
However, with the French authorities intent on safeguarding the value of the
franc while rebuilding their foreign currency reserves, many market players
feel the Bank of France will wait for cuts in Germany's leading rates before
making a move. The Bundesbank's central bank council is widely expected to
lower its key discount and Lombard rates at one of its two December
meetings.
The dollar ended the week on a strong note, buoyed by high hopes for world
trade talks and a general optimism on the US economy. Dealers said the
currency's ability to hang on at the end of the week, a change from the
usual Friday profit-taking, indicated it could see further gains this week.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG
It has been an interesting time for Hong Kong watchers over the past few
days: Morgan Stanley's Barton Biggs cut his weighting in the equity market,
Nomura's Nick Knight increased his and Goldman Sachs downgraded Hong Kong
Telecom, one of the key stocks.
This week could be just as uneasy - the Hang Seng index dropped back 4.5 per
cent last week - as investors wait to see if US money continues flowing.
Some analysts suggest that, in any case, the market may consolidate before a
traditional rally prior to the Chinese new year.
BANGKOK
TelecomAsia has fixed the offer price of its sale of 223m shares at Bt55 a
share, making it Thailand's biggest public offering, valued at Bt12.3bn.
The offer period for the telecommunications group will take place this week
with the shares due to be listed by mid-December. Half the shares will be
offered to Thai investors and half to overseas institutions. The company
will have the market's second biggest capitalisation, following Bangkok
Bank.
MOSCOW
Russia's biggest single oil producer is being offered for sale to domestic
investors via a public auction. Surgutneftegaz, a Siberian company, is
offering 12.05 per cent of its shares, but foreigners are not permitted to
subscribe. They will, however, be able to invest up to 15 per cent in parent
group Yukos when that is floated in due course although no date for that has
been set.
BRATISLAVA
Daily trading and weekly auctions in the country's over-the-counter market
are expected to be introduced from January. RMS Slovakia AS, which manages
trading on the OTC, commented that this would replace the current monthly
auctions and hoped to attract both retail and institutional investors.
TURKEY
Foreign investment trusts and mutual funds purchasing shares in Turkey are
to be exempted from corporate and witholding tax. Mr Stuart Harley of
Schroders said the decision clarified what had been a grey area. Overseas
investors have been very active in the Istanbul market this year, while
declining short-term interest rates have prompted domestic investors to
switch into equities.
VENEZUELA
The government has suspended the privatisation programme two weeks ahead of
general elections. President Ramon Velasquez said a decision on how to
proceed with the programme would be taken by the new administration when it
takes office on February 2.
The proposed flotation of Aeropostal, the state airline, is among the
casualties.
ZIMBABWE
Zimbabwe, added to the IFC's emerging market's index last week along with
China, is beginning to attract a limited amount of foreign interest,
although it still remains very illiquid. The industrial index of some 50
stocks has been recovering this year after a steep fall in 1992 because of a
severe drought.
PNG
Another new addition to the list of the world's emerging markets could come
about later next year after the government here said that if there was
enough interest from brokers and dealers a stock exchange could become
operational.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Primary beneficiaries of the passage of
Nafta - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement may not herald a
Latin American stock market boom, but it sure helped avoid a bust. A
collapse of the agreement would have battered the Mexican stock market and
the other Latin American markets would have suffered in its wake.
Worse, for longer-term market prospects, it would have threatened the
Mexican government's economic strategy. Many economists believed capital
outflows from Mexico after Nafta's demise would have made a devaluation
difficult to avoid.
A Mexican devaluation would have worried holders of the Argentine peso,
whose parity with the US dollar is the bedrock of Argentina's anti-inflation
strategy. Economic problems would probably have engulfed Latin America's
second economy - Mexico - and its third - Argentina.
The largest economy - Brazil - meanwhile, is so preoccupied with domestic,
political and economic difficulties that Nafta's failure would hardly have
registered. The Brazilian market rallied last week, not because of Nafta,
but because many Brazilians see it as the best place to hold capital in the
face of the shock economic programme they now view as likely.
Of course, Nafta guarantees nothing. As investors were reminded on Friday as
the US stock and bond markets tumbled, continued flows of capital from the
US into Latin American markets depend to a large part on investors avoiding
panic at home.
Nonetheless, its passage continues to provide a reason for institutional
investors to look to the region to boost returns. For Latin American
economies, the major consequence of Nafta is probably the boost it gives to
the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. But says Ms Tamzin
Hobday, Latin American strategist at Baring Securities in New York: 'From
the market perspective, the important issue is that it provides support for
the kind of economic model Latin American economies have been following.'
It should reinforce incentives, she and others suggest, for Latin
governments to continue to pursue free trade and market-oriented economic
policies. Yet in stock market terms, the impact of Nafta's passage will be
far from equal across the hemisphere.
Most observers believe that two markets, other than Mexico's, will be the
primary beneficiaries: Argentina and Chile. More peripheral markets such as
Colombia and Peru may also benefit, some reckon. But most analysts think
Venezuela or Brazil have little to gain, and Brazil might even be a loser.
Chile and Argentina have been identified by US officials, in that order, as
the next candidates to join Nafta, and both governments are clearly
interested in the prospect. These two countries are most like Mexico in
terms of economic policy, and have inflation more or less under control. In
trade terms, both have much less to gain from Nafta than Mexico. Only about
14 per cent of Argentina's exports go to the US, and 17 per cent of Chile's,
compared with 73 per cent of Mexico's and 23 per cent of Brazil's. Yet the
reduced risk of a reversal of economic strategy with Nafta on the cards is
viewed by analysts as definitely helping flows to the stock market.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis, head of emerging markets equity research at Bear Stearns
in New York, sees the price to earnings multiple of the Buenos Aires market
falling from 18 this year to 14 next. The benefits of corporate
restructurings brought about by the country's economic programme should
begin to flow through to earnings in 1994, he believes.
In the Chilean market, the average p/e should slip from 17 to 14. Mexico's
current p/e is about 14.5, but could rise with a market rally to 16.5 by the
year end, Mr Dennis says.
On the other side of the coin, Venezuela is so wrapped up with domestic
preoccupations that it is unlikely to benefit much, even though US officials
consistently suggest it could follow Chile and Argentina into the agreement.
With two military coup attempts last year and presidential impeachment
proceedings this year, Venezuela faces presidential, congressional and
municipal elections on December 5. A populist is leading in most published
opinion polls, and even if he does not win, the new Venezuela Congress is
likely to be fragmented and ill-disposed to economic reform.
As for Brazil, it may be the one large economy in the region that will
suffer from the passage of Nafta, since its mix of export products is very
similar to Mexico's. 'Mexico's tariff-free access to this important market
cannot be good for Brazil,' says Mr Stephen Rose of the London-based Stephen
Rose &amp; Partners, a broker specialising in the Argentine and Brazilian
markets.
Both politically and economically, Brazil seems the last in line to accede
to Nafta. Politicians and bureaucrats in Braslia are absorbed in the
country's domestic turmoil. When they think about it, they are suspicious of
Nafta, reckoning the North Americans should stick to North America.

this weekend.

financial markets, and hopes to raise Dollars 30bn through domestic and

FT  22 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Hopes of recovery face test - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The focus of attention on the London stock market will swing back towards
the corporate front this week as the pre-Budget equity account draws to a
close and US markets close down for Thanksgiving Day.
Company results have yet to produce the signs of business recovery the stock
market has been seeking throughout this year. But this week could prove a
turning point.
The City's - and Downing Street's - hopes for a consumer-led economic
recovery will be put to the test when Allied-Lyons, Northern Foods, Kwik
Save and Tate &amp; Lyle deliver their latest trading figures.
Overhanging the brewery and food sectors is the threat of changes in VAT or
excise duties in the Budget which Mr Kenneth Clarke will deliver only days
after the companies report profits, and just before the Christmas selling
season.
Northern Foods, high quality, domestically-orientated and an important
supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer and other high street leaders, has paid the
penalty for these characteristics by underperforming the stock market in the
past 12 months. Any good news from Northern Foods will be welcome but the
market is not enthusiastic, aiming for a rise of under 7 per cent to around
Pounds 73m pre-tax.
From Allied-Lyons, a dull statement seems to be the best hope. The group is
perceived as facing a tough business environment, retail margin pressures
and nervousness over Mr Clarke's intentions for drink taxes.
But a straw in the wind may have been Whitbread's revelation last week that
pub food was the prime boost to its profits expansion. The market's response
to Allied-Lyons' statement will set the pace for Grand Metropolitan,
Guinness and the other leaders of the sector.
Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sugar company and a big player in the US,
will offer valuable evidence on the progress of economic recovery across the
Atlantic. UK investors might be behind the times here, since the shares were
badly hit by a fairly cautious trading statement from the board last
September. Market expectations of full-year profits are tightly bunched
around Pounds 220m.
Analysts are looking for Pounds 125m - Pounds 128m from Kwik Save, the
discount supermarket group. The shares have underperformed even the badly
mauled food retailing sector recently, caught between price cutting
initiatives of the leading chains and the exposure given to the new
discounting groups. Analysts will be focusing on the growth in like-for-like
sales and margins.
PROSPECTIVE P/E RATIO
The latest prospective p/e ratio for the '500' index for calendar 1993 is
16.0 according to IBES, the consensus estimates service (last week: 16.1).
This compares with an IBES estimated p/e for the '500' of 20.6 (20.7) for
calendar 1992. The official FT calculation of the historic p/e, based on the
latest reported earnings, is 19.87 (19.79).

FT  22 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Bank shares may suffer further fall - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although this will be a holiday-shortened week (the markets are shut on
Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close at 1pm on Friday), investors and
traders should have plenty to chew on over the next few days.
October durable goods data, due out on Wednesday, are expected to provide
further evidence that economic activity is picking up. But the stock markets
may not find much cheer in the numbers if, as in the past few weeks, the
news unsettles inflation-sensitive bond investors and pushes long-term
interest rates higher.
The steady rise in rates has put the brake on the long rally in bank stocks.
One of the reasons the Federal Reserve cut interest rates between 1990 and
1992 was to bail out the ailing banking industry by providing banks with
huge interest margins.
The rate cuts had the desired effect, but now, with rates rising, banks will
have to wean themselves off their fat margins. Their earnings performance,
which has been impressive recently, will undoubtedly suffer as a result.
Bank stocks, which stumbled last week, could fall further before the week is
over.
There is little corporate news due out, although the takeover battle for
Paramount Communications will enter a new phase with the offers of rival
bidders Viacom and QVC Network both due to expire this week.
Investors will also be keeping an eye on airline stocks in the light of the
flight attendants strike at American Airlines, which unions plan to extend
into the busy Thanksgiving weekend - traditionally, the busiest travel
period in the year.
Stocks traded on the Nasdaq market are looking vulnerable at the moment.
Nasdaq lists a lot of smaller-capitalised, growth-oriented companies, many
in the technology, communications and healthcare sectors.
Their shares performed well when the economy was seen to be struggling,
because investors liked their potential for earnings growth, but in recent
months they have lagged the broader market.
Last week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index held their own near record highs, the Nasdaq composite fell 3.56
per cent, and its performance over the year now lags behind the main
indices.
With economic growth picking up pace, the tide of investment sentiment may
be moving decisively against small-cap stocks in favour of the giants of the
Dow and S&amp;P. Finally, the market for initial public offerings is worth
watching. Over the past fortnight the IPO market has seen a couple of big
successes - most notably, the flotations of the restaurant chain Boston
Chicken and the clothing retailer Talbots.
Both benefited from hype and heavy speculative buying, leading some
observers to warn that the IPO market (and with it the secondary market) may
be in danger of overheating.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Emerging Markets: Possible renewed pressure on D-Mark -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After weakening early last week on a larger-than-expected drop in the German
repo rate, the D-Mark won a reprieve late in the week on Bundesbank signals
that it will not accelerate the pace of monetary easing, writes Conner
Middelmann. However, this week's German inflation and money- supply data
could exert renewed pressure on the D-Mark by fuelling more talk of
near-term rate cuts.
'As the Bundesbank continues easing short-term rates, we expect the US
dollar and most European currencies to firm against the D-Mark,' said Mr
Thorsten Neufeld, economist at DB Research, Deutsche Bank's research
subsidiary in Frankfurt.
Germany's two-week repo rate fell by nine basis points to 6.29 per cent last
Tuesday, prompting talk that the Bundesbank was shifting into a more
aggressive easing gear to revive the flagging economy. Two days later the
Bundesbank announced a fixed-rate repo at 6.25 per cent, indicating that
while it continues to loosen its monetary reins, it will only do so very
gradually.
However, October M3 money supply - expected to come in around the top of the
Bundesbank's 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range - and November
inflation, expected to have slowed to about 3.7 per cent year-on-year from
3.9 per cent in October, may revive easing speculation.
Amid the accelerating recovery in the US economy and OECD calls for
increases in the rate there, this means the D-Mark is set to weaken further
against the US dollar. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, expects
the dollar to reach DM1.75 by year-end and to climb to around DM1.85 on a
six-month view.
The D-Mark also looks set to weaken against some of the core currencies in
Europe's exchange rate mechanism. 'Some of these currencies - notably the
French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone - are headed back towards
their old ERM trading bands' against the D-Mark, said Mr Neufeld.
Despite last week's aggressive rate cuts, the Belgian franc briefly breached
the BFr21.0950 floor of its former 2 1/4 per cent trading band against the
D-Mark.
France is one of the few European countries not to have cut short-term rates
last week and is expected to continue tracking the Bundesbank's cautious
easing course, although many are calling for a cut in its 6.45 per cent
intervention rate on the back of the currency's strength. The franc closed
at FFr3.4690 on Friday.

TOKYO
Technical selling is feared in equities after the downward break through
18,000 in the Nikkei-225 on Friday. Dealer support is expected to be limited
by the Labour Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow, and ahead of interim earnings
from the banking sector on Thursday and Friday.
FRANKFURT
Autumn press conferences approach a nervous market from BASF on Monday, and
Bayer on Thursday. Twelve days ago the third of the 'Big Three' German
chemical companies, Hoechst, saw profits down 40 per cent after nine months
and a worse performance in the September quarter. Wednesday and Thursday
bring conferences at Metallgesellschaft and Commerzbank, with hopes of a
dividend rise at the latter.
PARIS
After rising French consumer expenditure in September, and in the third
quarter of 1993, James Capel expects a decline of 0.3 per cent in October as
an increase in social security contributions depresses disposable income.
ZURICH
November CPI figures for Basle and Geneva are due this week. Smith New Court
expect falling Swiss rents will help to depress the indices to around 2.5
per cent from the 3.4 per cent recorded in October, providing further
evidence of the improvement in the domestic economy.
A raft of press conferences include ABB and Merck on Tuesday; Nestle is
expected to give sales forecasts, and Alussuise nine-month sales figures, at
their autumn news conferences on Wednesday.
STOCKHOLM
Nine-month results from the ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Swedish/Swiss engineering
combine are expected in Sweden and in Switzerland.
Analysts expect ABB to report a slightly lower profit for the period, while
forecasts for the full year remain reasonably positive, particularly in
light of the economic situation prevailing in Europe.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Risk and Reward: Charging the right price for futures fund
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors buy futures funds because they promise high returns. On the basis
of those returns, futures fund managers charge fees which dwarf charges in
most other areas of the fund management industry.
But are these fees really justified? A growing number of observers, and even
some managers within the industry, think not. Certainly, the high level of
fees has had a negative impact on the growth of the futures fund industry,
by discouraging institutions from investing in such funds. Most investors
are high net worth individuals, who may not look too closely at fees so long
as returns are attractive. However, when their fund's performance is
disappointing, fees frequently become an issue.
Standard fees for futures funds are 2 to 4 per cent for management, with
performance fees of 15 to 25 per cent. The performance fees are charged on
any profits, so even a return which only equals Treasury bill rates is
stripped of this fee.
'There are very few futures fund managers who consistently produce excellent
returns for investors,' said Ms Nicola Meaden of Tass Management, which
tracks futures funds' performance. '(Those who do) have a strong case for
justifying those levels, but for the industry as a whole I believe the fees
are too high.'
The timing of performance fees also causes some frustration. Some managers
take fees every month, while others wait until the end of the year. The
former, though, can earn performance fees even if their fund ends down on
the year.
Most futures funds are multi-manager funds - that is, an overall manager
divides assets between a group of futures fund managers, known in the jargon
as CTAs or commodity trading advisers. If there are six trading advisers and
two make a profit, performance fees have to be paid to them even though the
fund is down overall. However, some futures fund managers do not pass this
charge on to investors.
So are there any signs of change? Fees have come down slightly in the past
few years, and there is increasing pressure from the hedge fund market,
where management fees are about 1 - 2 per cent. Hedge funds have performed
well this year and are proving more successful in attracting institutional
investors.
Futures funds have also had a good year. According To Tass, the average
return for the year to the end of October was 15.37 per cent. But there is a
large range in performance, with some funds down as much as 50 per cent and
others up as much as 100 per cent.
'We only deserve to get paid if we perform,' said Mr Robin Edwards, a
managing director of Sabre Fund Management, whose funds are up some 20 per
cent in the year to end-September. 'There are people who don't perform. They
don't last in the business.'
He also points out that unit trusts in the UK charge relatively high fees
(around 5 per cent up front, with a 1 - 1 1/2 per cent annual management
charge) often for doing no more than tracking an index.
If futures fund managers are serious about wanting to attract more
institutional money, they will need to address the issue of fees.
'I don't see why anyone should be paid a performance fee if their
performance is paltry,' says Mr David Moore, a director of Credit Lyonnais
Rouse, which appoints external manage for its funds. 'It would make sense if
there were a threshold - such as the T-bill rate - below which there would
be no performance fee.'
Given that investors are taking a far greater risk by investing in futures
funds than by putting their money in US Treasury bills, this only seems
fair.

FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Bank may bow to Gemms on repos - Capital
&amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One by one, the various gilt-edged market makers (or Gemms) have been called
in to see the Bank of England in recent weeks and invited to give their
views on whether the UK should have a fully-fledged bond lending or
repurchase (repo) system.
Two years ago, such an approach by the Bank would have seemed inconceivable.
It was widely felt by the securities houses, especially those with active
repo desks in other government bonds, that the Bank had a strong aversion to
an open repo market.
Yet in the space of two years, the pressure has built up for an open repo
market and the Bank's willingness to listen to Gemms' views on the pros and
cons of such a system suggests it is genuinely open-minded on this matter.
Those who have told the Bank their views believe that an open repo market is
inevitable: it is simply a question of time and the determination to
overcome certain obstacles, such as the regulation of a repo market and
implications for the taxation of dividends.
Gemms have enjoyed a privileged position for several years. Because of their
requirement to make two-way prices under all market conditions, they need to
be able to borrow gilt-edged stock to complete their sales. This they do
through Stock Exchange Money Brokers, specialist intermediaries who borrow
the gilts from approved lenders, such as large institutions.
Increasingly, market participants have argued that the Gemms' privilege
should be extended to others: through repos, holders of gilts would be able
to sell them for cash for an agreed period of time, at the end of which they
would buy them back at an agreed price.
Such arrangements exist for US, French and German government bonds, and
there are many investors and securities houses who would like to see a
similar arrangement for UK government debt.
Those in favour of an open gilt repo market claim there would be several
advantages. Even with the existing arrangements, Gemms do sometimes face a
shortage of certain kinds of stock. 'Sometimes you want to borrow stock as a
Gemm so you can go short, and it's hard to get anything other than benchmark
issues,' complains a dealer at one leading UK house, adding that an open
repo system would improve gilt market liquidity.
With an open repo system, overseas investors - who are significant holders
of UK government bonds - would be encouraged to lend out their stock to
enhance the return on their portfolios.
The pro-repo camp argue that an open repo system would entice a broader
range of investors into the market.
For example, an investor who wants to buy gilts could finance his gilt
purchases more cheaply by using the bonds as collateral and borrowing
against them.
One Gemm calculates that an investor might be able to reduce his borrowing
cost quite considerably: he might, for example, pay 50 basis points over
Libor to finance his position unsecured, but could reduce it to 10 - 15
basis points over Libor on a secured basis.
Those who are in favour of having a repo market argue that the inability to
'repo-out' stock has deterred many investors, particularly those in the US
who are accustomed to the freedom to 'repo-out' their US treasury bond
holdings.
If these investors could be wooed into the gilt market by the presence of a
repo facility, they argue, it would encourage more investors to participate
in the market, which in turn would mean lower borrowing costs for the
government.
Not everyone agrees on this point. It is not entirely clear which investors
have steered clear of gilts for this reason, given that the gilt market has
shown a considerable rally over the last two years and produced bumper
returns for investors.
While the Bank recognises the advantages of creating a deeper and more
liquid market through an open repo system, there are obstacles which would
need to be overcome.
Even its most ardent proponents will admit in private that repos have a
chequered past and have acquired a rather 'spivvy' reputation, thanks to
several scandals, such as the Drysdale case in the US in the early 1980s.
Clearly, the Bank would want to be satisfied that the market was not open to
abuse or disruptive behaviour. This raises the question of how best to
regulate the market (whether through legislation or a code of conduct), and
how to ensure that stock is not lent out several times over (in the latter
case, the solution would be to simply place stock with an agreed third
party).
'The regulatory and tax problems are not insurmountable: it's more a
question of whether the Bank really wants to relinquish its hold over the
secondary market in gilts,' claims one gilts specialist.

The Bundesbank policy-making council meets only twice more this year, on
December 2 and December 16. With long bund yields close to a historical low,
at 5.85 per cent on Friday, the market is clearly anticipating further
decisive rate cuts at one or other of these meetings.
The failure to deliver more than a fractional reduction in the securities
repurchase rate after last Thursday's council meeting did nothing to
unsettle the optimism. Money supply date published today and inflation
figures for four states later this week will be closely scrutinised to see
whether the optimism is justified.
The market expects growth in October M3 of 6.3 to 6.7 per cent on an
annualised, seasonally adjusted basis, compared with the Bundesbank's target
of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for the year. Inflation data from Baden-Wurttemberg,
North-Rhine Westphalia, Hesse and Bavaria are also likely to be positive.
Two factors weigh against the optimism. First is the Bundesbank's love of
surprise: everybody is taking a rate cut for granted, so it is likely to
want to disappoint them. Second is the influence of the US bond market:
investors are becoming wary of the possibility of US interest rate rises.
This has unsettled US bond prices and could spill over into the bund market.

FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Germany considers long-dated sector -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Austria's successful DM2bn offering of 30-year Eurobonds
last week, which prompted a flood of long-dated issuance by six German
states, has raised the possibility that the German government could follow
suit.
There is clearly strong demand for long-dated D-Mark bonds, especially
outside Germany. International interest was such that Austria's issue was
increased on Friday by DM500m from DM1.5bn.
Excluding Austria's offering, just over DM3bn worth of bonds with maturities
of more than 10 years emerged last week, through a combination of 30-year
bonds and 20-year bonds puttable after 10 years.
The sudden rush of long-dated paper and a perception that some issues were
too tightly priced has resulted in this new market reaching saturation point
sooner than many syndicate managers had hoped.
However, they are confident the overhang of paper will be absorbed fairly
quickly, which will enable other highly-rated borrowers to raise long-term
financing at the current low interest rates.
Deutsche Bundespost, Germany's post office which set up a DM2bn medium-term
note programme last week, is expected to raise DM500m via a 30-year bond
issue this week.
The bonds are likely to be priced to yield around 70 basis points over
10-year German government bonds (bunds). The pricing of 30-year D-Mark bonds
is more an art than a science due to the lack of benchmarks beyond 10 years.
The yield spread on Austria's bonds was calculated by using the yield
differential between 10-year and 30-year Dutch and French government bonds,
a mechanism devised by JP Morgan when it arranged a DM1.5bn offering of
15-year Eurobonds for LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance in August, the first
offering with this maturity in the D-Mark sector.
So long as there is no 30-year bund, Austria's offering will be seen as the
benchmark against which future issues will be priced.
Syndicate managers hope it will not be long before the German government
does so, since this would provide the liquidity and credibility which most
investors require.
The German government does have experience in this area. In 1986, Germany's
low inflation rate prompted the government to issue two DM1bn offerings of
30-year bonds.
They became illiquid as a change in market conditions dissuaded the
government from issuing more long-dated paper and concentrate instead on
issuing 10-year bunds.
The German finance ministry has declined to comment on whether the
government will resume its issuance of bunds with maturities of more than 10
years.
The government is thought to be seriously considering the option but is put
off by two main factors: uncertainty about how well the market could absorb
large issues of 30-year bunds (a bund issue totals around DM10bn these days)
and the lack of a relevant futures contract.
Nevertheless, the desire to conform could well encourage the German
government to overlook these problems.
Italy has become the latest European sovereign borrower to issue 30-year
debt and Spain will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the domestic
market in December.

Activity in the UK government bond market is likely to be subdued this week
as investors wait to see whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut
interest rates at or around the time of the Budget on November 30.
The market is fired-up for a base rate cut following last week's encouraging
economic data, in particular the small rise in inflation.
This has provided Mr Clarke with a good excuse for easing monetary policy,
should he need to sweeten the tax increases which are widely expected to be
announced in the Budget.
A good M3 figure in Germany today, and cost of living later this week, may
tilt expectations even more firmly behind a UK base rate cut, as markets
gear up for a drop in Germany's lending rates.
There are few economic data to influence opinion in the UK this week,
although on Friday the CBI produces its monthly survey of manufacturing
trends.
Last week, the drop in retail price inflation from 1.8 per cent in September
to 1.4 per cent in October pushed gilts up about a point.
Since then the market has drifted down by about 5 basis points, but it is
likely to remain well supported this week, against a background of low
inflation and the strong expectations for a further easing of base rates.

Already reeling because of a string of recent encouraging economic
statistics, US bond prices are likely to come under renewed pressure this
week from more economic data and an influx of new supply.
The only good news for fixed-income investors is the Thanksgiving holiday,
which will shut the market on Thursday and close it early on Friday, at 1pm.
They may also be cheered by Monday's release of the latest Federal budget
deficit figure, which is expected to show a slight shrinkage in the deficit.
Otherwise, the only notable data due is the October durable goods orders
report on Wednesday. After September's slight 0.7 per cent rise in durable
goods orders, Wall Street is looking for a bigger increase.
With sentiment so gloomy, traders are not looking forward to this week's
Treasury auctions, which will add supply to the market at a time when prices
are vulnerable. Today, the Treasury will sell Dollars 17bn in two-year notes
(the largest such issue in history), and on Wednesday it will sell Dollars
11bn in five-year notes.
If Friday's fall in prices is carried through into the early part of this
week, institutional investors could fear further declines and stay away from
the auctions, pushing yields even higher. Thursday's holiday may not come a
moment too soon for the bond market.

The Japanese government bond market is likely to move in a narrow range this
week, with investors focusing on evidence of further economic weakening and
the size of a prospective income tax cut.
Investors have become wary of the recent fall in the yield on the No 145
10-year benchmark, to below the 3.5 per cent level. An increasing number
last week tried to avert the risk of profit-taking by buying put options, or
contracts giving the holder the 'right to sell'.
However, increasing pessimism over an economic recovery is likely to support
lower interest rates.
One concern for bond investors is the size of the income tax cut, which Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, pledged over the weekend. The tax
advisory committee to the government last week proposed an income tax cut
funded by an increase in consumption taxes. But the government is likely to
implement an early tax cut to boost the faltering economy, financed by
government bonds, until consumption tax is increased.
Traders believe a tax cut of Y5,000bn to Y6,000bn one year ahead of any
consumption tax hike will be unlikely to affect supply and demand but a cut
over Y10,000bn, two to three years ahead of a consumption tax increase will
be bad news for the bond market.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Markets: World's eyes on US interest rates - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN

<TEXT>
Thanksgiving week in the US promises to add fresh uncertainty to the
question preoccupying the world's financial markets: what is the outlook for
US long-term interest rates?
The New York markets will start winding down from Wednesday lunchtime in
preparation for Thursday's holiday; many people will stay at home on Friday,
too. So the active trading week will only be two days - yet into it, the
government plans to cram two bond auctions, for two-year notes and five-year
notes.
That means that anyone buying these issues may well be stuck with them until
next week - potentially a worry in a market that demonstrated its volatility
yet again on Friday.
Despite this, the auctions will probably go well; they usually do. The
broader issue remains. Has the US bond market moved - as Mr Robert Brusca,
of Nikko Securities in New York puts it - from a bear phase of a bull market
into a true bear market?
That matters to investors regardless of where they live. A sustained move
upwards in long-term US rates would indicate that bond investors fear the
return of inflation, suggesting that in the not-too-distant future the
Federal Reserve would get the message, too.
The realisation that both short and long-term interest rates were decisively
headed upwards in the US would dawn, unpleasantly, around the world. In the
US equity markets, shares would be damaged by appearing less attractive than
bonds or cash.
Overseas, equity and fixed-income markets would lose the psychological prop
of a worldwide outlook of falling interest rates and low inflation. Though
the economic climate would still indicate lower interest rates to come in
Europe, investors would glance nervously at the US.
Flows of US retail investors' cash - out of deposit accounts and money
funds, into equities at home and abroad - would dry up, as Americans
rediscovered the joys of interest. An end to the flows, perhaps their
reversal, would be bad news for shares worldwide.
Much hangs, therefore, on the outlook for the US bond market. After Friday's
further slide in the market, the next few days could be tense. In
Thanksgiving week, no-one wants to be the turkey.
Those expressing their gratitude on Thursday will include the heads of big
American companies, for whom the fourth quarter is looking happy. One of the
biggest and best diversified US corporations recently held a meeting for its
divisional bosses. Without exception, said someone present, they reeled off
tales of double-digit revenue growth in September. Fourth-quarter results
will reflect this underlying business strength. A shaky bond market may hurt
the valuation of the stock market; but it will do little in the short run to
damage the improvement in earnings.
Rapid, self-sustaining growth in Asia/Pacific's industrialising economies is
one of the investing community's new articles of faith. The television
pictures of President Clinton at the Apec economic summit merely confirm the
worldwide enthusiasm for equities anywhere in Asia - except Japan.
There's no doubt that this region will be the manufacturing heartland of the
world in the coming century. There's also no doubt that the addition of a
billion people to the global market economy will have profoundly beneficial
results.
Don't expect the process to be a smooth one, though. In some respects, the
global economy in the early 21st century will look a lot like it did in the
late 19th century: bumpy. A large, rapidly growing, aggressively
export-oriented region will make the world grow faster, true - but it will
also provide a lot more shocks.
Look at the description last week, from Courtaulds, the UK chemicals
company, of how the Chinese credit squeeze had hit revenues. 'Production of
acrylics and acetate tow that were previously going to China have been
diverted to Europe,' said Mr Sipko Huismans, Courtaulds' chief executive.
Prices in Europe had suffered; and the viscose market in the US would soon
be hurt, too.
China's trend growth will be rapid, but it is unlikely to be stable. Periods
of slower growth will leave markets awash with unsold product destined for
China; and above-trend growth will push up worldwide prices, once the global
economy recovers.
The growing Asian economies are still a relatively small part of world gnp.
But their rapid growth and vast populations will make them the world's
marginal consumer. And in economics, it's at the margins that things happen.
The flood of money into the developing markets of the Asia/Pacific regions
is only partly driven by economics, of course. It's also driven by one of
the great self-reinforcing phenomena of current investing: the concept of a
'normal' weighting. Global investors look at the world through the prism of
one of the worldwide equity indices, such as the FT-Actuaries World Index.
If a market starts to rise rapidly against the rest of the world, its
weighting in such indices will rise, because they are weighted by market
capitalisation. Global investors will discover themselves to be suddenly
underweight in that market. It wouldn't look good at year-end to be
underweight in a market that is performing strongly; perhaps it is time to
move back into line? Thus, a rally once begun is self-reinforcing, until
some event occurs to reverse its course. The smaller the market, the thinner
its trading and the further away it is, the more powerful this cycle.
Western fund managers look down on those who still place their faith in a
stock's 'momentum'. Retail investors and the nave markets of the
Asia/Pacific rim might use this technique, they say, but no-one with the
merest smattering of modern portfolio theory takes it seriously. Yet they
have institutionalised such a concept in the name of prudence. Most recently
it has led them, with splendid irony, to pour money into the pockets of
Pacific rim investors. Did somebody say nave?
The new weekly table alongside caters to the increasing interest in the
'total return' of asset classes round the world. Total return captures both
the capital appreciation of a security and its income stream (dividends or
interest). It thus allows you to compare the return in holding your money in
the money market, with that available in bonds of different maturities or
equities. The table shows the total return in local currency terms on four
asset classes in five countries over the past week, the past month and the
year to date.
The growing interest in total returns is partly a result of the worldwide
trend towards convergence of tax rates on income and capital gains.
Investors are increasingly indifferent as to whether they get their profit
from a stock's appreciation or its income stream, and want a measure which
captures both.
Total returns are also in fashion because cheap computing power has made
them easier to calculate. Not that easy, though: a great deal of expertise
is required, for which we are grateful to Mr Chris Golden of Lehman Brothers
in London, for the cash and bond figures, and Mr Symon Bradford of NatWest
Markets in Edinburgh, for the data on equities.
Two events in Belgium next week - a series of demonstrations against
government austerity planned by labour unions and the meeting of the
European Commission to review its draft white paper on employment and
competitiveness - underline a worldwide trend pointed out recently by Mr
David Roche of Morgan Stanley.
People are tiring of corporate restructuring and retrenchment, as witness
the Canadian election, the Air France protests, recent labour unrest in
Italy and Germany, and the anti-Nafta campaign in the US.
One way in which this unhappiness could manifest itself is a general swing
back towards protectionism, subsidies, and government interference,
potentially damaging for corporate earnings. The phrasing of the white paper
will be one indicator of the way the debate is going; so will progress in
the Gatt talks. The way politicians discuss this issue will indicate how
seriously they take the new public mood.
