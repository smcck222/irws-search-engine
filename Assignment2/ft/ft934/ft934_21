FT  22 NOV 93 / The Markets: China's gradualist strategy not a Russian
option - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Therapy without shock' is a tempting slogan for Russian politicians, as
they stake out their positions in the run-up to next month's elections. With
inflation running above 1,000 per cent a year, and industrial output
expected to fall a further 10 per cent this year, the need for therapy is
obvious. But 'shock therapy'? The Russian people may well figure that they
have had more than their fair share of shocks already.
In fact, the party of shock therapy is currently firmly in the lead in the
polls. The liberal Russia's Choice party, led by Yegor Gaidar and backed by
the president, wants to cut subsidies to state enterprises in order to
control inflation and encourage the private sector.
But for supporters of groups such as the Civic Union for Stability, Fairness
and Progress - backed by Russia's industrial lobby - a more gradual approach
to subsidy cuts has an obvious appeal.
'Gradualism' also has an impressive pedigree. China, which began its
transition from central planning back in 1978, has avoided shocks like the
plague, while eschewing rapid cuts in subsidies to inefficient state
enterprises or mass privatisation.
Instead, the Chinese leadership has concentrated reform first on agriculture
and rural enterprise, while cautiously experimenting with liber-alisation in
selected pro-vinces.
And this 'gradualist' strategy has worked. The Chinese economy has grown by
a dramatic 8 per cent plus since 1978, doubling its share of world trade.
Compared with Russia, it remains a poor country. Russia's average income per
head in 1991 was Dollars 3,220 compared with a mere Dollars 370 in China.
But the contrast between the drab streets and decaying industry of Moscow,
St Petersburg or Volgograd, and the dynamism of the shining industrial
development zones that surround Tianjin, Shanghai or Guangzhou, suggests
that these simple dollar income comparisons tell only a small part of a much
larger development story.
How tempting, then, to see China as a role model for Russian reform: a
relatively pain-less way to make the transition from plan to market,
encouraging the non-state sector and foreign investment but with-out
requiring immediate cuts in state output and employment.
Sadly, the analogy does not work, as Harvard professor and Russian adviser
Jeffrey Sachs argues in a forthcoming Economic Policy paper, written with
Wing Thye Woo.
The reason is that Russia and China started the transition to a market
economy at very different stages of economic development. In China in 1978,
the bulk of the population worked in collectivised, but unsubsidised
agriculture - state enterprises employed less than 20 per cent of the
population.
Liberalisation of agriculture, and the consequent rapid (not gradual) rise
in productivity, meant substantial gains to the rural population and allowed
surplus peasant workers to move to the rural industrial sector.
The potential losers from cuts in subsidies to unviable state enterprises
are a dwindling minority, while the willingness of the population to
increase its holding of money balances has allowed the government to pay
monetary credits to industry without fuelling inflation.
China has not escaped inflationary problems. But its inflation has resulted
not from the need to subsidise the old, but because the growth of new
enterprise has run ahead of the ability of physical infrastructure and
economic institutions to support it. It is the World Bank, not the
International Mone-tary Fund, which is advising China on the structural
reforms.
For Russia, this Chinese 'gradualism' is not an option. Russia's highly
centralised planning means that state enterprises are much larger than in
China, while in-dustry is more regionally concentrated, making closure of
non-viable plants more difficult.
But Russia is also over-industrialised - only 6 per cent of the population
works in agriculture, compared with 93 per cent in state enterprises. The
constituency which stands to lose, in the short-term, from cuts in subsidies
is therefore much greater.
Meanwhile, as confidence in the currency has dwindled, the government's
resort to the printing press has meant accelerating inflation.
This Russian inflation is not a product of overly rapid development but of
the government's need to continue to subsidise the past at the expense of
progress. Until these industrial subsidies are cut, the bias against the
non-state sector and very high inflation will continue to impede growth of
the non-state sectors.
Indeed, a gradual approach to cutting state subsidies risks being the worst
of both worlds - it hurts the state employees, while providing little
incentive for state employees to move into the service or private sectors.
Hence, the importance the IMF attaches to linking aid to cuts in
inflationary industrial credits.
Of course, Russia's transition to democracy makes the short-term task of
cutting subsidies even harder, a problem that China has never had to face -
which explains why the IMF has been criticised, both by Russia's reformers
and western economists, for being much too cautious in offering this
financial support, most recently by Mr Sachs in today's FT Letter's column.
But, in the debate between advocates of 'gradualism' and rapid disinflation,
Mr Sachs and the IMF are on the same side.

halfway mark

<TEXT>
Yamaha, the world's largest producer of musical instruments, hit a
discordant note, with first-half profits nearly a quarter down.
Pre-tax profits declined by 24.2 per cent to Y2.93bn (Dollars 27.4m) in the
six months to September, a reflection of a saturated domestic market for
pianos, sluggish consumer spending and the reduction in the yen value of
export earnings caused by the Japanese currency's rise in value.
Yamaha posted a 58.7 per cent fall in profits for the year to last March
which prompted a boardroom coup, after union demands that management accept
responsibility.
But the group's fortunes appear to have taken a dive since the end of the
first half. It is making losses in the current half, on the basis of
Yamaha's forecast of a taxable profit of Y1bn for the full year to next
March, nearly a third of the Y2.8bn made last year, on sales of Y320bn.
First-half sales this year fell 4.8 per cent to Y172.14bn.
Yamaha announced an unchanged interim dividend of Y3 a share, more than
twice covered by per-share earnings of Y6.31, down from Y8.89 a share in the
same period of last year.

David Jones, the upmarket Australian department store business owned by the
troubled Adelaide Steamship group, could be refloated or sold, according to
its parent.
Adsteam also told shareholders at its annual meeting the price for the
retail interests 'must reflect the real and potential value of such a
flagship business', and gave no hints on the timing for such a move.
There has been speculation that there might be a sale in 1994-95, and that a
float of the department stores could raise around ADollars 500m (USDollars
326.7m). Adsteam has already disposed of its other major retail interest, in
Woolworths, via a multi-billion dollar flotation.
Meanwhile, Adsteam is selling the core business of its Metro Meat unit to
CITIC Australia for an undisclosed amount. The deal, subject to Foreign
Investment Review Board approval, should close in early-1994, and be close
to book value. CITIC is the Australian investment vehicle for
Beijing-controlled China international Trust and Investment Corp.

George Weston, the Weston family holding company controlling Loblaw,
Canada's biggest grocer operation, as well as pulp and paper interests,
posted third-quarter net profit of CDollars 21.2m or 45 cents a share, up
almost 50 per cent from CDollars 14.2m or 27 cents a year earlier. Sales
rose 5 per cent to CDollars 3.55bn.
The profit comparison was distorted by a CDollars 12m special charge in the
1992 period.
Loblaw and Weston Foods, a large processing unit, contributed higher sales
and earnings.
Revenues at the Weston Resources' businesses were up 25 per cent to CDollars
295m, due to an acquisition and strong timber markets, but profit dipped to
CDollars 3.9m from CDollars 7.6m because of sharply lower results from the
fisheries unit.
Weston's overall nine-month profit was CDollars 50.6m or CDollars 1.08 a
share, up from CDollars 24.1m or 39 cents, on revenues of CDollars 9.06bn,
against CDollars 8.57bn.
Nova Corp is selling its fully-owned Novalta Resources natural gas
production unit to Seagull Energy, of Houston, for CDollars 275m cash. It
will book a CDollars 120m gain on the sale.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz predicts
break-even for year

<TEXT>
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German diesel engine and industrial plant
manufacturer, expects to break even in 1993 despite poor results in the
first half of the year.
The company said that for the full year, turnover would fall by 10 per cent
to DM3.3bn (Dollars 1.95bn). In 1992 its turnover was DM3.7bn and it then
broke even on a pre-tax basis.
Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive, said the company would again
break even this year because of its cost-savings programme and a pick-up in
business at its industrial plants divisions.
KHD said it had saved 'hundreds of millions of D-Marks' by reducing its
workforce and raising productivity. The company said it would continue to
slim down by laying off 800 employees by the end of 1993 from its current
workforce of 11,000. In 1992, the company reduced its payroll by over 2,000
employees. KDH also said it had significantly reduced material costs.
It added that while the motors and agricultural machine-tools divisions were
suffering from the general slowdown in domestic and international markets,
business was picking up in the industrial plants side.
Turnover in that division is expected to reach over DM1.8bn for the year,
over a third of KHD's total sales. It said this would greatly improve the
overall turnover, which dropped by 21 per cent in the first six months of
the year.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hits two Japanese
audio makers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's audio makers were battered by a sluggish consumer spending and the
sharp rise of the yen in the first half of 1993.
Pioneer, the specialist audio and laser disc maker, suffered an operating
loss of Y1.25bn, although foreign exchange gains helped it to report a
pre-tax profit of Y3.35bn.
Meanwhile, Kenwood, the specialised audio maker, reported a pre-tax loss of
Y2.46bn, hit by the rise of the yen and downturn in consumer spending. The
company is passing its interim dividend.
Pioneer saw sales drop 16 per cent to Y173.4bn, compared with Y205.5bn
previously, in the face of slow consumer spending in Japan and a decline in
demand for its commercial use laser disc karaoke systems.
Sales of audio products in North America and Europe and of car audio product
in Europe were particularly depressed, the company said.
However Pioneer's gains from currency hedging helped it to avoid a pre-tax
loss.
Kenwood saw falling demand in its audio and telecommunications business,
which was particularly hard hit in Japan with a drop of 23 per cent.
Overall sales totalled Y96.4bn, down 10 per cent from the Y107.2bn made
previously.
Pioneer is forecasting a 9 per cent decline in full-year sales to Y349bn and
a 58 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y7bn. Kenwood expects full-year
sales to fall to Y204bn from Y210.6bn and pre-tax profits to be Y1bn, down
from Y4.0bn.
Buoyant demand for mobile phones helped Kyocera, the maker of semiconductor
components and electronic parts, report a 1.9 per cent rise in sales in the
first half,
Strong demand for electronic equipment from cellular phone companies helped
that division push sales up 20 per cent.
In contrast, demand for fine ceramics, semiconductor devices and precision
instruments fell in the face of the economic slump.
Overall sales came to Y150.4bn but pre-tax profits were down 6 per cent to
Y17.4bn from Y18.4bn due to a decline in non-operating income. Operating
profits were up 6 per cent to Y11.4bn from Y10.7bn.
Kyocera forecast full-year sales of Y305bn, up 1.5 per cent from the
previous year, and pre-tax profits of Y35.4bn, down 7 per cent.

<TEXT>
Schindler, the world's second largest elevator group, is taking control of
its Asian sales and servicing businesses after renegotiating a series of
joint ventures with Jardine Pacific.
A new venture, Jardine-Schindler Holdings, owned equally by the two
partners, with Schindler having a call option to raise its holding to
majority status, will take over from January 1.
Since 1974, Jardine has had a 60 per cent stake in its ventures with
Schindler. Early last year, Schindler publicised its frustration with this
arrangement, which it felt was inhibiting its development in the world's
fastest growing markets.
'We cannot afford to invest a lot if we do not have a real joint venture
where we can manage our own business,' Mr Alfred Schindler, chairman, said
in an interview.
Mr Schindler said the group paid a cash sum to Jardine and expected to
exercise its option to take control of the new venture in two to five years.
As part of the new arrangements, the Jardine-Schindler venture loses its
exclusive rights to represent Schindler in China, where the Swiss group has
two joint ventures with local partners.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paramount poison pill decision
likely today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US court is expected to rule today on the legality of the 'poison pill'
provisions in the Dollars 9.7bn merger agreement between entertainment group
Paramount Communications and the television cable company Viacom.
QVC Network, a home shopping channel which has made a rival Dollars 10.6bn
bid for Paramount, has asked the Delaware Chancery Court to throw out the
provisions, which are designed to make it prohibitively expensive for QVC to
buy Paramount if the agreed merger with Viacom collapses.
The court can throw out the poison pill provisions if it rules that the
merger agreement between Paramount and Viacom is not a strategic alliance,
as the two com-panies contend, but a straightforward sale of Paramount to
Viacom.
QVC argues that if Paramount is up for sale, it should be sold to the
highest bidder.
In a separate move, QVC sent a letter over the weekend to the Paramount
board claiming it had obtained the financing for its Dollars 10.6bn offer,
and asking the board to begin negotiations.
The Paramount board had previously rejected QVC's higher offer on the
grounds that it was conditional upon QVC obtaining Dollars 3bn in bank
loans.
Wall Street analysts, however, believe that Viacom will triumph in the
battle for Paramount.
Late last week, Paramount's shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange as
investors anticipated that the Delaware court would reject QVC's call to
throw out the poison pill provisions in the Viacom-Paramount agreement.
Analysts believe QVC's only chance of success is to significantly raise its
own bid.
Lee Iacocca, former Chrysler chairman, sold another Dollars 31m worth of
Chrysler stock last month, according to documents filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley looks again at
China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley's decision last week to tone down its bullish stance towards
China has taken the shine off Hong Kong's dazzling stock market.
Hong Kong has been propelled to record highs this year by a huge inflow of
funds from international investors seeking an exposure to China's booming
economy.
Since China's stock exchanges are still at an early stage in their
development, Hong Kong's liquid stock market is widely regarded as a proxy
for China.
The Hang Seng index, the barometer of the Hong Kong stock market, reached a
record high of 9,733.34 on Monday last week but by Friday it stood 4.8 per
cent lower at 9,263.94, mainly in response to Morgan Stanley's shift in
strategy.
Morgan Stanley's decision to reduce its exposure to Hong Kong comes a little
over one month after Mr Barton Biggs, its emerging markets strategist,
returned from China, saying: 'After eight days in China I'm tuned in,
overfed and maximum bullish.'
In addition, Morgan Stanley actively promoted its positive stance towards
China last month when it arranged a series of international convertible bond
issues for Chinese companies.
Last week, Mr Biggs cut Hong Kong's weighting in his emerging markets model
portfolio from 16 per cent to 10 per cent. In a research document entitled
'Hong Kong: Pausing for Breath', Mr Biggs wrote: 'Momentum investing is
great stuff, but the craziness content in the magic of China is beginning to
look like a bubble and smell like a tulip.'
'To mix metaphors still further,' he continued, 'taking a third of our chips
off the table while the game is still wild and woolly seems sensible.'
Mr David Roche, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, said yesterday that Hong
Kong had lost some of its attraction following its recent run.
But although he had cut Hong Kong's weighting from 7.2 per cent to 5 per
cent in his global equity model portfolio, he was still left with a heavily
overweight position towards Hong Kong.
He noted that Hong Kong's new weighting in the global portfolio was 10 times
its benchmark weighting of 0.5 per cent based on gross domestic product, and
more than double its benchmark weighting of 2 per cent in the Morgan Stanley
Capital Index.
Mr Roche gave two further reasons: the likelihood of a mass repatriation of
US funds as the US economy picks up, and a danger that China's economy could
be badly damaged by a power struggle within China's leadership over economic
policy.
'I am less convinced about the low-growth theory in the US,' he said. In his
view, the US economy will be much stronger than the consensus economic
forecast and that this will create demand for capital in the US.
He noted that there had been been a huge outflow of funds from the US to
other markets, around Dollars 100bn on an annualised basis, because US
interest rates were low and the dollar was weak. 'But this trend will
reverse with a vengeance as the economy recovers and interest rates rise,'
Mr Roche said.
Turning to China, Mr Roche said the recent structural reform package was a
'policy fudge which is indicative of a power struggle'. In addition, signs
of back-tracking on China's austerity programme suggested that Beijing had
yielded to the coastal regions' desire for fast-paced economic growth.
Mr Roche said that as a result, there was an increased risk of a hard
landing for China's economy, that power in China would be decentralised, and
that wealth differentials would widen further.
'All these could lead to political instability,' Mr Roche said.
Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley believes in China's long-term potential.
'I still believe that China is the premier growth and investment story in
the world . . . and that some day China will experience the mother of all
bull markets,' Mr Biggs wrote.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Boardroom battle at Fife Indmar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A minority group of shareholders at Fife Indmar, the engineering and
distribution company, is leading a boardroom rebellion aimed at unseating Mr
Gavin Hepburn, the long-time chairman.
The shareholders, who claim some 10.5 per cent of the shares, have
requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to replace Mr Hepburn and
fellow director Mr Michael Munro with Mr Guido Crolla, a Scottish
businessman, and Mr David Chassels of BDO Binder Hamlyn.
The rebels are claiming that the current management had failed to 'make best
use of the acquisitions in the last few years', according to Mr Crolla, who
made Pounds 1.7m earlier this year when he sold his Citylink bus business to
National Express.
In the last decade, Fife has diversified from marine engineering into
distribution and catering.
The rebels include director Mr Charles McDonald, who holds about 8 per cent
of Fife. He joined the board in 1988 following Fife's acquisition of Jack
Scot, his North Sea hire firm. If successful, the rebels intend to appoint
Mr McDonald as chairman.
Mr Crolla, who would become managing director, said he had approached Fife
with proposals in June, but had been rejected.
A detailed statement would soon be sent to shareholders setting out his
proposals, which are likely to include asset disposals.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Direct Line chief sells bonus
for one-off Pounds 45m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wood, the chief executive of Direct Line, the rapidly growing
insurance company owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, is about to swap a
multi-million pound remuneration package for a one-off payment of about
Pounds 45m.
Full details will be disclosed later this week when Direct Line reports its
latest figures. The payment is expected to consist of cash and shares in
Royal Bank of Scotland. It is understood that Mr Wood will hold the shares
for at least five years.
The payment is understood to include remuneration of about Pounds 18m for
this year, reflecting the rapid growth of the motor insurer in the past 12
months.
Last year Mr Wood, who founded Direct Line in 1985, received a little more
than Pounds 6m from his bonus contract which links his annual pay to the
rate of asset growth of the insurance company.
The bonus accounted for Pounds 6,014,000 of his total emoluments of Pounds
6,121,290. The deal was originally agreed in 1988 when Mr Wood sold his 25
per cent stake.
The company was the UK's first telephone-based 'direct' insurer, selling
motor insurance policies by telephone and has grown rapidly, specialising in
the lower risk end of the market. Earlier this year it announced that it was
on course to becoming the country's biggest motor insurer.
Direct Line recently announced its intention to expand into the home
insurance market, where it is highly critical of the commission rates
charged by building societies, banks and other intermediaries. The group is
also test marketing plans to sell personal loans by telephone.
The company has nearly doubled the number of its motor-insurance customers
to 1.25m during the past year. It employs 1,900 people in Croydon, Glasgow,
Manchester and Birmingham.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Navan seeks to re-open Bulgarian
mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Navan Resources, a small Dublin-quoted company, is to raise IPounds 7m
(Pounds 6.6m) via a placing to cover the cost of a 40 per cent stake in the
Chelopech mine in Bulgaria which the company says produced 45,000 troy
ounces of gold and 8.8m lbs of copper annually during the 1980s.
Navan also claims that the Chelopech ore body contains 5.4m ounces of gold
and is one of the largest gold resources in Europe.
The mine was closed by the new democratic government in April 1991 because
of unacceptably high levels of arsenic in the copper concentrate (an
intermediate material) sold to the nearby smelter at Pirdop.
Navan says it has been able to earn a 25 per cent interest in the mine by
demonstrating to the Bulgarian authorities that these environmental problems
can be overcome.
A joint venture company, Bimac, with an authorised capital of 1bn Bulgarian
lev (about Pounds 24.8m) has been established to operate the mine and
associated facilities. But it will not inherit past liabilities of any kind.
Navan will inject about Pounds 2.6m) into Bimac and directly own 40 per
cent. It has the right to take its stake to 68 per cent. The Pounds 2.6m
will be used to bring the mine back into production in 1994.

FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Unscrambling a plate of tangled
spaghetti - Andrew Jack examines the highly unusual and complex insolvency
of Kwelm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the biggest and most complex insolvencies ever. Last week it
moved into a new phase, as creditors voted overwhelmingly for a scheme of
arrangement under English law for the Kwelm insurance companies.
At stake is the future of five insolvent insurance companies, themselves
part of a far wider web owned by London United Investments, which is in
administration. Other connected companies include Weavers, the insurance
agency now in liquidation.
'This is either the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end,' says
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one
of the joint provisional liquidators.
Creditors to the different companies may receive initial dividends in the
range of 3 per cent to 12 per cent by summer next year, and between 35 per
cent and 47 per cent ultimately. But the process of running down the company
is likely to take as long as 40 years, as many future claims continue to
emerge.
Kwelm is short for Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street and Mutual
Reinsurance, five insurance companies which were created or acquired by LUI
since the early 1970s. Most of the business they took on through Weavers was
'long-tail'. It was primarily North American insurance and reinsurance for
professional and medical indemnity, product liability and directors and
officers cover.
From the late 1980s, adverse claims rose to the point at which they ceased
underwriting new business, and then in 1990 instructed Weavers to stop
paying claims on their behalf. After lengthy negotiations with creditors,
the companies entered provisional liquidation in March 1992, except
Walbrook, which entered the procedure in August that year.
Collectively, the Kwelm companies have more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
in liabilities. Allowing for current actuarial estimates with a high degree
of statistical confidence, the final figure may be as high as Dollars 9.1bn.
Aside from the sheer size of the numbers in the accounts, work on Kwelm has
presented substantial difficulties. At its peak Coopers was using the
equivalent of up to 50 full-time staff.
So far, the firm's fees have exceeded Pounds 7.4m, and its total costs,
including legal fees, are Pounds 22m. Over the next three years it projects
administration costs of Dollars 89m (Pounds 60m). Mr Hughes argues that the
complexities justify the fees.
Another sensitivity is the potential conflicts of interest, which are rife
at Kwelm. Walbrook last summer became part of the Kwelm scheme partly
because of creditors' concerns that there would be clashes in objectives if
the LUI administrators remained in charge of managing Walbrook.
Coopers has hired actuaries and accountants from its own practice to provide
independent advice on the liabilities and the viability of the scheme. It is
also, like the other large accountancy firms, a creditor to the Kwelm
companies on professional indemnity.
Mr Hughes says: 'We have to be sensitive to issues where there might be a
conflict.' If he believes there is potential tension, he uses Mr Gareth
Hughes, an Ernst &amp; Young partner, as 'scheme conflicts administrator'.
One of the most time-consuming tasks has been reconstructing the records of
the insurance companies in usable form. Many are stored in London warehouses
on paper or microfilm. Even those on computer need modifying so each
individual policyholder can be identified, previously a detail which only
the broker needed.
So far, that has led to the identification of more than 35,000 creditors. It
will take many more months for the process to be complete. 'We have had to
unscramble accounting information that is, crudely put, like a plate of
spaghetti,' says Mr Hughes.
To help grapple with the logistics of the proposed scheme, Coopers brought
in one of its own project management consultants, Mr Jeff Morris. His
previous job had been to co-ordinate the relocation of 5,000 Coopers staff
as the number of London offices was cut from 13 to three.
He created six teams to work on the preparations behind the scheme,
including one to manage and invest Kwelm's considerable cash assets of more
than Dollars 700m, which it must retain to pay out future claims. The
presence of so much money makes Kwelm a highly unusual insolvency.
Another team was geared to explaining the scheme to the 10 different types
of creditor who had to approve it: those who were and those were not to
benefit from the government's Policyholders' Protection scheme, across each
of the five Kwelm companies.
Now Mr Morris is planning the gradual run-off stage of Kwelm, most of which
will be done by about 160 staff employed through Kwelm Management Services.
That requires considerable investment in new systems, in re-establishing a
relationship with the rest of the insurance market, and motivating staff.
A job with a business which plans to close rather than grow may seem an
unusual choice, but Mr Morris says: 'Job guarantees are very short-term
these days. KMS has a life of at least 20 years.'
'There is a big job going forwards,' says Mr Hughes. Financial
investigations are under way to trace assets, and litigation against both
auditors and agents alleged to have misappropriated assets continue. The
House of Lords still has to resolve exactly who will can benefit from the
Policyholders' Protection scheme.
It will also be some time before the effectiveness of schemes of arrangement
for insolvent insurance companies has been reliably tested.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): The power of the payout - Other
Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generator, is expected to announce half-year
profits of Pounds 105m-Pounds 110m on Wednesday, up from Pounds 95m. City
attention will focus on the dividend.
Following a change in cover policy, analysts expect the payout to rise by at
least 15 per cent annually over the next few years. But with the industry
regulator considering whether to refer PowerGen and National Power to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, there is pressure to be conservative.
                         *      *      *
Northern Foods: Interim results, due on Tuesday, are expected to have a
downbeat tone, although pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds
68.4m to around Pounds 73m. The company has encountered worsening trading
conditions since the second quarter. Deepening competition among the
supermarkets has led to double-digit falls in doorstep milk volumes and put
pressure on corner shops.
                         *      *      *
Thorn EMI: The music and rentals group announces half-year results on
Tuesday, with pre-tax profits expected to be flat at around Pounds 105m,
after roughly Pounds 10m of exceptional costs related to disposals. Interest
will focus on compact disc pricing in the UK and US. Further questions are
possible about the US subsidiary Rent-A-Center, which allegedly used
unorthodox methods to extract money from late-payers.
                         *      *      *
Tate &amp; Lyle: Full-year results from the sweeteners group, out on Wednesday,
were foreshadowed in September when the company warned profits would fall
short of the Pounds 230.8m made in 1991, but show a marked improvement on
1992's Pounds 189.5m. Analysts are expecting around Pounds 220m. However,
much of the gain will have come from favourable exchange rates.
                         *      *      *
Kwik Save: The UK's largest discount food retailer is expected on Wednesday
to reveal an increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 125m-Pounds
128m. Although that is a healthy rise from last year's Pounds 110.6m,
analysts have downgraded their forecasts from as high as Pounds 136m and are
keen to hear Kwik Save's response to growing competition in the UK food
market.
There are fears that it is being squeezed between hard discounters and price
aggression of the superstores.
                         *      *      *
International: In the US, today is expiry date for cable group Viacom's
friendly tender offer for Paramount Communications.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Wind of change yet to reach the
bottom line - Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For two years now, the drifting fog of worldwide recession has obscured the
benefits to Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, of
restructuring to sharpen the focus on its core businesses.
Few expect first-half results on Tuesday to afford any clearer glimpse of
what has been achieved. Pre-tax profits are expected to improve 24 per cent
to about Pounds 290m - but by a more modest 7 per cent if exceptionals and
restructuring costs are excluded. Progress at the trading level is likely to
be even slower.
The management team which took over in 1991, after a Pounds 147m loss on
currency transactions, responded immediately to criticisms that the growth
rate had been pedestrian.
It has introduced new management structures. Peripheral, low-profit
operations have been sold, including Lyons Maid ice-cream; Showerings cider
company; wine interests in Germany and Chateau Latour, the Bordeaux vineyard
 -on which a book loss of about Pounds 20m will be taken - and Grants of St
James's.
Marketing spend has been increased, and in spirits concentrated on its
leading brands - Ballantine's, Beefeater, Kahlua, Courvoisier and Canadian
Club. The alliance with Domecq of Spain has been strengthened and extended
into Mexico. In Germany, France, Italy and Greece, Allied has taken control
of its brands distribution.
Brewing operations have been merged with Carlsberg in the UK, where
Carlsberg-Tetley was launched early this year into a fiercely competitive
and still declining UK beer market. The Victoria Wine drinks retail chain
has been reinforced by the acquisition of Augustus Barnett.
Costs have been reduced, with the workforce cut by nearly 2,000.
These moves have been applauded - but Allied's investors will have to wait a
little longer to see the rewards.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Dream of freedom turns into a prison: Paul Betts explains
why four European airlines abandoned the Alcazar project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alcazar yesterday turned into Alcatraz for four European medium sized
airlines. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS),
Swissair and Austrian Airlines had attempted for the past seven months to
merge their operations to create a 'fourth force' in the European aviation
industry to compete against the big three European airlines: British
Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France.
The four airlines picked on the name of Alcazar, the Spanish for a Moorish
fortress, because their intent was to create a new fortress airline system
in Europe to defend themselves against the increasing consolidation and
globalisation of the European airline industry.
Until a few weeks ago, it seemed the four carriers were close to agreement.
They managed to compromise on several complex issues including the valuation
of assets, headquarters location for the new joint airline company and the
joint management structure.
But at the end of the day it was the new partnership's American connection
which transformed the ambitious venture into a prison which, like Alcatraz,
was impossible to escape.
Mr Jan Carlzon, the former SAS president, warned two weeks ago that the
choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large question that can
still endanger Alcazar'.
A partnership with a US carrier has become one of the critical aspects of
any global alliance by a European carrier or group of airlines. But the
problem for the Alcazar partners had been made all the more difficult
because three of the carriers had already established ties with US airlines:
KLM with Northwest, Swissair with Delta Air Lines and SAS with Continental.
Until yesterday, financial advisers to the four airlines felt that the US
partnership issue was in many respects less complex than the other problems
the carriers had managed to resolve over the past few months of hectic
negotiations. Indeed, bankers had calculated that co-operation in Europe
would account for most of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) benefits the
alliance was expected to provide with the US partner playing a relatively
minor role.
In the last few days, the issue appears to have been narrowed down to a
simple choice with KLM insisting on its US partner, Northwest, while the
other three airlines favoured a link with Delta, in which Swissair has a 5
per cent cross-equity stake.
'It boiled down to KLM versus the rest on the US partner issue,' one source
close to the negotiations said yesterday.
KLM, which owns a 20 per cent stake in Northwest's parent, Wings Holdings,
argued that Northwest offered strategic advantages to Alcazar largely
because of the recent US 'open skies' deal with the Netherlands.
But Swissair said Northwest was too weak financially and its US network,
based around its hubs of Minneapolis and Detroit, was considerably less
attractive than Delta's deeper reach in the domestic US market.
KLM, however, was worried that Delta's main European hub at Frankfurt would
rival the hubs of the Alcazar partners in Amsterdam, Zurich, Copenhagen and
Vienna. But the other partners argued that Delta's strong presence in
Frankfurt, rather than competing against their hubs, would enhance their
position in Europe by strengthening their presence in the large German
market. They also felt that if KLM got its way, the partnership would be
heavily tilted in the Dutch airline's favour with Amsterdam ending up
playing the dominant role in the alliance.
The collapse of Alcazar will now force the four airlines to reconsider their
longer term plans.
KLM, which failed to form a partnership first with Sabena of Belgium and
then with British Airways, has been cutting costs and believes it is now in
a better position to face the competitive pressures of airline deregulation
and globalisation than two years ago. The Dutch airline also believes it can
buy some time to consider new partnerships because the pace of
liberalisation in Europe appears to have slowed.
SAS has also restructured its top management and intends to pursue its
cost-cutting drive to return to profitability. But without a strong
international partnership, its longer-term future remains clouded.
Swissair has already made it clear that will need a strong European partner.
It already has links with Delta and Singapore Airlines, but the airline
needs a big European alliance. Mr Hannes Goetz, Swissair's chairman,
recently said if Alcazar failed, Swissair would have to consider a
partnership with one of the three big European carriers: BA, Lufthansa or
Air France.
As for Austrian, the smallest of the four, it has already held talks with
Lufthansa and has not ruled out an alliance with Swissair.
The collapse of Alcazar in no manner suggests a reversal in the current
trend of consolidation in the European airline industry.
If it had succeeded, the top six airline groups in Europe would have
controlled almost 85 per cent of European airline traffic. But as Professor
Rigas Doganis, of Cranfield Institute of Technology, recently put it: 'If it
does not, another grouping will emerge. The consequences will be the same.'

FT  22 NOV 93 / Forte may sell KFC stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, is believed to be close to an
agreement to sell its stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken to Pepsico, its
partner in the business.
Pepsico is expected to pay Forte about Pounds 40m for its 50 per cent stake
in the venture, which is responsible for 304 Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurants in the UK. Of these, 84 are directly owned by the Forte/Pepsico
joint venture and 220 are franchised.
Forte has been keen to sell its stake for some time as part of its drive to
concentrate on its core hotel and restaurants business.
Kentucky Fried Chicken has suffered from price competition from other fast
food outlets. Forte does not provide separate figures for Kentucky Fried
Chicken, but it said last September that the chain's sales fell in the six
months to July 31 this year.
This was in contrast to the restaurants division as a whole, where profits
grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 40m on sales up 15 per cent to Pounds 358m.
In addition to Kentucky Fried Chicken, Forte owns the Welcome Break, Happy
Eater and Little Chef roadside restaurant chains.
Last December, it bought the Relais autoroute restaurant chain in France
from Accor, the French hotel group.
Forte is believed to have had less luck finding a buyer for its Harvester
restaurant chain which it put up for sale earlier this year.
The group had indicated that it hoped to sell the chain for more than Pounds
120m. It is believed, however, that offers received so far have been for
Pounds 110m or less.
It is now thought to be holding out for a higher price.
The Forte airport services division, which is to be floated early next year,
will be called the Alpha Airports Group.
Mr Paul Harrison, managing director of the division, said: 'The name Alpha
was chosen because it signifies 'beginning' in Greek and is also
appropriate, being the first letter of the aviators' alphabet.'

FT  22 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): High cost base deepens woe -
BASF/Bayer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Buffeted by price competition and overcapacity, the European chemicals
industry is in severe difficulty. In Germany, the problems of the three
giants - BASF, Bayer and Hoechst - are exacerbated by high manufacturing
costs.
The companies are expecting no second-half turnaround, but a clearer picture
will emerge when two of the big three release nine-month results: BASF today
and Bayer on Thursday.
Bayer, insulated from the ferocious downturn in bulk chemicals by
healthcare, has predicted that earnings will drop 20 per cent this year to
DM2bn (Pounds 700m). It should say whether this is still attainable. BASF
will look in bad shape by comparison. Profits halved in the first six months
to DM249m and may have disappeared in the third quarter.
'There is no question in my mind that BASF is now making losses,' said Mr
Albert Richards, chemicals analyst at CS First Boston in London. 'This might
not be obvious under German accounting rules, which give management the
freedom to report what they want. If they reported under US Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles they would probably report a significant loss
for the nine months.'
BASF is likely to report a token profit, but without a recovery in demand,
it can only return to genuine profitability via further cost cuts.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Middleton in final plea for Merrett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, will today make a
last-ditch effort to persuade Lloyd's agents to increase their backing for
syndicates managed by the Merrett Underwriting Agency Management.
Fears are growing that failure could lead to the break-up of the wider
Merrett Group, which also owns insurance services interests.
Lloyd's has become involved because Merrett's two biggest syndicates 418 and
1067 lead some of the market's most valuable US insurance business and are
unlikely to continue trading next year without support.
The Merrett's syndicates' difficulties have increased by the collapse of
plans last week to secure support from Travelers, the US insurance company.
Members' agents (who handle the affairs of Names - the individuals whose
assets have traditionally supported the market) are now said to be offering
between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m in backing for syndicate 418, compared
with the syndicate's current capacity of Pounds 150m and an estimated
minimum requirement of Pounds 50m. Lloyd's could also be left with the job
of organising the 'run off' (meeting claims on existing policies) of any
Merrett syndicates which are closed. Merrett is already handling the run-off
of syndicate 418's 1985 and 1990 loss-making years. A spokesman said
yesterday that Lloyd's 'was concerned to ensure continuity for existing
policyholders and that the interests of members are safeguarded'.
A 'steering group' consisting of Mr Middleton and other senior figures will
co-ordinate the activities of the Lloyd's Corporation - which administers
and regulates the market - and Lloyd's agents.
Mr Keeling replaced Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett Group, as
deputy chairman of the Lloyd's market in August.
As well as 418 and 1067 the group had aimed to manage four other syndicates
 -179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - next year.
They could now be transferred to other agencies, leaving the group dependent
on its income from insurance services business including Miller Knight, the
loss adjusters, BIL, an insurance investigations business, the Merrett
Health Risk Management, and BCS, a specialist run-off company.
Meanwhile three Merrett executives who resigned on Friday are to join Zurich
Re, the Swiss reinsurance company. Mr Dennis Purkiss, former group chief
executive of Merrett, will become chief executive officer, while Mr Ken
Barrett and Mr Stewart Laderman, underwriters of 1067 and 418's non-marine
business respectively, will join the Zurich underwriting team.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a stock market which has risen 70 per cent this year, Hong Kong is not
easily unsettled. Morgan Stanley's advice that its clients should scale back
exposure to Hong Kong equities might have been expected to jangle nerves.
The flight of US institutional investors from low interest rates at home has
contributed heavily to the market's remarkable run. With shares trading on a
multiple of around 15 times next year's forecast earnings - against a normal
trading range of up to 12.5 times - it is hard to quibble with the judgment
that the Hang Seng index is fully valued.
But the US is not the market's only source of liquidity. Japanese investors
have joined the buying party since the summer. With the local economy
booming, Hong Kong itself is hardly strapped for cash. Anecdotal evidence
suggests local investors have pulled back from the more extravagantly-priced
stocks. Some of that cash is likely to be reinvested, perhaps in second-line
shares. That should provide support even if US investors now temper their
enthusiasm.
Still, Hong Kong will find it more difficult to shrug off bad news from here
on. China remains both an enticing prospect and a possible source of nasty
shocks, both political and economic. While Beijing's credit squeeze now
appears to be easing, that may only postpone the day when resolute action is
required to curb an over-heating economy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of Mercury Asset Management's mining trust this week will provide
investors with a useful diversity of risk. RTZ stands alone among top-notch
UK mining companies, and the trust will invest worldwide. Whether it is
worthwhile digging deep to invest in mining shares at this stage of the
cycle is less clear. Base metals prices are at historic lows in real terms -
aluminium has fallen by two thirds from the peak in 1989 - so it is tempting
to call the turn. Demand should improve through 1994 as economies pull out
of recession. The snag is that high stocks and cheap exports, notably from
the Commonwealth of Independent States, leave metals markets with plenty of
slack.
Past experience suggests stocks in aluminium and nickel will have to halve
before prices show real recovery. Stock levels will only fall slowly unless
production is cut back. There are some signs of action on that front. US
aluminium producers have cut 700,000 tonnes capacity in the last 16 months.
Yet exports from the CIS have risen twice that amount since prices started
to slide. Russian aluminium smelters and nickel producers will be unwilling
to turn off the tap. While most big tin producers recently agreed to
restrict exports, it is not clear China will do so. There is always a chance
that demand within Russia will revive and soak up more local production. But
that cannot be taken for granted. While the slide in metals prices leaves
scope for dramatic improvement, the timing of recovery looks anything but
copper-bottomed.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Alcazar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always going to be tough getting Alcazar off the ground, given the
complexities of negotiating between four airlines, six governments and a
host of trade unions. But after compromising over so much, it seems odd the
merger should come juddering to a halt over the seemingly innocuous issue of
which US airline partner to choose. That suggests the principle of the
merger itself may have become an issue, rather than just the practicalities.
In any event, the carriers have little option but to seek new alliances.
The experience of the low-cost Southwest Airlines in the US has shown that
size is not the only criterion for aviation success. But the four European
carriers have all inherited high cost bases and geographic limitations. Only
the economies of scale deriving from mergers are likely to solve their
competitive problems. SAS appears in most urgent need of an alternative. A
restructured deal with KLM must remain possible.
The big three European airlines, however, will be quietly chuckling at their
smaller rivals' difficulties. British Airways will press ahead in Europe
through TAT and Deutsche BA. Air France can keep trying to defy economic
gravity for a little longer. But the biggest beneficiary of Alcazar's
failure could be Lufthansa. Austrian Airlines now seems likely to succumb to
its advances. And, despite its links with Delta and Singapore Airlines,
Swissair, too, may find it hard to resist being drawn into its orbit.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: A taste for Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been something of a turnround in City sentiment towards Guinness,
whose shares have risen by 13 per cent from last month's trough. Part of the
reason is the more robust message coming from management. First came the
shake-up at the top of its spirits division, though that can only be judged
when a replacement is found for Mr Crispin Davis, its former chief. Guinness
has also made a concerted effort to reassure the market about the durability
and usefulness of its links with LVMH. Last week's sale by LVMH of its Roc
beauty products division will further calm fears that it might sell its 24
per cent stake in Guinness to raise cash. It would have to be foolish - or
desperate - to do so at this stage of the cycle anyway.
Perhaps more important is the way Guinness is tweaking its message about
brands. There is less talk now about trading up in scotch, and more about
securing market share by demonstrating the inherent value rather than the
mere status appeal of its brands. That applies even at the lower end, which
Guinness has neglected in the past. Guinness may thus derive premium value
for its brands across the price spectrum in a way that is less dependent on
a tendency to trade up. In beer, Guinness is pushing its stout brand in a
way that seems consciously designed to distract from the continuing
embarrassment of its foray into the Spanish domestic lager market.
No doubt this new formulation of its strategy appeals because it corresponds
better to the drinks market reality. Guinness is adamant that it is not in
the business of discounting. Nor is it simply living in the hope that its
customers will soon begin to trade up again. A better-defined sense of
purpose may have stopped the short-term rot in its share price. It will
still be a long while, though, before that translates into a significant
recovery of profits.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Unemployment benefit may suffer deep cuts: Leak discloses
'insidious' review of welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment benefit may suffer deep cuts if plans under serious
consideration by ministers as part of their efforts to cut public spending
are included in next week's Budget.
The proposals emerged yesterday after documents outlining the scope of the
government's long-term social security review were leaked to the Labour
party.
They set the scene for a prolonged and bitter row over the future of the
welfare state. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the review was
'more insidious and more threatening than the previous Thatcher reviews' and
went 'right to the heart of the welfare state'.
Labour is expected to launch an attack on the proposed benefit cuts when the
government's recently announced legislative programme is debated in the
Commons this week.
Ministerial resistance to changes in unemployment benefit has been reduced
by the recent downward trend in jobless figures, underlined by last week's
announcement of the biggest monthly fall in the total for nearly four years.
One option being examined is to halve the time for which the 715,000
unemployment benefit claimants are eligible for the Pounds 44.65 a week
benefit from a year to six months.
If plans for that go through, the unemployed would have to rely on income
support, which is pegged at Pounds 44 a week for a single adult but which is
means-tested to exclude those with savings of more than Pounds 8,000.
The government would need to legislate for such a change, however, providing
a potential rallying point for its opponents and risking an embarrassing
Commons defeat.
Ministers have already indicated that the Budget will include a sharp
reduction in the amount of state support given to employers whose staff go
on sick leave and a Pounds 500m cut in the cost of state invalidity benefit.
Yesterday's developments came as public figures queued up to give chancellor
Kenneth Clarke advice on what he should do in his first Budget on November
30, with most agreeing that tax rises would be necessary.
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said Mr Clarke should crack down on
public spending, although he conceded he 'may need to raise taxes a little
bit as well'. Mr John Biffen, the former Tory cabinet minister, argued for
an extension of the VAT base to include water and transport, as well as
other items currently zero-rated.
A report written by Mr Bill Robinson, previously special adviser to Mr
Norman Lamont, former chancellor, said Mr Clarke had no realistic
alternative but to raise taxes in the Budget.

Leaders of Pacific rim countries set out a vision of economic partnership at
the weekend which they said would give the Asia Pacific region a new voice
in world affairs and would spearhead global growth in the 21st century.
Although they stopped far short of establishing a formal economic community,
the leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping indicated
gathering momentum by agreeing to meet next year in Jakarta.
They also called a meeting of finance ministers to discuss macroeconomic
developments and capital flows.
The heads of government of the US, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Brunei, with ministers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, met for six hours in a
replica Indian log longhouse on Blake Island, near Seattle.
The leaders issued a 'vision statement' that steered clear of the many
bilateral issues dividing Apec members and contained few specific
commitments.
However, it said: 'Our economies are moving toward interdependence and there
is a growing sense of community among us.'
The region, they noted, accounts for 40 per cent of the world's population
and 50 per cent of its gross national product.
The statement's vagueness underlined the nervousness of Asian countries
about creating new formal structures for co-operation, and particularly
about agreeing to anything that might be interpreted as submitting to US
domination.
The leaders were emphatic that they were not trying to establish an
exclusive trade bloc and that they were determined to win a strengthened
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Leaders of Pacific rim countries, meeting in an unprecedented summit at the

Although they stopped far short of establishing a formal economic community,

The statement's vagueness underlined the nervousness of Asian countries
about creating new formal structures for co-operation, and particularly
about agreeing to anything that might be interpreted as submitting to US

However, Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said the summit had
'diminished fears some countries might have had about the US and its
motives.'
US President Bill Clinton said: 'We've agreed that the Asian-Pacific region
should be a united one, not divided. We've agreed that our economic policies
should be open, not closed.'
The leaders were emphatic that they were not trying to establish an
exclusive trade bloc and that they were determined to win a strengthened
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Most Apec countries, seeking to give
impetus to talks on the Gatt Uruguay Round, offered new tariff cuts.
Gatt negotiators in Geneva are seeking accord by December 15.
China's insistence that the US should not link trade and human rights issues
found an echo with virtually every other participating country.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Israel and Egypt plan gas pipeline and power grid link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt and Israel have exchanged letters of understanding to begin detailed
work on linking the two countries' national power grids and build a Dollars
1bn (Pounds 670m) pipeline to supply Israel with Egyptian gas.
Both projects mark an early step in what Israel hopes will be a massive
peace dividend in Middle Eastern regional integration.
Mr Moshe Shahal, Israel's energy minister, said at the weekend that he had
negotiated the deals with Egypt's energy and oil ministers, with the
approval of President Hosni Mubarak.
Israeli officials said experts from the state-owned electricity corporation
would visit Egypt next week to begin a study with Egyptian counterparts on
how best to link the electricity grids, which could be 'done at once'. The
study will be financed by the European Union. Mr Shahal said the linking of
regional electricity systems could save Israel Dollars 200m and Egypt
Dollars 78m by eliminating the need for parallel power lines.
Israel also hopes to include Jordan, Turkey and Syria in a regional power
grid as soon as there is a more comprehensive Mideast peace agreement.
Under the potential gas supply deal, Mr Shahal said a pipeline would be
built from the Egyptian Nile Delta to Israel, passing through the Gaza
Strip, which could also be supplied with Egyptian gas. Israel hopes to agree
a supply contract under which Egypt would pipe up to 2m tonnes of natural
gas annually for 25 years, mainly to Israeli power plants.
The Dollars 1bn project may be funded in part by the EU. An international
energy company, approved by both Egyptian and Israeli Energy Ministries,
will undertake a study.
Egypt has said it has insufficient natural gas to export, but potential
discoveries might provide the necessary reserves.
Mr Shahal also said that, in future, payments by Israel for petroleum
supplied by Egypt would be made through an Israeli commercial bank rather
than a European bank. The minister said the two countries had also discussed
co-operation in petrochemicals and joint oil searches.

FT  22 NOV 93 / A prince captured: The heir to the British throne believes
he could be used more effectively in promoting UK plc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Her Majesty's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mr David Gore-Booth, paced the
marbled floor of Jeddah Hamra palace in shock: 'That was incredible,
astonishing, unprecedented.'
It was well after 2am and King Fahd, Custodian of the two Holy Mosques and
head of the House of Saud, had just left in one of his favourite, old
Mercedes limousines after lengthy talks with Prince Charles, heir to the
British throne.
The king had already turned convention and protocol on its head with his
last-minute decision to meet the prince on his arrival from Riyadh. The
conversation, lubricated with glasses of carrot and kiwi fruit juice, began
with the inevitable pleasantries about families and ambassadors but quickly
moved up a gear.
Shortly before his recent, week-long trip to the Middle East, Prince Charles
had publicly attacked the regime of Saddam Hussein and called for closer
understanding between the world of Islam and the west. He was highly tickled
by reports that his words had triggered a fall in the Iraqi dinar.
King Fahd, the first of his many Middle East hosts, was appreciative of the
speech, expressing unqualified admiration and respect for his visitor. Mr
Gore-Booth is not a man to wear his emotions on his sleeve. But the
ambassador, casting diplomatic restraint into the hot, night air, was
gob-smacked.
King Fahd's message of gratitude was to be repeated ad infinitum as the
prince - no longer part of the world's most famous royal double-act -
progressed across a region where royalty still counts. Here, royal families
not only dispense patronage but award commercial contracts carrying
billion-dollar tags; here a British prince can pack the sort of punch which
often eludes him at home.
His arrival in Saudi Arabia set the tone for a hectic tour of duty run at a
ridiculous pace. But despite the flag-waving and flummery which enveloped
the royal visit, there was a serious sub-plot. Prince Charles had come to
bat for Britain.
Increasingly, his trips abroad are being carefully constructed to maximise
commercial spin-off for British companies. According to one of the prince's
team: 'Their function has changed; he is not wheeled out as a zoo exhibit.'
The prince himself is not worried that his unique position is being used to
help trade, hoping instead that it 'filters down to benefit our own
companies'. Indeed, he believes he is under-exploited and is desperately
keen for Whitehall to do something about it. He was bemused because there
had been a row over the availability of the VC10 for the Middle East trip. A
minor, inter-departmental skirmish maybe, but he believes it demonstrated
the low priority given by Whitehall to such visits.
The prince has already made one behind-the-scenes attempt to enlist the help
of government in devising a co-ordinated strategy for using him and his
foreign excursions to best effect in selling Britain.
An invitation eight years ago from Kensington Palace to representatives of
ministries and trade bodies to consider the issue came to nothing. It
floundered, he believes, in an atmosphere of national short-termism which he
thinks still persists, and on the inability of government to orchestrate
initiatives across departments.
'Things can be properly co-ordinated in Wales and Scotland because each has
only one secretary of state. Why can't it be done for the nation as a
whole?' he inquires.
Now that ministers, particularly in the Department of Trade and Industry,
have given exports a high political priority, the prince's office wants to
try again to build more effective links with government departments to
maximise the value of royal missions. One aide says: 'Parts of Whitehall
still see royal visits in an anachronistic way. A certain amount of
re-education is required and is under way.'
It is impossible to evaluate the commercial contribution of a 45-year-old
trainee head of state who cannot return home with signed contracts in a
crested briefcase. But, merely by virtue of who he is, he can forge personal
relationships which can lead to commercial alliances. As another member of
his inner-circle puts it: 'He can cut ribbons and unveil any number of
plaques. But much more importantly, he can open doors.'
The prince is the first to acknowledge the difficulty in assessing his value
in this respect. On his visits abroad, he says he wants to develop his role
as 'a cultural and commercial emissary', acting on behalf of a country for
which he cares deeply but which he believes often undersells itself. He
regularly alludes to the way some of Britain's European competitors beat
their own drums more effectively than UK plc.
His influence is now felt overseas through organisations such as the
business leaders' forum, the newest of his business-led charities which is
aimed at getting British companies to help the development of emerging
economies. In spite of the endless suggestions that the heir to the throne
is emerging from his own annus horribilis to search for a newly-defined
role, he insists it has never changed. Whether his value is perceived to be
as great elsewhere, given his recent personal traumas, remains open to
question.
'The idea I am searching to redefine my job is rot. It is just that, since
the day I got married, people have chosen to ignore the things I continue to
do day in and day out.'
The Prince of Wales has been starring in what he concedes has been a 'soap
opera', from which, so far, it has been impossible to escape. His eyebrows
rise in exasperation at the alternative, tabloid agenda which usually
chooses to neglect his best endeavours in favour of what he sees as
irrelevant, sometimes malicious trivia.
None of this may cut much ice with those who believe the royal family is an
expensive irrelevance whose time has passed. The critics' convictions will
only have been reinforced by the distractions of the past few years.
In Kuwait, the prince's men were again forced on to the defensive, trying to
keep newspaper reporters away from excited, expatriate schoolchildren in
case journalists fed them loaded questions to embarrass their special
visitor. Later, there was despair at newspaper stories claiming the prince
had made a 'gaffe' by talking to a French Mirage pilot at the Dubai air
show. British princes, it seems, are only supposed to talk to British
companies. Prince Charles now hopes, perhaps in vain, that he can begin to
refocus public attention on his serious role and on a broad range of issues
 -such as inner cities and architecture. The growing personal support team
which operates from roomy offices overlooking Ambassador's Court at St
James's share his objectives. Those closest to him say he is 'a driven man',
determined to fulfil a role which has never been written down and which he
has largely created for himself. His determined sense of purpose sometimes
provokes an ill-tempered outburst against those who might see things
differently.
In spite of the pressures, he is healthy, despite a nagging, polo-induced
back injury which has left him with an uneasy gait. He needs little sleep,
though the contemplative calm of a church service in Kuwait brought on
obstinately heavy eyelids which threatened to hand the tabloids another
headline. Before returning to London, he stole a few, private hours in the
sunshine at King Hussein's seaside palace in Aqaba, most of them spent
ploughing through the pile of official papers at his side. Such commitment,
he pleads, would not be shared by the sort of international playboy he could
have been.
There was no time for play as the prince criss-crossed Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, taking coffee and sweetmeats with kings, crown princes
and prime ministers. Whatever the cynics might say, the British companies he
called on last week were in no doubt that the visit was worth the prince's
weight in riyals.
Mr Peter Marshall, managing director of John Brown Engineering, was among
the royal visitor's hosts when he called in on the Pounds 120m Ibn Zahr
plastics plant project at Jubail, in Saudi Arabia's eastern province.
Did it help? 'Are you kidding? You can't put a value on his visit. It
brought together some very influential people and helped reinforce the idea
of British commitment to the region.' Mr Marshall will shortly return to
Jubail, where he is told the visit has helped to create the right climate to
carry forward negotiations on another Pounds 110m project.
On the other side of the kingdom, in Jeddah, Mr Patrick Arnold, chairman of
the local British businessmen's group, gave the same message: 'Competition
here is tough. But there is a lot of pro-British sentiment and this visit is
a tremendous confidence booster for UK companies.'
British ambassadors, who once might have measured the success of such a
royal visit by the size of their cocktail parties, believe the prince's
commercial value is exceptional. Mr William Fullerton, the Foreign Office's
man in Kuwait, says there have been three recent trade missions from the UK
and that the prince's visit will mean continuing goodwill towards visiting
groups. The prince's Arab hosts think likewise. Dr Jasim Mohhamed Alansani,
commercial director for the development of the industrial city of Jubail,
says: 'The prince's visit will directly help British companies in their
fight for work.'
Despite such endorsements, the team at St James's believes that much more
can be done. The prince's latest visit, for example, proved immensely more
effective because of his earlier speech.
He cannot always have on hand a weighty address relevant to the interests of
his hosts, but the idea of more thoroughly preparing the ground, perhaps
through linked ministerial visits, is one to be more fully explored. Another
way of heightening the impact of his trips could be to orchestrate immediate
follow-up business missions able to exploit the warm glow left in the wake
of royalty.
There is in place a system to help devise and plan missions for members of
the royal family, overseen by the royal visits committee, chaired by Sir
Robin Butler, cabinet secretary. The Foreign Office, which picks up the
bills for overseas royal visits but which gives such expenditure low
priority, plays a pivotal role in drawing up an annual programme and
advising on who goes where.
The DTI, which has tiny resources, also plays a part. Its UK-based market
intelligence operation provides pre-trip briefings and, for the prince's
Gulf trip, helped organise a seminar in Saudi Arabia on energy and the
environment.
But Gen Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of British forces during the
Gulf war, who accompanied the prince around the region, believes - like
others in the Royal circle - that a more all-encompassing, strategic
approach designed to make the best of a very British asset is needed.
Sir Peter, a director of Flemings, the London-based merchant bank which has
built a permanent presence in the region, is clear about the prince's
special value: 'There are some very heavy-hitters in the business world out
here, particularly the Americans. Royalty can provide a very effective
counterweight to that sort of approach.'
There was no doubt that Prince Charles had a magnetic effect on his royal
hosts during his visit. But that reaction is highly unlikely to be repeated
so easily when he meets a more cynical public in republican-leaning
Australia in January. The commercial benefits there may be a lot more
elusive.
In Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, cavalcades of limousines conveyed guests
to the gangway of Her Majesty's yacht Britannia, where they were entertained
to a modest dinner devised as a simple antidote to the excesses of the
banquets on shore.
As the Royal Marines played selections from Smetana and Strauss, British
businessmen chatted with royalty, politicians and their own counterparts
from the world of commerce.
Britannia is five years younger than the prince and, with nearly 1m miles on
the clock, its future is at the mercy of a Whitehall machine which doubts
its value and needs to cut costs. Now, perhaps too late, the vessel is
increasingly being made available for commercial use - last week it was at
the centre of Indo-British week in Bombay. Back in Abu Dhabi, as dinner on
board ended and guests prepared to watch the marines 'beating the retreat',
an astonished Arab guest learnt of the yacht's uncertain future.
Sheikh Khalifa Muhairy, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was
incredulous. 'You are mad. It is a unique advertisement for your country.
How can its future be in doubt?'
If the Prince of Wales had overheard the question being asked of the 400ft
yacht, he might have been forgiven for thinking it had been directed at the
House of Windsor itself.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Russia and its neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Boris Yeltsin suggested, earlier this year, that the UN
should grant Russia 'special powers' to guarantee peace and stability in the
former Soviet Union, he got a frosty reception outside his own country.
Since then, public debate in the west has focused on Russia's internal
affairs. Is Mr Yeltsin a democrat? What are the chances of real economic
reform? These have been the central preoccupations of both analysts and
decision-makers.
No doubt that is correct. In the long run a democratic, market-oriented
Russia would be a far more congenial and constructive member of the
much-touted 'international community' than one that relapsed into
dictatorship and state control. But that does not mean foreign policy is
perfect so long as Mr Yeltsin remains in power, still less that western
governments should ignore it. Indeed, they are now being invited to take an
interest in it by the Russian foreign minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, who has
revived Mr Yeltsin's proposal in more diplomatic language.
Instability
Mr Kozyrev points out that many of Russia's southern neighbours are wracked
by internal conflicts and two (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are at war with each
other. Russia, he says, cannot ignore such widespread instability on its
borders, or its effect on the 25m ethnic Russians who now live as minorities
in non-Russian states. Russia is blamed for not paying its share of the cost
of peacekeeping operations elsewhere in the world, while other powers,
already stretched and baffled by Bosnia and Somalia, are clearly reluctant
to do much about similar problems in the former Soviet Union. There Russia,
joined sometimes by other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
is willing to do the job, but looks to the UN for political and financial
support. And, Mr Kozyrev concludes in a seductive sotto voce, his own
ministry would specially welcome UN involvement, as a way of strengthening
civilian control over the Russian forces deployed.
The worst way for western governments to react to these overtures would be
to ignore them. That would convince Russians that the west was washing its
hands of the region, and effectively giving them carte blanche to solve its
problems on their own as best they can. On the contrary, the west should
welcome the chance to monitor, and indeed to influence, Russian behaviour in
the region. Official observers, whether from the UN or from the Conference
on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), could be a useful instrument
for this.
Acceptable role
But if such organisations are to be involved, their members must make it
very clear what they regard as an acceptable role for Russia, and what they
do not. Where Russia is able and willing to play a genuinely impartial
peacekeeping role there may be a case for setting off the cost against its
UN arrears, which it is anyway unlikely to pay. But it would be grotesquely
misleading to describe units such as the 14th army in Moldova or the 201st
rifle division in Tajikistan as 'peacekeeping forces'. The former is the
main armed force of the breakaway Transdniestrian region, while the latter
is propping up a regime run by veteran communists and guarding the frontier
against its opponents, who have fled into Afghanistan and are being
radicalised into anti-Russian Islamic militants.
Russia must be expected to assert its interests in a region of obvious
strategic importance to it. But it should not be encouraged to do so by
deploying military force in the guise of an 'impartial' peacekeeper. Nor
should it be recognised as protector of all ethnic Russians, still less of
all Russian-speakers, outside its borders.
The ethnic composition of virtually all the ex-Soviet republics, and most
conspicuously of Russia itself, requires all governments in the region to be
very sensitive in their treatment of minorities. Where external help is
required with this it should be provided on a multilateral basis, notably
through the CSCE's High Commissioner on National Minorities, Mr Max van der
Stoel, rather than by ethnic 'kin-states' whose intervention is more likely
to exacerbate such tensions than to allay them.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Decision time for Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Within weeks, or even perhaps days, the government is likely to tell British
Nuclear Fuels whether it can press the start button at Thorp, its nuclear
reprocessing plant at Sellafield. The decision, one of the most
controversial facing the government, seems almost certain to be yes:
ministers have already said they are 'minded' to grant a licence. Once Thorp
starts to re-process fuel, there will be no turning back. The plant will be
radioactive, and subject to hefty decommissioning costs.
The alternative to approval is a further public inquiry, which could last
more than a year. But BNF claims this would be tantamount to abandoning
Thorp, as foreign customers would walk away to French rivals. Continuing
uncertainty over Thorp would also complicate and perhaps even endanger the
government's planned review of nuclear power.
So far as the government is concerned, the only outstanding issue is Thorp's
financial viability. A public consultation early this year concluded that
its radioactive emissions would not pose a significant threat to health or
the environment. But in going through a further round of consultations, the
government has acknowledged the concern that pressing ahead with Thorp could
land the UK taxpayer with a larger bill than stopping the project now.
Dry storage
Since the government approved Thorp's construction in 1977, the arguments
for reprocessing used nuclear fuel rods have diminished. The alternative of
'dry storage' - containing the waste without further treatment - may now be
cheaper. Scottish Nuclear, one of Thorp's UK customers, wants to switch to
dry storage for part of its waste, arguing that it could save millions of
pounds a year. Thorp's critics have questioned whether BNF's overseas
customers, notably the Japanese and German utilities, might make the same
choice.
BNF says not. At the start of the second consultation, it published
projections claiming that the UK would lose at least Pounds 900m by
abandoning Thorp and switching to dry storage. Foreign customers were not
only keen for Thorp to start, but were locked in with tight penalty clauses,
it argued.
BNF's case is plausible. However, it assumes that customers abide by the
letter of their contracts with BNF throughout the plant's life. The real
risk, Thorp's critics say, is that some foreign customers might pull out and
contest their obligation to pay compensation, leaving the plant running
below capacity.
Shortcoming
The consultation's most serious shortcoming is that the government has not
commissioned any independent audit of BNF's projections. Nor has it produced
its own estimates of the costs of dry storage, or a clear assessment of the
implications of the Thorp decision for UK electricity bills.
Those sums might well come out in Thorp's favour - but if they have been
done, they have not been made public. It is known that the Treasury has
examined the figures, but given its record in projecting nuclear costs - it
has consistently underestimated the costs of building and decommissioning
nuclear reactors - that is insufficiently comforting.
Before any announcement on Thorp, it is essential that government reflects
carefully upon these points. Ministers will be right to weigh carefully the
difficulties of abandoning a plant on which Pounds 2.8bn has already been
spent, particularly since to do so would involve breaking commitments to
Japan and Germany and would weaken, perhaps fatally, BNF, which is a British
high technology company with some potential. Moreover, to concede a further
public inquiry would play into the hands of protestors like Greenpeace,
whose aim is not just to stop Thorp, but to obliterate the UK nuclear power
industry.
If the government remains minded to let Thorp start work, it is essential
that ministers provide a full and rigorous validation of the economic case
for doing so. The history of nuclear power in the UK contains some of the
government's most expensive industrial mistakes, all of them based upon
inadequate analysis of costs. As Britain's nuclear industry looks forward to
its next, important stage of development, possibly to include another
attempt at privatisation, the last thing it needs is an inadequately
verified decision in favour of Thorp.

A terrifying new professional standard is being proposed for Britain's
bean-counters by the Auditing Practices Board. SAS 210 pronounces that
auditors must get to know the business they examine sufficiently well to
understand the practices that might have a significant effect on the
financial statements. It seems that there has been no such standard in the
UK up till now. No wonder all these companies keep collapsing without a peep
from the auditors.

Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which has brushed up the image of everyone from Boris
Yeltsin to Britain's Conservative party, is not one to duck tough
assignments. So it is perhaps not surprising that the latest - and perhaps
oddest - political figure who may seek its help is former Nigerian president
General Ibrahim Babangida.
Babangida stood down in August after eight years in charge, but at 52 he
seems too young for permanent retirement. He now lives in some splendour in
his home town of Minna, but his aspirations for statesmanship appear to be
resurging, now that his erstwhile right hand man, General Sani Abacha has
got rid of the interim government, led by civilians but backed by the
military.
Word is that Babangida may be prepared to pay handsomely for the top-notch
marketing advice available from the likes of Saatchi, to smooth the path for
a possible comeback when elections are held in a few years' time.

The Economist, redoubtable weekly magazine that it is, always adopts a lofty
tone in its leader columns, dismissing with great vigour any idea it finds
absurd.
So it cannot complain too much if it occasionally gets the same sort of
treatment itself. Take last Friday's outburst by ex-prime minister Sir
Edward Heath at a conference in Luxembourg. Sir Edward dismissed John
Major's recent European vision article in The Economist as 'ghastly', and
then complained that the magazine had not allowed him to write a serious
rejoinder.
But presumably that request was only a jest, since he ended by dismissing
the mag as 'not read at all in Britain, sparsely read in Europe, and mainly
a coffee table paper in America'.

So now we know what Sir Derek Alun-Jones, the deposed boss of troubled
Ferranti, did with part of his near Pounds 500,000 golden handshake. The
Independent on Sunday reports that he spent Pounds 22,000 on acquiring
Ferranti's share of the fishing rights on a stretch of the river Test in
Hampshire. The rights had been bought when Alun-Jones was running Ferranti
and it could afford to entertain wealthy overseas clients in style.
He seems to have struck a good deal paying roughly half what Ferranti paid
for the stake. However, his former employer denies any special favours and
says that the decline in price was due to a combination of the recession, a
drought and the fact that the other owners had the right of veto over any
purchaser.

Meanwhile it did not take long to spot the odd man out at the summit. Hamish
Macleod, a 53-year-old Scottish civil servant, can scarcely have expected to
be rubbing shoulders so informally with the leaders of 40 per cent of the
world's population when he was appointed to be Hong Kong's financial
secretary.
However as all three Chinas - China, Taiwan and Hong Kong - are members of
Apec it was politic only for one to send its head of government. So Macleod,
a mild-mannered St Andrews graduate who has worked his way up the Hong Kong
government since joining as an administrative officer in 1966, was sent as
Hong Kong's 'economic leader'.
What Jiang Zemin, China's president, thought of having Macleod sitting next
to him in all the meetings is not recorded.

<TEXT>
One of the most delicate issues facing the delegates from 17 Pacific Rim
countries who have been meeting in Seattle was what to call their high-level
pow-wow.
The formal title, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, is a clumsy mouthful
that Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister and one of the early
promoters of the Apec grouping, describes with only partial grammatical
correctness as 'four adjectives in search of a noun.' US secretary of state
Warren Christopher called it Opec, while President Bill Clinton preferred
Asia-Pacific Economic Council.
Australia's Mr Evans believes it is only a matter of time before Apec moves
to 'three adjectives and a noun: Asia-Pacific Economic Community.' But the
word 'community' has ruffled many Asian feathers.
Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister for international trade and industry,
said the group was already a 'community with a small c', but that she had no
desire to capitalise the word.
Fred Bergsten, the US economist in charge of a group of eminent persons
drafting a vision for Apec's future, then had to convince Apec ministers
that although his group's report spelt Community with a capital C, it was
not proposing the creation of another European Community.

FT  22 NOV 93 / How Uncle Sam won over a sceptic

<TEXT>
'No man whose mind is alive and active . . . can keep his political and
spiritual opinions, much less his philosophical consciousness, at a
standstill for a quarter of a century. . .'
 - George Bernard Shaw in The Perfect Wagnerite (1898)
GBS is always there when you need him. Recently I have been wondering how to
respond to remarks that my opinions have changed since I moved to
Washington. How, I am asked, can someone who rarely hesitated to find fault
with Thatcherism now write so sympathetically about market forces? Is it the
climate? Or perhaps the food? Am I being blackmailed by some
arch-conservative think-tank?
Shaw provides the perfect answer. My views have not changed. I have simply
managed to avoid an intellectual 'standstill'. I may not have written for
the Financial Times for a quarter of a century. But it will soon be a
decade. And much has changed in those years.
As people age, a coarsening of their thought is sometimes evident. Youthful
idealism gives way to knee-jerk punditry, sometimes of a reactionary nature.
Sympathy for the disadvantaged can evaporate. As the old adage goes: 'If you
are not a socialist at 20 you don't have a heart; if you are not a
conservative at 40, you don't have a head.'
I am not conscious of any loss of idealism. But my views on the kind of
policies that are likely to be effective in the long run have evolved.
Compared with a decade ago I am more sceptical of government solutions and
more willing to rely on market forces.
I realise this runs directly counter to spirit of the times. President
Clinton is in power, not President Reagan. In the early 1980s, there were
high hopes for monetarism and markets. The pendulum has since swung back in
favour of interventionist policies. Keynes's critique of classical economics
is again taken seriously - especially in Britain.
Various forces - some external, some internal - have contributed to my
change of heart. The most significant political event of this past
half-century is the demise of communism and central planning. This has
occurred not just in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe but in Asia,
where China is moving toward a market system, and in most of the rest of the
developing world. Billions have opted to replace bureaucrats by markets.
The relevance of the global collapse of communism for the advanced
industrial economies can be endlessly debated. Since the west rejected
full-blown central planning and stuck with parliamentary democracy, many
people conclude we have nothing to learn from events in Russia, Poland or
China.
This strikes me as less than intellectually honest. In the days before the
fall of the Berlin Wall many western economists greatly exaggerated the
success of economic planning and suggested that, with a different political
regime, it could provide a viable alternative to capitalism. We now know
better.
Communism was a logical extension of 19th-century socialist ideas. People
like Shaw believed in state ownership of the means of production, in the
elimination of the profit motive and in a near complete equalisation of
incomes. The failure of socialism as a national economic system ought to
make us more sceptical of applying similar principles on a smaller scale
within industrial democracies.
On a personal note, leaving Britain in 1990 before the economy imploded, has
left me in a less pessimistic frame of mind than many UK commentators.
Nothing fuels hostility to market forces more effectively than a depression.
When unemployment is high, the well-intentioned naturally recoil against the
apparent waste and cruelty of the market system. Had I lived through the
latest UK recession, which was much deeper than the US downturn, I would be
more receptive to anti-market rhetoric.
But living in the US has illuminated some of the virtues of the market. For
all its chronic social problems, America's smoothly-running market economy
offers a sturdier ladder of opportunity than Britain's. There is plenty of
old money around. But the link between wealth and social class is far less
pronounced: if somebody is wealthy, the presumption is that they worked for
it. There is a greater sense of optimism, a deeper confidence that free
enterprise, for all its imperfections, will reward ability and hard work.
Britain might have developed US attitudes if Gladstonian liberals had been
able to resist the intellectual advance of socialism. If the Liberal party
had seen off the challenge from Labour and retained its commitment to free
trade and free markets, political power might have see-sawed between two
parties broadly committed to free enterprise. The Liberals could have played
the role of American Democrats - a role which the Labour party could yet
play with distinction.
Looking back, I can see that gut hostility to market forces came naturally
to someone of my generation. I was, after all, raised in a welfare state. I
enjoyed 'free' state education (at university as well as school) and 'free'
state healthcare. I took for granted the government's right not only to
steer the economy but to regulate the whole of society. I had no interest in
industry or commerce. Entrepreneurship? The profit motive? These were
concepts dismissed with disdain by the intellectuals I admired.
I had what I would now describe as a 'hang-up' about social justice. Since
our needs are similar, shouldn't we have roughly equal incomes? Why? A
society must provide an ample safety net for the poor, but surely the left's
obsessive desire to redistribute incomes reflects a crass materialism or,
worse still, sheer envy of the good fortune of others.
Nobody is qualified (not even a parliamentary majority) to judge what income
their neighbour deserves. The beauty of a market system is that judgments of
worth are not required: in the absence of artificial barriers to
competition, what we get will usually be determined by the usefulness of our
services to others.
Unfortunately, market forces remain deeply unpopular. The terminology is
certainly unhelpful. 'Market' sounds hideously impersonal, while 'forces'
conjure up images of authoritarian repression. Why should any society
subject itself to so unnatural a discipline?
To appreciate the market you have to consider its nature more carefully. It
is not something external forced on us. It is us: it is simply the sum total
of free exchanges between individuals. It is the only genuine form of social
co-operation because no exchange occurs unless each party expects to
benefit.
Of course, our 'voting power' on the market is not equal because our incomes
differ. But the combined voting power of ordinary people vastly exceeds that
of rich elites, which is why snobs so dislike commercial television. And in
the market we get to vote several times a day, not once every four or five
years. And we are voting on specific issues rather than consigning virtually
limitless powers to a bunch of politicians.
Millions of people cannot physically co-ordinate their decisions except
through the market. The only alternative to the market is thus the transfer
of power to bureaucratic elites, nominally supervised by their parliamentary
masters.
Do such opinions make me a conservative? I would say, emphatically, no.
Somebody who advocates more competition and more reliance on market forces
is no friend of vested interests or the status quo.
Today's true conservatives are the people who have learned nothing from the
20th century, the people whose attitudes and actions distantly echo the
arguments of 19th-century Fabian socialists such as Shaw. Indeed, given his
optimistic temperament and commitment to human progress, I am confident that
had Shaw been born in 1956, rather than 1856, he would not be a Shavian. He
would be waving the market banner.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A contrast in environmental values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RYOTARO KANEOKA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest David Lascelles' comparison of the way Oxford and
Freiburg manage their environmental and traffic problems (Business and the
Environment, November 17). If I try and read between the lines, I see a
number of contrasting approaches to the way we value the environment.
1. Is Oxford's privatisation strategy a better one? I feel that a
market-oriented valuation of the environment is more sustainable because
Freiburg's subsidisation only adds to unwanted budget deficits.
2. Is Freiburg's high level of community control sustainable? Heavy
subsidisation adds up to higher costs, and if it continues, there may be a
lasting risk of Germany having a relatively high inflation rate.
3. Is Oxford's environmental pricing likely to gain wider acceptance? The
majority, I suspect, still need Freiburg's inflationary market. But the
global market and European currency competition must be systematically
deterring the inflationary market.

FT  22 NOV 93 / An enigma behind the UK recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old proverb says that every grey cloud has a silver lining. The British,
however, are good at seeing the grey lining around every silver cloud. There
is thus a resistance to seeing how good the recent economic news has been in
a recession-beset world. For instance, the surprise October fall in the
retail prices index took the index so far below what was expected that it
has given a downward push to the inflation trend.
Students of the inflation process must get used to three inflation measures.
There is the 'headline' RPI rate, heavily distorted by the timing of
mortgage rate changes and which now stands at the unrealistically low rate
of 1.4 per cent, year on year. Then there is the official measure of the
underlying RPI rate, which excludes mortgage interest and stands at 2.8 per
cent.
Finally there is the core rate which attempts to remove other temporary
disturbances, such as those caused by indirect tax changes. How to measure
the core is controversial. But an estimate by Michael Saunders of Salomon
Brothers puts it at 2.8 per cent too. Taking into account the increases in
value added tax in the pipeline and assuming a further small increase in
excise duties, Saunders expects the underlying rate to rise briefly next
summer to a couple of decimal points above the official 4 per cent target
ceiling; but he expects the core rate not to rise much above 3 per cent.
This downward pressure on prices reflects a more competitive atmosphere than
that normally brought about by a slack economy. The RPI indices are
supported by pay settlements, which are the lowest since the Confederation
of British Industry databank started in 1977. Earnings increases due to
third-quarter pay awards in manufacturing are estimated at 2.3 per cent. In
services they are 2.8 per cent, a fall from the previous quarter. The CBI
estimates are corroborated by official figures showing recorded earnings
increases for September down to 3 per cent.
UK pay per unit of output is actually down on a year ago compared with 6 per
cent increases in both Japan and Germany. Only the US is increasing its
competitiveness more rapidly than the UK.
To cap it all, lower inflation has been accompanied - contrary to what might
be expected at this stage of the cycle - by falling unemployment. The number
out of work peaked in January at 10.6 per cent, and has since fallen by 0.4
percentage points, the fall now spreading for the first time to the
long-term jobless. The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, will be free to argue
in his Budget next week either that the economy is now doing so well he can
avoid a tax increase, or that it is strong enough to withstand such an
increase.
But having celebrated the good news, an economic analyst should want to dig
deeper. In particular, he should ask about the present upturn; is it
vigorous enough to reduce the gap between actual and potential output? Or is
it so feeble that the gap is getting larger and depression intensifying?
Official output figures still suggest the latter. Non-oil gross domestic
product rose by well under 2 per cent in the year to the third quarter of
1993. This is below the most conservative estimate of the growth of capacity
and fits in with the popular impression of a modest and patchy recovery.
How can this be reconciled with falling unemployment and rapidly rising
productivity? The most optimistic explanation is that the upturn is stronger
than realised. The pessimistic explanation is that productivity gains are
being overstated because of inadequate allowance, for instance, for the
increasing numbers of part-time workers.
It will be some time before there is enough data for a full explanation. The
fact that unused capacity, as measured by the CBI survey, is declining along
with unemployment, makes it look as if there is a genuine reduction in the
margin of slack.
The best guess is that the productivity of workers using existing capacity
is indeed increasing rapidly, but at the same time there is inadequate
capacity to support a true recovery. In other words, capacity shortages will
recur while there are still large resources of unused labour.
Some industrialists will want, in conjunction with the Labour party, to fix
the capacity problem by government hand-outs for investment, a 'business
plan for Britain' and so on. A more reflective person would look at the
inhibitions discouraging businessmen from extending capacity, as distinct
from just making it more cost saving.
The remedy probably lies in still more flexible labour markets, plus more
topping up of social security payments to workers of low earning capacity.
Low pay and some dole are better than no pay and no work.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NOEL CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on European high speed rail ('Next chapter of the railway
children', November 18) is a timely reminder of the social and environmental
arguments for an efficient integrated European railway system. By
implication it also highlights, sadly, the catalogue of failures -
technical, political and commercial - to come to grips with this issue in
the UK.
A view I have held for some time - and, judging from a limited poll, a not
too outrageous one either - would be to hand over British Rail to SNCF, the
French state rail system, in return for the French government handing over
Air France to British Airways. Both governments would get rid of an
unprofitable investment, would be able to claim a positive step towards
European integration, and, best of all, put these businesses into the hands
of those apparently better able to manage them.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: IMF rules for loans to Russia a
'cop-out'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFFREY D SACHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Odling-Smee's defence of the International Monetary Fund role
in Russia (Letters, November 17) includes three dubious propositions that,
taken together, help to account for the IMF's very limited achievements in
the former Soviet Union.
First, Mr Odling-Smee claims that the IMF staff are in 'close contact' with
Russia at this crucial juncture. In fact, aside from a couple of resident
representatives, there is no IMF team currently in Russia. The IMF work,
such as it is, is conducted by telephone from Washington, and by brief
fly-ins. When the IMF is actually ready to negotiate, it will insist on a
prior fact-finding mission that will absorb several weeks before the start
of actual negotiations. The Russians are thereby left without in-depth IMF
technical assistance in planning 1994 policies. Worse, under the IMF's
standard operating procedures, Russia will not see another IMF loan
disbursement for several months.
Second, Mr Odling-Smee takes it for granted that Russia's failure to
stabilise is proof that the IMF is right to withhold its lending. The IMF
simply cannot understand that by withholding its own loans at crucial
points, such as early 1992 and now, it gravely weakens the chances for
successful stabilisation. When a drowning man is 10 metres from shore, the
IMF throws a 5 metre lifeline, content that it has met the drowning man half
way.
Third, Mr Odling-Smee asserts that it will lend money when 'the Russian
authorities as a whole are in a position to commit themselves to and
implement, on a sustained basis, a strong adjustment programme'. This IMF
standard is a cop-out, and more often than not a bureaucratic excuse for
inaction. In a deep crisis, reformers can never prove ex ante that they are
in a position to sustain a strong programme; they win their reforms step by
step, with successes leading to further successes. This was true for Schacht
in 1923, Erhard in 1948, Salinas in 1989, Balcerowicz in 1990, and Cavallo
in 1991. The IMF must lend when the chances are good, not perfect,
recognising that its own loans can help to tilt the balance.
Mr Odling-Smee neglects the very reasons that make IMF negotiations in
Moscow so crucial at this juncture. Since the breakthrough to new elections,
the reformers have had a strong hand. They have eliminated all subsidised
credits; they have ended budget subsidies on agricultural procurement; they
have ended artificial write-offs of inter-enterprise arrears; they have
taken over control of credit policy from the wayward central bank; they have
instituted a bold land privatisation programme; and they have adopted a
tough monetary programme, that if combined with IMF funds, would limit money
growth to rates consistent with single-digit monthly inflation. The new
Russian fiscal year starts in six weeks, and Russia must therefore plan its
1994 programme now, not on the IMF's timetable. With pre-election polls
showing the reformers with a good chance to control the next parliament, the
chances for stabilisation would be good if there is adequate western
assistance.
Given that several weeks will be needed to conclude a loan agreement,
preparations should already be under way in Moscow. IMF funds could be
disbursed early in 1994 in the event the reformers triumph in the elections
and are able to launch a stabilisation programme at the start of the new
year. If conditions prove inauspicious, there will be opportunity enough to
hold back.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial agents will retain
advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was most interested in the article 'Agents lose jobs ahead of EU
laws' (November 15) summarising some of the difficulties for principals in
dealing with commercial agents after the new regulations come into force in
the UK on January 1 1994.
Like many law firms, we have been working on providing advice on the impact
of the regulations. In particular, I agree that companies should re-examine
the implications of using commercial agents and consider the alternative of
appointing distributors.
However I think it is important in making this assessment to recognise that
there are fundamental differences between commercial agents and distributors
which will have an impact upon this choice.
In particular, it is of course possible to set the price at which commercial
agents will sell goods on behalf of a principal. Distributors, on the other
hand, must be free to sell at whatever price they think appropriate. It
would be illegal under resale price maintenance laws to provide otherwise.
Other factors which need to be taken into account are the impact of general
competition law, which in the UK treats agents and distributors very
differently, and the credit worthiness of a distributor responsible for
buying and paying for goods in its own right.
The new agency rules will certainly make life more difficult for principals,
and in some ways remind one of the laws regulating employees. However agents
do have advantages and there are a number of factors which need to be
weighed in the balance before moving to distribution arrangements.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: Designs of a romantic hero - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a famous still from a movie of Gary Cooper standing in full profile
before a soaring skyscraper, looking firmly into the future. The
Fountainhead was made in 1949 from the novel by Ayn Rand, which sold five
million copies. Its hero was an architect, Howard Roark, a young genius who
pits his wits and skills against the conventions of the New York
establishment. Gary Cooper played the part to the hilt. The film, like much
of Ayn Rand's work, extols rugged individualism, powerful egoism and all
refusals to compromise. Her hero was probably based on the American
architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who certainly saw the architect's role as that
of the powerful, single-minded genius.
Sir Norman Foster is an architect who shares with the hero of The
Fountainhead that taciturn virility and confidence. His quiet conviction
that his designs are rational and logical is impressive. He is also
convinced that architecture is a product of individual genius and that
compromises are to be avoided. A visit to his London office reveals that,
while undoubtedly a top architect, he is also aware that posterity may see
him as a creative romantic - a man who tried to change the world.
In this year's Financial Times Architecture Award Sir Norman's office has
two runners in the shortlist: the University Library at Cranfield; and
Stansted Airport in Essex, which represent just a fraction of the work of
this international practice. In the pipeline there are a quite remarkable
number of major projects. The new Canary Wharf underground station will be
the best reason for the expansion of the Jubilee line, and the Imperial War
Museum exhibition hangar at Duxford will be a dazzling example of
appropriate technology. Then there are three new international headquarters
for major companies - Agiplan, Obunsha and Sanei; a new law library for the
Cambridge Institute of Criminology as well as the new Napp laboratories for
the same city; the new Commerzbank in Frankfurt; in Berlin the new
Reichstag; in Nimes the Carre D'art; in Frejus the new Lycee; in Rotterdam
the Marine Safety Simulator; in Neudorf the business promotion park; and in
Corsica a timber-framed house for a private client.
If the governor of Hong Kong can keep things on an even keel, Sir Norman's
design for the large new airport at Chep Lap Kok will be one of the finest
new airports in the world. In Valencia the design for the new conference
centre is well underway, and in the City of London the new offices at Tower
Place for Bowrings is currently in for planning consideration. Sir Norman
has been unafraid to add to a listed building  - a house in Chelsea designed
in the 1930s by Mendelsohn and Chermayeff - enhancing the original. In
Omaha, Nebraska his firm is adding a wing to the Joslyn Art Museum; and the
results are still awaited for the competition for a new gallery of Scottish
art in Glasgow.
The hero of The Fountainhead would have been amazed that one architect could
change so much of the world. Foster's office gives some clues. Visitors
enter and walk up a grand, gentle granite staircase and the office itself is
a young architect's dream. Beneath a high glass wall with amazing views of
the Thames are ranks of architects and technicians. Howard Roark would have
enjoyed this elevated position: you feel as though the team below could well
be drawing up designs for some great spaceship to take us all to the moon or
beyond.
For the best of Foster's work in the UK, go to Stansted Airport and then to
the Sainsbury Centre at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. The
extension to the Sainsbury Wing is a cool triumph. To enjoy Foster more
intimately, the Royal Academy's Sackler Galleries show how well he can fit
an older context.
It will be fascinating to see how Foster does in the FT Award on November
29. Meanwhile, he should be appointed designer of the new Tate Gallery
Museum of Modern Art, convert the Bankside Power Station into a home for
very contemporary art (like the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, in
warehouses converted by Frank Gehry), and build a gallery for modern art on
the Vauxhall site.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: A spectacular Perestroika - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Proust or Anthony Powell's sequence of novels, A Dance to the Music of
Time, Tony Kushner's epic play Angels in America is not something you should
begin in the middle. You should also remember the sub-title. This is A Gay
Fantasia on National Themes, not the history of America. Even so, there is a
lot of American history in this riveting seven-hour drama.
Part One, Millennium Approaches, opened on the Royal National Theatre's
Cottesloe stage in January last year, and was magnificent. It has now been
revived as splendidly as ever. It is accompanied by Part Two, Perestroika,
which initially at least is a disappointment. That is a view which one
rapidly revises as the play goes on. By the end, the whole of Angels in
America is a wonderful theatrical achievement.
One of the problems with Part Two, as Kushner admits, is that he thought of
the title before he wrote the piece. 'I had this wild-eyed notion that
Gorbachev was going to make the world a different place and bring about the
advent of democratic socialism,' he has said in an interview. The real
perestroika has not quite worked out like that, but Kushner kept the title
because Gorbachev claimed that his job was simply 'to make change
irreversible'.
Keeping the Soviet background leads to a strange opening. Perestroika begins
with a speech by the last surviving Bolshevik in the Kremlin in 1986. It is
delivered by Harry Towb, the same actor who starts Part One as an American
rabbi at an obscure funeral. Any attempt at parallelism between American and
Russian history is quickly abandoned. There are some later references to
Chernobyl (as reported to America by the World Service of the BBC) but for
the main we return to the original characters.
The surprise here is that the two principal victims of Aids in Millennium
Approaches are still alive. Indeed, apart from the Russian interlude, Part
Two picks up more or less where Part One left off. There is a trip to heaven
as Perestroika goes on, but it seems to be on a return ticket, and even at
the end one of the Aids sufferers survives with the hope of another five
years. No-one can say that Kushner is a pessimist: he even includes the New
World Symphony.
What do they do all the time? They talk, make love, fall out, then talk
again. Apart from the state of America, Angels has three main subjects. One
is Aids, another is Roy Cohn, an adviser to Senator McCarthy who died of the
disease in 1986, and the third is religion in general and Mormonism in
particular. The common thread is homosexuality.
The period is broadly the Reagan presidency, even if Cohn seems a throwback.
In the gay community, it is more of a shock that a young married Mormon
should admit to voting Republican than that he should be a closet gay. To
Americans, however, the biggest shock must have been the discovery of Cohn's
illness. Here was the most rabid right-winger of the lot, claiming to have
been responsible for sending the Rosenbergs to the electric chair, exposed
as a homosexual with a disease that had then scarcely been identified. He
threatened to sue his doctor if he diagnosed anything more than cancer of
the liver.
Cohn is magnificently played in both parts by David Schofield. The young
Mormon who has no difficulty in sleeping with him is Daniel Craig. But this
is a complex set of relationships, almost as if several plays were going at
once. At the heart of it is the affair between Prior Walter (Stephen
Dillane) and Louis ('my friends call me Louise'), the lover played by Jason
Isaacs, who abandons Walter when the latter's Aids is discovered. The scene
at the end of Part One where they waltz together is almost unbearably
moving.
Few of the lovers are monogamous. A gay black nurse called Belize (Joseph
Mydell) shows how easy it is to come and go. There are also sub-strands
involving the Mormon's pill-popping wife and mother. All of these parts are
superbly acted.
Yet it is not really the subject that makes Angels work. It is the nature of
the dialogue and the quick shifting from one scene to another. Kushner is a
master of one-liners, moving from quotations from Shakespeare to popular
songs within the same sentence. Even in the most intense episodes, there is
a burst of wit. The staging of some of the set pieces is spectacular. Note
the smart restaurant scene when Cohn is trying to persuade his Mormon friend
to commit perjury, and a similar scene at a bar. The immaculate direction is
by Declan Donnellan and the design by Nick Ormerod.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: Intelligent Lohengrin melds potent myths - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Opera's new Lohengrin is the company's first since 1971.
The work is hard to bring off: an amply proportioned Grand Opera fairy-tale
about the eternal battle between Good and Evil beneath whose surface Wagner
has melded several potent myths dealing with the role of the artist in
society, the relationship of the sexes and (viewed through Freudian eyes)
the development of the individual psyche.
I suspect that now it is harder to bring off than ever, in a
feminism-influenced age suspicious of notions of Elsa-like feminine
innocence and Lohengrin-like spotless chivalry, a television-dominated age
out of tune with musical spaciousness and steady-paced unfolding ' and
vocally a post-heroic age widely deprived of the type of Wagner voices
(broad-spanning, truly mettled, pure and shining of timbre) on which so much
of the opera's peculiar atmosphere depends.
So the notable success of this new production lies in its nice balance -
simplicity and many-sidedness in the dramatic handling, a precise musical
flow established by the conductor, Mark Elder, which enables the drama to
work up a powerful, impressive, long-lingering resonance. This achievement
is more than the sum of its parts, as probably an ENO Lohengrin is always
likely to be: the orchestral playing and choral singing solid and finely
prepared but lacking the last ounces of radiance; the casting more on
'house' than international considerations; the finish of design made perhaps
even plainer than intended by economic stringency - here and there one
senses that an extra Pounds 10,000 added to the budget would have come in
mighty useful.
And yet in the first two acts of Saturday's opening performance there was no
doubt that the experience was taking strong hold (I have not encountered the
Coliseum stalls in such quiet, concentrated form for a long while). Act 3
began with a functional glitch during which the movement of curtains - a key
feature of Hildegard Bechtler's set design - seemed briefly possessed by the
spirit of Disney's Fantasia; the mood was unsettled for a while afterwards,
on stage as well as in the audience, and no doubt later evenings will
proceed more serenely.
Even then, however, the spare intelligence of Tim Albery's production still
exerted itself in multifarious fascinating ways. In line with the best of
this remarkable director's work - the recent Opera North Don Carlos, say, or
ENO Budd and Grimes - the modernity of the vision is remarkably
unprescriptive. The setting, with its economical yet architecturally
forceful outlines evocative of stony, sculptured texture, bold restriction
of colour, sensitive gradation of light (by Jean Kalman, a master of his
craft), and controlled massed groupings, permits response on many levels -
ancient and modern, 'mythic' and analytic, narratively straightforward and
psychologically probing.
The simpler pleasures of the opera are not scorned: the slow build-up of
tableaux, episodic pictorialism, romantic alternations of light and dark.
(There's even a real dove.) Neither are the thought-provoking ambiguities:
the choreographic embodiment of the swan and final resurrection of Elsa's
young brother show as much. The treatment of the main characters is as
reverberant as the experience of the principals will allow: which means that
the Ortrud of Linda Finnie, the most significant Wagnerian performer on
stage, accrues a controlled stillness and depth unmatched elsewhere.
This is not Lohengrin as postmodernist lecture-demonstration, but its
qualities encourage the audience-member to come to grips with the work in
all its rich and problematic aspects. Without Mr Elder, who has matured into
a Wagner conductor of genuine and palpable authority, one suspects that the
grip would have to be comprehensively loosened. Nothing in the shaping or
pacing of the work drew attention to itself; equally, nothing dragged or
sagged. The transitional middle-point of the middle act, a perilous moment
of possible Lohengrin tedium, was sustained as firmly as the previous
Elsa-Ortrud encounter had been.
All that the evening lacked was real beauty, and follow-through, of singing.
The Lohengrin, Elsa and King - John Keyes, Linda McLeod, Michael Druiett -
are all young singers of considerable Wagnerian potential and no less
considerable patchiness of technique; one longs for a Reginald Goodall to
arrive swan-borne on the scene and coach them into a more complete state of
'finish'. Miss Finnie's powerful mezzo is exercised to its limits: the
effect is dangerous, but in the event thrilling.
Malcolm Donnelly's Telramund is sound workaday, Christopher Booth-Jones's
Herald admirable. The clear, sensible new translation by Amanda Holden adds
greatly to the vividness of the performance, although a handful of betises
'from whence', indeed]' remain to be sorted out.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: Early Mozart
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The season marking Opera North's 15th year of existence continues, somewhat
uncertainly, with a new production of Il re pastore (1775), the rare,
slender, beautiful chamber opera - properly a dramatic serenata - of
Mozart's late teenage. Measured by the company's own standards the show is a
disappointing case of internal imbalance: decently played and sung (in
certain instances rather more than that), feebly and trivially staged.
The excuse may be that it was got up as a last-minute replacement for the
Eugene Onegin which Opera North decided not to borrow from Welsh National
Opera (quite wisely, in my view: that was feebleness and triviality on a
much grander scale). The intended Tatyana, Joan Rodgers, and Olga, Patricia
Bardon, have gone into the Re pastore cast; the remaining three members of
the quintet, freshly engaged, are useful Mozartians and it is the fault of
neither the singers, nor the English Northern Philharmonia under Paul
Daniel, nor indeed the cleanly singable new translation by Amanda Holden,
that at moments the first of the work's two acts comes close to a write-off.
In his 19th year Mozart was already an international veteran of
opera-composition, but he was back in Salzburg and opportunities to write
operas were painfully scarce. He longed to do so, as letters attest; and
when this one came his way - a piece d'occasion on an already much-set text
by Metastasio, the Habsburg court poet - he seized it to produce music of a
progressively deepening warmth that lifts the experience far above pastoral
politeness. At its heart is the aria 'L'amero, saro costante', a reverie for
the twined voices of the soprano-castrato hero and solo violin as raptly
tender as anything he ever wrote.
Depth and warmth the work may possess, in abundance, but it is still
essentially an exercise in style - the high court style - which in any
modern revival needs either careful re-creation or else stringent
reassessment. Jejune coyness of the sort the Opera North director, David
McVicar (also designer, in tandem with Frank Higgins), foists on the
serenata structure is fatal.
During the overture, puppets prance larkily on the bottom edge of the
front-cloth, blocking out any possibility of actual listening to the music;
the whoops-a-daisy treatment of the shepherd and shepherdess hero and
heroine, attended by five cute child figurants, is in the same vein. In the
second act, as weightier emotions shade the situations, the stage action
becomes less footling, but by then the damage is done.
At least, though, there is the ineffably delicate, fine-grained Joan Rodgers
in the title role - on Thursday the pure line of her lower notes sounded a
touch sullied (by a cold, I guess), but excellent technique left her mastery
of Mozart style unscathed. Mary Hegarty as the shepherdess Elisa, though a
less careful vocalist, beams out a ray of sunlight with her bright, sweet,
unforced tones.
The two tenors, Martyn Hill and Philip Salmon, cover skilfully their passing
moments of dryness; Patricia Bardon's rich mezzo is too weighty for Mozart's
seconda donna soprano role. Daniel's conducting tends to bustle the early
stages of the work along - with this production unfolding before his eyes,
who can blame him? There-after the balance between Mozartian energy and
Mozartian grace is more securely held.

FT  22 NOV 93 / People: Germans' turn at Europay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kurt Richolt, who was dismissed from the board of Commerzbank in May, is to
be the new chairman of Europay International, the Brussels-based group
formed last year by the merger of Eurocard and eurocheque, writes Katharine
Campbell.
Richolt, 54, will chair the board which is comprised of senior executives
from 17 member countries including eastern Europe. It is effectively a
non-executive role and he will work on average a little more than one day a
week.
He replaces Bernard van Eldik, a 64-year-old Dutchman who played a leading
role in the Eurocard/eurocheque merger completed in September 1992. The
organisation, whose biggest competitor is Visa International, claims to be
the biggest card group in Europe with 80m cardholders.
Europay's secretary general Mark Van Wauwe explains that with a British
chief executive, Ron Williams, and a previous Dutch chairman, it was felt
that the Germans, who have three seats on the 25-strong board, were due a
turn.
In an unusual move, Richolt, who had been on the board of Commerzbank since
1982, was dismissed after Germany's third largest bank made provisions of
DM300m as a result of the collapse of the Danish insurance company Hafnia.
The last time a board member of one of the big German banks was dismissed is
believed to have been 1980.
Van Wauwe highlights Richolt's varied international experience as well as
his grasp of English, Spanish and French. 'He has been selected and his
appointment has been agreed by the whole German banking community,' he adds.
The three Germans on the board come from Hypo Bank, the savings and the
co-operative banking associations.
While Van Wauwe contends that it was 'the unions' who insisted on Richolt's
departure, Commerzbank says it was the decision of the whole supervisory
board. Although the bank lost sizeable sums in lending to the likes of
Olympia &amp; York, it was decided to establish accountability in the Hafnia
case because of the size of the exposure to a company that was not a
worldwide industry leader. Richolt was the board member with area
responsibility for Scandinavia.

FT  22 NOV 93 / People: Cash, debt and worry beads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's central bank governor, Efthymios Christodoulou, bowed out at the
weekend in response to pressures from the recently elected socialist
government, writes Kerin Hope. The socialists had been expected to sack him
because of his close connections with the opposition New Democracy party,
but, even so, the timing of his resignation was a surprise.
His presence at the Bank of Greece was seen as a guarantee that exchange
rate policy would be stable while the socialists worked out ways to tackle
economic problems.
The favourite to take over is Ioannis Boutos, a former economy minister
close to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.
The socialists, meanwhile, have persuaded Nikos Kyriazides, a former IMF
executive director, to come out of retirement for the newly created job of
debt manager at the Finance Ministry. Greece's domestic debt, now over 120
per cent of GDP, is ballooning to Latin American proportions.
Kyriazides, 66, former deputy governor of the Bank of Greece, should be the
right man. At the IMF, he had much to do with debt restructurings for
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. And when it comes to talking to the European
Commission, he can draw on experience as chief Greek negotiator in the
run-up to Greece joining the Community.
Kyriazides, one of the few Greek bankers who flips a string of worry beads
while he talks, sounds confident he can find a way to restructure part of
the Dr5,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) owed by the government to Greece's commercial
banks that will get EU approval. But he is leaving nothing to chance. His
worry beads are blue, the colour that in Greek eyes brings good luck.

FT  22 NOV 93 / People: UAP's chairman - a very strong taste for
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few better connected businessmen in France than Jacques Friedmann,
the newly-appointed head of Union des Assurances de Paris, the country's
largest insurer and one of the stars on the government's privatisation list.
The UAP chairman has the ear of the two most powerful political figures in
France - he is a childhood friend of Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist
RPR party and a front-runner to be the next president, and a trusted adviser
to prime minister Edouard Balladur. This is largely the reason for his
appointment.
Although regarded as a shrewd manager while he was head of Air France
between 1987 and 1988 and at previous posts such as his chairmanship of the
Compagnie Generale de Maritime, he has never worked in insurance. At 61, he
may have little taste for the intricacies of premiums, risk analysis and
reinsurance. Day-to-day management tasks could therefore fall to Didier
Pfeiffer, the respected number two at UAP.
But Friedmann does have a taste, a very strong taste, for privatisation. As
adviser to Chirac when the latter was prime minister in 1986-88, he helped
draw up the government's privatisation programme. When Balladur and the
right returned to power in March, he found himself performing the same
function, albeit on a bigger scale.
His close links with the top Gaullist politicians will make him a central
figure in French industrial policy and the execution of the state's plans to
sell 21 publicly-owned groups.
His first task will be to see to the privatisation of UAP itself. He
inherits a company in fairly good shape following the effective management
of his predecessor, Jean Peyrelevade.
In October, Peyrelevade concluded a long-running dispute with Suez, the
industrial and financial holding company, which gave UAP control of Colonia,
the German insurer.
Shortly afterwards, UAP announced first half profits of FFr1.09bn (Pounds
120m), a rise of 15 per cent over the first six months of 1992, and evidence
that the company is on the road to recovery after a dismal performance last
year.
With its results on the mend, privatisation of UAP is expected to take place
in the first half of next year.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Kirkham bearded in his den: Lucy Kellaway talks to the sofa
salesman whose company, DFS, floats this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Kirkham, an unknown sofa salesman from Yorkshire, has made nearly
Pounds 300 million but is not satisfied. His fortune is larger than the
reputed piles of the Forte and Weinstock families put together and three
times as big as Charles Saatchi's. Yet his sights are pitched higher still.
'I've got this burning desire,' he says. 'I'm not happy to be a
multi-millionaire. I hear this talk of billionaires . . .'
On Wednesday his life's work, DFS Furniture Company, joins the stockmarket.
That day Kirkham will be in his office in Doncaster at 7.30 am as usual
having made Pounds 130m from the sale of half the company. The flurry of
publicity over, it will be back to the hard graft of making still more
money.
The scale of his ambition has left his advisers gasping. 'Genuinely
ambitious people are rare,' one says. 'Some end up as dictators. Some go
into business. He is the most complete example of the latter type I have
ever met.'
Two months ago few people south of Watford had heard of Graham Kirkham.
Peers in the furniture trade like Derek Hunt of MFI have never clapped eyes
on him.
Out of nowhere this businessman has become the City's latest darling. The
raging ambition is hidden under a bluff and modest manner; he comes across
as the chubby, cheerful chappie. Analysts enthuse about his plain-speaking
Yorkshire charm, his hard work, and the strength of his business.
Outsiders might wonder at their reaction. The City has seen many
entrepreneurs come and go. Retailers in particular have a habit of making a
fortune only to lose a large part of it, witness Gerald Ratner, Sir Terence
Conran and George Davies.
Moreover, the DFS prospectus contains some eyebrow-raising details: Kirkham
has withdrawn Pounds 13m from the company before flotation, of which Pounds
5.5m was paid in the form of works of art and antiques as a crafty piece of
tax avoidance. The company's merchandise manager has several times been
convicted for drunken driving; more recently he has been charged with
driving when disqualified and refusing to be breathalysed. And finally, as
Kirkham is raising no new money for the business, it has to be asked why he
is taking the company public at all.
'I went along to the analysts' meeting very cynical expecting to hear all
sorts of bullshit but was pleasantly surprised,' says Katherine Wynne of
Kleinwort Benson. Kirkham, she points out, is different from the giddy
entrepreneurs of the 1980s. Many of them, John Ashworth at Coloroll for
example, came and went in a matter of years but Kirkham has built up a
business slowly over a quarter of a century.
Meeting this multi-multi-millionaire is a disarming experience. He talks
directly, banter marred only by incessant assertions of his own high moral
sense. 'The one person I am accountable to is me. If I can satisfy myself I
can satisfy everyone else,' he says. According to his own ethical code there
was nothing wrong with paying himself a tax-efficient fortune before the
flotation - he sought and followed the best professional advice.
When it comes to the merchandise manager and his drinking habits, Kirkham
asserts: 'I care about people so much it hurts. We will support him as much
as possible. I look at the work he's done for the company for the last 19
years. We employ human beings.'
Kirkham was born in the little town of Edlington, the only son of a miner.
He was a good boy: went to Sunday school, sang in the choir and learnt to be
'humble but proper. I was taught not to tell lies, to stand up in buses and
to say thank you'.
He failed all his O levels, failed to get into the RAF, and suddenly decided
to buckle down. He became a sofa salesman, at which he says he was only 'run
of the mill'. Frustrated then at the lack of prospects, he set up his own
company, without any capital, in a disused billiard hall, making sofas
upstairs and selling them downstairs. Then 23, with a mortgage and two small
children, he was quite unbothered by risk: 'If people don't contemplate
failure, that is a good reason for them to succeed.'
He built up the business steadily, opening out-of-town furniture stores and
reinvesting all profits. He believes in hard work; he never takes more than
a week or two holiday a year, and neither does any of his top management.
His own optimism and drive are obvious; he prides himself on being able to
make others feel the same way. 'People who have the germ are set alight by
my own enthusiasm,' he says. His city advisers, whom Kirkham initially
thought had never done a day's work in their lives, were shattered by the
experience of floating the company. 'It was tiring working with him. He has
so much energy,' says one.
Yet the explanation of how this energetic and ordinary bloke came to build a
business worth Pounds 300m is elusive. Kirkham reckons there is no single
secret to his success: 'I always say our margins of 16 per cent are made up
of 64 quarters of one per cent.'
Among these 64 little bits is the fact that the boss understands every
aspect of his business. He has also formed close and longstanding
relationships with his suppliers, and has been clever with his marketing.
When he opens a new store he sends a personalinvitation to well off
potential customers offering them a discount. Viewers of Central and
Yorkshire TV can hardly tune in without seeing one of his settees.
Whatever the reasons for his success, Kirkham may find he needs new skills
as the boss of a public company. Suppliers speculate that his style will
have to change under the beady eye of shareholders and non-executive
directors. 'Make no mistake this has been run as Kirkham's company. No one
makes the decisions except him,' says one.
Fewer changes are likely to his lifestyle as a result of his Pounds 130m
cheque. He already has more money than he knows what to do with - he owns a
Georgian mansion and has a serious art collection. He makes the astonishing
claim that he has no plans for disposing of the new millions. 'I've really
not given it any thought,' he says.
So if neither he nor his company needs the money, why should he voluntarily
cramp his style just to list the shares? Kirkham argues that as his children
do not want to go into the business, flotation 'just seems appropriate'. I
remind him that Richard Branson and Alan Sugar regretted going public. He
starts to say that Branson and Sugar are just two of hundreds of others. He
stops and changes his tack. 'Those two guys have got beards and I haven't'

FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: What about the carpet colour? - Mick Newmarch,
chief executive of the Prudential Corporation, offers advice on how to move
head office / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICK NEWMARCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having emerged only recently from a daunting array of storage crates, I am
now free to assess the Prudential's recent move and to offer some advice for
those contemplating a similar step.
The corporation left its ancestral home, 142 Holborn Bars, London, in 1988
in anticipation that the building would re-emerge, after restoration and
modernisation, stripped of its more arcane features but retaining its Gothic
fenestrated charm and tradition. Despite many false dawns, we have not been
disappointed. We have returned and have been on the site for all of eight
weeks.
A successful move is built upon a monument of planning activity. Equally
true, as we have learnt, this monument must be constructed like a piece of
Lego, so that as expectations change or deadlines shift it can be quickly
reassembled in a different configuration.
Our planning process was based upon a top-level committee, myself included,
which contemplated an enormous variety of seriously important decisions
ranging from the colour of the carpet to the shape of the dining chairs and
the location of the coffee machines.
The committee was served by a professional project manager with the backing
of a full-time team. However mundane each small decision may appear,
co-ordinating them is a task to rank with re-designing the space shuttle for
complexity.
It quickly became apparent to us that a pint of Prudential employees in 1988
equalled a substantial quart in 1993 owing to the growth in the business. I
believe this is an inevitable feature of any move: the space is never quite
as intended nor the numbers quite as anticipated.
As a result, we took the opportunity to harness the talents and energies of
our employees in adapting our working styles and developing ingenious
responses to the problems presented by our new environment. Each area had
its own move co-ordinator who added the seasoning of commercial realism
required to the plans for their own space.
Clearly, a move on this scale risked dislocating our business operations
completely. We could scarcely close down our investment operations for a day
to move the furniture or tell our customers their maturity cheques must wait
until we found the crate containing the file.
Hence the move was staggered over three weekends and handled entirely by
professional movers. As a result, everything in sight was labelled, to the
point where I wondered if I might be date-stamped and tied up with sticky
tape for the duration. This was time-consuming, required discipline, but was
extremely worthwhile.
We also took care to consider the sense of well-being of the staff, many of
whom had never worked in the old building or in the 'foreign' territory of
Holborn. We provided maps and guides and a personal welcome pack tailored
for each person. An army marches on its belly so we provided free sandwiches
to maintain blood sugar levels.
For us, the most positive catalyst to a successful move was the prospect of
a visit from the Queen to open the building, only two weeks after our
arrival. This galvanised the otherwise jaded into bursts of vacuuming,
tidying and urgent activity to control our errant fire alarms.
Finally, it is worth remembering that however detailed the plans, some
elements will inevitably escape, just as some carefully chosen furniture
will look uncomfortable in its new home and no one understands how the waste
bins came to be that perplexing shape.
I am looking forward to the day when we at last locate the keys to the
monstrous, but impressive safe in my office, to allow exploration of its
contents, untouched since 1988, or even before. I feel, however, a genuine
sense of rejuvenation in our new environment: the move for us has been a
positive and co-operative opportunity. I encourage others to look on theirs
in the same light.
Next Monday: Sir David Plastow of Inchcape on how to plan for board
succession.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: Christmas crackers - Jean-Louis Barsoux says the
office party is a logical absurdity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN-LOUIS BARSOUX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why does the Christmas office party generate so many funny stories, so much
corporate jokelore? The answer is that it has privileged status. Directors
and senior executives are so afraid of laying themselves open to the
miserable tag 'Scrooge', that they will put up with behaviour from employees
that would warrant instant dismissal at any other time of year.
Often described as an occasion when anything goes, there are breaches of
acceptable behaviour and deportment which would normally shake the very
foundations of the organisation. The Christmas 'do' provides an annual
catharsis for the passions and paranoias that lie just below the surface of
everyday office life. No corporate principle is left unturned.
Business logic: companies are built on an ethos of thrift, logic and
constraint. This is in marked contrast to the over-indulgence, recklessness
and lack of control of the office party. Seasonal largesse is expected from
the company - but such extravagance can seem indulgent in times of economic
stringency. So clients and suppliers are rarely invited; to do so might
simply re-enforce their contempt for the company.
There is also a reversal in the customary respect for company property. The
office and its immaculate furniture is converted into something resembling a
Marseilles dock-side dive. Party-goers push desks together, climb on them,
dance on them. They spill drinks and stub out cigarettes on the carpets.
Status considerations: initially, the status quo prevails. Senior figures
may seem a little stand-offish until they are sufficiently tanked up to
mingle. Easy access to the boss at first guarantees a large crowd, but
executive awe evaporates proportionately as wine and inadmissible desires
take hold. The acolytes drift away from the once-compelling centrifugal
figure. A new hierarchy emerges, built on charm and entertainment value.
The group may then exercise collective pressure in getting the boss to don a
paper hat and perhaps perform some embarrassing party piece. The boss will
self-consciously oblige for fear of being labelled a party pooper - and may
well over-compensate on the clowning in an attempt to establish street
credibility.
Loss of dignity is but the first casualty of the evening.
Physical restraint: normally demure people shout hoarsely over the blaring
music; those usually so aware of their body boundaries are suddenly given to
extravagant semaphore; physical uprightness turns into slouching, into
sitting on floors, then into lurching, sprawling and fumbling. Rational
behaviour gives way to drunken exhibitionism. Colleagues, who would never
usually lay a finger on one another, slap each others' backs and hug one
another shamelessly. This is no place for the sober or the dutiful. Sexual
decorum: normal rules applying to office encounters are suspended as excuses
for contact are proffered: loud music requires close proximity of
conversationalists, dancing may ensue, the bright strip lights are
extinguished and sprigs of mistletoe materialise.
The everyday concentration of people in typing pools, shop floors, and
open-plan offices is subverted as individuals seek out the building's nooks
and crannies; temporary elopers cavort in store cupboards or computer rooms
and find novel uses for photocopiers.
Interpersonal harmony: as the evening draws on, the enforced bonhomie may be
interrupted by sporadic outbreaks of conflict. The seasoned campaigner vents
his pent-up frustration at being passed over for promotion in favour of a
young high-flyer with a thinly veiled joke, an insult, an emptied wine glass
or even a scuffle.
Not only is this yearly debauchery alien to the day-to-day idea of
acceptable behaviour at work, it is also in contrast with Christmas in the
domestic setting. Spiritual aspects of the season give way to one long round
of grope, gossip and gripe. Christmas in the workplace owes more to the
pagan Viking fertility rites of Yuletide than to Christianity.
All this makes one wonder why companies persist in holding office parties.
They are probably responsible for more distress and agonising, more
resignations and damaged job prospects, than any other single event in the
corporate calendar. They are psychological minefields, viewed by staff with
a mixture of excitement and dread.
Yet the truth is that many people derive a morbid enjoyment from grotesque
self-revelation and unwise acts, even those that end in squalor, violence or
regret. Twelve months, it seems, is long enough for selective amnesia to set
in and for everyone to take their chances, once again, on the rollercoaster
of merriment and disaster.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: Quality yardsticks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What criteria should be used for judging good, quality managers? It ought to
be a routine question for organisers of the many UK business award schemes,
but too often it is not properly addressed.
Tomorrow, however, management awards will be made at a lunch in London,
based on the qualities which three separate audiences - main board directors
of the top 500 UK companies, fund managers and City and business editors -
consider important for generating sustainable growth.
The exercise was kicked off by Sundridge Park, a corporate development
practice in the PA Consulting Group, which defined 18 criteria identified
through close observation of well-managed organisations. These criteria were
then put to a representative sample of the three groups, which were each
asked to select their top five.
Significantly, strategic thinking came out ahead of the others in all three
surveys, with leadership second in all three.
At that point the consensus cracked, fund managers and City editors
emphasising the importance of external yardsticks such as investment
planning and research and development, while the industrial leaders
preferred people and team development. Innovation, however, was somewhere in
everybody's top five.
Of those currently low on the list, Sundridge Park believes career
management will move up the corporate agenda in the next few years. The onus
in future, however, will rest more on the individual than the company, with
the latter playing a mainly supportive role.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: American strike brings chaos to US
airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strike by flight attendants at American Airlines enters its second week
today with unions and management no nearer agreement, and thousands of
flights still delayed or cancelled because of the industrial action, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
Yesterday Mr Robert Crandall, chief executive of American, the largest US
carrier, estimated that this week nearly half the airline's scheduled
flights would leave with passengers. Until now, many flights have been
cancelled or have left without passengers because of lack of attendants. The
percentage of flights leaving on schedule would be higher at its hub
airports, which include Dallas-Forth Worth, Chicago and Miami.
American also claimed a growing number of attendants were returning to work,
but the attendants' union said 95 per cent of its members were still on
strike. The strike, which is due to continue until the end of this week, has
stranded thousands of passengers. Competing airlines, including Continental,
Delta and Northwest, have scheduled extra domestic flights and said they
will honour any valid ticket endorsed by American. On international flights,
British Airways, and Virgin have also said they will honour endorsed
American tickets. POLAND: Flights between London and Warsaw are still
heavily disrupted by the dispute between the British and Polish governments
over landing rights. British Airways has been banned from flying to Warsaw,
while Polish Airlines has been denied access to Heathrow. BA is flying
passengers to Frankfurt and then bussing them to Warsaw.
SPAIN: A national strike planned for Thursday could severly disrupt travel.
BELGIUM: On Friday Belgian unions are threating a national strike in protest
at the government's austerity plan.
FRANCE: Public sector unions plan further strikes against privatisation
plans.
NIGERIA: The situation is very tense following the announcement of a
military government, the dissolution of all democratic institutions and the
banning of all political parties. Non-essential visits should be postponed.
An indefinite national strike is disrupting business and services, internal
travel and international flights. Industrial action might escalate to
rioting, especially in the south west. Residents should exercise caution.
There is a high incidence of street crime and armed robberies, especially in
Lagos and the south. Travelling outside cities after dark is unsafe.
Fraud is commonplace. Business people should check credentials of Nigerian
contacts thoroughly. Those in doubt should consult the Department of Trade
and Industry (Nigerian Desk, tel: 071-215-4966).
MEXICO: Robbery in Mexico City and other major urban areas is commonplace.
There is particular risk on the metro (underground) and around bus stations.
Only official airport taxis should be used. Take special care when using
taxis late at night.
Because of incidents of robbery, visitors are advised that excepting travel
on first class buses on the 'Cuota' highways, it is unsafe to travel on
roads outside major cities at night, and on the following roads at any time:
coast road between Acapulco and Puerto Escondido
Highway 37 from Uruapan to Playa Azul (Particularly in the State of
Guerrero)
Highway 51 from Zitacuaro to Huetamo in Michoacan
roads in the Yucatan Peninsula, especially Route 180 from Merida to Campeche
and Route 186 from Chetumal to Villahermosa. Avoid isolated beaches
(Particularly around Puerto Escondido).
GUINEA: Tension remains high in the run-up to December 5 presidential
elections. No reports of violence in or around Conakry since disturbances in
October, but caution advised. Additional information from Travel Advice
Unit, Consular Department, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Clive House,

FT  22 NOV 93 / Opera conductors, oui bus conductors, non: Michael Skapinker
tests the new airport bus in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris has its own way of adding to the
disorientation of a traveller arriving in an unfamiliar city.
Getting to the city centre by rail involves a ride first on an airport bus
to the nearby RER suburban railway station. Then follows a battle to figure
out how the RER connects with the Metro underground system, for French
railway maps lack the clean-lined simplicity of their UK counterparts.
Hence the attraction of the new Roissy Bus service from the airport to the
Paris Opera in the centre of the city.
The advantage of this service, which leaves the airport every 15 minutes, is
that you use only one mode of transport. At FFr30 each way, it also costs
less than taking a taxi.
However, the experience of a recent one-day trip to Paris from London
suggests that the bus is best avoided. The vagaries of the city's traffic
make the service too unreliable for anyone with appointments to keep and
flights to catch.
My journey from Charles de Gaulle began at 11.35am. Despite repeated
warnings of imminent traffic snarl-ups on lighted signs above the motorway,
the bus kept moving. The only incident was a near collision with a car -
shrugged off by both parties without any swearing or hooting. We arrived at
the Opera at 12.18 pm - total journey time 43 minutes.
The relatively painless ride resulted in a decision to take the bus back to
the airport, leaving the Opera at 6pm. With a British Airways flight back to
London at 7.30pm, it was cutting it a little fine, but I assumed there would
be less traffic on the way back than there had been at mid-day on my way in.
This was a mistake. The traffic leaving the city was so heavy that I finally
arrived at the airport at 7.15pm - tight for time and only just able to get
on to the flight.
So it will be back to the railway in future. The same journey by RER and
Metro costs FFr39.50 and should take about 40 minutes.
Understanding that system may requires a little concentration but it has the
advantage of being reliable - provided no industrial action is taking place.

FT  22 NOV 93 / In park with Madonna: Joggers' guide - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON MUNRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most business travellers to New York, fighting the locals for pavement
space is the only exercise they ever get.
In such a crowded, noisy place, who could imagine jogging, or even taking a
leisurely walk? However, New York offers jogging and walking routes with
ample breathing space.
When they want the solitude of woods and water, New York runners head for
Central Park, the leafy, 843-acre urban sanctuary opened in 1876. The park's
department says it has the city's lowest crime rate. But it recommends
runners avoid the park at night and run with a partner if possible.
One of the most popular routes in the park is a 1.6-mile gravel track around
the Reservoir, the largest body of water in Manhattan. The access point is
at 90th St. and Fifth Ave. The reservoir offers mallard on the water and
occasional appearances by such celebrity exercisers as Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis and Madonna.
For a longer course, there is Central Park's auto loop - six miles of
hard-surface road closed to traffic on weekends. The auto loop bypasses
great expanses of woods and lawns, including one near West 72nd St called
Strawberry Fields, which is dedicated to the memory of John Lennon.
A run in Central Park takes you past many Victorian-era architectural gems.
One is Belvedere Castle, built in 1872 of the same stone that is found
thrusting dramatically out of much of the parks' landscape. With Norman,
Gothic and Moorish features, it overlooks the Great Lawn's softball fields.
Other popular access points to Central Park are at its south-east entry
(Fifth Ave and 60th St) and south-west corner (Columbus circle).
In the thick of Broadway traffic, it might be hard to remember that New York
is an island. But a refreshing jog along some of the city's waterfront
promenades will quickly set you straight. Skirting the Hudson River, the
one-and-a- half-mile-long Battery Park City Esplanade begins at the downtown
intersections of Chambers and West Streets.
It continues south almost to Battery Park and the tip of lower Manhattan.
The route takes you past the World Financial Center and the North Cove Yacht
Harbor. The Hudson kicks up stiff breezes. These are cooling in summer but
blood-chilling in winter.
On the east side of Manhattan, the East River Esplanade offers a three-mile
course, from 63rd St, north to 125th St. On the left, cars whiz by on the
FDR Drive. But there are more tranquil sights, such as Gracie Mansion in
Carl Schurz Park. Built as a country manor house in 1779 by wealthy merchant
Archibald Gracie, it is now the official home of the city's mayor.
Many New York hotels offer advice on the best running routes. The
Ritz-Carlton, on Central Park South, distributes maps to its guests that
detail three routes of varying length. The maps also list emergency
telephone aid numbers.
For more information on running in New York, contact the New York Road
Runners Club, at (212) 860-4455.

FT  22 NOV 93 / How to win from the winter war / A look at special deals
aimed at wooing customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airlines desperate for business passengers to fill their aircraft in the
slack winter season are vying with each other to offer the most attractive
deals.
Across Europe, airlines are wooing their most lucrative clients, the
business executives, with special offers. German and UK residents,
especially, are on the receiving end of the best prizes, ranging from price
cuts to free flights and overnight stays in luxury hotels.
The airlines' main weapon is the 'frequent flyer' programme. When taking
flights, members of programmes earn points which can be redeemed for items
such as free tickets or upgrades to business class.
Anyone can join an airline's frequent-flyer programme and there is no reason
why someone should not join several. In the UK, British Airways' 'Dream
Ticket' promotion has the highest profile. But behind the hype this is
simply a promise to double the number of points collected for a flight taken
before the end of March. This means that one business-class return to New
York would earn enough points for an economy return to Athens. In the
summer, it would have taken two such flights. As always with UK residents
flying with BA, the deal only applies for first, business and full-fare
economy tickets.
Many business travellers buy discounted tickets: in this case, US carriers
such as American Airlines and United Airlines offer a better deal. Their
double-points offer, for UK residents only, applies for virtually any fare
available. On short-haul flights, British Midland also gives awards to
buyers of economy-class tickets.
For those living in Germany, this will seem tame stuff. BA and American
Airlines will triple the points earned by German residents over the next few
months. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based carrier, is offering enough
points with one business-class return to the Far East between now and the
end of December for a free business-class ticket within Europe on Austrian
Airlines or Swissair.
The desperation to attract German passengers may be because of the depth of
the country's recession. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of
Paris-based travel agency Wagon-Lits, says that for the first time airlines
are selling seats at less than published prices in Germany.
Danish residents, too, can find discounted tickets: business-class fares on
Scandinavian Airline System on some short-haul routes have been cut by 30
per cent. SAS is also offering business-class passengers starting from the
UK a free overnight stay in a Scandinavian hotel, provided the trip is made
before the end of March. Alitalia has a similar scheme for flights from
Italy to London before December 31. Business-class passengers get a free
night in a London hotel.
This is only a selection of the deals on offer. And the tide of special
deals is unlikely to ebb until spring. There is still a recession in the
airline industry and over-capacity is widespread. That combination in recent
years has meant fringe benefits and cost savings improve through the season.
If - like a quarter of Europe's business air travellers according to a
recent survey - your choice of carrier is determined by awards of
frequent-flyer points, winter is a chance to push up your total quickly.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Court rules BCCI plan unfair to creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International would
have been unfairly discriminated against in proposals between the
liquidators to the bank and the government of Abu Dhabi, its majority
shareholder, according to the detailed text of a judgment made by the
Luxembourg courts late last month.
Proposals offered to Abu Dhabi by the three court-appointed liquidators
would have breached Luxembourg civil law by ranking it above other unsecured
creditors. The document says the proposal allowing Abu Dhabi to offset
Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.27bn) in claims against its debts to BCCI companies
would break the rule of parity between Abu Dhabi and other unsecured
creditors, which should all be treated equally.
It also rules that the liquidators' proposals to divide equally with Abu
Dhabi the proceeds of any legal actions taken against third parties in
connection with the collapse of the bank would be a concession to Abu Dhabi
to the detriment of other unsecured creditors. The details shed new light on
the surprise decision in the Luxembourg appeals court on October 27, which
refused to provide the necessary ratification to allow the liquidators to
proceed with their proposals.
The fact that the agreement negotiated by the liquidators for a payment of
up to Dollars 2bn from the government of Abu Dhabi was in the best interests
of unsecured creditors was 'not the sole or even the primary criterion' in
the court's decision to reject the liquidators' proposals, the translated
verdict says.
Equally irrelevant was the lack of a 'serious alternative' to the plan
offered by the three BCCI creditors who opposed the liquidators and called
for a greater settlement from Abu Dhabi.
Judge Raoul Gretsch, a senior judge, announced the verdict in favour of the
appeal brought by three creditors to the bank, Mr Adil Elias, Mr Hal Skolnik
and Mr Assilaos Artiki, who wanted a greater contribution from Abu Dhabi as
part of the settlement.
The judgment said found in favour of the appeal, but on the grounds that the
proposals included a number of points that which in their current form
amounted to a breach of Luxembourg civil law.
That suggests the liquidators may have to restructure their proposals to
obtain Luxembourg approval even if they obtain agreement for a higher
contribution from Abu Dhabi, as desired by the three creditors who made the
appeal.
The document also argues that Abu Dhabi has broken Luxembourg law by
refusing to hand to the liquidators papers and documents to which they are
entitled under Luxembourg law. It reveals that the liquidators were planning
to receive payment from Abu Dhabi under their proposals into an offshore
bank account in Jersey, maintained by Law Debenture.
All legal costs incurred in the appeal will be charged against BCCI assets,
says the Luxembourg document.
It reveals details of a legal action by the liquidators not previously
reported. Interfiduciaire, a chartered accountancy and tax advisory firm
which audited BCCI in Luxembourg, has been sued.

FT  22 NOV 93 / All-women shortlists unworkable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A rule demanding all-woman shortlists in some parliamentary seats is
unworkable, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, said
yesterday. The idea that Labour headquarters could tell a constituency it
could not choose its own candidate would be resisted fiercely, he said on
BBC television.
He said: 'It is tragic that the Labour Party should be getting itself into
another constituency argument at this time. The cause is absolutely right,
that more women must be in parliament to represent Labour. 'But this way of
doing it is going to produce chaos and is absolutely unworkable. This will
actually set the cause of women's representation back as some the other
half-cock measures have set it back'.
If positive steps were being taken for women they ought also to to be taken
for blacks and Asians who were 'pathetically under-represented' in the
parliamentary party.

He said: 'Mr Major talks a lot about returning to basic values and appears

factor in those times - namely that unemployment was at rock bottom and that
school leavers . . . had a realistic prospect of a job,' he told the Apex

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at Bentley Colliery near Doncaster in South Yorkshire have accepted
management plans to close the pit next month, British Coal said yesterday.
The National Union of Mineworkers had accepted an improved redundancy
package and production would cease on December 3. It said miners would
receive redundancy payments of up to Pounds 44,000 each.
The pit, which employs 450 people, is one of 12 for which the government
announced a reprieve in March. Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes
are equivalent to more than six months' production.
Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire will stop production on December 3,
subject to the agreement of its 400 miners.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Part-time jobs are boost for women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part-time work has helped women increase their contribution to household
income in the past two decades, says a report published today by the
Institute for Fiscal Studies.
Men are still responsible for 'the lion's share' of money coming into the
household, Mr Steven Webb, the report's author has found. In 1991, the
average income received directly by men was about Pounds 200 a week compared
with Pounds 100 a week for women.
However, the figures reflect 'a major growth in equality', Mr Webb argues.
Two decades earlier women received directly only one pound in four coming
into households.
But where more than two thirds of men's income comes from wages or
self-employment, women on average receive only just over half of their
income from earnings and nearly a quarter from social security.
The study says that the growth in women's employment has come mainly among
married women with children. Employment rates among the growing numbers of
lone parents have 'fallen back sharply' over the last 20 years, and they now
receive around half their income from social security.
According to the study, the likely future growth in the availability of
part-time jobs should help increase women's share of household income
further. It says: 'There is every likelihood that the gap will close still
further in coming years.'
Mr Webb argues that more than a third of married women with children are
currently outside the labour market and would be prime candidates for
part-time jobs. However, he acknowledges that growing responsibilities for
caring for elderly relatives and the limited availability of affordable
child-care may restrict married women's ability to take such jobs.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Many employers still losing sleep over EU work directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Roberts is typical of the 15 per cent of British manufacturing
workers who regularly work a night shift. The 32-year-old chemical worker, a
father of three, much prefers working four 10-hour shifts to doing five of
eight hours.
The European Union's controversial working time directive, which will be
formally passed in Brussels tomorrow, will make it more difficult for him to
do so.
Both government and employers say that the sting has been drawn from the
directive - especially in relation to the attention-grabbing 48-hour week
limit. But there is still regulation in areas such as night work and
statutory holidays which may bring fundamental changes in three years.
By then the directive will have to be implemented in Britain, unless the
British government's legal challenge to it should unexpectedly succeed.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of the European employers' body Unice, says
that thanks to sweeping revisions Europe's employers 'can now live with the
directive'.
Fundamental changes have indeed been achieved. For British employers alone
there will be no 48-hour week limit for at least 10 years, although no
employee can be forced to work more than 48 hours.
Even for employers in the other 11 member states the 'reference period'
within which the working week must not exceed an average of 48 hours will be
a minimum of 4 months and, with union agreement, a maximum of 12.
There is exemption for workers at sea, in transport industries, and doctors
in training, in all 12 member states. Other groups with specific exemptions
will have to be provided with 'appropriate' protection rather than
'equivalent' as planned. Attempts to establish Sunday as a statutory day of
rest or to make all night work dependent on union agreement have been
blocked.
So what are British employers still worried about? 'There is still a lot of
devil in the detail, but we will not know exactly how we will be hit until
the directive has been translated into UK law,' says Mr Peter Reid of the
Engineering Employers Federation.
Privately, one employer also confided that he feared the legislation might
'change attitudes' and make people more reluctant to work the long hours
that they do in Britain.
A minimum rest period of 11 hours per 24 hours is not likely to pose a
problem for many employers.
But the entitlement to paid annual holidays of at least four weeks could
have a big effect in Britain, where holiday provision, like much else, has
no statutory underpinning.
Another area of worry for British employers is night work. The ruling that
night shifts must not exceed eight hours will require changes to many shift
patterns. Night workers suffering from health problems will have the right
to be transferred to day work, though that has been watered down to
'whenever possible'.
Also, the fact that equivalent health and safety services must be available
for night workers could mean plants with their own medical staff will have
to have them on duty, not just on call, at night.
Nonetheless, government officials say privately that the directive is now
bearable, provided it is sensibly implemented. But Mr Reid of the EEF and
many labour lawyers wonder how parliamentary draughtsmen will deal with
parts of the directive - such as the requirement to 'take account' of the
monotony of shift work.
The working time directive, like other parts of the EU's social dimension,
fits better with the tradition of regulations and codes of practice of
continental Europe than with British common law. But the imposition of the
directive on Britain, albeit in watered-down form, marks another small step
toward UK convergence with those continental traditions.

FT  22 NOV 93 / First November snow since 1969 in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists were warned last night to expect more snow after a day in which
some roads in Scotland and northern England were blocked.
Yesterday's heaviest falls were in the eastern half of Britain, and London
had its first November snow since 1969. The heaviest falls, of more than
5mm, were in Lincolnshire, East Anglia and near Ashford in Kent.
Today's falls are expected to be lighter and more isolated, but the AA
advised motorists to slow down and keep their distance. Main roads were
blocked yesterday near Perth and in Kent, and conditions were so bad on part
of the A1(M) in County Durham that several vehicles slid off it.
The threat of more snow this week has prompted the Meteorological Office to
rush forward the long-planned launch of a new way to deliver forecasts to
the public - by fax.
Today the Met Office introduces Weathercall Fax. It enables anyone with a
fax machine to dial up instant copies of the latest charts, graphics and
written forecasts. There are estimated to be 1.25m machines in the UK.
Callers can select 24-hour and five-day forecasts covering any of 27 local
areas, seven regions or the whole country. They can even choose to receive
the latest satellite pictures taken from a height of 36,000 km - though
these take six minutes to come through with their fine details of swirling
cloud systems.
The Met Office, based in Bracknell, has been developing its service for
three years. 'We're already the largest single provider of information by
fax in this country,' said Mr Roger Hunt, sales director.
The Met Office, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, has developed
Weathercall Fax in partnership with Telephone Information Services, a London
company.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Dixons to challenge warehouse retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, Britain's leading high-street
electrical retailer, said he would compete 'ruthlessly' with new US-style
warehouse clubs which undercut goods in his shops.
But he denied telling suppliers at an annual gathering that they would have
to decide whether they would sell to Dixons or warehouse clubs such as
Costco, which offer cut-price shopping to members.
Mr Kalms said last night: 'At an annual dinner which we always give for our
suppliers . . . I said I could not see how they could supply complex goods
like video cassette recorders, camcorders which require a high degree of
service to cut-price stores and ourselves. There is a contradiction here. We
include pre-sales and after-sales service in our prices. Suppliers cannot
work with high service retailers with a national network and low cost
operations.'
Mr Kalms said that he was not going to give his market away.
'We are going to compete ruthlessly with anyone who tries to undercut and
that includes on price if needs be,' he said.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Payment to Names to be debated today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lloyd's council, the governing body of the insurance market, is expected
to consider today a proposed structure for an out-of-court settlement to the
legal actions by loss-making Names against their agents.
Several thousand Names - individuals whose assets support the market - are
claiming more than Pounds 3.5bn in compensation.
The deal allows for a 'bespoke' offer for each Name involved, the amount of
compensation varying according to which syndicates the loss-making Names
belong to, as well as a series of other factors.
Lloyd's has still to complete its work on obtaining funds for the deal, but
it is understood that errors and omissions insurers, which cover agencies
against legal awards for negligence, are prepared to contribute at least
Pounds 300m and possibly as much as Pounds 400m.
Further funds will come from donations from agents and brokers, which the
market estimates could amount to as much as Pounds 75m.
Lloyd's will also make a contribution - possibly as much as Pounds 500m -
from its own central fund, which pays claims when Names are unable to meet
their obligations.
It is expected that details of the offer will be posted to Names over the
next two to three weeks. They are expected to vote on the deal early in the
new year.

A successor to the Business Expansion Scheme that would give a tax incentive
for family members as well as business 'angels' to invest in small
companies, is urged today by the Small Business Bureau, a Tory party lobby
group.
In a paper to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the bureau argues for a
scheme to encourage investment in unquoted manufacturers.
The proposed Manufacturing Expansion Scheme would entitle individual
investors to a maximum tax relief each year on investments up to Pounds
250,000, for a minimum of five years.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Tunnel damage almost repaired
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Damage caused by an explosion in the Channel tunnel should be repaired by
tomorrow, the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday.
TML, the contractor, said the incident occurred during tests 7km from the UK
end of the tunnel, where it was still under land, on November 13. It was not
made public until yesterday.
Eurotunnel, the operating company, dismissed fears that the start of
services through the Channel tunnel might be delayed by the accident, which
is reported to have happened when 25,000 volts were sent down the main power
cable and hit an abandoned metal bar.
An HSE official said the incident had happened during testing of the system
which took electric power to equipment which carried overhead cables through
the tunnel.
TML, the contractor, said the area had been cleared, as part of standard
safety procedures, and no one was hurt.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Miners accept deal to close Yorks pit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at Bentley Colliery in South Yorkshire have accepted management plans
to close the pit next month, British Coal said yesterday.
It said the National Union of Mineworkers had accepted an improved
redundancy package on behalf of its members at the colliery. Production will
cease on December 3 and miners will receive redundancy payments of up to
Pounds 44,000 each.
British Coal blamed the closure on reduced demand in a 'highly competitive
market place'.
The pit, which employs 450 people, is one of 12 for which the government
announced a reprieve in March. Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes
are equivalent to more than six months' production, and about three-quarters
of the pit's weekly output of 20,000 tonnes is being added to the stockpile.
British Coal wants to close two other Yorkshire pits, Hatfield in Doncaster
and Frickley in Pontefract, by the same date.
Silverdale Colliery in Staffordshire will stop production on December 3,
subject to the agreement of its 400 miners.
The future of three other pits - Littleton, near Cannock in Staffordshire,
Ellington in Northumberland and Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear  - will be reviewed
this week.
British Coal will be left with about 16,500 miners by next month if the
programme of closures is accepted.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Regulator may heed funding demand: Societies demand reform
to boost competition on rates to potential borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, Building Societies Commissioner, has raised the
prospect that powers in the de-regulation bill now before parliament could
be used to allow societies to raise more of their funds on the wholesale
money markets, enabling them to be more competitive.
Mrs Gilmore said there was 'no huge magic' about the present limit of 40 per
cent of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets, set by the
Building Societies Act 1986.
Below this overall ceiling, each society has a different limit. The average
is about 30 per cent.
'If it became a really serious pressure point and you could think about
doing it as a stand-alone measure, I suppose one would think about it. It
might be possible under the de-regulation bill,' Mrs Gilmore said.
Competition in the retail financial sector both for savings and for mortgage
lending has been particularly tough this year. Societies have suffered some
months of net outflows of funds and the banks have steadily increased their
share of mortgage lending.
Larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is
cheaper, in order to be able to offer more attractive deals to potential
borrowers. 'It's about being able to give our members the most favourable
rates,' said one chief executive.
An overall limit of 50 per cent would imply lower individual limits for
societies, thus ensuring that they retained their character as mutual
institutions.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said such a move should mean
that customers were offered better mortgage deals as competition increased.
Mrs Gilmore's readiness to consider the use of deregulation powers is a sign
of how she interprets her role.
She said: 'I think it's about wanting building societies to be successful
and doing whatever we can through the regulatory system to see that they
are, which means responding so far as the act allows to their wish to
diversify and change and move with the market in a prudent kind of way.'
Further evidence of the commission's desire to be flexible comes from its
development of a system in which it makes generic regulations enabling
societies to move into areas of activity, such as money transmission, rather
than individual orders, each dealing with a specific scheme.
In spite of such initiatives, however, some of the larger societies believe
the commission has a tendency to 'nanny' the sector. In particular, a recent
draft prudential note on lending policy has been criticised for being too
detailed and prescriptive.
Mrs Gilmore admitted that it was not easy to devise guidance that applied
sensibly to the whole of the industry. That means from Halifax, the UK's
largest society - with assets of more than Pounds 60bn - to some local
societies which have only one or two branches.
She argued that the draft note on lending contains a mix of requirements
which the societies must fulfil and guidance about how to do so, but hinted
at a re-packaging of the advice to make this clear. 'If that's being sensed
differently by the market, if that's causing confusion, then obviously we'll
look at it'.
In spite of the over-capacity in retail financial services, and the lack of
immediate external pressures on societies to merge, the commission is widely
seen as hostile to the idea of banks, or even life companies, acquiring
societies.
Mrs Gilmore said she had nothing in principle against such mergers, but
admitted that the part of the 1986 Act which provided for such moves was
difficult to interpret.
Apart from the overwhelming support which is required from a society's
members - its savers and borrowers - there is an added complication if the
offer is made in terms of cash rather than shares because cash cannot be
distributed to members of less than two years' standing.
She argued that the commission was bound to supervise such matters closely.
That was because the commission had to strike down the deal if a member
could show that he or she had not been properly informed before the vote.
Beyond what might be accomplished through the de-regulation bill, Mrs
Gilmore does not believe there will be significant legislation for the
building society sector until the next parliament at the earliest, though
she does expect societies to want to move beyond the current restrictions
before the end of the century.
That legislation will, she believes, raise fundamental questions about the
nature of building societies, which the societies themselves will have to
consider further: how far do they want to retain their distinctive character
with its advantages and restrictions in a market of intensifying competition
and pressures to diversify?
'I think the interesting questions about next act are what it is to be a
membership organisation and how wide you let the remit go. At the extreme,
you do come to the view that the next act could just be about a category of
mutual banks,' she said.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Can an energy panel save us from more blunders?: The views
of 16 experts may be too diverse to be effective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, MICHAEL SMITH and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the coal crisis was raging earlier this year, the government pledged to
set up a panel of experts to advise it on energy issues - the implication
being that they would prevent it from making such policy blunders again.
Tomorrow the 16 men and women of the newly appointed Energy Advisory Panel
will hold their first meeting. Judging by their credentials, the advice they
will they be giving ministers will be very mixed - perhaps too mixed to form
a forceful view.
They will have a crowded agenda. Apart from specific issues such as the
privatisation of British Coal, the British Gas monopoly inquiry and the
forthcoming review of the nuclear power industry, they will have to ask
whether the UK should have a more hands-on energy policy - as many of the
government's critics are arguing.
In the longer term they may consider environmental questions, the structure
of the electricity industry, whether Britain should have more renewable
energy projects and EC policy on free trade in energy supplies.
The chairman, Mr Martin Holdgate, director-general of the Swiss-based
International Union for Conservation of Nature, is an expert on renewable
energy. His expertise will be bolstered by Lady Mary Archer, a specialist on
solar energy and chairman of the National Energy Foundation, which promotes
energy efficiency.
The energy industry will be represented by Mr Ron Campbell, former managing
director of Babcock Energy and an expert on nuclear power; Mr Sam Laidlaw,
head of UK operations of Amerada Hess, the US oil company; and Dr Anthony
White, a director of National Grid Company.
There is also a sprinkling of academics, consultants, representatives of
union and consumer interests, industrialists - and an electricity
privatisation expert from the City, Ms Lynda Rouse of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. She is also on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Many participants have a high profile in the energy debate and have argued
for a more active national energy policy. Mr Tony Cooper, general secretary
of the Engineers and Managers' Association, is one of them. He has called on
the government to set up a framework for the market to operate in, warning
that otherwise short-termism would destroy longer term objectives.
Another is Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power
Association, which lobbies for energy-efficient power generation.
Several other members have spoken out against aspects of the government's
policy. Mr Mike Parker, former director of economics at British Coal, has
just published a book in which he describes the government's coal review as
'more form than substance'.
Mr Dieter Helm of Oxford Economic Research Associates has attacked the wide
discretion given to energy industry regulators, and thinks they should be
brought under tighter government control. Dr White at National Grid had
actually dismissed the panel as a bad idea before he was appointed to it.
On the other hand, Mr Nigel Evans, managing director of Caminus Energy, a
Cambridge-based energy consultancy which advised the government on the coal
issue, is more sympathetic to a pro-competition policy.
'The limitations of past energy policies are strongly apparent -
particularly with hindsight,' he says. 'There are so many uncertainties I
would not have the confidence to say what that policy should be.'
Ms Ann Scully, vice-chairman of the National Consumers Council, says she is
less concerned with who owns the energy industry than with the quality of
service people get.
Mr Peter Ibbotson, director of construction and engineering at the J.
Sainsbury supermarket group, who takes a strong interest in reducing energy
costs, said: 'I would like to think that investment in conservation and
efficiency should rank equally with investment in energy producing
industries. We would be better investing the nation's resources in
conserving energy rather than just in producing it.'
Some observers believe the panel's membership is too diverse to influence
government policy, and that it would have difficulty forging a common
position. But Mr Ibbotson said: 'I will certainly do my best to make the
Department of Trade and Industry sit up and take notice of the panel. I hope
it won't just be a talking shop.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Contractors protest at debt burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction subcontractors could be losing about Pounds 1bn a year owed to
them by clients and main contractors which have become insolvent, a survey
of more than 800 specialist engineers published today indicates.
The survey by the Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group (SECG), which
represents heating, ventilation, electrical, plumbing and lift manufacturers
and contractors, revealed that 889 companies had lost a total of Pounds 24m
between January 1992 and July this year because of the failure of other
companies.
The losses represented 2.29 per cent of turnover on average. If the same
trend occurred throughout the building industry subcontractors would have
lost Pounds 1.1bn from bad debts from a total construction industry turnover
last year of Pounds 47bn.
The SECG called yesterday for a reform of UK insolvency laws. It wants
ministers to abolish preferential creditor status, which gives secured
creditors such as banks precedence when the money left by a failed business
is divided up.
The government recently announced it was considering whether the balance of
rights between secured and unsecured creditors was right. The Confederation
of British Industry has also called for insolvency laws to be reformed.
Under the present arrangements there is usually very little money left for
trade creditors once secured creditors have been repaid. The SECG said
yesterday that all contractors should be classed as secured creditors if
they were owed money for work that had been done.
It said the collapse of a main contractor often caused a chain reaction
which left subcontractors unpaid, forcing them and their suppliers to fail
in turn.
Some of the companies quoted in the survey had reported losses of as much as
8 per cent of their annual turnover.
The SECG said procedures for channelling money from the ultimate customer
through main contractors to subcontractors should be improved. Clients
should be required to pay bills when the main contractor went out of
business, it said.
The group also criticised the practice of retaining part of the money owed
to subcontractors as an insurance against defects emerging after work had
been completed.
'The archaic system of retention money, applicable only in the construction
industry, should be abolished,' said the SECG.
It said contractors that were guilty of late payment or non-payment to their
suppliers were causing serious financial problems for the industry and
causing even more companies to fail.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Investment growth low: Improved capital allowances attract
only 15% of companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than 15 per cent of companies increased investment in machinery and
plant this year in spite of the temporary introduction late last year of 40
per cent, first-year capital allowances, says an NOP survey.
The results of the Lombard business investment survey, carried out for
Lombard North Central, the leasing and hire purchase subsidiary of National
Westminster Bank, come a week before the Budget which industry hopes will
contain further measures to boost industrial investment.
The recession has helped bring manufacturing investment to its lowest level,
as a proportion of gross domestic product, for more than 30 years. However,
the temporary rise in allowances from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, which
expired last month, appears to have given only a modest fillip to capital
spending.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has come under heavy pressure to renew
the temporary extension and to enable all investment up to Pounds 200,000 to
be eligible for relief. But there are doubts within the Treasury about the
effectiveness of such initiatives. The Treasury has also regarded them in
the past as a costly way of stimulating corporate investment.
The Lombard survey of 450 companies shows that the allowances made most
impact on smaller businesses. It also reveals that while only about 7 per
cent of manufacturing companies took advantage of the improved allowances, a
third of transport and distribution businesses used them.
Although nearly half of the companies say capital expenditure programmes
have been hit by the recession, more than 70 per cent of respondents believe
the economy will improve over the next year and that they will raise
investment activity in the first half of 1994.
Their optimism is based primarily on a recent increase in orders and
inquiries and on lower interest rates.

FT  22 NOV 93 / ITV faces flood of takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An announcement that could set off the greatest ever burst of takeover
activity among ITV companies is likely this week.
The government is expected to give details of a significant degree of
liberalisation of the ownership rules governing ITV companies.
The signs are that the most restrictive forms of change, allowing only one
or two companies to change hands, have been rejected.
At the moment the nine largest ITV companies are unable to take each other
over under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. A liberalisation that would allow one
company to hold two large licences plus one of the smallest six ITV licences
would enable a considerable degree of consolidation to take place in the ITV
system.
Under such a scenario, Carlton Communications could take over Central,
Granada could take over LWT, and MAI, the controlling company in Meridian
Television, could take over Anglia.
The share prices of many ITV companies have been rising in recent weeks and
immediate takeover bids are likely to get under way as soon as the
government confirms the details of the new rules.
Barriers are likely to remain in place to prevent the takeover of HTV or
Scottish Television by other large ITV companies or the two London licences
being owned by the same company.
No matter how many companies change hands, each broadcasting licence will
remain separate and the Independent Television Commission will ensure that
all programme obligations are honoured.
Some details of the plan are still being worked out and no announcement is
expected today.

FT  22 NOV 93 / 'We do not want the status of constables': The fight over
prison officers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prison Officers Association will today launch a challenge to last week's
High Court ruling that its members have the status of constables and
therefore do not have the right to strike. The temporary ruling, if allowed
to stand, would mean derecognition of the association as a union.
To comply with the injunction the association has called off a three-day
programme of industrial action over the government's market testing
proposals. The action was due to start today and would have meant thousands
of prisoners remaining in police cells.
However, the association said it would not participate in talks hinted at by
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, aimed at finding a way to maintain
the present status of the association's members but allowing them to enjoy
certain rights, such as access to industrial tribunals.
Mr John Bartell, association chairman, said: 'It would be rank hypocrisy on
our part to talk with Mr Howard. It seems to us he has belatedly realised
what a mess he has landed himself in. He does not want us to be a trade
union but we can have certain rights.'
He added: 'We do not want the status of constables. We want to be recognised
as a trade union.'
Mr Howard has said that many questions need to be resolved - including
relations with governors and other people working in prisons - to put
industrial relations in the service on a proper footing.
A counsel specialising in labour law said yesterday that last week's ruling
meant the association had the status of a club, not a trade union.
The association has long had a reputation for old-fashioned militancy.
Generations of officers have realised they had substantial power by
threatening to withdraw their labour.
But industrial relations in the Prison Service have progressed in recent
years. In 1987-88 the Fresh Start reform programme, while far from a
complete success, produced some improvements in management and industrial
relations structures. Since then, the Prison Service management has sought
to devolve financial and personnel responsibilities to local governors. In
June the association signed an agreement recognising the importance of
resolving problems at local level.
Until two years ago Prison Service management was highly centralised, with
the pace of change determined by national negotiations between the Home
Office and the association. Now the service is run by an executive agency.
Companies managing Britain's private prisons do not have to recognise the
association - Group 4, the biggest private operator so far, recognises the
GMB general union instead.
Future government market testing plans include transferring some public
prisons to private management. Although under Tupe - the transfer of
undertaking regulations - officers at these prisons would have continued
employment rights, the private-sector companies would be under no obligation
to continue recognising the association.
With Mr Howard now challenging the association's ability to take industrial
action, its leaders are likely to feel they have little to lose by fighting
their case all the way in court - and little other choice.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Irish PM willing to hold referendum on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday gave his clearest
assurance yet that he was prepared to submit Dublin's territorial claim over
Northern Ireland to a referendum in the republic.
But he stressed that such a step, aimed at removing the claim from the Irish
constitution, could only be taken in the context of an overall settlement.
If put to the electorate now it would be turned down, he warned.
In a generally upbeat assessment of the prospects for peace in the province,
Mr Reynolds said there was a need for a balanced approach to the Irish
problem 'taking on board all the widespread views'.
It was for London and Dublin to 'take the initiative and run with it,' he
said, stressing the possibility of achieving peace before a political
settlement.
Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Reynolds spoke of his
'excellent rapport' with Mr John Major, who he had
always found 'a very reasoned, reliable, competent and commonsense person'.
On the referendum question, Mr Reynolds said the 'nationalist identity' as
represented by Dublin's territorial claim over Northern Ireland would 'not
be thrown away unless we found a new accommodation for both traditions and
both identities and both cultures'.
If the referendum were put and failed, Mr Reynolds's Fianna Fail party would
be handing over the banner of nationalism to Sinn Fein and the IRA who would
be seen as the only organisations standing firm on national identity.
In a veiled criticism of Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist
party, Mr Rey-nolds said many unionists understood that fact, but some did
not. The DUP is insisting that Dublin's territorial claim be dropped before
it returns to the negotiating table.
The 200-strong Ulster Unionist Councillors' Association yesterday agreed
unanimously its total opposition to any new arrangement that would involve
the Dublin government or its agencies in matters of local government in
Northern Ireland.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Graduates 'forced to lower pay hopes'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many recent graduates have had to lower their career and pay expectations,
an Institute of Manpower Studies review said yesterday. One in seven of 1992
university graduates in England, Scotland and Wales had failed to find work.
Ms Helen Connor, the review's co-author, said: 'Graduate output has almost
doubled in the last five years and is forecast to grow further to 1995 and
beyond.' She added that the rise had altered the labour market for graduates
beyond recognition.
'Graduate unemployment is still rising and the traditional demand for
graduates remains weak,' Ms Connor said. Unemployment was lower for
graduates from the 'old' universities (11 per cent) than for graduates from
former polytechnics and colleges which are now universities (nearly 18 per
cent).
The institute expects the number of graduates in 1995 to be 57 per cent
higher than the 1992 total, with a rise of 68 per cent for women compared
with 45 per cent for men.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Small businesses urge more tax aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A successor to the Business Expansion Scheme that would give a tax incentive
for family members as well as business 'angels' to invest in small
companies, is urged today by the Small Business Bureau, a Tory party lobby
group.
In a paper to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the bureau argues for a
scheme to encourage investment in unquoted manufacturers, as well as other
measures such as a long-term credit institution and 100 per cent capital
allowances for small companies for a short period.
The proposed Manufacturing Expansion Scheme would entitle individual
investors to a maximum tax relief each year on investments up to Pounds
250,000, for a minimum of five years.
Mr David McMeekin, corporate finance director at Midland Bank and a member
of the policy unit that produced the SBB report, said: 'The key thing is
that any scheme should be cost-effective from the taxpayer's point of view
and aimed more accurately than the BES.'

FT  22 NOV 93 / Trading company counter-sues SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate, is counter-suing the Securities and
Investments Board which earlier this year launched a legal action to restore
Pounds 4m to the company's pension fund.
Melton Medes on Friday launched its own legal action alleging that the SIB
had wrongfully disclosed information acquired during an inquiry into the
handling of pension fund assets. Mr Nathu Ram Puri, chairman of Melton
Medes, yesterday claimed the disclosure had cost him Pounds 5m to Pounds
10m.
The SIB refused to comment on the writ, although it said it intended to
continue pursuing its own legal action.
The basis of Mr Puri's allegation is that the SIB gave information to
plaintiffs in a separate court case which cast doubt on his claims of a
pension fund surplus.
Mr Puri is involved in two separate legal actions. The first, launched by
beneficiaries of the pension fund last year, claims damages of more than
Pounds 7m. It alleges that Mr Puri and Mr James Philpott, Melton Medes'
chief executive, improperly handled funds regarding a loan from the pension
fund to Melton Medes' subsidiaries.
The second case was brought by the SIB in July this year seeking damages of
more than Pounds 4m. It alleges that Mr Puri and Mr Philpotts repeatedly
breached rules of Imro, the self-regulating body for fund managers, in
handling pension fund assets.
Mr Puri alleges that the SIB informed the beneficiaries in the first court
action that Kidsons Impey, auditors of Melton Medes Pension Trustees,
planned to review their report on the fund's 1990 accounts. In the event,
says Melton Medes, the auditors decided 'not to add any qualification to
their report, but the damage had been done'.
Mr Marcus Rutherford, of solicitors DJ Freeman, representing Melton Medes,
said the alleged disclosure was a violation of section 179 of the Financial
Services Act 1986.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Chinese leader cuts a figure on the world stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEATTLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's President Jiang Zemin did not quite go to the extent of donning a
ten-gallon hat - as did his patron, Mr Deng Xiaoping, when he visited the US
in 1979.
But the crusty Communist party general secretary went out of his way to make
an impact as a world leader during the weekend summit in Seattle.
Mr Jiang talked expansively but uncompromisingly in a 90-minute session with
President Bill Clinton. He had individual meetings with leaders of
Indonesia, Australia, South Korea, Canada, Japan and Thailand. He dropped in
on a 'typical' middle-class American family, handed out a stuffed panda and
a doll in exchange for cookies and a picture of Sleeping Beauty, and
brandished pictures of his grandchildren.
For Mr Jiang, the summit could not have been held in a more symbolic city
than the home of Boeing, which dominates the local economy. China has bought
more than 200 Boeing aircraft since the 1970s and is the company's biggest
foreign customer. Thanks to the country's economic boom and renewal of its
infrastructure, it promises to remain so.
But if Mr Clinton removes China's most favoured nation trading status, as he
threatens to do next year, Seattle would fear the consequences. Visiting
Boeing's Everett plant, Mr Jiang pointedly thanked Mr Frank Shrontz,
Boeing's chairman, for the company's efforts to maintain China's MFN status.
Chinese officials repeatedly pointed out the US would suffer if MFN is
revoked.
Mr Clinton, after several months of worsening relations, has embarked on a
new policy of closer engagement with China, involving higher-level and more
frequent discussions than had occurred since before the Tiananmen Square
killings in 1989.
However, he made clear to Mr Jiang this does not imply a lessening of US
pressure on China for improvements in human rights, market access and
nuclear non-proliferation - all conditions set by the US president for MFN
renewal next June.
On human rights, Mr Clinton spelled out specific demands for International
Red Cross access to Chinese prisons; release of political prisoners
particularly if they are ill; a dialogue by Beijing with the Dalai Lama, the
exiled Tibetan spiritual leader; and access by US customs officials to
ensure prison-made goods are not exported to the US.
Mr Jiang delivered a 15-minute statement on the diversity of the world's
nations and the need not to interfere in each other's affairs. But he did
discuss the North Korean nuclear threat and indicated China was prepared to
discuss the issues which were of concern to the US.
Both men said the meeting was a 'good beginning'. Mr Clinton said it
'established our determination to build on the positive aspects of our
existing relations, and to address far more candidly and personally than we
have in the past the problems that remain'.
China had not been expected to give ground in so public an arena as the
first meeting between the two presidents. But Mr Warren Christopher,
secretary of state, was encouraged that they had met, that Mr Jiang had not
refused to 'engage', and that they had 'a vivid and animated discussion'.
Despite China's rejection of US demands, stepped-up and forthright dialogue
seems likely to continue, with end-year deadlines looming for resolution of
market access and textile disputes and congressional hearings on the MFN
issue due in January.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said Beijing's trade surplus with
Washington could reach Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15.6bn) this year and described
it as 'politically and economically unacceptable.' Ms Wu Yi, China's trade
minister, responded that 'China has never been afraid of sanctions.'

FT  22 NOV 93 / EU and US in crucial Gatt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, DAVID DODWELL, FRANCES WILLIAMS and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEATTLE, GENEVA, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European trade negotiators arrive in Washington today for a two-day meeting
with US counterparts that is likely to determine the shape and scope of the
Uruguay Round package of world trade reform.
'I am confident now that there will be an agreement by December 15,' the
deadline set for an accord, a European Union negotiator said before
departure. 'The Washington meeting will decide whether it is a big deal, or
something more modest.'
While warning that a 'small package' would be much harder for national
governments to ratify, he signalled that outstanding differences over
protection and subsidies for steel presented a stumbling block. Negotiators
would be trying to 'reduce matters to an absolute minimum' - focusing on
market access, trade in services, anti-dumping rules, subsidies and
disciplines over support for steel and aircraft.
The Washington meeting between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, will allow EU negotiators to
learn how events of the past week have influenced US strategy towards
completion of the Uruguay Round. The EU has been a spectator during the
approval by the US Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement and
the US courtship of Asian nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
summit in Seattle.
US officials said at the weekend they believed that winning congressional
approval for Nafta had strengthened their hand in the Uruguay Round
negotiations and had improved prospects of congressional support for the
Gatt deal.
'A good consequence of the Nafta win is that while we really would like a
deal, we don't have a high octane political need for one. When the president
says we want a good one, we can mean that,' an administration official said.
The Senate voted Nafta through on Saturday by 61-38. A total of 34
Republicans joined 27 Democrats in favour of the measure; 28 Democrats and
10 Republicans opposed it.
As the Uruguay Round approaches December 15, after which President Bill
Clinton will lose his fast track authority to negotiate without line-by-line
congressional oversight, the White House believes that the Nafta battle has
re-established a constituency for free trade within Congress.
Mr Clinton said that the US would 'not accept a flawed agreement' but added
that a good Gatt deal could create 1.4m jobs in the US over 10 years.
Tom Burns adds from Madrid: President Francois Mitterrand of France
underlined that the road to a Gatt agreement remained rocky when he used
bilateral weekend talks with the Spanish government in Madrid to deliver a
stinging attack on what he said were bullying US tactics following the Nafta
accord.
He was supported by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, who warned in a
joint press conference with Mr Mitterrand and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish
prime minister, that the US would have to soften its stance on Gatt.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Weary Clinton sets sights on Pacific goals: The President
showed new-found enthusiasm for the region at the Apec summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by his haggard looks and weary tones as he delivered his final
speech before leaving the Asia-Pacific summit in Seattle at the weekend, one
might have thought President Bill Clinton had suffered a dismal week riddled
with defeat. In fact, he left the summit as he arrived - riding high.
'Other than being tired, and he is very tired, he is loving it,' a senior
administration official said.
Mr Clinton came to Seattle fresh from victory in Congress on the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and left after a step towards an ambitious
vision of the US as a country that looks not only to the Atlantic but also,
perhaps with keener interest, to the Pacific.
This vision is rooted in Mr Clinton's desire to place economics at the core
of US foreign policy. In his election campaign last year Mr Clinton
articulated the belief that US jobs depended on exploiting trading
opportunities overseas, but US officials say he did not make a 'gut
connection' until the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in
Tokyo in July.
His message sharpened by the Nafta debate, Mr Clinton last week in speeches
in Seattle closed the circle between international security policy,
international economic policy and domestic economic policy.
'We cannot remain strong abroad unless we are strong at home,' Mr Clinton
said. 'Stagnant nations eventually lose the ability to finance military
readiness, to afford an activist foreign policy or to inspire allies by
their example.'
At a time when wealthy nations must become ever more productive to meet
competition from both low wage countries and highly skilled countries, the
only way they can increase jobs and raise incomes is through expanded trade.
'There is no alternative. No-one has yet made a convincing case that any
wealthy country can lower unemployment and raise incomes by closing up its
borders. The only way to do it is to expand global growth and to expand each
country's fair share of global trade,' Mr Clinton said.
This emphasis on export opportunities has led the US inexorably towards the
Asia-Pacific region, which is not only by far the fastest growing segment of
the world economy but also the area with which the US has the largest trade
deficit. Japan and China between them account for more than two thirds of
the entire US trade deficit.
At the same time, Mr Clinton in Seattle directly linked US military presence
in the Pacific and its security treaties with five countries in the region
to expanded market access.
'We do not intend to bear the cost of our military presence in Asia and the
burdens of regional leadership only to be shut out of the benefits of growth
that that stability brings,' he said.
The administration is anxious not to snub Europe. The approved formula
adopted by even the most Asia-minded US officials, such as Mr Winston Lord,
assistant secretary of state for the region, is that 'no area will be more
important than Asia,' and Mr Clinton himself insisted that Europe remained
'a central partner for the US in security, in foreign policy and in
commerce'.
But many senior officials can scarcely conceal the feeling that all Europe
has to offer them is mature markets with few opportunities for expanded US
exports, foreign policy nightmares such as Bosnia, and an unimaginative and
backward-looking pessimism.
Turning Mr Clinton's new-found enthusiasm for the Pacific into something
concrete may prove difficult. In the first place, the administration's
approach to realising its goals in the region is largely built on combining
divergent policies previously seen as incompatible alternatives: engaging
China on trade issues while taking a tough line on human rights;
aggressively pursuing bilateral trade initiatives while pressing on with
multilateral talks in the Gatt round; seeking to expand its free trade
agreements in Asia and Latin America at the same time.
'We want it all,' says Ms Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for economic
affairs, while experts from the Bush administration scoff at their
successors' inability to set priorities.
Second, many Pacific nations - including even those with a more western
heritage, such as Australia - resent the US efforts to link its own values,
such as human rights, market economics and democracy, to trade. Asian
leaders look at a US beset by budget deficits, governmental gridlock and
violent crime, and question whether this is a price worth paying for greater
democracy.
Third, many Asian members of Apec have shown reluctance in Seattle to get
sucked into grandiose US schemes for Mr Clinton's 'new Pacific community,'
in which Apec could play the same role of anchoring peace and prosperity in
Asia that Nato played in weathering the Cold War in Europe. Several
countries remained wary of any attempt to institutionalise Apec with larger
bureaucracy and more regular meetings.
US officials describe these reticences as 'birthing pangs,' and for all
their doubts, Apec leaders took several steps in the US's direction. They
agreed tariff cuts as a token of sincerity in final Gatt negotiations,
accepted the US proposal for a meeting of Apec finance ministers, and agreed
on a leaders' summit in Indonesia next year.
But the US's Asia vision has a long way to go before, as Mr Clinton hoped,
'future generations may look back and say they can't imagine how the
Asian-Pacific region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony without
the existence of Apec'.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Hosokawa wins respite in battle on market access
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's government has won a breathing space to press ahead with its
political reforms before it faces more US pressure to open its markets and
stimulate its economy.
US officials are increasingly convinced that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's
prime minister, is bringing real change to his country's political system,
and are willing to wait until he can win this battle in the Japanese
parliament before pressing their demands for access to the Japanese market.
President Bill Clinton, fresh from a bruising struggle to win congressional
approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, sympathises with Mr
Hosokawa's political difficulties.
'The president clearly sees political reform as Hosokawa's Nafta,' a senior
administration official said, echoing Mr Hosokawa who said the next
legislative hurdle, in the upper house, for his reform plans would be just
as difficult as the Nafta debate was in the US.
US officials insisted they were not disappointed that the bilateral meeting
had yielded no specific progress either on opening the Japanese rice market
or on the additional measures to stimulate economic growth that the US
believes Japan should undertake.
Mr Clinton said he hoped the two countries would over the coming months take
action to boost the world economy.
'By next June or July, certainly by a year from now, I believe that the
responsibilities of the United States and Japan to do more to promote global
economic growth will have been in large measure advanced,' he said.
Mr Hosokawa, however, said later that he had no idea what Mr Clinton was
talking about.
Senior US administration officials said they still believed further stimulus
to demand in the Japanese economy would be timely, but said there could be
no question of the US trying to dictate to Japan the size or timing of a tax
cut or tax reform programme.
Progress on bilateral trade issues is unlikely to materialise until the days
before Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa next meet on February 11.
'The pattern historically is that change occurs at the eleventh hour. We
will have to see if the three key areas of procurement, insurance and
automobiles yield concrete results or not,' a senior administration official
said.
But Mr Hosokawa repeated Japan's opposition to setting numerical targets for
foreign market shares, and insisted that the bilateral trade talks could not
be a one-way street.
'We will do our best with regard to market access, but efforts will have to
be made on the US side to improve its competitiveness,' Mr Hosokawa said.

SAUDI ARABIA
If Saudi newspapers reflect official policy, Israel would be wise not to
begin counting its diplomatic and economic chickens in the Middle East
before the outline peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation is well and truly hatched. Whatever progress Israel may have
made on softening a formerly hostile media in other parts of the world, for
journalists in Saudi Arabia it remains a subject ripe for plucking.
The visit to Washington last week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, was a chance not to be missed. 'Peace dividends or fruits of
aggression?' was the rhetorical question posed on the opinion page of the
daily Arab News. 'Jewish leaders are making use of the (PLO) agreement to
rob the world powers and force them to respond blindly to their demands', it
maintained of Mr Rabin's talks with President Bill Clinton.
Elsewhere editorial writers contrasted what they saw as the urgent need for
financial help in the Palestinian territories, with 'American taxpayers'
money showering down on Israel with hardly any restraint.' They professed
amazement 'at how far the US is bending over backwards to try to please the
Israelis'.
Why they should be amazed is more difficult to guage when Saturday's leader
column in the Saudi Gazette explained that the US is prone to 'occasional
fits of madness'. It mattered not to the writer that the US galloped to the
rescue when Iraq invaded Kuwait, presumably in one of its saner moments.
What so upset him was the US and the UN 'tightening the noose of sanctions
around Libya's neck' and trying to impose some sort of 'biblical justice' on
an Arab people at a time when genocide was continuing against the Moslems of
Bosnia.
For the record: Saudi Arabia officially supports the Israeli-PLO peace
process and is closely allied to the US; it is disgusted with the response
of the US and the Europeans to events in former Yugoslavia; and local
newspapers do not get much opportunity for expressing strong opinions on
events closer to home.
NIGERIA
General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's new military leader, can expect a rough ride
from the local press, even though his first action was to allow some
national dailies banned since last July back on the streets.
If the state of a country's press were the only yardstick, democracy would
seem to be flourishing in Nigeria. Few countries in Africa can boast such an
array of newspapers - over a dozen on sale each day in Lagos, and at least a
dozen more available in the rest of the country. It takes more than a coup
to inhibit editors who have had to work under military governments for more
than 20 of the 30 years since independence.
Not surprisingly, Gen Abacha's removal of Chief Ernest Shonekan, civilian
head of a military-backed government, pushed the clamour against a
seven-fold increase in fuel prices off the front pages.
'Shonekan resigns, Abacha takes over government' ran the Guardian's headline
on Thursday, before the full impact of the action by the military to oust Mr
Shonekan had become clear. By Saturday the impact of Gen Abacha's abolition
of all elected civilian bodies was sinking in.
The Guardian, the most respected independent daily in Nigeria, also reported
the first foreign reaction. Under the heading 'Britain deplores change', it
quoted foreign secretary Douglas Hurd's condemnation of military rule.
ITALY
With such headlines as 'The War of the Mayors' and 'Mayors of the new
Italy', the outcome of municipal elections dominated the Italian press last
week, pushing aside the endless flow of corruption revelations.
La Repubblica summed up the political battle by saying: 'Occhetto versus
Bossi and Fini, Martinazzoli risks his job.' Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of
the formerly communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) is attempting to
demonstrate that the Italian left at last is a credible contender for
national government. To do this, the PDS no longer has to beat its historic
rival, the Christian Democrats, but rather the protest vote on the right of
Mr Umberto Bossi's populist northern League and the neo-fascist MSI of Mr
Gianfranco Fini.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, according to Le Repubblica, risks losing the
leadership of the Christian Democrats if the party performs poorly - as all
the papers predict. Corriere della Serra yesterday observed that the
Christian Democrats were relying on the 'Truman effect' - a reference to the
US president's surprise victory in 1948.
Corriere's chief cartoonist sets the scene with the unseasonal cold weather.
Headlined 'The forecast', the cartoon shows Mr Bossi pushing a snowball down
from the icy north towards central Italy which in turn is receiving the cold
wind of the right (a reference to the strong right-wing protest vote
expected in Rome), and Mr Martinazzoli under an umbrella in the south.
The one piece of good news agreed by all was Italy's success in securing a
place in the World Cup.
IRELAND
It was soccer too which drew the biggest headlines in the Irish Republic's
press, overshadowing London's and Dublin's latest peace efforts for Northern
Ireland.
The World Cup qualifying round between the Republic of Ireland and Northern
Ireland last Wednesday was played at Belfast's Windsor Park in front of an
almost exclusively, and very hostile, Protestant crowd. The one-all draw was
sufficient for the Republic to qualify, but more important for the political
columnists, the match provided a handy juxtaposition for them to score their
own points.
As one in the Irish Times wrote, the match 'may have done more than acres of
print and yards of film to give outsiders a whiff of the poisoned gas of
communal conflict'.
More sportingly, Fintan O'Toole, also of the Irish Times, who described how
out of consideration for his physical integrity he spent the match
pretending he was a Protestant, had an upbeat view of the result. It
produced, he said, 'something it's hard to see in Belfast - triumph without
victory, joy for one side without defeat for the other, pride at nobody's
expense, a game in which everybody has won'.
The Irish government must have thought it had scored an own goal last
Friday, when it discovered its negotiating position revealed in full detail
in the Irish Press daily paper. Who leaked the story? Some papers pointed to
an emerging conflict within the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition.
Expectations are high for a positive outcome to the political final - the
Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month, but the commentators are preparing
their readers for what might be an inconclusive draw on home ground.

<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, returned from a 10-day visit to
North America yesterday triumphantly saying he had won US economic and
defence assurances which would bolster the Middle East peace process.
The strengthening of Israeli-US relations, a key factor in the electoral
victory by Mr Rabin's Labour party last year, is critical for the prime
minister to continue to win Israeli domestic support for his peace drive.
Mr Rabin said President Bill Clinton had promised to maintain Israel's
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) aid package for 1995 and 'later on', despite a
shrinking US foreign aid budget, and had agreed to supply Israel with
advanced aircraft and other missile and weapon systems. The US had also
agreed to lift current barriers on Israeli purchases of advanced US
technology, including supercomputers, which would ensure Israel's military
edge over Arab states.
Israel, the prime minister said, hoped to get a significant quantity of US
military surplus equipment, such as 50 F16A jet fighters over the next two
years. The weapons would be supplied 'almost for free' because of cuts in
the size of the US military.
'The US understands our security needs,' Mr Rabin said at Ben-Gurion
airport.
Mr Rabin said he had also discussed peace talks with Palestinians, Jordan
and Syria, to prepare for the visit of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state, to the region next month and he indicated he favoured US-brokered
secret talks with Damascus.

Hopes of even a partial settlement to Anglo-Chinese differences about Hong
Kong's political development diminished at the weekend when Beijing hardened
its position in the 16th round of bilateral talks, writes Simon Holberton in
Hong Kong.
It is understood that during the two days of negotiations in Beijing Chinese
officials backed off from an offer to settle the so-called non-controversial
aspects of Governor Chris Patten's plans for Hong Kong's democratic
development.
The two sides resolved, however, to hold a 17th round of talks in the
Chinese capital, starting on Friday, on arrangements for the colony's 1994
and 1995 elections. This could be the last round if the UK stands by Mr
Patten's legislative timetable calling for the introduction of his bill on
December 8.
The Foreign Office official leading the British team said another round of
talks was consistent 'with our hope of a faster rhythm of discussions from
now'.

<TEXT>
Bangladesh is sending 700 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait frontier to bolster the
United Nations force monitoring the volatile border, Agencies report.
A Bangladeshi official said the deployment was 'in response to a
long-standing request from the UN'.
A UN spokesman said: 'The Bangladeshis will be armed and under certain
circumstances they will be able to open fire.'
The zone has been patrolled by the UN since shortly after the end of the
1991 Gulf War that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait after a seven-month
occupation. Iraq has not recognised the border demarcated by the UN about a
year ago.
On Saturday, more than 500 Iraqis, mostly women and children, crossed into
Kuwait to protest at work on a trench which the emirate is digging along the
disputed border.
A Kuwaiti contractor working on the trench fired a shot in the air after the
Iraqis started throwing stones, said a spokesman for the UN Iraq-Kuwait
observer mission.
The US State Department condemned the border crossing, the second such
incursion in a week.
Shooting incidents along the 130 mile line have escalated since work on the
trench reached Abdali where scores of Iraqi farmers still live. Kuwait has
also reported several border shootings at its posts.
The border line, drawn by a UN commission a year ago, also put 11 oil wells
and an abandoned naval base that used to be in Iraq on the Kuwaiti side.
Kuwait says it will compensate Iraqi farmers who lost their farms.

Nigeria's military government has reduced last week's increase in the petrol
price from N5 to N3.25 a litre in a deal with labour unions which ends the
week-long general strike, reports Paul Adams in Lagos.
After meeting senior government officials, the Nigeria Labour Congress said
it recognised the need for some increase in fuel prices but argued that N5
per litre was too high. The unions will continue to negotiate for transport
allowances to offset the big rise in fares by transporters since fuel prices
went up.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Donors to debate Kenya aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting of Kenya's donors in Paris today is expected to restore a measure
of financial assistance to President Daniel arap Moi's government despite
continuing concern over corruption and tribal massacres.
Diplomats in Nairobi say governments are torn between the wish to support
the economic reforms of Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's progressive finance
minister, and their alarm at Kenya's deteriorating political situation.
Two years ago, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and donor
governments suspended balance of payments support to Kenya after a series of
broken promises on political and economic reforms. The aid was worth Dollars
350m (Pounds 234.8m) a year. Its loss plunged the economy into recession and
led to an accumulation of Dollars 700m in debt-servicing arrears.
Most donors agree Kenya has made impressive economic strides in the past six
months.
However, progress has been overshadowed by the treatment of Kikuyu peasants,
Kenya's largest ethnic group. More than 1,000 have been killed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of China's worst industrial accidents, in Shenzhen, the country's
showcase for economic reform, has underlined the other side of the country's
astonishing modernisation drive - the parlous state of workplace safety and
conditions, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
More than 100 workers, mainly young women, were killed and injured when a
toy factory caught fire late on Friday night. By yesterday the death toll
had risen to 81 and injuries, mostly burns, to 31.
Faulty wiring was blamed for the fire in the Zhili toy factory, a Sino-Hong
Kong joint venture employing 200 in the town of Kuiyong, about 25km
north-east of the Hong Kong border.
But the scale of casualties reflected the factory owner's practice of
barring the doors and windows to keep people inside the factory during
working hours. More than 50 bodies were found piled up behind a locked gate.
In 1992, more than 15,000 workers were killed in industrial accidents,
confirming fears held by such institutions as the International Labor
Organisation that safety standards in China are extremely lax.
Chinese officials blamed last year's casualty rate - which was 3 per cent
higher than in 1991 - on 'negligence at some enterprises which tried to gain
higher output at the expense of workers' safety'. A Shenzhen government
official yesterday attacked foreign investors, particularly those from Hong
Kong, for trying 'to save money by installing below-standard safety
facilities.'

FT  22 NOV 93 / Nigerian report attacks leakage in state funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A confidential report for Nigeria's deposed civilian leader attacks
widespread leakages in state funds and urges an investigation into Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of oil receipts paid into special project accounts in the
first half of this year.
The report also reveals that the mid-year limit for this year's national
budget has been overshot, with the deficit reaching N26bn, far in excess of
the N15.6bn target and little short of the N31.1bn deficit approved for the
full 12 months. It also warns of 'huge' defence ministry debts.
The disclosures come as Britain and its Western European Union partners meet
in Luxembourg today to consider sanctions against Nigeria's new military
government.
The 60-page document, 'Final Report of the Budget Monitoring Committee', was
commissioned earlier this year by Chief Ernest Shonekan, civilian leader of
the military-backed interim government. He was forced to resign last week by
General Sani Abacha, the defence minister who is now the new head of state.
The report, handed to Mr Shonekan on August 24, criticises 'leakages' of
state funds, condemns unviable multi-billion dollar projects, and shows up
mismanagement and uncontrolled state spending under Gen Ibrahim Babangida,
who stepped down last August.
Western diplomats and aid officials, who gave access to the report, say that
the committee's efforts to make government spending more transparent and to
ensure independent audit of the operations of the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) were largely frustrated by the
country's generals. The military feared exposure of the corruption that
pervades the political system, they said.
In the first half of this year, says the report, oil sales worth 'a total
sum of Dollars 1.537bn was paid into various dedicated accounts'. The
committee complains it 'was unable to have access to detailed information on
the operation of these accounts', set up under Gen Babangida to meet the
foreign exchange costs of projects such as a proposed liquefied natural gas
plant. The committee advocates 'a clearly defined reporting process' for
revenue earning agencies, 'particularly' for the NNPC 'so that the reason
for the large shortfalls in revenue' in the first half of the year 'can be
identified and leakages blocked'.
The report expresses concern about 'non-payment of revenue of N1.1bn
expected from the sale of domestic crude oil lifted and refined by NNPC for
local consumption' in the first six months of this year.
The report notes that the ministry of defence has 'accumulated huge debts
which government is not in a financial position to honour at the moment' and
criticises the 'considerable cost of keeping procured weapons in warehouses
abroad'.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Brazil corruption hearings strain party

<TEXT>
Senior politicians from the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement
(PMDB), the country's largest party, are holding talks which could lead to a
split in its ranks ahead of next year's presidential elections.
The talks reflect worries that the party has been seriously harmed by
corruption hearings which are under way in Congress.
The hearings, which have accused several leading PMDB figures of corruption,
are also seen to be helping the presidential ambitions of Mr Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, the candidate of the left-wing Workers Party (PT).
Politicians from the PMDB's so-called 'ethical' wing, which has not been
tainted by the hearings, are considering whether to try to link with the
country's other centre-left party, that of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the
finance minister. The alliance would then be likely to support the
presidential bid either of Mr Antonio Britto, a PMDB minister, or Mr
Cardoso.
Such an alliance is complicated by regional factors. In states where both
groups are strong, for example, one side would need to agree not to run
candidates in congressional and gubernatorial elections, also set for next
year.
But, according to some PMDB figures, an alliance is the best way to split
from the competing wing of the party, which has been involved in the
corruption allegations and is controlled by Mr Orestes Quercia, the still
powerful former governor of Sao Paulo state.
In the hearings, investigating allegations of corruption schemes involving
funds from the government's budget, five of the eight main individuals so
far accused come from Mr Quercia's faction.
Any alliance would probably have to be agreed before Christmas, in order to
comply with election rules on party affiliation. The shortage of time means
the two sides may agree to an unwritten understanding rather than a formal
alliance.
However, opinion polls released yesterday suggest the party needs to act
quickly.
Since August the popularity of 'Lula', as the PT candidate is known, has
increased by four percentage points to 31 per cent. His nearest likely
contestant is Mr Paulo Maluf, the right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, with 12 per
cent, while Mr Cardoso is stuck on 7 per cent.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Headway in Congress on gun control: Clinton plans crime
crusade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US congressional leaders were yesterday negotiating a final version of gun
control legislation, after the Senate, under extreme public pressure, passed
a bill on the issue by 63 votes to 36.
The Brady Bill, named after its chief proponent Mr James Brady, who was
wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, imposes
a waiting period of five business days on the purchase of hand guns. The
waiting period would give dealers time to check the background of gun
purchasers.
The Senate decision came in response to a flood of voters' telephone calls
at the weekend which forced Republicans to abandon a filibuster that had
threatened to scuttle the legislation.
'It's time to put the Brady bill behind us,' said Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican leader yesterday. Nonetheless, he voted against the bill.
The bill provides for Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) in funding to establish a
nationwide computerised system for the instant record check on would-be gun
purchasers. This is designed to keep guns out of the hands of convicted
criminals and the mentally ill.
Mr Brady, a haunting figure in his wheelchair as he lobbied for the
legislation, said he was glad the Republicans had 'come to their senses' to
end the filibuster. 'The way to stop the carnage on the street is with this
small step,' he said.
A separate crime bill, passed by the Senate, has additional gun control
measures in a ban on the production and sale of some semi-automatic assault
weapons, a ban on the sale of hand guns to juveniles and an end to the sale
of armour-piercing bullets.
While these measures are minimal by international standards, many individual
states have moved to tighten gun control rules even further. Senator Patrick
Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has talked of taxing the sale of ammunition.
President Bill Clinton has suggested he might be willing to ban sales of
some types of bullet.
Now that anti-crime legislation is due to be signed, Mr Clinton is preparing
a public crusade against law-breaking.
According to the Washington Post, an inter-agency group including
presidential aide Mr David Gurgen is planning a number of presidential trips
to stress community efforts against crime. The president is expected to link
it to family issues.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Corruption curbs Czech crackdown: The country has yet to set
up an intelligence service untainted by the former regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years after the revolution that swept away communism, the Czech
republic is stepping up efforts to co-operate with western intelligence and
police agencies in the struggle against international arms and drugs
smugglers.
However, the Czechs have yet to establish an intelligence service that is
reliable and untainted by the former regime.
As a result, there is concern that inexperience, slack controls and
corruption are severely constraining the drive against organised crime.
A new Czech intelligence service (BIS) was established at the end of last
year, in the second reorganisation of the security services since the
revolution.
BIS has particular links with Britain's MI5 and MI6, as well as with
Germany's BND. It has also forged ties with the international police
organisation Interpol.
Co-operation is taking place with Moscow, too. Last May, Mr Yevgeny
Primakov, director of the Russian foreign intelligence service, paid a
discreet visit to Prague in an attempt to improve contacts.
However, former employees of the secret police (StB), many of whom still
work in the Czech security services, are believed to be using their
connections and access for illicit purposes.
Two months ago Mr Vaclav Benda, chairman of the Christian Democratic party
(KDH) termed as unacceptable the presence of roughly 65 former StB employees
in the reorganised BIS.
Several cases of illegal bugging - notably, within Justice Ministry offices
 -and the theft and sale of classified Interior Ministry information have
been reported in recent months.
Among scandals involving former StB agents, the most notorious is an alleged
attempt to blackmail Mr Viktor Kozeny, head of one of the country's largest
investment funds. The alleged blackmailer, who is currently standing trial,
is said to have used information gathered by the StB in his attempt to
extort money from Mr Kozeny.
Since the fall of communism, illicit activities of all kinds have
proliferated. They include money laundering, extortion, drugs running,
racketeering, prostitution, and trade in weapons, explosives, radioactive
materials, stolen cars and pirated videos.
White collar or economic crimes have also risen exceptionally quickly,
growing 75 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 compared with the same
period in 1992, according to Czech police statistics.
Large quantities of Semtex explosive destined to be sold on the black market
have been seized by Czech police since the spring, and several weapons
caches have been found.
Before the revolution, the former Czechoslovakia was among the world's 10
largest exporters of weaponry, ranging from tanks to small arms.
Large amounts of weapons were left behind as Soviet troops withdrew
following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact military alliance.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Western banks plunged into Russian politics: A pre-election
financial curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the issue of a single presidential decree, western bankers have become
embroiled in the politics of the Russian elections.
Three weeks before the elections to a new parliament, the Russian government
has imposed restrictions which it condemned as reactionary when they were
demanded by the old parliament. A presidential decree published at the end
of last week prevents banks that are more than 50 per cent foreign-owned and
have not begun serving residents from doing so until January 1996.
Only two of the dozen western banks that have already received licences to
take deposits from Russian customers are spared, because their Russian
subsidiaries are already up and running. They are Credit Lyonnais Russie and
BNP-Dresdner Bank's joint subsidiary, both of which are in St Petersburg,
rather than Moscow, the country's banking capital.
Banks affected by the decree are: Chase Manhattan and Citibank of the US;
France's Societe Generale; the Netherlands' ING Bank and ABN-Amro Bank;
Credit Suisse; Bank of China; and Turkey's Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi, which
planned to take a 51 per cent stake in a joint venture bank with Russia's
Tokobank.
'How can you give out a banking licence and then a few weeks later say
'Sorry, we've changed our minds',' said one western executive involved in
the Yapi ve Kredi project, which only got its licence on November 1. 'It's
ridiculous but we'll just have to figure out some new arrangement.' One
solution might be for Yapi to reduce its shareholding to 50 per cent but
take priority over Tokobank in decision-making.
The western banks had no plans to take deposits from Russian individuals,
but the decree deprives them of the opportunity to work with Russian
enterprises including lucrative joint ventures with foreign shareholders.
The decree was signed the day after a meeting between leading Russian
bankers and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, who heads the
Russia's Choice electoral bloc. It fits in with the protectionist promises
of other large parties competing in the December 12 elections.
Apart from the desire to satisfy the powerful banks that are supplying much
of the campaign finance, the decree is also part of efforts by radical
government ministers to undermine Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank
chairman, who granted the licences.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said on Friday the decree was in
line with international practice and intended to protect Russian banks' from
losing their best clients and staff at a critical stage in their
development.
Banks point to the more than Dollars 3bn accumulated by the International
Moscow Bank, the first bank with foreign capital to open in Moscow, to
illustrate their claims that prestigious western banks will steal their
prized currency deposits without putting more money back into the economy.
They also point to the fact that IMB has lent a much smaller proportion of
funds to the Russian economy than top Russian commercial banks.

Armenia, which has devoted much of its wealth to fighting a war with
Azerbaijan, today introduces its own currency, the dram, after much
hesitation in abandoning the rouble, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
Moldova, another former Soviet republic involved in ethnic strife, plans to
introduce its own currency on November 29. This leaves only Belarus, which
is negotiating full monetary and economic union with Moscow, and Tajikistan,
sharing the rouble with Russia.
Meanwhile, Lithuania, one of the first republics to leave the Russian
economic orbit, has concluded a trade pact with Russia to restore trading
links built up during five decades of Soviet rule.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Secret services unite against crime: The Cold War's end has
forced agencies to find a new role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS, JIMMY BURNS, ROBERT GRAHAM and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across Europe, secret services are coming in from the cold, as they search
for new roles and greater public acceptability after the demise of
superpower confrontation.
Governments are searching for value for money, while electorates have grown
increasingly wary of secret service power and lack of accountability.
The response has been two-fold. On the functional side, Europe's secret
services have pooled their efforts against cross-border terrorism, and are
stepping up co-operation to combat a sharp rise in organised crime stemming
from the former Soviet bloc.
On the public relations side, countries such as Britain and Italy, whose
intelligence services have traditionally been subject to little public
scrutiny, are being forced to shift towards more open practices, similar to
those of Germany and the Netherlands.
Britain's MI5 and MI6 and Germany's BND have quickly emerged as the key
players in the struggle against drugs trafficking, arms-running and weapons
proliferation. But intelligence agencies from now-democratic eastern Europe
are also being drawn into the fray.
Links with the Russian intelligence service, the successor to the KGB, have
been hampered by Moscow's admission that it is still spying on the west,
particularly for scientific and industrial intelligence.
But MI5 has held training courses for members of the Czech, Hungarian and
Polish intelligence services, designed to remodel these organisations on
western lines.
A spokesman for Germany's BND confirmed last week that 'contacts' exist with
eastern European intelligence agencies in areas such as drugs and money
laundering as well as terrorism.
The Czech republic is a particular focus for attention. Since the beginning
of the year about 20 clandestine drugs laboratories have been uncovered
there by the Czech police. Police estimate 70 per cent of drugs entering
Germany pass through the Czech Republic on their way to western Europe from
the Middle East, the former Soviet Union and Latin America.
The Italian secret services, in the throes of radical reorganisation after
widespread revelations of serious malpractice, are also believed to have
intensified contacts with the Czech republic, Ukraine and Albania to combat
the activities of gangs with possible Mafia links. 'The conquest of markets
these days is more important than the defence of territory,' according to
one top Italian secret service official.
Italy, meanwhile, has provided a powerful example of the need to subject
intelligence services to adequate political control.
As part of the overall attempt to clean up corruption throughout public
life, magistrates are conducting at least four investigations into Italy's
intelligence services. They are looking into alleged abuse of office,
embezzlement and association with the Mafia.
To avoid such malpractice, the Rome government last month announced a
radical reform of the intelligence services and their merger into a single
co-ordinating agency. This will be controlled directly by the prime
minister's office and answerable to parliament both for its activities and
the use of budgeted funds.
The Intelligence Services Bill announced in London on Friday contains
provision for a parliamentary oversight committee to survey the activities
of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, which appears likely to play a similar role to the
parliamentary committee that scans the German secret services. A similar
committee is in operation in the Netherlands.
There are pockets of resistance to the relaxation in secrecy, with details
of the budget and staff numbers of Spain's Cesid, and of the DGSE and DST -
the foreign and domestic arms of the French intelligence services -
remaining classified. But increased international co-operation among
intelligence services is spurring moves towards greater accountability.
Britain's MI5 has built up particularly strong links to Germany's domestic
intelligence agency, the BfV. Although the BfV is legally barred from
participating in the battle against organised crime, German and British
officials believe that co-operation between the two agencies has helped curb
Irish terrorist attacks against British army bases in Germany in recent
years.
As part of its informal study of German methods, MI5 has even looked at
whether to adopt some elements of the BfV's relatively open approach towards
disseminating information to the press.
Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, has lifted the veil on
some aspects of the service by holding off-the-record conversations with
journalists during the last year. Four months ago, MI5 took the
unprecedented step of issuing a 36-page booklet on its activities.
However, Ms Rimington is unlikely to raise her public profile to the extent
of Mr Eckart Werthebach, the BfV chief, who makes frequent TV appearances. A
European intelligence service chief with close contacts to Mrs Rimington
says he has advised her against becoming a public figure in view of the
threat from the IRA.
A new public relations role for MI6 appears even more unlikely. MI6 has made
clear its reluctance about subjecting its chief, Sir Colin McColl, to even
the limited public exposure given to Mrs Rimington. MI6 argues it already
faces considerable government checks and balances.
In an example of the limitations on MI6 disclosure, Baroness Daphne Park, a
former MI6 controller, has been given clearance to answer questions on
British TV. An interview is being screened tonight in which she talks of the
information MI6 provided to the UK government before the August 1991 coup
against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president.
Although Baroness Park (who retired from a key intelligence role in 1980) is
the most senior MI6 figure ever to speak on British TV, she gives no
significant insights into MI6 policy. By contrast, Mr Konrad Porzner, the
head of the German BND, already related in a German press interview during
the summer how his agency gave the Bonn government forewarning of the August
1991 coup.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Government spending curbs hit drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drug sales in Europe have stagnated in the wake of reforms aimed at curbing
spending on pharmaceuticals in Germany, Italy and the UK.
Sales in pharmacies in the seven biggest European markets, which together
form the world's biggest drugs market, were static at constant exchange
rates during the first nine months of this year, according to IMS
International, the market research group.
In dollar terms they fell from Dollars 38.4bn (Pounds 25.7bn) in the first
three quarters of 1992 to Dollars 34bn in the same period this year.
Further reforms to limit pharmaceuticals spending, recently announced in
Spain and Portugal, will add to the pressure on sales. France is also
expected to reveal a new drug pricing scheme.
Pharmaceuticals companies are also struggling with sluggish growth in the
US, the world's biggest single market. This grew only 4 per cent from
Dollars 31.9bn to Dollars 33.2bn. Sales have been held back by the growing
power of bulk buyers of health services who can negotiate ever-greater
discounts.
The Japanese market, the world's second largest single market, rose 13 per
cent in yen-terms from Dollars 11.3bn to Dollars 14.6bn.
However, a 7 per cent price cut is expected to be introduced next year by
the ministry of health and welfare.
The slowdown in Europe was mostly the result of a collapse in sales in
Germany, Europe's largest market. These dropped from Dollars 10.9bn to
Dollars 9.3bn, a fall of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates.
German pharmaceuticals groups, often highly dependent on domestic sales,
suffered by more than the 10 per cent headline figure, however, because of
changes in doctors' prescribing habits, away from expensive patented
products to cheap non-patented ones.
During the first four months, sales at the seven largest research-intensive
drug manufacturers fell 16.5 per cent, while sales at the four largest
generic companies increased 36 per cent, according to the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. As a result, most drugs companies operating in Germany
have announced restructuring programmes.
The Italian market also declined, from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a
drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Caution on Brussels jobless plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European finance ministers will today discuss an ambitious strategy for
halving unemployment in the European Union by the year 2000.
The strategy is outlined in a European Commission report intended as a call
to arms for a common approach on tackling the economic crisis and restoring
European competitiveness.
Ministers are expected to give a cautious welcome, but some member states -
notably the UK and Germany - are likely to resist commitments to specific
targets for job creation, growth and interest rate policy.
The Commission's paper, Restoring Growth and Employment - Strengthening
Convergence, has assumed added significance as a guide to macroeconomic
policy as a result of the collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism
last summer.
Among its chief recommendations are a cut in the EU average of short-term
interest rates of between 2 and 3 percentage points, conditional on curbs in
wage rises and public deficits; a cap on real wage rises set at 1 percentage
point below the rate of productivity; an inflation target of between 2 and 3
per cent; and annual economic growth of 3 per cent from the mid-1990s.
The Commission also appeals for more flexible labour markets and a reduction
in employment taxes, although it remains unclear how Brussels intends to
propose funding these ideas.
Inside the Commission, officials are divided on whether to recover the loss
in revenue through taxes on pollutants such as carbon dioxide, higher value
added tax, or taxes on income from savings and investment. Another proposal
is to penalise equipment deemed to be polluting, though this has been
condemned in some quarters as a threat to the internal market.
Pro-labour forces are also pressing for a tax on capital to offset the
sacrifices which employers and governments are expected to require from
trade unions. They hope to receive a sympathetic hearing from Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the Commission, who appears to have abandoned his
earlier trial balloon in favour of a tax on speculative capital flows.
Mr Delors is close to completing his separate White Paper on competitiveness
for the Brussels summit next month. Finance ministers led by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, are pressing hard to examine the
White Paper ahead of the summit to test whether the Commission has
incorporated members' submissions.
However, Mr Delors is said to be reluctant to hand over the whole Commission
document, arguing that it would risk being mutilated by those seeking to
strengthen their anti-Brussels credentials at home.
The Delors White Paper offers a framework for public discussion rather than
directives for action. Though similar in content, the macroeconomic
guidelines carry more formal weight since they have to be adopted by EU
leaders under the Maastricht treaty.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Finance ministers plan tighter banking supervision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers are close to a deal on proposals to
strengthen banking supervisory authorities in the wake of the collapse of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Ministers from the Twelve will today review a Belgian presidency document
which paves the way for tighter supervision of all financial institutions,
including banks, credit institutions, and insurance businesses.
A central feature of the proposal is the requirement for transparent
operations. The idea is to make it easier for the regulatory authorities and
auditors to establish the financial soundness of a financial institution
and, if necessary, prepare a case for intervention.
Other proposals for avoiding a BCCI-style scandal include:
A requirement that financial institutions maintain their head offices in the
same member state as their registered offices.
An extension of the list of bodies with which confidential supervisory and
prudential information can be exchanged by the authorities.
Guidelines on whether auditors should be allowed to extend the scope of
their reporting beyond the affairs of a specific financial institution to a
group as a whole. This could allow auditors to track down, say, suspicious
intra-company loans or outstanding debts.
The Belgian presidency of the EU and the European Commission have been
co-operating to iron out last-minute difficulties. A UK diplomat last week
predicted there was a good chance of agreement.

Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday said his
government would consider new measures to revitalise France's sluggish
economy in an attempt to curb the rise in unemployment, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris.
The government has already launched a job creation programme of public works
and employment reform. However Mr Balladur plans a special meeting of
ministers at the end of the winter to decide whether additional measures are
needed. One priority will be to reduce youth unemployment, now running at 20
per cent, almost twice the national average.

   BEAUNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Burgundy wine prices yesterday fell for a record fourth consecutive year at
France's most renowned annual auction, reflecting a lacklustre world economy
and overflowing supplies, writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell from Beaune.
Total bidding at the Hospices de Beaune auction of 1993 wines raised
FFr10.6m (Pounds 1.2m) for 759 casks compared with FFr11.85m for 663 barrels
last year.
Red wine prices fell by 25 per cent, and white wine by an average of 7 per
cent. The Cuve Clos de la Roche fetched the highest price of FFr32,000 per
barrel of 300 bottles.
The drop in prices reflected lack of interest in the more expensive
Burgundies. Significant, however, was the prominence of buyers on behalf of
supermarkets, a recent development for high-class Burgundies.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Italy's Christian Democrats suffer poll humiliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political map of Italy was further shaken yesterday by the collapse of
support for the long-ruling Christian Democrat party and its allies in
partial municipal elections.
According to usually reliable exit polls, the Northern League of Mr Umberto
Bossi strengthened its hold in northern Italy, and the former communist
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) managed to forge a successful series of
alliances throughout the country.
At the same time, Christian Democrat votes and those of its three other
allies that form the basis of the Ciampi government's parliamentary majority
 -the Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - switched in central and
southern Italy to the neo-fascist MSI. In Sicily this vote switched to the
progressive Catholic movement, La Rete (The Network) of Mr Leoluca Orlando.
Mr Orlando, on the basis of exit polls, looked set to be the sole mayoral
candidate to achieve an absolute majority on the first round. Campaigning on
a clean government and anti-Mafia ticket, this represented a huge vote
against corruption and organised crime.
Yesterday's municipal elections involved 1.1m voters, almost a quarter of
the electorate, in 428 towns and cities.
The Christian Democrat vote dropped in many places to below 10 per cent,
compared to almost 30 per cent in previous polls.
The result is likely to increase pressure for early general elections in the
first quarter of next year. It is also likely to put pressure on Mr Mino
Martinazzoli to resign from the Christian Democrat leadership.
Under new laws approved in March, mayoral candidates have to get an absolute
majority in the first round or face a run-off on December 5.
The run-off in Naples will be between the PDS alliance and the MSI, whose
candidate is Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of fascist dictator Benito
Mussolini.

Greece's central bank governor, Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, resigned at the
weekend in response to pressures from the new socialist government.
Mr Christodoulou, a former economy minister appointed by the previous
conservative government, said he was stepping down to make way for someone
'closer to the government's political conviction'.
Although the socialists had been expected to sack Mr Christodoulou because
of his close connections with the opposition New Democracy party, the timing
of his departure was a surprise.
The favourite to take over as central bank governor is Mr Ioannis Boutos,
another former economy minister who is close to Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Drug sales sickly as health ministries strive to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drug sales in Europe have stagnated in the wake of reforms aimed at curbing
spending on pharmaceuticals in Germany, Italy and the UK.
Sales in pharmacies in the seven biggest European markets, which together
form the world's biggest drugs market, were static at constant exchange
rates during the first nine months of this year, according to IMS
International, the market research group. In dollar terms they fell from
Dollars 38.4bn (Pounds 25.7bn) in the first three quarters of 1992 to
Dollars 34bn in the same period this year.
Further reforms to limit pharmaceuticals spending, recently announced in
Spain and Portugal, will add to the pressure on sales. France is also
expected to reveal a new drug pricing scheme.
Pharmaceuticals companies are also struggling with sluggish growth in the
US, the world's biggest single market. This grew only 4 per cent from
Dollars 31.9bn to Dollars 33.2bn. Sales have been held back by the growing
power of bulk buyers of health services who can negotiate ever-greater
discounts.
The Japanese market, the world's second largest single market, rose 13 per
cent in yen-terms, up from Dollars 11.3bn to Dollars 14.6bn. However, a 7
per cent price cut is expected to be introduced next year by the ministry of
health and welfare.
The slowdown in Europe was mostly the result of a collapse in sales in
Germany, Europe's largest market. These dropped from Dollars 10.9bn to
Dollars 9.3bn, a fall of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. German
pharmaceuticals groups, often highly dependent on domestic sales, suffered
by more than the 10 per cent headline figure, however, because of changes in
doctors' prescribing habits, away from expensive patented products to cheap
non-patented ones.
During the first four months, sales at the seven largest research-intensive
drug manufacturers fell 16.5 per cent, while sales at the four largest
generic companies increased 36 per cent, according to the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. As a result, most drugs companies operating in Germany
have announced restructuring programmes.
The Italian market also declined, from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a
drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies.
Drugs sales, excluding exchange rates, increased in five of the seven
largest European markets. French pharmacy drug purchases rose from Dollars
8.93bn to Dollars 8.96bn, an increase of 6 per cent at constant rates. Drugs
purchases in the UK fell in dollar terms from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars
3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency.
The Spanish market was one of the strongest in Europe. Although sales fell
in dollar terms from Dollars 3.7bn to Dollars 3.3bn, they rose 12 per cent
excluding currencies. The Dutch market was also strong, registering a 12 per
cent rise, although the market was static in dollar terms at Dollars 1.1bn.
The Belgian market was also static at Dollars 1.1bn, but increased 5 per
cent excluding currencies.
However, growth in France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium was
insufficient to offset the decline in Germany and Italy.
In the seven largest European markets, the hardest hit categories of drugs
have been for cardiovascular problems, muscular-skeletal complaints such as
arthritis, and blood agents , for which all registered sales declines
compared with the first nine months of last year. Sales of alimentary and
metabolism drugs, mostly for ailments such as stomach ulcers, were static.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Airline merger hopes dashed by rift over US link: European
carriers call off talks on alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most ambitious European mergers ever attempted collapsed
yesterday after KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines
System and Austrian Airlines failed to agree on a common US airline partner.
The four medium-sized carriers said in a joint statement that they had
decided to abandon their seven months' negotiations because of
'fundamentally different views' on a US partnership.
Swissair blamed KLM for the collapse of the proposed Alcazar alliance, which
had been intended to create a fourth airline force in Europe to compete
against the big three carriers: British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France.
The collapse of the Alcazar project is likely to hasten the consolidation of
the European industry around the strongest groups, such as BA and Lufthansa,
which have already set up global alliances.
Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, said the three other partners
had favoured Delta Air Lines, in which Swissair holds a 5 per cent
cross-equity stake, but KLM ultimately decided to stand by Northwest
Airlines, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake. Mr Loepfe said the four
airlines had started negotiations with the assumption Delta would be the US
partner.
But KLM said that although it wanted to agree a deal, it had concluded that
the merger should go ahead only if Northwest and not Delta was chosen.
The negotiations were described by financial advisers as the most ambitious
attempt to date to form a European cross-border merger, since it involved
six listed companies and six governments (including the three Scandinavian
companies and governments involved in SAS).
Although the four airlines managed to reach broad agreement on several
complex issues - including the valuation of the proposed joint airline's
assets, the location of its headquarters and joint management structure -
the talks remained blocked on the US partnership issue.
Failure of the talks has now left the four airlines with the dilemma of how
to secure their longer-term future in the increasingly competitive and
rapidly consolidating airline industry.
All four sought to put on a brave face yesterday. KLM, which failed in
earlier partnership attempts with Sabena of Belgium and BA, said it had no
plans for the moment to resume merger talks with BA or to seek a separate
deal with SAS.
SAS said it had not dropped the idea of an alliance with one or more
European airlines, but Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman of the SAS
board, said the airline would stand alone for a period to consider its
options: 'This is not a catastrophe.'
Swissair also said it would seek other alliances. Mr Hennes Goetz, the
airline's chairman, recently said if Alcazar flopped, the only option left
for Swissair would be to join forces with Lufthansa, Air France or BA.
Austrian Airlines, the smallest of the four, said it would be considering
co-operation with Swissair and Lufthansa, which said this year that it was
interested in establishing closer ties.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Prince hits at lack of support for royal visits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prince of Wales is frustrated at what he sees as lack of support from
some powerful government departments for royal visits abroad which could
help secure business for Britain.
The prince wants more support for his role as a commercial and cultural
ambassador for Britain when he goes abroad as part of his role as heir to
the throne.
The prince's frustration emerged during his recent tour of the Middle East
when he visited projects involving British companies in Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. A Financial Times correspondent travelled
with the prince and was given full access as he met the Gulf rulers,
government and business leaders.
The prince has tried with little success inviting UK government departments
to co-ordinate a more strategic approach to getting the most out of his
visits.
Fresh attempts are being made by the prince's private office to improve
links with Whitehall, particularly with the DTI, which has itself embarked
on an ambitious programme to help boost British exports.
The prince feels senior officials have underestimated the potential benefits
for UK companies from his role as royal envoy.
According to one of his inner-circle: 'Parts of Whitehall still see royal
visits in an anachronistic way. A certain amount of re-education is required
and is underway.'
During his middle east trip, British businessmen and Arab ministers
frequently endorsed the value of his visit. Mr Peter Marshall, managing
director of John Brown Engineering, which is active in Saudi Arabia, said
the visit should help it conclude a Pounds 110m project management contract.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Major reassures Ulster Protestants over veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major moved to regain the initiative in the Northern Ireland peace
process by reassuring the Protestant majority last night that they retained
a veto over any change in the status of the province.
After the weekend disclosure of fresh talks between Mr John Hume, the Social
Democratic and Labour party leader, and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, Downing
Street flatly rejected any possibility that a revived Hume-Adams peace plan
could form the basis for a political settlement.
The prime minister's office dismissed speculation at the weekend that it
might respond to a cessation of violence with an amnesty for IRA and
loyalist terrorists. Downing Street said that since there were no 'political
prisoners' in Northern Ireland, an amnesty would not arise. It declared that
the presence and number of British troops in the province could not be a
subject for negotiation.
That was coupled with a strong reaffirmation that the government's
'constitutional guarantee' to the people of Northern Ireland meant that the
democratic rights of the majority would never be prejudiced.
Mr Major's determined move to reassure the Protestant majority - and above
all Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists - followed signs in recent days of
growing unease among moderate Unionists over the direction of the peace
process.
The leak of draft proposals from the Dublin government on its terms for a
political settlement risked threatening the Ulster Unionists' acquiescence
in Mr Major's negotiations with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister.
Mr Major is relying on the support of the nine Ulster Unionists MPs to get
through controversial legislation at Westminster. The prime minister is also
aware that without Mr Molyneaux's backing it will be impossible to secure an
Ulster settlement.
Officials said detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the
1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fell far short of Dublin's call for a significant
element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province,
although it recognised Dublin's aspiration to a united Ireland.
Downing Street said that Mr Major remained determined to press ahead with
negotiations to secure a political settlement in close co-operation with Mr
Reynolds.
The Irish prime minister yesterday offered an upbeat assessment of the
possibility of a permanent cessation of violence by the IRA and its loyalist
counterparts. Mr Reynolds also distanced himself, though rather more gently
than the British government, from the Hume-Adams initiative.
However, the differences between the two leaders over the route to a
settlement have been reflected in wrangling over the date of the planned
Anglo-Irish summit in Dublin next month. Irish officials insisted the date
had been set for December 3. But British officials suggested Mr Major
thought more time might be needed to decide the framework for a political
settlement.
Officials said the government would review the number of troops needed in
the province if there were a permanent cessation of violence.

FT  22 NOV 93 / Monday FT: A new start to the week - Richard Lambert, the
editor, explains changes to features and services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, the editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's Monday FT has a number of new features and services. Our aim is to
provide readers with a lively and authoritative guide by highlighting the
events and trends which could shape their week.
The new Monday FT will include:
The FT Guide to the Week Ahead on the back page of section II.
Significantly expanded coverage in section II of what could be in store for
companies and markets. Peter Martin, financial editor, explores global
investment trends. A special table analyses worldwide investment returns.
Peter Norman, economics editor, and Edward Balls of our leader writing team
look at emerging economic policy debates.
Special reports on the week ahead for companies, the international bond,
equity and foreign exchange markets.
A new page taking a fresh look every week at the increasingly popular
emerging financial markets, especially in Asia and Latin America.
The FT Guide to World Currencies, normally published on Tuesdays, will now
provide this comprehensive exchange
rate information at the
start of the business week.
Four new features in the first section of the newspaper: a business travel
guide, a column about international executives and jobs, a profile of a
leading business figure and an international press review.
As a result of these improvements, several features will move or disappear.
We hope this will not inconvenience our readers.
Michael Prowse's column on America moves from the back page of section II to
the main features pages. The Monday interview will come to an end, but
regular interviews will now appear on the features pages on Tuesday.
The international economic indicators will appear on Tuesday. The FT/Isma
bond price table will continue to be published during the week but not on
Monday. The construction contracts feature will disappear. Large
construction contracts will be reported on the news pages.
I would welcome readers' views on these changes.

FT  22 NOV 93 / City share system to cost less than Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new share settlement system proposed for the City will cost about half
as much as the Stock Exchange's failed Taurus project - according to details
to be unveiled later this week.
However, because the proposed Crest system will not be nearly as
sophisticated as Taurus, individual companies are likely to have to spend
more developing their own computer link-up systems.
Specifications from the Crest advisory committee, which is sponsored by the
Bank of England, will carry an estimated price tag for building the central
system of Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m compared with the estimated Pounds 75m
for Taurus.
Committee members said they expect the specifications may cause an outcry
among smaller firms, particularly those specialising in private client
stockbroking, because the costs of linking into the new system may prove
prohibitive.
'These smaller firms could well be forced to contract out their settlement
services,' one committee member said.
Crest is intended to replace the share settlement system which is
paper-based, with an electronic system but firms will have the option of
retaining share certificates for those clients who want them.
But it is believed that the costs of running a separate paper-based system
for small private client firms could be more expensive than the clients are
willing to accept.
Meanwhile, the committee's paper will not discuss the controversial question
of who should own the Crest system. The question of ownership will be
addressed in a paper to be released in February.
The Bank of England says it currently has no view about who should control
the system.
However there is support within the advisory committee for the Bank of
England to run it in the first year or so before devolving the operations to
users.
The Stock Exchange however is said to be seeking a role for itself -
possibly as a part owner of the Crest system on behalf of its members.
The Bank of England has said in the past that it does not believe there is a
long-term future for the Stock Exchange in share settlement.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Opera conductors, oui bus
conductors, non - Michael Skapinker tests the new airport bus in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris has its own way of adding to the
disorientation of a traveller arriving in an unfamiliar city.
Getting to the city centre by rail involves a ride first on an airport bus
to the nearby RER suburban railway station. Then follows a battle to figure
out how the RER connects with the Metro underground system, for French
railway maps lack the clean-lined simplicity of their UK counterparts.
Hence the attraction of the new Roissy Bus service from the airport to the
Paris Opera in the centre of the city.
The advantage of this service, which leaves the airport every 15 minutes, is
that you use only one mode of transport. At FFr30 each way, it also costs
less than taking a taxi.
However, the experience of a recent one-day trip to Paris from London
suggests that the bus is best avoided. The vagaries of the city's traffic
make the service too unreliable for anyone with appointments to keep and
flights to catch.
My journey from Charles de Gaulle began at 11.35am. Despite repeated
warnings of imminent traffic snarl-ups on lighted signs above the motorway,
the bus kept moving. The only incident was a near collision with a car -
shrugged off by both parties without any swearing or hooting. We arrived at
the Opera at 12.18 pm - total journey time 43 minutes.
The relatively painless ride resulted in a decision to take the bus back to
the airport, leaving the Opera at 6pm. With a British Airways flight back to
London at 7.30pm, it was cutting it a little fine, but I assumed there would
be less traffic on the way back than there had been at mid-day on my way in.
This was a mistake. The traffic leaving the city was so heavy that I finally
arrived at the airport at 7.15pm - tight for time and only just able to get
on to the flight.
So it will be back to the railway in future. The same journey by RER and
Metro costs FFr39.50 and should take about 40 minutes.
Understanding that system may requires a little concentration but it has the
advantage of being reliable - provided no industrial action is taking place.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: In park with Madonna - Joggers'
guide - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON MUNRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most business travellers to New York, fighting the locals for pavement
space is the only exercise they ever get.
In such a crowded, noisy place, who could imagine jogging, or even taking a
leisurely walk? However, New York offers jogging and walking routes with
ample breathing space.
When they want the solitude of woods and water, New York runners head for
Central Park, the leafy, 843-acre urban sanctuary opened in 1876. The park's
department says it has the city's lowest crime rate. But it recommends
runners avoid the park at night and run with a partner if possible.
One of the most popular routes in the park is a 1.6-mile gravel track around
the Reservoir, the largest body of water in Manhattan. The access point is
at 90th St. and Fifth Ave. The reservoir offers mallard on the water and
occasional appearances by such celebrity exercisers as Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis and Madonna.
For a longer course, there is Central Park's auto loop - six miles of
hard-surface road closed to traffic on weekends. The auto loop bypasses
great expanses of woods and lawns, including one near West 72nd St called
Strawberry Fields, which is dedicated to the memory of John Lennon.
A run in Central Park takes you past many Victorian-era architectural gems.
One is Belvedere Castle, built in 1872 of the same stone that is found
thrusting dramatically out of much of the parks' landscape. With Norman,
Gothic and Moorish features, it overlooks the Great Lawn's softball fields.
Other popular access points to Central Park are at its south-east entry
(Fifth Ave and 60th St) and south-west corner (Columbus circle).
In the thick of Broadway traffic, it might be hard to remember that New York
is an island. But a refreshing jog along some of the city's waterfront
promenades will quickly set you straight. Skirting the Hudson River, the
one-and-a- half-mile-long Battery Park City Esplanade begins at the downtown
intersections of Chambers and West Streets.
It continues south almost to Battery Park and the tip of lower Manhattan.
The route takes you past the World Financial Center and the North Cove Yacht
Harbor. The Hudson kicks up stiff breezes. These are cooling in summer but
blood-chilling in winter.
On the east side of Manhattan, the East River Esplanade offers a three-mile
course, from 63rd St, north to 125th St. On the left, cars whiz by on the
FDR Drive. But there are more tranquil sights, such as Gracie Mansion in
Carl Schurz Park. Built as a country manor house in 1779 by wealthy merchant
Archibald Gracie, it is now the official home of the city's mayor.
Many New York hotels offer advice on the best running routes. The
Ritz-Carlton, on Central Park South, distributes maps to its guests that
detail three routes of varying length. The maps also list emergency
telephone aid numbers.
For more information on running in New York, contact the New York Road
Runners Club, at (212) 860-4455.

FT  22 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: How to win from the winter war / A
look at special deals aimed at wooing customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airlines desperate for business passengers to fill their aircraft in the
slack winter season are vying with each other to offer the most attractive
deals.
Across Europe, airlines are wooing their most lucrative clients, the
business executives, with special offers. German and UK residents,
especially, are on the receiving end of the best prizes, ranging from price
cuts to free flights and overnight stays in luxury hotels.
The airlines' main weapon is the 'frequent flyer' programme. When taking
flights, members of programmes earn points which can be redeemed for items
such as free tickets or upgrades to business class.
Anyone can join an airline's frequent-flyer programme and there is no reason
why someone should not join several. In the UK, British Airways' 'Dream
Ticket' promotion has the highest profile. But behind the hype this is
simply a promise to double the number of points collected for a flight taken
before the end of March. This means that one business-class return to New
York would earn enough points for an economy return to Athens. In the
summer, it would have taken two such flights. As always with UK residents
flying with BA, the deal only applies for first, business and full-fare
economy tickets.
Many business travellers buy discounted tickets: in this case, US carriers
such as American Airlines and United Airlines offer a better deal. Their
double-points offer, for UK residents only, applies for virtually any fare
available. On short-haul flights, British Midland also gives awards to
buyers of economy-class tickets.
For those living in Germany, this will seem tame stuff. BA and American
Airlines will triple the points earned by German residents over the next few
months. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based carrier, is offering enough
points with one business-class return to the Far East between now and the
end of December for a free business-class ticket within Europe on Austrian
Airlines or Swissair.
The desperation to attract German passengers may be because of the depth of
the country's recession. Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of
Paris-based travel agency Wagon-Lits, says that for the first time airlines
are selling seats at less than published prices in Germany.
Danish residents, too, can find discounted tickets: business-class fares on
Scandinavian Airline System on some short-haul routes have been cut by 30
per cent. SAS is also offering business-class passengers starting from the
UK a free overnight stay in a Scandinavian hotel, provided the trip is made
before the end of March. Alitalia has a similar scheme for flights from
Italy to London before December 31. Business-class passengers get a free
night in a London hotel.
This is only a selection of the deals on offer. And the tide of special
deals is unlikely to ebb until spring. There is still a recession in the
airline industry and over-capacity is widespread. That combination in recent
years has meant fringe benefits and cost savings improve through the season.
If - like a quarter of Europe's business air travellers according to a
recent survey - your choice of carrier is determined by awards of
frequent-flyer points, winter is a chance to push up your total quickly.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Jurys Hotel rises 30% and calls
for IPounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JURYS HOTEL Group, the Irish-based hotel operator, yesterday announced a 30
per cent increase in interim profits and a IPounds 7.59m (Pounds 7.25m)
rights issue to fund expansion plans.
The rights issue of 7.58m new ordinary shares is on a seven-for-two basis at
105p per share. Mr Walter Beatty, chairman, said all proceeds would be used
to cut borrowings thus enabling Jurys to finance continued growth, both
internally and by acquisitions.
Following the purchase of the Jurys Kensington Hotel, which was funded by
debt, Jurys gearing now stands at 38 per cent. After the rights issue, this
will be reduced to 24 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 grew from IPounds 2.16m to
IPounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.67m). Turnover rose 21 per cent to IPounds 17.6m and
earnings per share came to 10.1p (7.6p). The interim dividend has been held
at 2p.
Mr Beatty said group business strengthened as the summer months progressed
and was aided considerably by the trading of the new inns, in Christchurch
and Galway, which was at the upper end of expectations.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Price curb on salmon imports condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH salmon producers complained yesterday that the European Commission
had not gone far enough to limit Norwegian salmon imports to the European
Union.
The Commission imposed a minimum price on the imports until the end of the
year. However, Mr Jim Payne, chairman of the Scottish Salmon Growers
Association, said: 'The levels of minimum import prices simply cement the
market price at Norwegian dumping levels and do nothing to resolve the
crisis in the industry.'
The new minimum import price for fresh and frozen whole (ungutted) salmon is
Ecu2,860 (Pounds 2,633) per net tonne.
The association says that works out at Pounds 1.22 per pound, below the
current weighted average price of Pounds 1.32 per pound for salmon at fish
markets. Prices have risen slightly since recently touching a low point of
about Pounds 1 per pound.
The Commission's move was a reaction to pressure from the Irish and British
governments. Scottish and Irish salmon producers have been hit by what the
Commission described yesterday as 'massive imports of Norwegian salmon at
low prices'.
The Irish government had formally requested safeguard measures, but the
British authorities  - to the irritation of Scottish salmon farmers  - had
asked only for 'appropriate measures' to deal with the problem. On Thursday
the Norwegians rejected Commission calls to restrict salmon exports.
Yesterday, Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, took action
under the safeguard rules of the EU's common fisheries policy.
The decision comes at a sensitive time for Norway, which is negotiating
membership of the EU. Finding a way to preserve Norwegian fisheries is one
of the trickiest aspects of the membership talks.
Norwegian sources said last night that the minimum price would represent an
increase 'in relation to the price of the last few weeks'. Officials claim
that total exports of Norwegian salmon for this year are forecast to rise by
only 5 per cent.
Norwegian salmon farmers say output is set to grow faster in Scotland and
Ireland than in Norway. They recently ended talks with Scottish and Irish
farmers on creating a network of producer organisations aimed at controlling
production.

THE Clinton administration has decided to sell China a supercomputer to help

US officials said the sale of power turbines for nuclear generators had also
been tentatively approved.
However, while the supercomputer, manufactured by Cray Research and worth
about Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.3m), is a 'done deal', the sale of the turbines
will depend on China showing a willingness to respond to US concerns over
human rights and trade practices which inhibit US exports to China in
several areas.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Tokyo stocks sink amid fears for financial system
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNTING pessimism over the Japanese economy, a spate of poor corporate
earnings figures, and heavy technical selling weighed down Japanese share
prices yesterday, pushing the Tokyo market to an eight-month low. The Nikkei
average of 225 leading stocks fell 1.2 per cent to 17,941.19, closing below
the 18,000 level for the first time since March.
Investors fear that further falls could damage the country's financial
system, wiping out chances of Japanese banks writing off bad loans using
gains on their stock holdings.
Some brokers had hoped record low interest rates would bring investors back
into the market. However, many investors believe that current share prices
are too high, and do not fairly reflect the true strength of Japanese
corporations and the underlying economy.
The price/earnings ratio for the market stands at around 90 times, and low
dividend yields, which currently average 0.8 per cent, are also no
attraction.
The Nikkei has lost 8.9 per cent since the beginning of this month, and
although recent falls in the index have been exaggerated through technical
selling related to a shift in trading of stock indices, overall sentiment
over the economic backdrop remains gloomy.
Interim earnings figures announced over the past few weeks have only
reinforced worries over the country's economy. So far, 771 companies have
reported unconsolidated half year results to September, revealing a 26.2 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits and a 7.7 per cent decline in sales from a year
earlier.
The Bank of Japan said yesterday that signs of an economic pick-up in the
second half of the year to March remain unlikely.
Sectors other than housing investment and public spending were performing
poorly.

half a lifetime. He does not go away. He just keeps mutating. Digging
himself in deeper. Singing a different tune. Softening or hardening the
message as circumstance dictates. It used to look haphazard, but that was
just a smokescreen. I think we have got a problem.
I went to a dinner this week. The good, the great and the pasty. Tiaras and
jewelled cuff-links. Servants scuttling and scraping. Everyone in their
place. You could hardly call it classless. There was a peculiar, malevolent
heartiness, and a single recurring joke. 'Did you hear the one about the
single mother of twins who wrote to the council because she wanted a larger
house with a swimming pool and a squash court?'
The toastmaster cleared his throat. My lords, ladies and gentlemen, pray
silence for the prime minister. And up stood John Major, talking about core
values. Time to get back to basics. Family first and foremost. It only takes
self-discipline. Britain once ruled the waves, and so she would again.
Next day I visited a supermarket. Sainsbury's, as it happened. I could tell
by the rudeness and queues. The price war was turning vicious. They were
giving the stuff away. I recognised the patrons. I had seen them the night
before: the good, the great and the pasty. Only their clothes were
different.
Their voices were the same. They were laughing just as loudly. 'Did you hear
the one about the single mother of twins who wrote to the council because
she wanted a larger house with a swimming pool and a squash court?'
John Major, boatered and aproned, was serving at the meat counter. Business
was very brisk. As the prime minister wrapped sausages and trimmed the fat
from chops, he spoke about his determination to return to core values,
rediscover the basics, family first and foremost, only takes
self-discipline, Britain would rule again.
That night I went to the theatre. They were all there in their seats: the
good, the great, the pasty. The joke ran round and round. 'Did you hear the
one about the single mother who wrote to the council . . . ?'
John Major appeared at the interval, earning sustained applause for a moving
evocation of a gentler, simpler age when families stayed together and just
stuck to basics. Wove their own cloth, crushed their own grain, trampled
their own wine and amused themselves at home with quizzes and simple games.
Envy was unknown. Everyone in his place. You got ahead or you didn't, and
were grateful in either case. Crime was barely heard of. Children could read
and write. Britain was strong and healthy, and would be strong and healthy
again. Core values and self-discipline.
I noticed, at the theatre, that the good, the great and the pasty spoke and
laughed loudly whenever they thought I was watching; but that when I looked
away and they thought I wasn't noticing their eyes grew cold and mean and
they glared at each other suspiciously.
Yet their faces would light up as soon as the joke was repeated. 'Did you
hear the one about the single mother of twins who wrote to the council . . .
?' Really extremely odd. More than a little frightening.
When John Major first shot through a hole in the ozone layer and fell to
earth, we were extremely happy to see him. Our gratitude knew no bounds. And
then the accidents started. Many things went awry. He seemed dithery and
cack-handed. Trouble just sought him out.
So then the mutations started. He even won an election. But the accident
rate increased. His days were strictly numbered. Or so it was supposed. But
that was just a smokescreen. He was learning on the job. Mutating and
transforming himself. Varying the pitch of the tune. Softening or hardening
the message.
John Major looks exactly the same today as he did three years ago. The hair,
the teeth, the glasses, the fixed and famous smile. He really is agreeable.
Only the message varies. But we have even got used to that. His resilience
is astonishing. He just keeps bouncing back. It dawned on me this week that
there is now no reason on earth why John Major shouldn't win the next
election.
I think we have got a problem.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The English sense of foul play: While his countrymen mourn,
Dominic Lawson views this week's World Cup results with relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON

FINALLY, we have been put out of our misery. England are out of the World
Cup or, as the sports writers insist on calling it, 'the greatest
footballing show on earth.'
The misery in question, however, is not chiefly that of the England soccer
team but of the millions of us who find the national game ugly and
pointless. We dreaded the thought of the saturation coverage which would
ensue if the England team qualified for the finals. We remembered how,
during the last World Cup, it was impossible to arrange a dinner party in
case it clashed with yet another game in England's unlikely advance to the
semi-finals. Or one did go ahead only to find guests rushing from the table
asking if there was a television in the house.
But, as I say, we are out of our misery. The summer will be filled instead
with the proper and civilised sound of leather on willow rather than leather
on head or boot, or whatever other parts of the anatomy footballers use to
play their random, undisciplined and rowdy game.
There was a danger that one or other of the home nations would qualify for
'the greatest footballing show on earth.' Had Wales qualified then it would
immediately have been adopted, even by people who normally regard the celtic
fringes as fit subjects only for after-dinner jokes. Fortunately, however,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all managed to emulate England's
non-achievement.
The Republic of Ireland did qualify and the inevitable happened: the English
press began to describe that nation as part of 'the British Isles.' True
enough, but it was the first time I had heard this expression outside of a
geography text book. The point, of course, was to persuade us that we are in
some way still connected with, and intimately involved in, 'The greatest
footballing show on earth.' Had Ireland not qualified all would not have
been lost. Eventually, the list of referees chosen to arbitrate in the World
Cup finals would have been published and there might well have been an
Englishman on it. There would have ensued innumerable newspaper articles
about 'England's man at the greatest footballing show on earth.'
I wrote last week that I had been so buried in writing a book that no items
of news penetrated my consciousness. This was not quite the case. The one
event of global importance which was so insistently reported that even I
knew, was the England soccer team's loss to the Netherlands. In particular,
I gleaned the impression that it was unfair. It was all the fault of a
German referee.
This, it seemed to me at the time, was the worst thing about the media's
obsession with the travails of the England team: we were always unlucky. If
it was not a conveniently German referee, then it was an injury to England's
best player, or the run of the ball which was 'cruel', or our manager's
inexplicable failure to select our best side, or one of their players should
have been sent off. No one ever seemed prepared to admit that other nations
had, perhaps, produced more talented players and that is why they won and we
lost. Somehow the idea persists that we ought always to win, and that if we
do not, we are the victims of malicious fortune, or bad management.
To a small extent this national disease of making excuses has spread into
the nobler game of cricket.
I would be rash to comment on the last week's High Court libel action over
the matter of alleged Pakistani ball - tampering in Test matches against
England. But it is hard to avoid the impression that the main stimulus to
the press's charges was the desire to find a reason for the England team's
defeat which did not include the fact that the Pakistani team were simply
much better players.
This whingeing would be more tolerable if, when England win, we were able to
do so without any gloating. It is hard to remember when an England victory
was not so greeted by the home press.
Doubtless other nations are as bad. Some might be worse. But I am delighted
that they will be the ones to endure more months of hyperbole and hackery,
while we in England can open a newspaper or watch television without being
forced to take part in 'The greatest footballing show on earth.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Private View: Doctor on call for science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BICYCLING embryologist took off his clips and declared: 'Potholes are
much more dangerous than genetic engineering.'
Lewis Wolpert, a professor of medical biology, blames Mary Shelley ('the
evil fairy godmother of science') for frightening people down to this day.
'The Frankenstein image touches something very deep in our psyche,' he said.
Monday sees the start of a 'European week for scientific culture,' a
programme of conferences, films, school visits, including a ballet based on
the Big Bang theory of the birth of the universe. The aim is to encourage
more career scientists, to stimulate popular participation in policy-making
and restore science to its place in European culture.
This is very much Prof Wolpert's theme, although he expresses it more
energetically and provocatively than does Directorate XII of the European
Commission, sponsor of next week's programme.
'Even the most intelligent of my friends worry about armies of human clones.
I say: where will they go to school? Where are all the mothers going to come
from? We know from the Hitler Youth that you don't have to go through
cloning to get people to think along the same lines. The fears are
grotesquely exaggerated.'
Wolpert, a Fellow of the Royal Society, is shortly to take over chairmanship
of the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science, a UK body founded
apparently on the premiss that public ignorance of science is creating fear,
and fear hostility.
This harks back to the famous Two Cultures jeremiad delivered by CP Snow in
1959. Was there still a problem, I asked?
'Snow was putting forward the idea that for most people true culture - in
the wonderful phrase of Max Perutz - is carried by the humanities while
scientists have merely been the plumbers of civilisation,' Wolpert replied.
Yet people were fascinated by science, he added. They were not so much
hostile as ambivalent, because science was so difficult, an unnatural way of
thinking (he has written a book on this theme*). Science lacked role models
and suffered from media stereotyping: practitioners were portrayed as
detached, boring people without spouses, children or passions. Anyway, he
concluded, press and television were run by arts graduates.
He thinks there has always been a gulf between scientific knowledge and
public understanding, probably even in Archimedes' day.
Perhaps, I suggested, mankind is not biologically adapted to contemplating
the cosmic or the atomic.
'I don't think it's even that. The real difficulty is that you can live your
life - I hate saying this - extremely comfortably without knowing any
science whatsoever. And most people do.
'You see science is a peculiar thing. But if you want to take your part as a
citizen, to take decisions about nuclear power and so forth, then you need
to know.'
Why do you think people still read horoscopes?
'People like a mystical idea of the world. They like magic. I don't have an
explanation for that. The New Age people love the discovery of quantum
mechanics and black holes. They take this hard-won hard science and they use
it for mysticism. 'Look', they say, 'we always told you the universe was
magical.''
I said: you can't blame them if our ultimate knowledge turns out so bizarre
. . .'
'No, it's such hard, difficult mathematical stuff.' He sounded quite angry.
'Science doesn't make you feel better: it doesn't lead to an afterlife, it
doesn't give you any purpose in your life. It removes magical powers like
the ability to predict the future, read minds and so on. So you feel less
comfortable.'
You see such people as poor, lost children?
'Yes'. The professor grinned wolfishly as if he'd eaten a New Ager for
breakfast. 'I do. You're wicked.'
Do you want them to give up astrology?
'No. That would be an absurd view . . .'
But when I pressed him he eventually admitted that was what he wanted. 'I'd
rather they did the pools,' he said.
Prof Wolpert is by turns dogmatic and doubtful; he thrives on controversy,
loves to be provocative and is easily provoked in turn. His betes noires
include disparaging journalists (he named some) and 'relativist'
sociologists who regard scientific knowledge as no more than another human
invention. Philosophers were good, but irrelevant.
'I'd like to see myself as a liberal,' he said. I'm terribly permissive
really. On the other hand I love being politically incorrect.' He paused as
a doubt surfaced. 'Although I'm totally against PC, the fact that there is a
discussion about it has sensitized people to the way our society works. I
would have to recognise that the sensitivity is really quite positive.'
Wolpert works at University College and Middlesex School of Medicine in
London. He studies the mechanism by which the fertilised egg gives rise to
limbs and is best known for his account of how cells know what to do. (Like
mass flagwavers in a stadium display they get the same instruction sheet
telling them what to do in whatever position they occupy.)
He was born in Johannesburg, to a middle-class Lithuanian Jewish family,
swung to the Left but had no stomach for politics. He studied civil
engineering because he was good at maths.
'I couldn't stand it. They were so boring. No, I liked them. They were very
good friends. I loathed the course. All my friends in the arts were pretty
girls reading DH Lawrence and there was I in the beastly room doing
engineering drawings. Even on holidays I used to have to work in the sewers
of the municipality.'
He worked in South Africa, hitch-hiked north to Israel, and moved to London
where he converted to zoology at the age of 25, taking his BA and PhD
simultaneously at King's College. He has the Scientific Medal of the
Zoological Society and has been a member of the Medical Research Council.
Discussing the technical and moral limitations of genetic engineering,
Wolpert insisted that scientists have nothing more to say about ethical
dilemmas than any other citizen. It was for the scientists to advise, the
public to debate, and parliaments to legislate.
But as an out-and-out materialist (biologists tend to be), he looks forwards
to the day when science will enable us to isolate and treat criminal
tendencies, say, as readily as any disease.
'I can think of no situation in which knowledge would make things in
principle worse. Because knowledge is neutral. I feel very strongly about
that. This nonsense that science has some sort of value attached. Rubbish.'
The molecular biologist is interested in humans as organisations of cells.
Would he not always be regarded with suspicion by those who see the human
being as a whole?
'I dont think you're right. It's no longer regarded as murder to turn off a
life-support machine. Abortion is allowed. My materialist position has no
bearing on this whatsover.
As a person you have one construct of the world, as a scientist another?
'Absolutely.'
And the two things should not be confused?
'Absolutely. My responsibilities as a citizen have nothing to do with my
responsibilities as a scientist.'
It is a familiar argument. Yet this emphasis on detachment, on privileged
status for scientific inquiry may be what most worries the non-scientist.
Wolpert insists that scientific knowledge is superior knowledge. When you
say it is superior, what do you mean?
'It's the only way to understand the world.'
But you've just said that as a citizen you have to look at it in one way, as
a scientist in another.
'There is a big difference between understanding and making judgments.'
I thought of the non-sciences which lay claim to understanding: economics,
history, religion. Why should science be 'superior'?
'In the sense that there are no alternative explanations. And superior in
that it is also probably true and can be shown to be true - or false.'
Wolpert mentioned religion, and said he agreed with the sociologist Max
Weber that the secularisation of the western world owes more to capitalism
than to scientific knowledge. Although a hard-line materialist, he said, he
easily understood why religion was so attractive. (His brother-in-law, the
Australian Richard Neville of Oz trial fame in the Sixties had recently
given him The Tibetan Book of the Dead.)
'Many very distinguished scientists - living and dead - are deeply
religious. Now, for me, religion is not all that different from astrology.
But I wouldn't want people to give up their religion.'
Are you a non-believer because you are a biologist?
'I gave up religion long before I took up science.'
Science and religion are contradictory but plainly can co-exist in the same
mind, he said. 'I claim that is because one is natural and the other totally
unnatural.' (Science, of course, is the unnatural one).
Religion may be more important to people than science, then?
'No question. Because it tells them how to live their lives.'
Wolpert quotes Tolstoy, who said science is meaningless because it does not
answer the questions What Shall We Do? and How Shall We Be? He quotes
Einstein, who said that there was no conflict between the two because
'science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind'.
So to many people the knowledge they get from religion is superior?
'I agree with you. It doesn't mean to say that they're right.'
But science remains a privileged kind of knowledge?
'I couldn't agree more.'
Perhaps it's just this word 'superior' that you'll have to drop?
Wolpert grinned. 'I don't think I'm prepared to do that.'
The professor donned his red anorak, put on his clips and safety helmet and
wheeled his bicycle to the lift. As he whizzed gleefully away to Mayfair to
hear a lecture on gene therapy it seemed to me I had missed a dialectical
trick. It was not knowledge we had been arguing about here, but wisdom.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Caravaggio - the real thing / Patricia Morison visits
the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a great week for revellers in Dublin. On Tuesday night, the National
Gallery in Dublin unveiled its rediscovered masterpiece by Caravaggio, 'The
Taking of Christ'. The next night, Ireland qualified for the World Cup.
Caravaggio would have loved it, one minute basking in the adulation of
experts and art-lovers, the next out roistering with the lads.
For the past 60 years 'The Taking of Christ' hung in the parlour of a Jesuit
community in Lower Leeson Street in the heart of Georgian Dublin. Again,
Caravaggio would have appreciated the setting. Respectable by day, the
street is famed for its cellar bars which roar into life in the small hours.
The Jesuit Fathers are now the toast of town for their generosity in placing
this priceless masterpiece on indefinite loan to the National Gallery.
The painting was spotted three years ago by Sergio Benedetti, senior
restorer at the National Gallery. It was labelled as being by the Dutch
artist and devoted follower of Caravaggio, Gerard van Honthorst. However, it
was quite obviously a composition by Caravaggio hitherto known only from
copies. These range from tolerable to execrable but one, in Odessa, was good
enough to have convinced some experts. Benedetti's task was to see whether
his intuition was right, and that the Jesuit's strikingly lovely picture was
indeed the lost original.
Cleaning and technical examination showed the tell-tale pentimenti, signs
that the artist had changed his mind; copyists generally get things right.
It also revealed Caravaggio's hasty, thick brushwork as he deftly laid out
his original composition. Experts shown the picture gave the right verdict,
culminating in the approval of Sir Dennis Mahon, doyen of Baroque Italian
art. (Oddly enough, when Guinness Mahon agreed to sponsor the unveiling, the
company was unaware of the role played by the great nephew of the bank's
co-founder.)
The shadowy career of Caravaggio has been made clearer by recent research in
Rome. It was known that 'The Taking of Christ' was painted for Cyriaco
Mattei in 1602, when Caravaggio was 31, a mature artist at the height of his
fame. The Mattei family had taken over as Caravaggio's patrons from the
louche Cardinal del Monte, who had commissioned (among other things) the
notorious homoerotic paintings of cupids and musicians.
For two years, probably the happiest in his life, Caravaggio had rooms in
the Mattei family's grandiose palaces. Another masterpiece he painted for
them was 'The Supper at Emmaus', in London's National Gallery. 'The Taking
of Christ' was the last of the group. It is a mesmeric and immensely
poignant portrayal of the moment when Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss.
Caravaggio's is an intense psychological interpretation of the arrest of
Christ. Swords play such a prominent part in many of his paintings that it
is striking that this time Caravaggio, the fanatical swordsman and
tavern-brawler, chose drama without violence and left out the traditional
figure of St Peter severing unlucky Malchus's ear.
On the right stands a figure who is not in armour, but holds a lantern and
gazes intently with parted lips at Christ. This man could be just a Jewish
official, but long ago the Caravaggio scholar Roberto Longhi spotted him as
a self-portrait of the artist. It is therefore the artist's hand at the top
of the painting, holding the lantern. The counterbalance at the bottom are
the fingers of Christ, linked in a gesture of prayer and submission.
Christ, and no one else, is shown full face, eyes closed, with an expression
of intense, wordless suffering. To his left there is the hysterical
shrieking figure of the young man who, according to the gospel, ran away
naked when one of the soldiers grabbed his cloak. Caravaggio's youth is
clothed and his red cloak billows over the heads of Christ and Judas,
ingeniously rather than naturalistically framing them.
Christ's deadly pallor contrasts with the coarse, wrinkled features of
Judas. Yet he is not a caricature, for in those eyes we see an expression of
shock as the traitor realises what he has done. Cardinal Girolamo,
Cypriano's brother and a deeply pious, austere character, may have
influenced the artist. There is a strongly Franciscan message in the
painting's emphasis on abnegation, obedience and martyrdom.
The declining fortunes of the Mattei family forced them to sell 'The Taking
of Christ' in 1802 to a Scottish laird, William Hamilton Nisbet, along with
five other fine paintings. Nisbet thought he had bought a Honthorst and
labelled it thus, or rather, as being by 'Gerard of the Night', a common
nickname. When the Nisbet pictures were sold in Edinbugh in 1921, someone
paid Pounds 10.10s for 'A Curious Old View of a Racecourse'. Someone else
paid Pounds 8.8s for the so-called Honthorst.
Soon afterwards, the painting was taken to Dublin and in the 1930s, was
given to the Jesuit fathers by Dr Marie Lea Wilson, childless widow of a
murdered police officer. Caravaggio's reputation made its rapid ascent, but
the Honthorst was unseen by scholars. It is splendid that such a masterpiece
seems now to have come to rest permanently in Ireland. It is also strangely
fitting, for one of Cardinal Girolamo Mattei's titles was defender of the
faith in Ireland.
Caravaggio: The Master Revealed, is sponsored by Guinness &amp; Mahon until 31
January 31. The gallery itself is undergoing major renovation so much of the
permanent collection will not be seen for several years.

WITH Christmas around the corner, Radio 4 is running a Sunday series for
non-believers, Devout Sceptics, in conversations with Bel Mooney. The first
sceptic was Lord Healey, worth listening to on anything. Philosophy at
Oxford destroyed any question of belief, though he began his scepticism at
about 13. Now he has faith, not in God, but in the business - chiefly music
 -usually attributed to the soul by those who believe in it, which he does
not. He feels no loss, and believes death to mean the end of physical
currency, no more.
Tomorrow, we have Lady Warnock, a less complex case. She is a practising
member of the Church of England, but cannot accede to the beliefs that
Christianity requires. There must be many in her state, who follow the
Christian practice, perhaps admire and enjoy the saga, certainly the
ceremony, but mentally cross the fingers when saying the Creed. Devotion
lies in the continuous ritual the church provides. Lady Warnock has no hope
of life after death, either; we die, she thinks, like other animals.
The Saturday and Sunday evening dramas to which I am addicted were better
this week. Radio 3 on Sunday gave us Amos Oz's Black Box, about Alex, a
distinguished Israeli working in America, Ilana, his divorced wife, Boaz, a
dubiously legitimate son, and Michel, Ilana's second husband, involved in
Israeli affairs, plus a lawyer, Manfred, who looks after Alex's accounts.
Their relationships are interesting, but in Guy Meredith's adaptation are
revealed almost entirely in letters exchanged between the characters. The
titular black box is really a dramatic extra. Ned Chaillet directed.
Radio 4 on Monday gave us Of Rats and Men, by Richard Bean. A famous,
unnamed Professor (Garrick Hagon) upgrades his experiments from rats to men.
His new assistant, Pearce (Anton Lesser), is asked to simulate the pain of
increasingly powerful electric shocks administered by volunteers. Will they
go on when they hear the yells of the suffering subject? Will they actually
press the switch labelled fatal? When does obedience give way to sympathy?
There is an aura of the lab throughout the play, a touch even of
science-fiction, but it is exciting enough in its way. Andy Jordan directed.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Take the biscuit - Off the Wall

<TEXT>
LORD PALUMBO, chairman of the Arts Council, was noble this week. He admitted
that the Council had made a hash of trying to cut grants to the regional
theatres, and he assumed responsibility. He also offered a chink of hope
that the Council will not repeat that fiasco in its review of the London
orchestras.
On the surface Palumbo is still committed to withdrawing subsidy from two of
the big three - either the LPO, the RPO, or the Philharmonia. But, as in the
regional theatre scam, the Council's strategy has gone wrong from the start.
Unwilling to take responsibility for its decision it invited Mr Justice
Hoffmann to chair an outside jury and pronounce sentence.
Apparently Leonard Hoffmann is unhappy with the situation, especially as the
committee seems to have its hands tied - the LPO, resident orchestra on the
South Bank, has an in-built advantage. It is now more than possible that the
Hoffmann panel will duck the issue. Even if it does recommend a withdrawal
of funding Palumbo made the point this week that it will be the Arts
Council, at its December meeting, that will make the final choice. And it
was the full Council that threw out the planned cuts by its drama panel on
the regional theatres.
So arts sponsorship is alive and kicking. True the 1992-93 expenditure
figures released on Thursday show a 13 per cent fall, to Pounds 57.69m, but
the 1991-92 total of Pounds 65.4m was inflated by the Pounds 11m that
companies poured into the Japan Festival.
Another reason for the decline is the near completion of the new
Glyndebourne, which has absorbed much of the corporate support for arts
rebuilding projects. Indeed the cut back in capital expenditure, from Pounds
12.5m to Pounds 5.4m, accounts for most of the annual drop.
We can see what is happening. In 1991-92 the first response of companies to
the recession was to reduce corporate hospitality, and their contributions
to corporate membership schemes slumped from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 7.9m.
Now they have decided to turn down appeals for capital projects. But
companies have maintained their sponsorship of arts events, particularly in
the north, where arts sponsorship is registering a near 70 per cent rise.
The biggest losers have been in London and the south.
A most dramatic moment recently took place, appropriately enough, at the
Arts Council. One morning in 1990 a secretary slit open a letter and out
fell a cheque for Pounds 1m. Of course the Council thought it was the latest
mind expanding ploy by some performance artist, but then a lawyer appeared
to announce that the money came from the estate of an anonymous wartime
refugee.
Some sceptics saw the munificent hand of Palumbo behind the cheque, but
whatever the source he suggested that the benefaction went towards an
independent Arts Foundation with the task of encouraging the avant-garde.
The original aim was to expand the funds of the Foundation to Pounds 10m, or
more, but bad publicity resulted in additional support of just Pounds 3,500.
Grand plans to open a mini Pompidou Centre in London were jettisoned and the
Foundation faded into obscurity.
So it was an agreeable surprise to find the Foundation actually giving out
money to artists. The interest on its investments funded five cheques for
Pounds 12,500 which were handed out on Wednesday to aspiring young artists -
the ceramicists, Philip Eglin and Sara Radstone, the poet Linda France, the
playwright Ed Thomas, and the photographer Ken Grant. The judges in the
multi-discipliniary category were unable to award a prize because no one
really knew what they were looking for.
The Arts Foundation will shortly re-launch itself. It has been very careful
with its money. As Lord Palumbo pointed out, the lunch to distribute the
prizes was the gift of a generous sponsor. No prizes for guessing his name.
On the subject of good housekeeping, the Arts Council announced this week
that it had saved Pounds 1,000 of tax payers money this year by cutting the
biscuit allowance of its HQ staff.

You never can tell about new productions in advance, least of all a critic,
but it seems that some remarkably promising performances are coming up.
Take the Royal National Theatre where the two parts of Tony Kushner's Angels
in America open this weekend. Part One, Millennium Approaches, has already
been seen. Part Two, Perestroika, is new. This is serious stuff, brilliantly
done, but not for the queasy. The RNT also has its lighter side, giving a
third and final run to Alan Bennett's wonderfully staged adaptation of The
Wind in the Willows from December 1.
The Royal Shakespeare Company is coming on strong, too. Previews of the new
production of Macbeth, with Derek Jacobi and Cheryl Campbell as the
Macbeths, open on December 1, directed by Adrian Noble. Given the ticket
sales for Noble's earlier production of Hamlet, book early.
You can just catch another brilliant Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse where
the Prince is played as a much younger man than usual by Alan Cumming. It
finishes at the end of this month, but the same actor is due to star in a
revival of the musical Cabaret at the same place from December 9.
A musical entertainment that looks promising is Piaf with Elaine Paige
directed by Sir Peter Hall at the Piccadilly. Previews start on December 8.
Of the longer runners, you must see David Mamet's Oleanna at the Duke of
York's. It concerns illiberalism and sexual harassment in an American
university. Everyone talks and argues about it afterwards, which is the
supreme mark of a successful grown-up play.
In a not dissimilar style, Harold Pinter's new play Moonlight shines more
brightly now that it has moved from the Almeida to the Comedy. It runs only
till the end of the year. Since I suspect it may be Pinter's valedictory,
see it.
There are two Noel Cowards. Tome Conti's enjoyable production of Present
Laughter, in which Conti also stars, will end at the Globe at Christmas.
Relative Values, starring Susan Hampshire, has just opened at the newly
restored Savoy and, as Coward's last good play, provides a great deal of
pleasure.
Do not overlook one of the best English comedies of all time. Oliver
Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer is playing at the Queen's with Donald
Sinden and a splendid cast all round. This could be the biggest treat of the
lot.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Museums for fun - Christmas shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER one thinks of it as a political nostrum, 'back to basics' is sound
advice for anyone intending to give the family something to see and think
about this Christmas. I recommend London's Big Three; the British Museum,
the National Gallery, and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Of those three, the
BM surely must come first especially if it some time since you saw the old
lady of Bloomsbury.
In which case, you have yet to catch up on the shimmering splendour of the
Hotung Gallery. This vast gallery of the Far East extends along the length
of the north facade, from the colourful ceramic statues of Chinese sages to
the drowsy eroticism of the Amuravati temple sculptures.
Five of the BM's galleries have been refurbished recently with a gift the
Sacklers. They redisplay spectacular collections from ancient Mesapotamia,
Anatolia, Nubia, and Egypt. Early Egypt was opened this autumn, and offers
ghoulish visitors the well-preserved corpse of Predynastic Man.
However, Egypt is 'done' in GCSE, so it may not be the great novelty.
Redress the balance by inspecting the spine-chilling Great Death Pit of Ur
from 2500 BC, with the jewellery which adorned dozens of ritually
slaughtered priestesses and the harps to which they might have listened. Who
could fail to respond to the gold statuette of the Ram in the Thicket?
Replicas of the Royal Game of Ur are on sale.
Games-players must see the The Art of the Chess Piece (until January 9,
free). For the first time since their discovery in 1853, it reunites all 78
of the Lewis Chessmen, the famous 12th-century ivory pieces found in the
Outer Hebrides. Private collectors have lent 50 rare chess sets, some
charming, some comical, some kitsch.
Also at the BM this winter, Old Master Drawings from Chatsworth (until
January 9) is full of beautiful things and free. But unless your child is K.
Clark in the making, the clear choice is Deities and Devotion; the Arts of
Hinduism (until April 10; adults Pounds 2). This beautiful exhibition sets
out to explain Hinduism. The gallery is painted in hot red and yellow, hung
with superb textiles, and stuffed with images of elephants and spritely
monsters. For the family trail and workshops, phone 071-328-8511/8854.
The National Gallery is putting on magic shows with someone called The Great
Xar. He or she is billed to appeal to all ages and the illusions relate to
pictures in the collection. Daily from December 28 to January 3 in the
Sainsbury Wing lecture theatre; entry free, no booking (071-839-3321).
At the Victoria and Albert Museum there is no more beautiful exhibition in
London than Gates of Mystery; the Arts of Holy Russia (until January 3; open
Tuesday to Sunday). It is perhaps not one to risk on children since a flop
will cost you dear, with entry charges to the museum and then to the show.
Yet the V&amp;A always does well by children. From now until January 9,
activities include Beatrix Potter story-times, drawing workshops, drama, and
a gallery trail based on Christmas card imagery. The first Christmas card,
sent by the V&amp;A's first director, Sir Henry Cole, in 1843, will be on
display and entries can already be submitted for the best home-made card, to
be exhibited in the museum. . For details; 071-938-8638.
Another sure success is the National Army Museum in Chelsea (free;
071-730-0717). The Waterloo Gallery has strangely effective models and one
of my favourite curiosities, the battlefield made by the unlucky Captain
Siborne in 1830. A manic achievement, it is 410 sq. ft. with 75,000 tin
soldiers.
A new gallery, the Victorian Soldier opens on November 26 and shows one of
the museum's particular strengths, its Crimean collection, as well as many
other conflicts. You will see Lord Raglan's telescope, breeches holed by the
Boer, the stuffed remains of Crimean Tom who was heard miaowing in the ruins
of Odessa and brought back to England. War might not be the obvious choice
for a Christmas jaunt, yet this splendid museum certainly gives the family
something serious to talk about.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: A mixed bag of Nutcrackers - Clement Crisp finds this
ballet the Yuletide favourite again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOUR first balletic concern at Yuletide is a treat for the tots, then
this probably means The Nutcracker, though there are alternatives, as I
shall reveal hereafter.
Without thought for your purse, the best Nutcracker available is Sir Peter
Wright's version for the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, on view
intermittently from December 17 until January 5 (please check Opera House
schedules). The choreography is authentic and good; Julia Trevelyan Oman's
first act designs are especially attractive and magical. You can judge the
success of a Nutcracker by the Ahs and Oohs (yours as well as your infant
charge's) which greet the moment when the Christmas Tree grows to vast size.
In this staging the magic is triumphant, and the battle with the mice the
best you can see anywhere. Unhesitatingly recommended. (En passant, let me
note that if you are in New York, Balanchine's Nutcracker is on view at the
State Theater on Lincoln Center at the year's end, and is superb).
The other London Nutcracker is shown by English National Ballet in a
marathon at the Royal Festival Hall, in constant performance for five - dear
Heaven, have pity on the dancers] - weeks from December 22 until January 22.
Lots of matinees. (Check schedules for times). Ben Stevenson's staging is a
suspect combination of slapstick and winsomeness, but that is what the young
enjoy, albeit the violence so necessary to the infant imagination is chiefly
committed by Stevenson's dreary choreography against the ravishing score.
Interesting new casts.
The Royal Ballet is not guiltless this year: its other seasonal offering is
the rampant infantilism of Tales of Beatrix Potter. Since I thought this the
most foolish thing the company had done in years - Ashton made the
choreography expressly for the cinema - I can only record that there are all
those cute animals teetering about the stage in a frenzy of charm. The young
may rejoice - though 70 minutes is quite a span of sitting still for the
teenies, for whom there are special early matinees (December 21, 22, 29,
January 8: check starting times) which offer this piece on its own at
somewhat reduced prices. Ballet-lovers may find it as repellant as I did:
regular performances pair it with Balanchine's glorious Ballet Imperial -
which is more like shock therapy than programme building.
Birmingham Royal Ballet also offers Nutcracker, in Peter Wright's other
version, with happy narrative, wonderful design (by John Macfarlane) and
Drosselmeyer as a conjuror. It is great fun, and on show at the Birmingham
Hippodrome from December 3 until December 18.
For anyone in Paris, the Opera Ballet at the Palais Garnier will reveal its
new acquisition - John Neumeier's Nutcracker from December 17 until December
31 (no performances on December 19 or 25). I thought it an odd staging when
I saw it with Makarova in Hamburg nearly 20 years ago, but it is full of
dancing, and the Opera's artists are superlatively good.
Meanwhile, at Sadler's Wells Theatre the Christmas treats are varied.
Adventures in Motion Pictures, a jolly modern-dance troupe, plays Matthew
Bourne's up-dating of the Nutcracker between December 8 and 18. It starts in
an orphanage terrorised by dear old Dr. Dross, and moves from there to all
sorts of jokes and modish fun. I enjoyed it at its Edinburgh Festival debut
last year. Then, from December 21 until January 8, the Black Light Theatre
of Prague proposes a version of Peter Pan. I know nothing of the staging,
but the company specialises in magical illusions, and promises 'a musical
adaptation'. Check with Sadler's Wells for timing details of both these
performances.
Peter Pan is also on offer with Scottish Ballet, which is presenting Graham
Lustig's balletic version at Glasgow's Theatre Royal between December 9 and
December 24. The bairns will probably be less concerned than I was, at the
ballet's premiere, about the merits of the staging. Northern Ballet Theatre,
on tour, proposes its engaging Christmas Carol for the week of December 7 in
Hull: good Dickensian fun. Thereafter Blackpool (for the week of December
14) and Halifax (for the week of December 28) can see the company's recent
Cinderella, for which I have no time.
And, if a theatre visit is not possible for the young, there are good dance
videos which will delight the dance-mad. But seek out the great names: some
recent issues immortalise the modish and the frankly inept. The old Royal
Ballet Swan Lake with Makarova and Dowell; Semenyaka and Mukhamedov in
Raymonda; Kolpakova and the Kirov in Sleeping Beauty, the Kirov Corsaire,
are all delights. And, perish the thought, there is even Tales of Beatrix
Potter as Ashton intended.
Details and availability can be found in the back pages of The Dancing
Times. (Tel 071 - 250 - 3006)

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Oh, yes it is] - it's panto time again / Brush up your
hisses and boos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSH UP your hisses; perfect your boos, panto time is almost upon us.
Obituaries for pantomime can be delayed for yet another Christmas. This is
one British institution that seems to survive the myriad changes in the
entertainment industry, probably because adults imagine the perfect panto of
their childhood and drag along their kids to perpetuate a folk myth.
Of course panto has changed, but it was changing in late Victorian times
when music hall stars started to assume Dick Whittington's tights and the
Ugly Sisters' false bosoms. Thirty years ago pop stars and television
personalities began to stretch their talents in panto, often to breaking
point.
Now it is sports heroes. Gareth Chilcott, the rugby player, has switched
from propping up England to roughing up Cinderella as the Broker's man at
the Mayflower, Southampton. This production also marks the panto debut of
Gloria Hunniford, one of nature's Fairy Godmothers. At the Theatre Royal,
Bath, Ian Botham will be whiling away his retirement in Dick Whittington and
Annabel Croft is serving it up in Cinderella at the Grand Opera House, York.
All these productions come courtesy of Paul Elliott, who is supplying pantos
to 20 theatres this Christmas. Out from the warehouse come the same old
sets, the costumes, and, too often, the scripts, but since familiarity is
one of the joys of the genre this is not too disturbing. Each year there is
a brand new production, costing Pounds 250,000, which over time will
traverse the nation. It always starts at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and
this year it is a new Jack &amp; the Beanstalk.
Like many pantos, one of its attractions is the oddball collection of stars
tempted to disrupt their Christmas for two shows daily. This Jack embraces
Rolf Harris, Bonnie Langford, and Dame Hilda Brackett. Another quaint trio
takes the stage in the Birmingham Hippodrome's Dick Whittington - the
sexually voracious Lesley Joseph from TV's Birds of a Feather; the winsome
Rosemarie Ford from Come Dancing; and the leaping Wayne Sleep, while the
dressers for Aladdin at the New Victoria, Woking, will have to cope with the
costumes of both Danny La Rue and Britt Ekland.
Advance bookings around the country are substantially higher so far this
year - except in central London. Once again the West End is a panto free
zone, mainly because the natural venue, the Palladium, is still host to
Joseph. But Londoners should be well served at Richmond, which always mounts
a lavish, traditional, production. This Christmas veterans Kate O'Mara and
Bernard Cribbens are headliners in Dick Whittington. A mile or so away
Wimbledon gets a northern invasion from Little &amp; Large in Jack &amp; the
Beanstalk while Bromley is fielding Ronnie Corbett in Cinderella, and
Lewisham catches the full blast of the latest television trend with Saracen
and Scorpio from Gladiators.
Pantomime has survived because it absorbs these fads of popular culture. It
even looks abroad. Marion Ramsey, a stalwart of the Hollywood Police Academy
movie series, finds herself in Cinderella in Hayes, which must come as a
double shock to her system. But while embracing the new, panto also finds
work for the old, and many stars whose salad days are long over enjoy a
seasonal re-birth. So there is Vince Hill in Birmingham, Charlie Cairoli in
Newcastle, and both Gerald Harper and the veteran Dame Jack Tripp in Babes
in the Wood at the Bournemouth Pavilion.
And there are the stars who shine brightest at Christmas, notably Ken Dodd,
still enmeshed in Diddy Men (and Susan Maughan) at the Manchester Palace's
Dick Whittington, and John Inman, a permanent Dame, in Mother Goose at the
Theatre Royal, Nottingham. Bournemouth also fields Roy Hudd, who is
thoroughly steeped in pantomine history, so steeped in fact that he combines
appearing in Bournemouth with writing and directing the Watford panto.
Some other artistes are equally elastic. Bobby Davro actually manages to wow
them in Goldilocks at both Newcastle and Leeds. The secret is that old show
biz one, timing. The panto season does not reach Leeds until February when
the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, production arrives at the Grand.
Of course there are theatres that try and ring the changes by offering
seasonal alternatives. Among the more interesting are the Birmingham Rep's
adaptation of the Raymond Briggs's modern classic, The Snowman; a speedy
revival at the Albery of Roald Dahl's Big Friendly Giant; and the appearance
of a Victorian Christmas Circus in the renovated Great Hall at Blackheath
Concert Halls.
But mainly it is panto as usual, which these days means pantos sponsored by
Cadbury's. Over 40 of this season's pantomimes are backed by the
confectionery firm which should ensure that the front stalls are battered by
sweeties.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: More than Messiahs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATIC fare in London this festive season promises to be unusually rich,
various and interestingly contrasted. This has less to do with what is on
offer at the two opera houses, more with the crop of rewarding
operas-in-concert that are planned to spring up in December. The biggest
venture is that of the London Symphony Orchestra in its Barbican Hall home:
a long-awaited concert mounting of Berlioz's magnificent epic, Les Troyens
(its two parts done thrice on consecutive days - December 2 and 3, 4 and 5,
8 and 9 - and then on the afternoon and evening of December 12). Colin
Davis, mighty London champion of this work for three-and-a-half decades,
leads a fascinating international cast headed by Vladimir Bogachov (Aeneas),
Luciana D'Intino (Dido) and Jane Henschel (Cassandra).
Even rarer is the single-evening (December 6) concert performance of
Tchaikovsky's late, lovely one-acter, Iolanta, at the Albert Hall. This
launches a proposed long-term collaboration between the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra and the Kirov Opera, here represented by the St Petersburg chief
conductor Valery Gergiev and a team of leading Kirov singers, including
soprano Galina Gorchakova, tenor Gegam Grigorian, baritone Sergey Leiferkus.
At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 8 and 11 there is Monteverdi's
Coronation of Poppaea in concert, with John Eliot Gardiner leading his
trusty 'period' performing cohorts and a superb cast - Sylvia McNair, Anne
Sofie von Otter, Michael Chance, Bernarda Fink, Kenneth Cox. This is the
most important but not the only QEH novelty: also on its December schedule
are the single visit (December 18) of Music Theatre Wales with its new
staging of Philip Glass's Poe opera, The Fall of the House of Usher, and,
after Christmas, the short (27-31) run of Music Theatre London's Cos fan
tutte, latest of the company's irreverently witty Mozart updatings.
In the 'legit' London opera houses, the art-form would appear to be wearing
a livelier festive-season aspect at the Coliseum than at Covent Garden,
where the play-safe repertory is made up of the new Magic Flute and the very
old (1964) Tosca, with Anna Tomowa-Sintow latest in the long line of
heroines stepping into the Empire dress originally created for Callas.
English National Opera's choice offering (from December 20), sure to provide
bliss for lovers of Czech opera and unexpected delight for others, is a new
production of Smetana's buoyantly tuneful romantic comedy The Two Widows;
David Pountney directs, Adam Fischer conducts, Marie McLaughlin, Anne-Marie
Owens and Arthur Davies take principal roles.
For the rest, the ENO runs in repertory its new Lohengrin and recent Figaro
revival, plus the return (from December 3) of Richard Jones's 1991
production of Die Fledermaus, a technologically elaborate piece of modernist
fantasy, occasionally mildly diverting.
Outside London the biggest attractions are provided by Welsh National Opera,
which tours its new Massenet Cendrillon and superb Falstaff in Oxford,
Bristol and then back to Cardiff; and Opera North, which in Leeds on
December 18 unveils another of the year's most eagerly-awaited events: the
company's first-ever staging (by Phyllida Lloyd) of Britten's Gloriana, with
the great Josephine Barstow as Elizabeth I.
Other than what is already noted above, the London concert scene contains
its familiar more-than-fair share of carol concerts, Messiah outings and
Grand Opera Galas. But worth keeping in mind are the exceptions to that
rule: the single London concert (Festival Hall, December 4) by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa, at the start of its latest European
tour and billing an imaginative all-Berlioz programme; the last instalment
(December 3) of the Barbican's current tribute to Olivier Messiaen;
attractive Wigmore Hall recitals by the sopranos Elizabeth Connell (December
8) and Sumi Jo (December 14); and the annual occupation of St John's, Smith
Square by the now-inappropriately-named choral group The Sixteen for a bunch
of pre-Christmas concerts.

with a mezzo in a million
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT

<TEXT>
SEVERAL new and reissued opera recordings dominated my listening year.
Gloriana, last of Benjamin Britten's operas to reach the recording studio,
gets an exhilarating, thoroughly committed performance from Welsh National
Opera forces under Charles Mackerras; the superb Elizabeth I of Josephine
Barstow and Essex of Philip Langridge lead a first-rate cast. The work
itself is not free of dramatic imbalance, flummery and rhubarb; but its
richness of musical content and astute approach to foreground personal
conflict render the flaws of small account (Argo 440 213-2).
Two 1993 sets of more familiar works - Rossini's Cenerentola and
Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades - seem to me already the most completely
recommendable modern versions. The former, in Decca's sparkling
Bologna-based edition conducted by Riccardo Chailly, has an all-Italian cast
(rare in modern Rossini), lively but unforced character (rarer still), and
the glowing, tender-hearted heroine of young Cecilia Bartoli, already a
mezzo in a million (Decca 436 902-2). The latter, in the third issue of
Philip's Kirov Opera series, is magnificently conducted by Valery Gergiev
and well sung by Gegam Grigorian, Maria Guleghina, Vladimir Chernov and
Irina Arkhipova; it adds up to a whole, and wholly commanding, view of the
terrifying masterpiece (Philips 438 141-2).
Off the main operatic route is the Opera de Lyon double-bill of
German-language one-acters by the Tuscan-born Ferruccio Busoni - Arlecchino,
stylised commedia dell'arte, and the 'other' Turandot, both from the second
decade of our century. If Verdi's Falstaff were infused with bittersweet
Weill, then stiffened with tough-minded Hindemith, something like these two
collector's items might result. Mixed bag of singers excellently conducted
by Kent Nagano (Virgin Classics VCD 7 59313 2).
Even more rewarding, to my mind, is Martinu's 1938 Julietta, a mysterious,
romantic, deeply affecting exercise in operatic surrealism. The 1964 Prague
National Theatre recording, now finely transferred to CD, merits its cult
following (Supraphon 10 8176-2). Another reissue that deserves equal cult
enthusiasm is the Paris (tenor) version of Gluck's Orpheus in the 1956
recording conducted by Hans Rosbaud, distinguished above all by the
Apollonian nobility of Leopold Simoneau's exquisitely-voiced hero (Philips
434 784-2).
I took endless pleasure from the reissues of two great violinists of eras
past. Fritz Kreisler, in a double-album of Victor recordings from the 1920s,
carefully restored on the specialist Biddulph label (LAB 068-69), and also
in a single disc of more general compilation (EMI References, CDH 7 64701
2), is the first - gloriously subtle, sensuous, charming, a musician without
peer in alchemising his (often trivial) material. Leonid Kogan, whose 1959
performances of four popular concertos come in a handy EMI double-pack (7
67732 2), is the second - perhaps not the most trumpeted of the leading
postwar Soviet players, surely the most 'inward' of that elite, most
refined, most poetic.
Among new symphony readings worth special attention are Frans Bruggen's
Haydn 100 and 104 (Philips 434 096-2) and Schubert Great C major (Philips
438 006-2), both with Bruggen's Orchestra of the 18th Century and both
bursting with spring-heeled new life; naturally shaped, spontaneously
musical accounts of Mendelssohn's Scottish and Italian from the San
Francisco Symphony under Herbert Blomstedt (Decca 433 811-2); and a simply
sensational one of Prokofiev's Third - the riotous, swirling, irresistible
symphonic re-thinking of the opera The Fiery Angel - from the Philadelphia
Orchestra under Riccardo Muti (Philips 432 992-2).
Stravinsky's two-piano (or four-hand) music, including the 'black-and-white'
version of The Rite of Spring, is put across with dazzling zest by Vladimir
Askenazy and Andrey Gavrilov (Decca 433 82902). Esa-Pekka Salonen's
Stravinsky series for Sony gains new lustre from its latest addition - a
beautifully keen, purposeful reappraisal of Orpheus, most unjustly neglected
of the neo-Classical ballets, coupled with an equally keen but slightly
over-assertive Petrushka (SK 53 274). The Virgin Classics disc devoted to
the music of Oliver Knussen, including the Songs without Voices and Hums and
Songs of Winnie-the-Pooh, is modern music at once toughly made and
captivating to the ear, small in scale but not in ambition (VC 7 59308 2).
A handful of vocal gems to end. Michael Chance, the most appealing
countertenor voice of our day, offers with Christopher Wilson a programme of
Lute Songs touched by grace, sensitivity and eloquent understatement
(Chandos CHAN 0538). DG's two-disc reissue (437 348-2) of Lieder by the
unforgotten, still-lamented Irmgard Seefried delights, stirs and uplifts in
the sound of every robustly communicative word and note (and this even when
the voice itself was caught in less than perfect estate). And finally, back
to Cecilia Bartoli, partnered by the pianist Andras Schiff, for a programme
of Italian songs by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn and Schubert that gave me
greater and more continuous joy than any other record released this year
(Decca 440 297-2).

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Profit from choice - Richard Fairman finds it
difficult to keep up with the quantity and range of classical music on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS has certainly been a year when the record industry has made the news,
though not always for the recordings it was producing. It seems record
company managers spend most of their time in court or even - for a few
memorable sessions - in the House of Commons Committee rooms.
The most most memorable image of 1993 was Gerald Kaufmann and the industry
Chairman at loggerheads across the table, each doing his best to shout down
the other on the question of CD prices. Meanwhile, a European court
delivered judgment in a test case regarding bootleg recordings of Elton
John; and, in London, George Michael is still in court trying to extricate
himself from his contract with his record company, Sony.
On the question of pricing, the industry argument has always been that the
profit on successful CDs funds risk-taking elsewhere. I do not know whether
that is the logic behind the flood of new classical recordings that
continues to pour on to the market-place, but it is difficult to keep up
with the quantity and range of CDs being offered to consumers.
Gerald Kaufmann and David Mellor are on opposite sides of the CD pricing
debate, but it became clear in the reporting of the House of Commons enquiry
that both have a partiality to the recordings of the middle-sized British
company, Hyperion. I share that enthusiasm and particularly admire the
company's growing number of imaginative song records. The CD of Margaret
Price singing with grand and mature beauty in Schumann (CDA 66596) may not
be to all tastes, but it is very special and definitely to mine.
Probably the most newsworthy event in artistic terms has been the launch of
Decca's series entitled 'Entartete Musik'. This is devoted to music
destroyed or banned by dictatorial political regimes and its first two
issues were of operas from Nazi Germany - Krenek's Jonny spielt auf and
Korngold's Der Wunder der Heliane. Both are admirably well performed and
recorded. The Krenek (436 631-2) is the more original opera, a strange blend
of art at its most popular and its most dense; the Korngold (436 636-2), an
old-fashioned romantic spectacular, is the safer bet.
For an example of the technical art of recording at its most advanced the
best choice is Debussy's Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien (Sony SK 48240), a
mystical orchestral pageant with speech and song. The sound quality
transports the listener away to an other-worldly ambience, in which
Debussy's music sounds even more ravishing than usual. Michael Tilson Thomas
conducts the London Symphony Orchestra and exemplary vocal soloists.
Another London orchestra - the Royal Philharmonic under Vladimir Ashkenazy -
gave an excellent account of itself in a CD of Walton's two symphonies
(Decca 433 703-2). The performance of the First might have kept the symphony
more single-mindedly on the path to its Hollywood-like final curtain; but
the Second is beautifully done, lyrical, sensuous, glowing with
Mediterranean colours, another splendid recording.
In the year of the Maastricht showdown I cannot resist the temptation of
selecting Elgar's often memorable early cantata Caractacus. The new
recording by the LSO under Richard Hickox (Chandos CHAN 9156/7) has many
strengths and the work's unashamedly patriotic text has taken on a
delightful topicality. The final chorus could be the Eurosceptics'
rallying-cry: 'On though the world desert you, on so your cause be right;
Britons alert] and fear not'.
To move further afield, the opening-up of contacts in Russia continues to
bring the country's cultural glories to a wider audience. An agreement
between Philips and the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg is well into its
stride and has scored its most notable success so far with a highly
recommendable version of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades (438 141-2). The
cast features leading lights from the new generation of Russian singers, who
have been causing such a stir in opera-houses worldwide.
Unfortunately, we said farewell this year to one of the most eminent of
post-war singers: Boris Christoff, who died in June. His art was far from
exhaustively documented on record, but the recordings that we do have
capture his larger-than-life personality as vividly as could be. EMI's
reissue of the 1955 set of Verdi's Don Carlos (CMS 7 64642-2) in which he
sings an unforgettable King Philip proved well-timed.
Finally, an absolute winner. It almost seems a cliche to include a CD which
has already won the Gramophone 'Record of the Year' award, but Anne Sofie
von Otter's recital of Grieg songs (DG 437 521-2) cannot be neglected. This
is marvellously spontaneous singing, which raises the stature of Grieg's
songs to an altogether higher level: a splendid tribute to the composer in
his 150th anniversary year.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: In praise of modern epics - David Murray admires
recordings of Maxwell Davies and Birtwistle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINE individual performances come and go on records, whilst the music itself
continues its serene existence in a timeless realm. But modern recording
makes not only unique performances available to far-flung audiences, but new
music itself, which in the old days you could discover only by being a good
score-reader or travelling far. Two records this year offer landmark-works
by British composers to the wider audience.
On Collins 13902, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies conducts his own Worldes Blis
with the Royal Philharmonic. Famously, its 1969 Prom audience loathed it and
stalked out in droves; now it sounds - in its tortuous, Mahlerian way - like
molten inspiration, squeezed out under extraordinary pressure. The CD
includes two more recent Davies works, both appealing: the lucid
ground-pieces for The Turn of the Tide, designed for expansion by school
groups, and his grave, whimsical 'in memoriam' pavane for Sir Charles
Groves.
On Collins 13872 Elgar Howarth conducts the Philharmonia in both Harrison
Birtwistle's grand, rhetorical Prom success of 1972, The Triumph of Time,
and a grand orchestral suite, Gawain's Journey - well, more than a suite,
but not quite a symphony - from his resplendent 1991 opera Gawain. It is not
a musical reprise of the stage action, for it chops forward and back through
the score; but every 'late' Birtwistle score has its own fierce consistency,
and this re-ordered set of Gawain parts never sounds like a patchwork. On
the contrary, the epic musical events suggest their own wordless, towering
scenario. And anyhow, the disc gives intrepid listeners the chance to get
deep into some magnificent new music - parts of which may be trimmed away
from the lengthy opera when Covent Garden revives it.

THE essential folk re-issue of the year is Hanibal's three CD set devoted to
the career of Richard Thompson, Watching the Dark (HNCD 5303). A wonderful
mix of the rare and the well known from the 1960s and his days with Fairport
Convention to the 1990s and his solo recordings The Dark confirms Thompson's
stature as an enthralling guitarist and singer and writer of bitter love
songs in which pain is forever uppermost. He is, with Elvis Costello,
Britain's greatest describer of despair.
Also superb is the first eponymous album of Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle (Hannibal
HNCD 4401). On it they cleverly unite the folk and singer-songwriter
traditions by yoking together the concerns of singer-songwriterdom -
personal confession, intimacy - with the instruments of folk, rather than
rock. The result, which includes their own version of the hit they wrote for
Linda Ronstadt, 'Heart Like A Wheel' and the oft-recorded 'Talk To Me Of
Mendocino', is one of the best unknown albums of the 1970s.
For historians the set of the year was British Pop Before the Beatles (EMI
789220-226). There was pop music in Britain before the 1960s but it was a
very strange phenomenon. The values of light entertainment held sway and,
for the most part, Rock'N'Roll spoke with a decidedly polite growl.
Collectively the seven CD set tells the story of how an American music was
tentatively transplanted to the UK and, against all expectations took root.
This sense of everything happening at one remove, of intense experiences
being filtered through the due decorum of being British, is the prevailing
mood of the early volumes. Even when teenagers take over from the first
British middle-aged celebrants of Rock'N'Roll, they are just as repressed.
Real delight does not figure until volume 3 and 1958 with Cliff Richard's
'Move It'. Similarly pain, the other central teenage emotion, does not occur
until volume 4 and Billy's Fury's brooding, haunted 'Maybe Tomorrow'. In
their place, good taste and condescension to things American reign.
But that certainly does not mean that the recordings are boring. If one is
interested in the complex process that attended the rise of pop (teenage
oriented) music at the expense of popular music this set is essential
listening. For example, listening to the CDs two small but significant
observations comes to mind: the long time it took for UK session guitarists
to lose their dance band habits and play the guitar with attack rather than
restraint (compare the Bert Weedon's 'clever' version of 'Apache' here with
the Shadows' recording).
Equally notable is the complete absence of the manic excitement of so much
American Rock'N'Roll. The outrage of something like 'Riot in Cell Block No
9' is smothered by embarrassment in the British cover version. The set also
explains why the Beatles and their fellow beat groups took root so quickly:
their forebears had prepared the ground before them but not sown the seed.
On the soul front the great re-issue is the two CD set, The Best Of Solomon
Burke (Rhino/Atlantic 8122-70284-2) which collects together the best of
Burke's ever so church derived messages. Not for nothing did Burke dub
himself the king of rock and soul. His impassioned soul pleadings - 'The
Price', 'Just Out Of Reach', 'Everybody Needs somebody to Love', etc. -
justifies that title.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Tuned in to jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT pocketsize selection of discs from 1993 would I recommend to represent
favourite moods evoked during the 12 months? Assume it is an overcoat which
can accommodate a dozen and start with Jan Garbarek's Twelve Moons (ECM 519
500-2). This is the best of the Norwegian saxophonist's bands, the regular
electro-bass and twinkling synth augmented by Marilyn Mazur's agitato
percussion and the icily serene blasts of traditional singing. The music is
alternately earnest and thrilling, always magnificent, but requiring the
listener to keep the collar turned up for warmth. There ought to be a
Norwegian proverb to describe Garbarek's music along the lines of 'cold
notes, warm heart'.
As a means of thawing out, choose Don Pullen's African-Brazilian Connection
and Ode To Life (Blue Note 0777 7 8923329). In this tribute to longtime
partner George Adams, the pianist's attacking runs are made into the
cushioning sounds and syncopation of Senegal and Sao Paulo. Intelligent and
at the same time devil-may-care in his percussive construction, the Pullen
mixture of piquancy and poignancy is richly concentrated here.
Randy Weston leads a big band which includes new boy Wallace Roney and Talib
Kibwe opposite old hands Hamiett Blueitt and Teddy Edwards in Volcano Blues
(Verve 519 269-2), a similarly spicy concoction. One of the first exponents
of so-called world music, the gangling pianist's precipitous style is
harnessed by arranger Melba Liston for some openly creaking, blue washed
charts of big hearted pleasure.
But if the loose-boned relaxation of Pullen and Weston proves too much of a
good thing then guitarist Joe Pass has produced a typically taut mainstream
delight in My Song (Telarc 83326), which sees him swinging precisely through
standards in a quintet reinvented after so many year's absence. More often
heard solo (but sounding like a duo) these days, the addition of rhythm
guitar and piano to Pass's clean and melodic lines gives new dimensions to
the swinging virtuoso.
You need to have a high and wild big band in the pack of course and end of
millennium madness dictates that it be led by young English eccentric Django
Bates, who almost the reincarnates Loose Tubes with his 'Delightful
Precipice'. In several sides of inspired and hugely musical lunacy Summer
Fruits (and unrest) (JMT 514 008-2) ) manages to combine Charles Mingus with
Spike Jones to spectacular and breathtakingly cheeky effect.
Some muscle should be given to the collection and that means bad bass driven
funk: Marcus Miller obliged in 1993 with The Sun Don't Lie (FDM 36560-2).
The sonorous and often foundation shaking bass guitar of Miller leads jazz
funk/rock statesmen such as David Sanborn, Wayne Shorter and Omar Hakim
through his own dark compositions. The inventor of the genre, Miles Davis
even pops in, posthumously.
And a favourite newcomer for 1993? British tenor saxophonist Theo Travis
made his debut with an authentically intoxicating early hours set, 2 am
(33JAZZ01 1). Fluid and fluent in technique, Travis also writes a good tune.
A prodigious number of reissues were mined from the back catalogues this
year, like last. Polygram and EMI Records have the richest seam with the
Verve and Blue Note labels respectively. My own favourites were a Stan Getz
retrospective The Best of the Verve Years Vol 2 (Verve 517330-2) and The
Rodgers &amp; Hart Songbook (Verve 516 158- 2). The latter matches the great
jazz singers (Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Holiday, Simone) with great American
songs such as 'Little Girl Blue', 'You Took Advantage Of Me'. Blue Note
favourites included, among many, The Best of Grant Green (Blue Note 0777 7
8962229) which, in this almost 'acid' setting exposes the late Green as a
greatly underrated talent. The combination of Nancy Wilson's lean and
expressive vocal tones alongside Cannonball Adderley's alto sax in the 1961
sessions from the same stable (Capitol Jazz 07777 81204 2 I) is sublime.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Books: My Book of The Year - Our reviewers choose the books
they have enjoyed most published during 1993
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MY CHOICE IS Vikram Seth's novel A Suitable Boy (Orion Pounds 20.00)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
all 1349 pages of it. Its people have remained with me vividly both as
individuals and as part of that post-Independence Indian society of which
the novel gives an amazingly complete picture. The story never loses sight
of its beautiful young heroine Lata whose choice of a partner for life is
its core; but it also deals brilliantly with many fascinating choices,
personal, political, spiritual, made by the other members of its large cast
of characters. The book is vastly long but never over-facing or boring. Here
is a contemporary novel in which you can immerse yourself happily for weeks
on end.
ANTHONY CURTIS
                             *      *      *
FEW biographies wear well. One that just might is my book for 1993 - Harold
J Laski: A Life on the Left by Isaac Kramnick and Berry Sheerman (Hamish
Hamilton, Pounds 25.00). It is an exceptionally competent, comprehensive,
readable work. A truly worthy centennial tribute. Laski has been dead 43
years, and is almost forgotten in the west. Not so in India. The
Gandhi-Laski encounter in London 1931 described here gives a fresh insight
into their characters. The authors write that,'There was a vacant chair at
every cabinet meeting in India, reserved for the ghost of Prof Harold
Laski'. That ghost still turns up in Delhi when least expected.
K. NATWAR-SINGH
                             *      *      *
MINE MUST be Margaret Thatcher's The Downing Street Years (Harper Collins,
Pounds 25.00). I found it compulsive reading, evangelistic yes, biased, not
nearly as much as I had expected. She is generous about most of her
colleagues, bears very little malice, if much pain. She is superb on the
Falklands, splendid on Scargill and dreadfully right about Europe. Too
starry perhaps about Gorbachev: and I shudder a little at her adulation of
'Ron'. Small blemishes on a magnificent career that bought a sinking Britain
safe to shore. The book has longueurs and is not well constructed, but is
head and shoulders above the waffling Macmillan or the verbose Wilson. What
a fighting spirit, what a sad loss] Read it.
JH PLUMB
                             *      *      *
MY BOOK this year is Dr Johnson &amp; Mr Savage by Richard Holmes (Hodder &amp;
Stoughton Pounds 19.99). It has always been a puzzle why Johnson, in later
life a domineering pillar of propriety, wrote in 1774 a curiously haunting
life of Richard Savage, obscure poet, drunken debtor, reprieved murderer,
self-deluded claimant of aristocratic parentage and regular biter of the
hand that fed him. Holmes most percipient of literary biographers
brilliantly analyses their short relationship in 1737-39. Savage alternated
between grand salons and lowest Grub Street; the young Johnson fresh from
the provinces fascinated by Savage's worldly charm, paced the night streets
of London with him in endless talk. This, as Holmes says is the 'story of a
friendship' and the 'biography of a biography' - in fact of the first
English biography. It is based on profound research and is wonderfully
readable.
ROBERT BLAKE
                             *      *      *
LIKE EVERY English-speaking Verdian I have been waiting a long time for Mary
Jane Phillips-Matz to finish her biography of the composer. It has been in
the works for decades, while the author - a tireless, indeed relentless
investigator - has dazzled, sometimes infuriated fellow-scholars with her
discoveries, making all of us re-examine not only beloved legends (like
Verdi's self-invented rags-to-riches story) but also traditional attitudes.
Spending months every year in Verdi's native area, the author knows every
building in Busseto, every field Verdi owned. No parish archive, no village
registry has escaped her scrutiny. At last her Verdi is here (Oxford, Pounds
30.00) A long story, it is as irresistible as the Po in full flood. Like all
biographies, it contains conjecture, some of it bold, but most of it
convincing; in any case, the detective-author fairly presents all her clues;
the reader can judge for himself.
WILLIAM WEAVER
                             *      *      *
WHAT A delight to discover Ursule Molinaro's Fat Skeletons (Serif, Pounds
7.99), a witty, pungent, short novel that targets both the feminist and
literary worlds. Having never read anything of Molarino previously, I see
from the blurb that she is 'a grand and eccentric old dame of letters' with
a long list of translations and novels to her name. This may account for the
certainty of touch and economy of words that make this story of a top woman
translator working in New York city such an effective novel. I can only say
that sparkling and amusing books in this genre are difficult to find. This
one made me laugh uproariously. It is the perfect Christmas stocking-filler.
ZARA STEINER
                             *      *      *
I FOUND great enjoyment in Madame Blavatsky's Baboon by Peter Washington
(Secker, Pounds 20). It casts a splendidly cold eye on the bizarre
collection of gurus who confected Theosophy, not least on Helena Petrovna
Blavatsky (she of the poached egg eyes and the burning glance), and on such
cranks as Charles Leadbeater (ex Anglican curate and reluctant even to shake
hands with a woman). The cast is gruesomely comic; the narrative - and its
conclusions - fascinating. And, as a tale of financial adventure, but a true
one, let me recommend Charles Gordon's The Cedar Story, (Sinclair Stevenson,
Pounds 18.99) whose subtitle - The Night the City was Saved - rightly
conveys the energy of Gordon's buccaneering narrative.
CLEMENT CRISP
                             *      *      *
MY BEST book is Francis Haskell's History and its Images: Art and the
Interpretation of the Past (Yale University Press, Pounds 29.95.) We take it
for granted that art illumines the past. Yet Haskell shows it was not until
the 18th century that historians became confident about using visual
evidence. He explores scholars' views over three centuries of argument as to
what art can reveal about the past. If an emperor's portrait makes him look
evil, was he? Does art reveal a nation's moral health? Can art prophecy -
did David's 'Oath of the Horatii' foretell the French Revolution?
Haskell marshals hundreds of clever men and batty judgments, forgotten names
and towering figures such as Gibbon, Michelet, Burckhardt, Ruskin. This is a
long book written with vigour, wit, and clarity. Should you get
side-tracked, on no account miss the final chapter on Johann Huizinga,
author of the Waning of the Middle Ages.
PATRICIA MORISON
                             *      *      *
HISTORY SEEN through personal experience may gain in vividness and passion
what it loses in balance and breadth. Richard Lamb's War in Italy 1943-45: A
Brutal Story (John Murray, Pounds 19.99), my choice, is an account of his
two years fighting with the Royal Italian Army, while Italy starved and
struggled between opposing armies and ideologies and armed factions of its
own, disease and chaos increased and liberators often seemed like enemies.
In telling his tale very much from the Italian point of view, Lamb is often
idiosyncratic in judgment, but he deals with aspects of the total upheaval
that may have been missed by more orthodox historians, and his love of Italy
and Italians shines through the horrors he recalls with passionate,
sometimes angry, regret.
ISABEL QUIGLY
                             *      *      *
I WAS thrilled to come across Christians Morgenstern's Songs from the
Gallows (Yale University Press Pounds 16.95) in a brilliant new translation
by Walter Arndt. Morgenstern was a German nonsense poet whose upside down
world and playful magic language resembled Lewis Carroll's. He began writing
his fantastical gallows songs in the 1900s, after a happy outing passed
Gallows Hill, near Potsdam. His characters include a watch that winds up and
down by drinking glasses of Mocha and Scotch, a drivel-shrivelling machine
and a menagerie of weird and melancholy chattering beasts. His metaphysical
jokes and haunting images work well in English; the German original also
appears alongside each translation. The volume is beautifully produced, and
should win this great lyric/comic poet a wide new audience.
JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
                             *      *      *
AUDEN SAID that for writing well, Time would pardon even Paul Claudel. There
is no denying a degree of political incorrectness in Alan Clark's Diaries
(Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 20.00) but it would be a very blinkered
spirit who could not enjoy them until time has drained all Clark's
offensiveness away. Pleasure springs not just from every page but from
virtually every sentence. There is of course, a lot of politics, including
some wonderful stories. But this is not a book to be valued primarily for
what is going on in Westminster and Whitehall. It is what was going on in
Clark that counts. Like all good autobiographers, he relishes his faults no
less than his virtues. His clear, un-self-justifying eye, his exposed heart
and his exact prose provide a rivetting experience: comic, provocative and
elegiac by turns.
KIT MCMAHON
                             *      *      *
LENIN'S TOMB by David Remnick (Random House, Dollars 25.00) came my way in
the course of work, and I certainly did not expect it would fit that
splendidly composite cliche, unputdownable. Remnick redeems a whole
generation of reporters who provided phoney descriptions of the late,
unlamented Soviet world. It was his - and our - good luck that he was in
Moscow during the years when Gorbachev brought the whole edifice down.
Evidently energetic and curious by nature, he gives you a sense of what it
was like to experience this weird historic event. This is a real-life
thriller written by someone unafraid to pass moral judgments - and all in
graceful prose too.
DAVID PRYCE-JONES
                             *      *      *
I CHOOSE Christopher Hope's The Love Songs of Nathan J. Swirsky (Macmillan,
Pounds 13.99), a small, wry, often wonderfully funny addition to the
literature of childhood. In a way, this is To Kill a Mockingbird turned
upside down: for these vignettes of suburban white Johannesburg in the 1950s
add up to a pessimistic vision of the South African apartheid society taking
shape at the time. Hope's writing shows here a new economy, a glancing
lightness, which makes his hitting of comic targets all the more precise.
MAX LOPPERT
                             *      *      *
AT LAST there is a UK edition of Raymond Carver's selected short stories,
Where I'm Calling From (Harvill, Pounds 8.99) compiled by the American
writer just before he died at 50 in 1988. Carver was the son of a saw-mill
worker and a waitress; he worked as a porter, petrol pump attendant,
deliveryman and dictionary salesman. Publishers ignored him until 1976. Each
story is a sideways glance at life from a passing train; and Carver's
melancholic wit and sad actualities are the best you will find outside
Chekhov. These 37 pieces cover domestic, family and professional life, each
wonderfully different but reassuringly similar. After reading them, as
Carver says, 'maybe our hearts or our intellects will have moved off the peg
just a little from where they were before.' But you have to be in rude
psychic health: Carver offers no cheer to the unhappy.

VED MEHTA'S delightful Up at Oxford (John Murray, Pounds 17.99), reminded me
of my own days there in the late 1950s. The Indian English Literature
student, with his unending supply of girls eager to read him poetry and
novels, was already something of a legend. His book is generous, even
reverential, treating the absurdities he encountered as lovable examples of
English eccentricity. 'What games do you intend to play?' asks the Master on
their first meeting, 'Cricket, rugby, tennis?' The frontispiece shows him
playing croquet. Ved is blind.

A MAYOR who attacks picnickers in the Botanical Garden with a Stinger
missile. Outraged citizens who tie him to four different cars and drive off
in opposite directions. A schoolmaster who keeps the remains in his freezer
until he can bury them piece by piece . . . The book I enjoyed most this
year was Elect Mr Robinson for a Better World (Heinemann, Pounds 9.99), a
splendidly funny first novel by Donald Antrim. It's an absurdist satire on
small-town America, in the finest traditions of Heller and Roth. It passed
with barely a ripple when first published in England. But everyone who
bothered to review it enjoyed it enormously. They could hardly have done
otherwise.

ANYONE WITH a taste for spicy food and wild tales of the Mexican Revolution
will enjoy Like Water for Hot Chocolate by Laura Esquivel (Doubleday Pounds
13.99/Pounds 6.99). The recipes are authentic ones from the turn of the
century and full of mouth- watering detail, but do not expect to find the
ingredients in your local supermarket. The linking love story is as exotic
as the food, a kind of soap opera gone mad which leaves a strange, sad
after-taste.

MANY GREAT religious paintings have been produced by profoundly unholy
artists but for Fra Angelico, art was an expression of faith. That has not
stopped most art historians form ducking the problem of what it means to be
both friar and painter. William Hood in his exceptionally beautifully
illustrated Fra Angelico at San Marco (Yale University Press, Pounds 45.00)
look at the different kinds of decoration of the various zones of the
monastery of San Marco in Florence as aids to devotion. He convinced me at
least of beginning to see these works as a Dominican monk at the monastery
might have seen them in the 15th century. It is rather like having surtitles
that allow you to understand what is going on in the opera rather than
simply enjoy a divine noise. The supple - at times poetic - monograph is a
model of its kind.

I HAVE been driving around the country a great deal this year and have been
converted to the Audiobook, which is, apparently, a fast-rising medium.
Nothing speeds a journey so happily. Consider, for example, the recently
released set of Derek Jacobi's magnificent reading of The Iliad in Robert
Fagles' wonderful new translation (Penguin Audiobooks, Pounds 19.99). To
listen to these six cassettes (playing time about 9 hours - call it 600 to
700 Motorway miles) is revelatory: Homer brought to life. In less elevated
mode, John Le Carre reads his own new novel, The Night Manager (Random House
Audiobooks, four tapes, Pounds 11.99). Le Carre is a famous mimic and there
is much fascination in hearing the accents and inflexions he gives his cast
of warring Whitehall bureaucrats and City villains. It is almost better than
the book, except that, as with so many of these tapes, it is 'abridged'. I
would argue that abridgement is A Bad Thing, and recommend you ideally to
try 'Cover-to-Cover', a splendid firm that refuses to tolerate such
commercial barbarity as cutting down the author's text.

                             *      *      *
I WAS struck by Anne Wallace's unusual choice of subject-matter and
independent-minded approach in Walking, Literature and English Culture: The
Origins and Uses of the Peripatetic in the Nineteenth Century (Oxford
University Press, Pounds 30.00). Much of the book is concerned with the
change in attitudes to walking that took place between the 1790s and the
1820s, as a result of a transport revolution that made it possible to see
wandering round on foot as a matter of deliberate choice - rather than an
activity confined to the poor, the raffish and the criminal. Wallace
discusses not only writers such as Wordsworth, who explicitly link poetry to
pedestrianism, but also some less obvious exponents of 'the peripatetic',
such as Jane Austen. The topic seems especially interesting now that walking
is, perhaps, on the verge of being reclassified as eccentric or aberrant -
as has long been the case in American suburbs.
CHLOE CHARD
                             *      *      *
I VOTE for the richly detailed bleakness of Penelope Lively's Cleopatra's
Sister (Viking, Pounds 14.99), a journey through the problems of fate and
choice for a couple who meet and fall in love when the passengers on an
aircraft are kidnapped. This happens somewhere west of Egypt (where she set
Moon Tiger - this new book develops from it) in Callimbia, a by-passed
country where Berenice, sister of Cleopatra, once reigned. How different
history could have been if Antony had turned to visit her instead. Lively
tells a sharp story, making life's improbabilities painfully vivid. I liked
her understanding of the compulsion of the fossils that drives the
palaeontologist hero; her sense of the nightmares of travel in much of the
world (not that they deter travellers); and the fragile truth of her
indecisive ending.
GERALD CADOGAN

I thought that Alan Clark's Diaries were snobbish, self-indulgent and not
written from the inside. On another hand, so many other people seem to have
enjoyed them that they are clearly a candidate for book of the year. They
are also more readable than the other political memoirs published as the
year went on. Clark can write.
I admired John Campbell's biography of Sir Edward Heath and Philip Ziegler's
of Lord Wilson, but would recommend neither for holiday reading except to
the most earnest. The first 100 pages or so of Sir Peregrine Worsthorne's
Tricks of Memory are wonderful - skip the rest.
It was also good to see a biography of William Archer, the man who brought
Ibsen to the English stage. New translations of Ibsen are less stilted than
anything that Archer produced, but at least Archer saw the talent. The
biography is by Peter Whitebrook and published by Methuen.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Books: Tempt the young to turn to the bible - The FT
Children's Book of the Month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MY MOTHER forced me, by steady daily toil, to learn long chapters of the
Bible by heart; as well as to read its every syllable through, aloud, hard
names and all, from Genesis to the Acopalyse, about once a year; and to that
discipline - patient, accurate, and resolute - I owe, not only a knowledge
of the book, which I find occasionally serviceable, but much of my general
power of taking pains, and the best part of my taste in literature.' Thus
wrote John Ruskin in 1885 of his strenuous childhood in the 1820s.
A century after Ruskin's death, when many people have little faith or none,
it is difficult to know how to introduce this rich and complicated
inheritance to children. Should it be through one of the traditional
translations or through the collections of easier Bible stories? What is the
Bible to our generation - and what should it be to the next?
Should the Bible be considered mainly as a literary and cultural inheritance
 -as a means to understanding the west's painting, poetry, literature and
music? Or should Bible study be considered as a way of teaching morality -
using the teachings of Christ to show young people how to behave?
The Bible must continue to serve as a living guide to right conduct, runs
this argument. The raciest Bible to be published this autumn, Nelson Word's
Youth Bible (Pounds 9.99), with such words as 'justice . . . fear . . . love
. . . depresLine is overdrawn sion . . . faith . . . sex' blazoned across
its jazzy cover, promises to reveal to 'a new generation that the Bible is
the best guidebook by which to live your life.' Although this approach is
often linked with Evangelical Christianity, even humanists would regard
Christ as a great moral example.
Of this autumn's selection of bibles and part bibles, the Youth Bible
(conceived for young adults) is the least attractive: 'accessible',
'relevant', moralistic, evangelically brow-beating, it is so buttressed
about by useful signposts, 'frameworks for understanding', 'goals' to tempt
uninterested teenagers onto the path to truth, that the complications and
inconsistencies of the book is entirely lost sight of.
Martin Waddell's Stories from the Bible (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 9.95),
which consists of re-tellings of a number of the best known stories from the
Old Testament for children of five and above is beautifully simple and
clear, but the language is often too bright and feisty for the subject
matter. In the beginning, we are told: 'God said: 'Let there be light]' and
there was. It was great.' And: 'The next day God made Heaven and Earth,
doing the big bits first.' Thus, in one swift stroke, children are caused to
lose all sense of gravity and duty. Waddell's account stops inexplicably at
Jonah.
The best of the crop is undoubtedly The Kingfisher Children's Bible (by Ann
Pilling, Pounds 12.99) which both selectively encompasses the Bible from
beginning to end, and mingles a modern re-telling in a language that manages
to retain some sense of the majestic cadences of the King James Bible, with
quotations from that translation and others. And, in spite of the fact that
it is a book of biblical 'highlights', each small, individual chapter is
prefaced by a specific reference back to the Bible itself, book and chapter,
so that children thirsty for more can easily consult the original source.
It therefore achieves what a good modern bible for children needs to achieve
if it is to serve the present generation: a harmonising of past with present
so that children understand that language, stories and moral truths are hard
won and long savoured. A language that leans too heavily upon this month's
idioms will surely be dead by Christmas.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Practical Traveller: The Sting in any language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW years ago, strolling beside the Nile in Cairo, I fell into
conversation with a middle-aged Egyptian. He was charming and affable,
well-dressed and well-spoken. I liked him immediately.
He was, he told me, a lecturer in middle-eastern history. We stopped for
coffee. We talked about Egyptian politics, history, social life. We got
along famously; before the hour was up he had invited me to his niece's
wedding that evening.
We also discussed my own plans to travel around Egypt. He had a contact in
the department of railways, he told me, who could issue two-week,
unlimited-travel rail passes at considerable savings. Normally they were
available only to researchers and academics on official visits. But for me,
his friend, it could be arranged.
We took a taxi to a vast ministry building. I gave him the money for the
pass and waited outside. It was better that way, he said - in shorts and
T-shirt I did not look terribly academic. An hour later I was still waiting,
and went in to investigate.
There was no official who dealt with foreign academics. There was no such
thing as a two-week rail pass. And there was no history lecturer. My
'friend' - one of Cairo's accomplished confidence tricksters - had taken the
money and vanished. I had no-one and nothing to blame except his wholly
convincing act and my own naivete.
We live in a sophisticated age where image and marketing power are
everything. It is no wonder that street crime, too, uses its own slick
methods to exploit the gullibility of travellers unfamiliar with local
conditions. There are still plenty of brutal gunmen and dark alleys out
there, but there are also lots of perfectly charming people who are capable
of lightening your pockets with little more than a smile.
What is worse, you will, at least until it is too late, smile right back.
The following are just a few of the more common methods of non-violent crime
practised on city streets from Mexico to the Philippines.
Diversions and distractions. On a pavement in Zambia I once received a
hearty handshake from a man welcoming me to his country - so vigorous was
it, so engaging his conversation, that it was only minutes later that I
realised he had removed my watch from my wrist. In Barcelona once I was
taken aback when a young woman with a remarkably prominent chest bumped into
me, as it were, head on; I would have liked to think it was true love - her
real purpose, though, was to take my mind off the hand slipping into my back
pocket.
Such diversionary tactics are commonly practised by thieves in crowded
places and often planned by groups of two or three. If a man in your path
appears to slip, or if two boys begin rough-housing in front of you, beware:
as you are bumped and concentrate on not falling, an accomplice may be
deftly picking your pocket or slicing your bag open with a razor. Do not
even check your money if someone rushes up and says you have just been
pickpocketed. This is an easy way of finding out just exactly where you keep
your money; five minutes later you might not have any left.
Extortion by petty bureaucrats. Policemen, soldiers and minor functionaries
are often pitifully paid in the developing world and sometimes cannot resist
abusing the power they have to supplement their wages. At Lagos airport, for
example, customs officials often bluntly ask departing businessmen for
'presents' - so anxious are these travellers to catch their aircraft that
they will hand over money.
Extortion at frontiers and in government offices, though, is one case in
which the victim has a choice. A polite but firm 'no' is usually enough to
make an official back down; the alternative - outright theft  - and its
possible consequences are rarely worth his while.
Credit cards. Never let them out of your sight. A favourite trick of
dishonest Bangkok merchants, among others, is to disappear just long enough
with your card to make a number of blank impressions. A few seconds are
enough. As they have your signature along with your purchase, they are then
free to fake the signature and fill in the blanks as they like.
In countries where credit card purchases may be made by telephone, your
credit card number alone may be sufficient for fraudulent use. In some
cities, customers now ask that even the carbon sheets used to make card
receipts be returned to them - anyone might make use of them once thrown in
the rubbish.
Bank accounts. Be equally cautious about handing out your bank account
number. Although banks are leary of wiring money without sufficient
verification, crooks who are able to obtain your home account number may try
setting up a local account in your name and having funds transferred to it.
Some succeed.
Impersonation. In Manila, tourists are sometimes stopped by men in neat
suits driving large new cars. They flash phoney police badges and explain
they are checking for counterfeit bank notes. They invite the tourists to
step inside, check their cash, surreptitiously remove whatever pleases them,
assure their relieved victims that their money is the real thing, and then
drive off.
Drugging. Strong doses of barbiturates may leave no marks, but in south-east
Asia especially, this is a fast-growing method of robbery. It is easily
practised, for local hospitality - a sweet given on a bus ride, the offer of
a cup of tea - is hard to resist.
Alarmingly, such invitations can end with the guest waking up hours later on
a piece of waste ground with a sore head and an empty wallet. It may be a
pretty young woman at the post office, or a smiling man who says he was your
airport bus driver. These days, sadly, one can never be sure of a smiling
stranger's motives. Caution remains the traveller's best companion.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Travel Books: Guide to the fate of the giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a shock, seeing elephants in the wild. What causes the sensation is
the effect of their size and physicality allied to their vulnerability. You
know that at any time a poacher's spray of bullets could remove this great
beast from the face of the earth.
Anyone heading for the safari grounds of Africa or Asia this winter should
invest Pounds 17.50 in a copy of The Fate of the Elephant by Douglas
Chadwick (Viking). It takes you in close to the giants and makes you feel
ashamed that their fate should be in doubt.
The strength of the book derives from Chadwick's travels. He starts in
Siberia, at a mammoth graveyard (the earliest known human portrait was
carved in mammoth ivory 26,000 years ago).
Then he visits east and central Africa. Then Japan and Hong Kong, where he
investigates the ivory trade. One Japanese netsuke carver tells him that it
would take 12 years to make the transition from carving ivory to carving
wood or some other material, and then another two or three years to learn
the characteristics of each type of wood.
Then India. Then Switzerland, for a meeting of Cites, the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species. ('Wildlife is the
second-most-lucrative illegal trade item in the world, exceeded only by
drugs,' he says). Then Thailand and Malaysia, and finally southern Africa.
Chadwick provides a great amount of elephant lore and information - most of
it gained first-hand - and this can be depressing. For example, he says that
in Tsavo national park, Kenya, he spent days looking for elephants and found
mostly dead ones.
'I learned to locate them the same way scavenging lions find carcasses, by
watching the sky for vultures. Once I found the first of a group, the stench
would lead me to the rest of the family. Four bodies here, six there,
another two across the gully, whitewashed with vulture droppings, putrefying
under the sun until the flesh liquefied . . .'
Chadwick says that the ivory trade is not the greatest threat to the
elephant. Its greatest peril is the explosive growth of the human
population. Both Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus are running out of
living space among 5bn-plus humans, so where will they and their huge needs
fit in as human numbers approach the 10bn to 12bn projected within 50 years?
The Fate of the Elephant is not all gloom. Chadwick explains how his travels
made him grow to like wild elephants tremendously. He found them
overwhelmingly sociable, expressive and emotional. Their size is pulverising
yet they react to the smallest things - pausing to let a mongoose scurry by
or cautiously circling a paper wrapper left by a tourist.
All the while, says Chadwick, he had a very strong sense of a mind behind
each elephant's actions: a sense of information being processed in
interesting and highly individual ways.
The fate of the elephant will be a close-run thing. 'I want to believe,'
says Chadwick, 'that we will ultimately save elephants and that we will do
it because we acknowledge and accept their commonality with us.'
With luck, says the author, man's moral progression will enable him to
extend his sense of kin to other species. Chadwick wouldn't be surprised if
elephants help show the way.
Train Journeys of the World (Automobile Association, Pounds 16.99) covers
what it calls 30 of the world's most spectacular and famous rail routes.
Photography and maps are excellent, and the commentaries strike a good
balance between information and travelogue.
Journeys include the Marrakech Express to Casablanca and Fes; Japan's Bullet
Train; the central railway of Peru; the Rhine valley (Cologne-Frankfurt);
Austria (Bregenz-Vienna); the Glacier express through Switzerland; Spain's
Andalusian express; southern India (Madras-Ootacamund); Bangkok-Singapore,
and Cairo-Aswan.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Bubbly competition winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WEEKEND FT readers revealed an extraordinary fondness for puns, anagrams and
acronyms in a competition I set last month to find an acceptable colloquial
name for bottle-fermented sparkling wine that is not made in Champagne,
writes Jancis Robinson.
Of the hundreds of suggestions, most were inspired by the forbidden
appellation, as in Shampagne, the choice of many but, surely, too
perjorative. There was Champ, Pagnecham, Chamagne, withChamps, Sparklagne,
and, perhaps most onomatopoeically appealing, Chamcham.
Pascham, like many of the entries, depended on a fair knowledge of French,
although the Scotswoman who suggested it was keen to say that the name
incorporated 'more than a hint of passion' (she also asked us not to print
her address as: 'We'd rather not have any uninvited visitors after the
prize'.)
Another opinionated suggestion came from Cambridge, but again was
pejorative: 'May I suggest that for something essentially bubbly and frothy
a suitable name would be 'Fergie'. This has the further advantage that it
suggests it is not quite the real thing'.
The phrase Vin Deux Fois suggested a full grasp of production techniques, as
did Bib (for Bubbled in Bottle). Notch (short for Not Champagne) suggested
by a Belgian diplomat based in Muscadet country also had its attractions.
But the six bottles of Green Point 1990 donated by Mot &amp; Chandon go to a
reader with an indecipherable signature and the post code BN7 3PF near
Lewes, east Sussex, for Trad, a shortened form of the official 'Methode
Traditionnelle' description to be found increasingly on labels. He or she
pointed out that it could be used as in 'non-vintage trad' and, in this
case, jolly good 'Australian trad'. The name may not fizz on the tongue, but
its credentials sound impeccably solid.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Still silence of the Lowlands
 -Giles MacDonogh mourns the closure of a string of distilleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a bad year in the Scottish distilleries. The heady liquid in the
whisky loch is rising fast and the industry's response has been to silence a
number of stills.
Most distilleries close for a spell during summer to allow staff to holiday
and for maintenance work; but this year the closures were longer than usual
and some of the distilleries did not open for production in the autumn.
As you travel from still to still you hear some pretty fancy semantics these
days: when is a 'silent' distillery actually a mothballed distillery; when
is a mothballed distillery actually closed?
Worst hit have been the Lowland malts. In June, United Distillers decided to
close all its Lowland distilleries with the exception of Glenkinchie.
Whisky-lovers shed the odd tear for the gentle Bladnoch, Scotland's most
southerly distillery: a delicate, Lowland classic. But that was nothing to
their reaction to the closure of Rosebank, a triple-distilled whisky which
many considered the greatest in its class.
There was no question that Rosebank was a better malt than Glenkinchie; but
Glenkinchie had an advantage which Rosebank could not equal: the distillery
is in a pretty valley just half an hour's drive from Edinburgh; perfect for
a day out for tourists. Rosebank, on the other hand, was in the ugly
industrial town of Falkirk. Not many tourists would travel to Falkirk. So
Rosebank got the bullet.
In June, Bladnoch and Rosebank were definitely closed. UD's decision was
hardly greeted with applause from the specialist press and the company
modified its tone. Now the stills are simply mothballed. Time will tell us
what that expression means.
Bladnoch and Rosebank were just the last in a series of closures. Gone is
Grants' Ladyburn; St Magdelene and Kinclaith went a decade ago; Allied's
Lomond and Interleven have been mothballed; At the moment only one Lowland
malt, Auchentoshan, is distilling.
Why did the Lowland malts go to the wall? Opinions differ. For a malt whisky
to survive, say the experts, it must be able to appeal to the blenders.
Within UD the line is that the Lowland malts had too little personality to
play a big role in blends such as Johnnie Walker or Bells.
In the distilleries, however, one hears a quite different story: at
Glenkinchie only 10 per cent is reserved for release as a single malt; the
rest goes into UD blends. Similarly Stewart Hodgkinson at Auchentoshan told
me that his whisky was in demand from blenders as it 'packed' a blend and
allowed, you to be a little more sparing with the more rarified products of
the Highlands and Islands.
Snooping round a blender's office the other day I found no shortage of
Lowland malts among the palate of whiskies to be used in one of the premium
blends.
When I spoke to the blender about this he was frank: he deeply regretted the
passing of some of the Lowland malts, in particular Rosebank, but he had no
shortage of stock for the time being.
Glenkinchie is also silent. The excuse is the need to replace the wash tun:
the vessel in which the porridge-like wort is mixed from malted barley and
hot water. The new wash tun will take a year to fit, say UD. Elsewhere they
are sceptical. 'It took us just six weeks to replace our wash tun,' One
distillery manager told me, 'Why do they need a year?' The implication is
that Glenkinchie has also produced more than it can sell.
Still, UD is unlikely to mothball Glenkinchie, which plays is part of the
highly successful 'Classic Malts' portfolio. It is a light whisky. Almost no
peat is used in the drying of the malt. As a result Glenkinchie is more or
less devoid of the smokey, phenolic aromas of the more powerful malts. It is
certainly not a bad dram: the aromas of dried fruit and nuts dominate.
With Rosebank gone, Auchentoshan is the last Scottish malt to be made by
triple distillation: a method which was always common practice in the
Scottish Lowlands and Ireland. Triple distillation means that the whisky
comes off the still with a higher proportion of the beery wash transformed
into alcohol than in the case of a double-distilled malt. The process
eliminates quite a number of flavour compounds, but it also removes the
heaviness of the malt.
Auchentoshan's light elegance together with its delicate orange zest and
cereal bouquet have encouraged the distillery's owners, Morrison-Bowmore, to
launch a new malt in the new year: Auchentoshan 'Select'.
This is to be a vatted malt without an 'age statement' designed to appeal to
the younger drinker who is being wooed by bourbon and vodka. I have tasted
the malt. It is not their standard 10-year-old, nor is it their fruity
21-year-old; but it deserves to succeed if the Lowland style is to survive.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Top taste - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ICA is launching a series of dinners called TASTE at which top chefs who
have had a big impact on British cooking will prepare a dinner and then
answer questions.
The series was due to kick off yesterday with Alastair Little, who normally
cooks at his Frith Street, London, restaurant. Rick Stein from the Seafood
Restaurant, in Cornwall, follows in February and Bruno Loubet in March.
Chefs Shaun Hill, Paul Rankin and Paul Gayler perform later in 1994.
Tickets cost Pounds 45 each (Pounds 80 for 2) including a three-course
dinner and wine, with proceeds to the development of the artistic programme.
Contact Melissa Larner tel: 071-873-0061, fax 071-873-0051.
Four very different French chefs - Michel Roux, Raymond Blanc, Bruno Loubet
and Michel Lorain - will be taking over the kitchens of Le Meridien,
Piccadilly, from Monday November 29 to Thursday December 2.
With the permission of David Chambers, the hotel's head chef, they will be
cooking meals that will include their interpretation of such British dishes
as baked cod in parsley sauce (Roux), bread and butter pudding (Blanc),
individual toad in the hole with onion gravy (Loubet) and sticky toffee
pudding (Lorain).
The wines, available by the bottle, half and glass, are from the Baron de
Philippe de Rothschild properties. Dinner will cost Pounds 49 per person
excluding wines. Tel: 071-734-8000, ext 43.

WE ARE encouraged to repeat last year's Guide to Armchair Shopping by an
account of how one reader made full use of the column recommending top-class
food producers.
The reader, a 'legal eagle' during the week and a keen cook at the weekend,
returned home late one night, sat down with his Weekend FT, worked out his
requirements and sent them off by fax. In spite of the fact that it was late
at night he received confirmation of one order, for wild boar, by return -
obviously from a farmer who keeps his fax machine in the bedroom. Three days
later the boar was delivered.
We hope that this year's guide will save you all considerable backache.

WINES AND SPIRITS
Most wine merchants are organised, and only too pleased, to despatch a case
of wine by post or carrier.

have created a wide range of gift packs.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Errors and omissions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WE APOLOGISE to four schools mistakenly omitted from our table. These were
Dr Challoner's High in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, which achieved an
FT score of 1.12 and a rank position of around 272nd; Jewish Free School in
Camden, London, a comprehensive which opted out this September, with an FT
score of 1.05 which placed it around 378th; Southend High School for Boys, a
grammar school with an FT score of 1.01, placing it around 430th; and The
Emmbrook School, a comprehensive in Wokingham, Berkshire, with an FT score
of 0.91, placing it around 598th.
Questionnaires were sent to the 1,100 top performing state schools according
to last year's government statistics.
State schools which did not co-operate with us would therefore not have
appeared although we hope that they will change their minds next year.
However, this meant that a few schools with sharply improved performance
were omitted. These included the Weald of Kent Grammar School, in Tonbridge,
which last year only managed 11 UCAS points per pupil. This year it scored
18, which would give an FT score of 1.08, placing it around 318th. The
questionnaire for Lady Margaret School, in Parson's Green, London, appears
to have gone astray and the school did not appear in the FT list but it
scored the highest GCSE pass rate for any state school in inner London.
On fees, the annual boarding cost for UK students at Carmel College in
Wallingford, Oxfordshire, is Pounds 12,450. The fee of Pounds 16,410 given
in our table is for foreign students.
A mistake in the other direction incorrectly put New College, Cardiff, at
the top of our 'value for money' table. In fact it should not even have
appeared in the top ten, and the best value school by our rough criteria was
St Gerards, Bangor.
No school featured in the survey has raised any query about the exam results
printed.

   THE ROLE of Britain in Europe
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
I bet that puts you off - could be changing. From enfant terrible to bete
noire, it may now be on its way to eminence grise. These thoughts were
inspired, if that is the word, by this week's annual conference of the
Confederation of British Industry and the reflections of the London
correspondent of Liberation, Julien Lefranc. 'Not European, the British? The
cliche has to be adjusted,' he wrote.
Now, the CBI has not usually been regarded as one of great engines of change
that drives British society and Lefranc took care not to let anybody think
it was. He just took, as a symbol of British reality, the marked preference
for a single currency in the European Union which was expressed by business
leaders in a CBI survey. Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, spoke of
wanting to avoid a situation 'where there was a single currency over there
and Ukrainian coupons here.' That, said Lefranc, was a demonstration of
pragmatism: the CBI recognised that it could export more if it operated in a
single currency area.
This was contrasted, not with the views of the government, but with those of
the City of London. For the City 'Black Wednesday,' when sterling had been
ejected from the ERM, 'had been regarded as a personal victory by many
London financiers and investors.' The event had saved a vast foreign
exchange market which brought them large profits. But in fact, the paper
concluded, these were marginal matters. The City was not really against
industry on matters European; it was firmly in the European camp, for the
Community provides a 'plus for Britain.'
So, rather disappointingly, the paper concluded, there was no real debate in
Britain about Europe. Any differences today are mere nuances. And Jacques
Delors should rejoice. So much for an article that started out with such
promise. But you can see why the situation in Britain might be regarded as
somewhat more placid than we had suspected.
So maybe the British are more European than they think. If one removes the
theatrical, even hysterical, element which plays such a large part in
domestic political debate, the basis of that debate is hardly different from
anything in France or Germany: the role of the nation in a wider union, the
problems of achieving a single currency and whether it can be done at all.
But there is still the Social Chapter, a classic example of the divide
between Britain and the rest, and of how things can get out of hand. The
British take this component of the Maastricht treaty at more than its face
value. But Article 1 consists of banalities about improved living and
working conditions, with a nod at their diverse meanings in different member
countries. Article 2 says the Council of Ministers can agree on what might
be done to further those aims. In Europe this is all symbols and
horse-trading, as well as a reflection of certain aspects of industrial
management that have proved quite successful.
But the British government, and in this it has the full support of
employers, refuses to have anything to do with any of this. The Social
Chapter is meaningful and it means higher costs. So no British minister of
civil servant will play any role in its development and implementation. But
the Labour Party supports it. One day maybe a Labour government may sign up
to the social chapter; by that time it will have taken on a character that
may be contrary to Britain's interests. Undoubtedly, whatever happens,
Britain will follow the iron rule that has guided all post-war policy
towards Europe: whatever the organisation, whatever the system, the British
must join at the wrong time.
However, there is just one curious difference in the present situation. When
it comes to discussing and voting on the implementation of the Social
Chapter, British members of the European Parliament will not be excluded.
They can therefore vote on matters from which British ministers are
excluded. This fact is only now starting to sink in Europe and has caused
alarm in Paris. It should not for, as it happens, Labour has, and presumably
will continue to have, a majority among MEPs and will vote with other
'socialists.' So the Social Chapter will benefit from the input of the
official opposition in Britain but not from that of the British government.
Now that is what makes the British different, not real Europeans. No other
government hands its opponents free gifts like that. When others press for a
ban on British Euro-MPs participating in votes on the Social Chapter, will
the British government show its Euro-credentials by taking the lead in that
campaign?
No, I was wrong, the British are not eminences grises, but wise fools,
idiots savants.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Country note: Woodland ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOODS are as much a part of Britain's history as village churches and
castles. But they are less respected, and often much more vulnerable.
Kenneth Watkins realised this from his early 20s as a farm boy in Somerset.
However it was not until 40 years later, as a wealthy retired agricultural
engineer, that he was able to put his lifetime's vision into practice by
forming The Woodland Trust.
Now aged 82, from his retirement home in a village on the edge of Dartmoor,
he still takes a regular walk in the nearby 100-acre Avon Valley Woods, the
trust's first acquisition, that he negotiated 21 years ago.
He is still chairman of the trust, which owns some 594 woods and manages
more than 20,000 acres of woodland, stretching from Uig on the Isle of Skye
to St Ives in Cornwall. It has a staff of 80 at its headquarters in
Grantham, Lincolnshire, and another 46 staff, including 30 woodland
officers, around the UK, and an annual income of Pounds 6m.
Next week, National Tree Week, November 25 to December 5, the trust is
celebrating its coming-of-age with a series of activities.
There are celebratory tree plantings, demonstrations, open days, guided
walks and woodland management courses, all aimed at reinforcing the prime
message of the trust - that woods, particularly those threatened by
clearance, large-scale conifer planting or neglect, need safeguarding.
A typical Woodland Trust wood is Lineover Wood, 100 acres of mixed ancient
woodland near Cheltenham. The trust purchased it from the Severn Trent Water
Authority in 1986 with the help of grants from The Countryside Commission,
the Nature Conservancy Council, Cheltenham council, the World Wildlife Fund,
trust members and local people.
Today it is presided over by 72-year-old retired nurseryman Ron Coates. Over
the past six years Coates has spent an estimated 10 hours a week acting as
voluntary warden.
With the help of his son, John, and volunteers he has been clearing scrub,
improving the access and encouraging the regeneration of natural species.
'I couldn't think of a more satisfying way of spending my old age,' said
Coates, who used to tramp the wood as a boy.
Woods owned by the trust are mainly used for leisure pursuits, such as
walking and riding. In addition there are the many people - the trust has
150,000 supporters that it contacts by post - who like nothing more than a
few hours enjoying woodland peace.
The trust has a 'Country Seats' programme in 13 of its woods which was
started in 1988 in response to an Pounds 80,000 legacy left by a
long-standing member.
It also has a woodland creation scheme, launched in Suffolk in 1991, and
expanded to include another five sites. Although the trust does not fell
wood specifically for sale, selling timber felled for management purposes
forms a significant proportion of the trust's income.
John James, director of the trust since 1980, says it is, on average,
acquiring woods at the rate of one a week. He believes that sympathetic land
ownership is the best way for the trust to offer the long-term protection
that woodlands need.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Five executive decisions: Minister for a Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHON PORRITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS environment secretary for a day, I make an early start, arriving by
bicycle at the hideously ugly Marsham Street Towers, central London, in
which the Department of the Environment is located.
Demolition would seem to be the only solution for such unloved carbuncles,
but I am not feeling sufficiently explosive so early in the day to order it
then and there.
I do however note the paucity of bicycle racks.
Five executive decisions before breakfast, essentially to knock off all the
things the Government has been promising to do, but has not quite managed:
to bring the long-awaited Environmental Protection Agency into being before
the end of the year; to reintroduce Peter Ainsworth's Hedgerow Protection
Bill into the Commons in the next session - this time as an official
Government Bill so that it cannot be talked out by those who see all such
regulation as an unwarranted extension of the powers of the State; to
implement the measures (already enacted by this Government in the 1990
Environmental Protection Act , but disastrously postponed in breach of EC
Directives) to regulate operators of landfill sites and toxic waste dumps
more rigorously; to triple the budget of the Energy Efficiency Office,
starved for so long of cash and influence that it has not even managed to
persuade Government departments to save any energy; to extend statutory
protection to all Sites of Special Scientific Interest, the so-called
'jewels in the crown of UK conservation', of which more than 500 have been
damaged over the last two years.
Over breakfast, I realise that I could go on all day effecting equally
useful bits and bobs of environmental legislation. But very few of them
would leave the UK any more prepared to confront the challenge of
sustainable development - embraced so enthusiastically at the Earth Summit
last year by John Major, the prime minister - than it is today. Ironically,
it turns out that the environment secretary has few direct powers to protect
the environment. Real power lies in the Treasury, the Department of Trade
and Industry, the Department of Transport and Ministry of Agriculture.
At which point I seize hold of the phone, ring the prime minist er's direct
line, and persuade him to extend my powers for a day to address
environmental issues within those departments.
First stop, the Department of Transport. The first decision is to axe most
of the Pounds 24bn road building programme which until now has been
mysteriously immune to cost-cutting pressures from Clarke and Portillo.
(Anticipate considerable brownie points from these two gentlemen, which
could come in very handy later.) Retain only those by-pass schemes which
have the overwhelming support of the towns and villages involved.
Then I would do everyone a favour, including John MacGregor, the transport
minister, by binning his fatuous plans for privatising British Rail, and
redirecting around 50 per cent of the money saved on the road programme to
new investment in rolling stock and electrification projects.
Simultaneously, I would authorise local authorities to introduce road
pricing schemes on roads for which they are responsible, on condition that
the proceeds are earmarked specifically for investment in new light rail or
tram systems, in further traffic-calming measures (which have already proved
popular), and in measures to promote cycling. (You may think I am a bit
obsessed by bikes, but don't you realise there are 5m riders?)
From there to the Department of Trade and Industry with a modest brief to
shame them into implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Committee
on Business and the Environment - a committee made up of leading business
representatives which the DTI itself established but has since
systematically ignored. Even the business community is fed up with this
Government's prevarication in adopting the business case for sustainable
development, let alone the ecological case.
Then to the Ministry of Agriculture to set aside the infamous Set Aside
scheme, by designating the whole of the UK as an Environmentally Sensitive
Area.
Last stop on my magical bicycle tour: the Treasury. Just two little reforms
here: a complete revamp in the way we present the national accounts,
relegating gross national product so that it becomes just one of the
indicators of wealth used in a new index of sustainable welfare. There is
nothing wrong with economic growth of the right kind, but the pursuit of
growth at all costs as an end in itself is absolutely incompatible with
achieving sustainable development.
Finally, end the day with a big bang by committing the Government to phasing
out income tax entirely by 2000, and to recoup the missing Pounds 56bn
through new taxes on energy, raw materials and waste. That should get the
jobs market moving. Back home for a large and well-deserved malt whisky, one
of the most environmentally-friendly products known to man.

environment.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Why the FT knows its school tables - John Authers compares
the FT's league list with the government's survey - and finds some
interesting differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are a parent, you are probably suffering from statistical overload.
Barely a fortnight after the FT-1,000 survey, which identified the top
performing schools at A-level, the Department of Education this week weighed
in with an even more ambitious exercise - figures for every secondary school
in the country on GCSE, A-level, and vocational qualification pass rates,
along with a much criticised truancy league table.
Which survey is better?
The short answer is that the Government's survey is better at identifying
'problem schools'. Our survey is better at giving an accurate guide to the A
level performance of the top 1,000 schools. The response to our survey this
year was excellent, but, unlike the Government's, it cannot claim to be
comprehensive. The Government figures show that a small number of schools
which declined to take part in our survey could have made it into our top
1,000 list.
The main difference between the two surveys is that at A level, our data is
more detailed and the scoring system subtler. Our score gives equal weight
to the quality and quantity of A level achievements for a group of pupils,
whereas the Government focusses more narrowly on the quantity of A level
results achieved this year.
For this reason a league table based only on the government figures would
produce some absurd results. For example, Winchester College, Manchester
Grammar, and St Paul's Girls', come only 45th, 46th and 47th respectively on
the government's score, but much higher on ours. This is because at the best
schools, some pupils take one or more A levels a year early, and many of
them do not bother with General Studies at A level, a subject excluded from
our survey. However Government figures shed some interesting light on top
schools.
What evidence is there, for example, that GCSE performance is replicated at
A-level? No fewer than 46 schools with sixth forms managed to shepherd all
their 15-year-olds to five or more passes at a grade equivalent to the
old-fashioned O-level. Of these, the total variation in A-level points
(where an A equals 10 and an E equals 2) was from 37.4 by King Edward's
Birmingham, to 13.5 by the Atherley School in Southampton. The GCSE table
ranks the 25 top-performing GCSE schools according to their A level scores.
While the FT showed 23 state schools in the top 200 (up from three in 1992),
the government showed 48 in the top 200.
The government split all A-level candidates into those taking two or more
and those taking fewer than two. This will allow easier comparison with
tertiary and further education colleges. As many of these colleges
concentrate on vocational education, with students possibly only attempting
one A-level, comparison might otherwise be unfair. However, the division is
unhelpful when comparing schools devoted to academic qualifications.
A less important point is that the government included general studies in
its calculations, while the FT omitted it in the light of widespread
questioning of the qualification by academics and university admissions
tutors. However, its inclusion by the government allowed King Edward's and
King Edward VI High in Birmingham to shine with average A-level point scores
of 37.4 and 33.4 - both suggesting an average achievement better than three
grade As. Both schools excelled in the FT survey, but the government appears
to overstate their superiority.
Two other comments provoked by the FT's survey are important. One is that
some schools are claimed to try to improve their scores by rejecting
16-year-olds who will not do well. This is not likely to be popular with
parents in the private sector and state schools would find it difficult to
reject aspiring sixth formers with adequate qualifications.
Even so, it is interesting that Cherwell, the nation's third best
comprehensive at A level according to FT data, serving a plum academic
catchment area in north Oxford, recorded a distinctly mediocre performance
at GCSE. Only 58 per cent of its 15-year-olds passed five GCSEs at grades
from A to C. Some 193 comprehensive schools across the country managed to do
better.
Parents whose children might have difficulty getting as far as A level will
therefore want to look at more than just A level figures. Cherwell's figures
suggest that schools which get the most out of children above the age of 16
may not be so adept at nursing them through GCSE.
Allegations of deliberate 'pruning' of pupils by schools at 16 have led the
Conference for Independent Further Education, which includes mainly
'crammer' schools specialising in A-levels, to ensure that all their A-level
results are audited by external consultants.
There is also the question of size. The bigger a school, the harder it will
be to maintain a strong average across all pupils, unless it is highly
selective. However, parents of gifted children may prefer schools with a
large sixth form because of the likelihood that it will include a sizeable
nucleus of other similarly able pupils.
Therefore, it seems fair to say that schools with particularly large numbers
of A-level candidates deserve more credit than their bare statistical
averages suggest. Some very large schools, including Eton, Manchester
Grammar, and Haberdashers' Askes's, featured at the top of the table. Others
which might have been overlooked somewhat unfairly include Dulwich (69th,
with 186 entrants), Sevenoaks (89th with 215), Wellington (96th, with 178),
Marlborough (144th with 202) and Millfield (186th with 234 candidates).
Finally, the FT's method of calculation was more complex than the
government's. Each school's rank and position were produced by using the
UCAS points per pupil (PPP), measuring the quantity of grades obtained, and
the average number of UCAS points per subject entry (PPE), which measured
the quality of grades.
A school in which every pupil scored exactly three A grades would have an
average PPP of 30 and a PPE of 10. To give each figure approximately equal
weight, the PPE was multiplied by three before being added to the PPP. Our
final figures provided an index from which the rank positions were awarded.
We scaled this score for convenience so that the average for all the schools
in our sample was 1.0. A school with a score of 1.2, was thus 20 per cent
better than average.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Sport: A lament for the muddy bath - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST man I saw playing rugby union in an old-fashioned scrumcap was my
eldest brother, who has a very large head. He looked more than usually
ridiculous in it, with his hair standing out in wild tufts between the
straps and pads. But there was another, more serious, handicap. The
contraption blotted out all sound, including the referee's whistle.
He wore it for a single game. On two of three occasions he rampaged
downfield, ball in hand, glory beckoning. Each time the unaccustomed
exhilaration of having outstripped the defence eventually gave way to
suspicion at the absence of pursuit. He stopped and turned, to find us all
scoffing at a distance; then trudged back to take his place at the scrum
which the referee had summoned.
A version of the old-style scrumcap does still have its adherents,
particularly in rugby league. Gary Schofield has worn one in the test
matches against New Zealand, a helmet which recalls John Wayne as Genghis
Khan, galloping across the wastes of Mongolia.
But in the union game it has been chucked on to the scrapheap, to join
knee-length shorts, banana-shaped boots, and those fat, rain-heavy balls
which, on raw November afternoons, descended from grey skies like mortar
shells. Elasticated strapping has become the vogue method of protecting
ears. This comes either wide and thick, making the wearer look as if he had
suffered a shrapnel wound; or thin and mean, as sported by Brian Moore (who
is mean, but not thin).
The decline and fall of the scrumcap has been mirrored by that of the other
icon of rugby, the cauliflower ear. Once, this was the indispensable
trademark mark of those warriors of the front and second rows. The shapeless
mess of pulverised gristle and cartilage on the side of the head was a badge
of honour, a silent legacy of hard times, - murky misdeeds, sacrifices
gladly made.
Actually, of course, this is sentimental nonsense. No one in his right mind
would wish to go through life with ears resembling lumps of uncooked sausage
meat. It would be absurd to object to the use of elasticated strapping if it
prevents such disfigurement; nor, even, to the spectacle - recently seen on
television - of Wade Dooley having his cauliflower ear feasted on by a leech
in an effort to get rid of the swelling.
Nor, if I am honest, can I become emotional about that time-honoured
accessory, the jockstrap. For years the powers that be have been urging the
abandonment of this article of dress, on the grounds that it is a seedbed
for the infectious and revolting herpes known as scrum-pox. The Rugby
Football Union want it replaced by swimming trunks; and it would be mere
fogeyishness to argue otherwise.
But the communal bath is another matter. It lies at heart of the culture of
rugby union. True, the spectacle of a score and more of hairy, fleshy,
battle-scarred bodies floundering in a huge tub of muddy water can be
something of an affront to those of a sensitive disposition, particularly if
the air is booming with the vile obscenity of the usual rugby chorus.
On the other hand, a shower cannot provide the balm to raw abrasions,
stretched muscles and twisted joints that comes with total immersion. The
authorities frown, muttering about disease and uncleanliness. But are there
not infections lurking in the cracks between the tiles beneath the showers?
To be indelicate, have they not heard of verrucas and allied horrors? So,
let the taps gush and the steam rise and the bodies intermingle. Leave the
harmless institution of the post-match plunge alone.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Motoring: The big cat that got away - Stuart Marshall tries
out the futuristic Lexus and is impressed / Test drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEXUS GS300 is the kind of car Jaguar must produce one day. It is sporty
yet urbane, dignified but not stuffy. The soft leather and wood veneered
interior is good taste personified. Something like it could, in fact, have
been a Jaguar. At Geneva motor show in March 1990, the Italian stylist
Giorgietto Giugiaro exhibited a concept car called Kensington. This curvy
four-door saloon had a Jaguar V12's mechanicals. Jaguar looked it over
carefully but reckoned it was not quite the kind of thing their customers
should have.
Toyota - Lexus is its up-market brand - also studied Kensington and was
rather more impressed, deciding to make it the basis of its classy Aristo
three-litre luxury saloon. Essentially the same car has just reached Britain
as the Lexus GS300.
It looks quite a bit smaller than the original Lexus LS400, the sepulchrally
silent V8 that has seduced some Britons - and a great many Americans - out
of their BMW 7-Series and Mercedes S-Class saloons.
But appearances deceive. The Lexus GS300 is only a couple of inches shorter
than an LS400, bigger than a Mercedes E-Class or BMW 5-Series and almost
identical in size to a Jaguar XJ-6.
Its three-litre, 209 horsepower straight six is the same engine that powers
the new Toyota Supra but without the twin turbochargers.
Like the high-class European cars it has been aimed at, GS300 has rear-wheel
drive and standard automatic transmission.
Unlike most of them, it comes with absolutely everything a business motorist
could wish for. The Pounds 31,950 price includes air conditioning, power
adjusted and heated front seats, cruise control, leather trim, driver and
passenger airbags, autochange CD player and a powered tilt-and-telescope
steering wheel. Ignition key out, the wheel raises itself and move forward
to make getting in and out easier. Put the key in and the wheel resumes its
pre-set position.
It goes beautifully. The suspension is just a little firmer than that of the
Lexus LS400 and you are more aware of the kind of surface the 55-series
Bridgestone tyres are rolling on. At British motorway speeds wind noise is
negligible. You hear the engine only when accelerating hard enough for the
transmission to hold second to over 50 mph (80 kph) and third to well over
70 mph (112 kph).
I see the G300 more as an alternative to a BMW 530 than a Mercedes-Benz
E-Class or a Jaguar XJ-6. It is a difficult point to put into words but it
lacks the gravitas that appeals to Mercedes and Jaguar (and for that matter,
Bentley) buyers. For younger people this is, of course, a plus.
For the size of car, rear-seat space is adequate rather than generous; the
boot is wide and deep enough to swallow easily two golf bags in their
trolleys; and the GS300 has the best headlights I have ever driven behind.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Sport: A millionaire's dented ego - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS comes a little early in the world of professional tennis. This
week the eight men competing in the IBM / ATP Tour Championship in Frankfurt
will divide between them Dollars 2.75m. In three weeks' time five of the men
from Frankfurt will be joined by another 11 in Munich to contest the Dollars
6m Compaq Grand Slam Cup, with its record first prize of Dollars 1.5m. I
think Santa Claus can safely afford to strike 19 names from his list of
calls this year.
The ridiculous thing is that the players themselves will not be thinking
about the money. They do not need to; the wolf has long ago given up calling
at their addresses.
What does matter to these battle-scarred competitors is self-fulfilment. In
a highly charged individual sport where egos are dented with each defeat,
success is everything. Yet, inevitably there will be losses. Coping with
this mental pressure is one of the most difficult lessons a professional
sportsman has to learn. The people who have exploited this simple but
fundamental fact are the sports psychologists.
Ever since Timothy Gallwey's Inner Tennis appeared in 1975 the gurus have
proliferated. All they have done is to dress up in new clothing the
techniques used over the years by successful coaches like Australia's Harry
Hopman and Maureen Connolly's adviser 'Teach' Tennant. These people, and
others who have followed like Nick Bollettieri and Bob Brett, have been
great motivators.
There has been interesting evidence in Frankfurt this week of the negative
and positive aspects of this process. Take Pete Sampras and Jim Courier, for
instance. Boyhood pals when they had attended the Bollettieri Academy in
Florida, Jim and Pete won their first important title together in Rome in
1989. I remember Pete's excitement in the locker room afterwards when he was
struggling with the local telephone system while trying to relay the good
news to his parents that he and Jim had just become the Italian Open doubles
champions. There was little thought then that the friends would become such
rivals.
In February last year Jim rose to the top of the world rankings, a position
from which he was displaced by Pete last April. Inevitably their
relationship was under strain. 'We're not as close as when I first turned
pro (1988). We don't really talk but we're still good friends,' Sampras had
said at the time.
Then Courier lost his French title to Sergi Bruguera in a final he should
have won. His ego was clearly dented. It was a mark of the skill of his
coaches, Jose Higueras and Brad Stine, that Courier was able to bounce back
from that disappointment to reach the Wimbledon final against Sampras.
No-one had expected him to go as far. But, well as he played (and if he had
taken the fourth set against a tiring opponent I believe he might have won),
Jim still lost once more to his rival. Another dent for the ego.
At the US Open top seeded Courier, who had briefly regained the No 1
ranking, crashed to the Frenchman, Cedric Pioline in the fourth round. The
ego buckled further. Sampras inflicted more damage by winning the tournament
to re-establish himself atop the computer list.
Before Frankfurt began Sampras had made certain of ending the year as the No
1, a fact that must have contributed to some very odd behaviour from Courier
this week. Once he had lost his opening match to Michael Chang - a 6-4 6-0
drubbing that suggested a fatalistic approach to the week's events - Courier
must have known he would not reach the final as he had done last year. Yet
afterwards he had bravely claimed 'I can still win it. Remember I lost one
of my round-robin matches last year.'
Behind the scenes Higueras was working overtime. By Wednesday he had
persuaded Jim that he was going to beat Andrei Medvedev and then tame
Michael Stich yesterday to reach this afternoon's semi-finals. The first
part of the plan almost worked. In spite of seeming more interested in
reading a novel at the changes of ends instead of thinking about his
tactics, Jim actually served for the match against the Ukrainian and held
four match points before losing 6-3 1-6 7-6.
His comments afterwards revealed an attempt to protect the ego from further
damage by pulling the blinkers firmly over his mind's eye. 'My concentration
has never been better. I have never been more focused. ' he claimed. 'But
why were you reading Maybe The Moon,' he was asked. 'It's an interesting
book. I just felt like reading it.' he said.
It cannot be easy for the official World Champion to accept that he is no
longer the best player in the world. Ivan Lendl has found it difficult to
admit that his career among the top players is over. The same realisation
has been painful for Boris Becker. The brilliant winner here last year,
Boris failed to earn a place this time. Like another former No 1, Stefan
Edberg, whose form also seems to be slipping, he must now face other
priorities - marriage and parenthood.
Sampras understood. 'It's been a pretty frustrating year for Jim. When you
come so close to winning two Grand Slams . . . and I can relate to that
after losing to Edberg in '91 (in the US Open final) . . . it can be
frustrating. He's just burnt out, he needs some time off, get his batteries
charged up for Australia. He'll be fine. I mean he's got a good head on his
shoulders' he said.
This from a man who admitted that his loss to Courier at the 1991 US Open
had: 'got the monkey off my back' following a year of mental anguish in the
wake of becoming the youngest ever US champion in 1990. Yes, the mature
22-year-old, battle-hardened in the cauldron of competition and well advised
by his coach of two years, Tim Gullikson, knew exactly how his friend felt.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Property (The Deep South): Georgia on my mind - The delights
of small-town America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCKILY, Sherman did not destroy all Georgia on his march. Washington,
Madison and Newnan are attractive small towns that survived, where some
antebellum (pre-civil war) houses have also escaped 20th century
development.
Madison is small-town America at its best. A prosperous staging post on the
old route from Charleston to New Orleans, it was the centre of plantations
for 60 miles around. Long, hooting goods trains still carry Georgia pines
through town, and the drugstore has kept its soda fountain. Main Street
looks smart, perhaps helped by the Georgia Main Street Project (a civic
trust type of scheme). There is a lively cultural centre and a Japanese
plant makes compact discs.
But the Japanese live out of town by themselves. It is their loss as Madison
has splendid houses. For example, 411 Academy Street, built in 1848, is a
classic late Georgian house, with the customary twin parlours (for men or
women), and high ceilings for summer heat. It does not have central air
conditioning, but an old-style attic fan cools the house in minutes. Its
two-acre lot is itching for a serious gardener. The price from Baldwin
Realty is Dollars 498,500. Property tax is far cheaper than in Atlanta an
hour away.
Two blocks away, 498 South Main Street is a treasure house of expensive
Victorian architecture, 'the most elegant country home in middle Georgia',
according to The Madisonian in 1883, with joinery rich in contrasting woods
 -black walnut and maple floors, walnut sliding doors, and walnut and ash
mouldings. Italian craftsmen stencilled the ceilings.
The house, lovingly restored, comes with 10 acres for Dollars 2.25m, from
Jenny Pruitt. The Victorian Society should charter an aircraft at once to
visit, continuing to Newnan (25 minutes from Atlanta airport) where Fisher
Realty offers another Victorian extravaganza. 155 Greenville Street of 1886
is painted in colour combinations we know on the Victorian bridges over the
Thames. The price is Dollars 795,000.
A classic antebellum Greek Revival house with a columned balcony and porch
is 52 College Street, with 12 ft high ceilings downstairs and 10 ft
upstairs. Although it became apartments during the Depression, it is now in
excellent condition. Pressure-washing twice a year, to remove mildew and
dirt from the white outside paint, has meant no painting for seven years.
Harry Norman asks Dollars 475,000.
Macon, south of Atlanta, is a small city once more important than Atlanta. A
Victorian house re-done (superbly) in 1911 by Neel Reid as a Parisian villa
is 397 College Street. In the College Hill historic district, it costs
Dollars 525,000 from Sheridan Solomon Kernaghan. The agent also offers an
imposing Greek Revival house (1837) with its columned porch rising from a
stepped podium. 1231 Jefferson Terrace costs Dollars 385,000. A Victorian
gem, this time unusually in brick with stone banding, is 1144 Georgia
Avenue, for Dollars 10,000 more from Murphey Taylor &amp; Ellis.
The quail-shooting season is starting on the plantations at Thomasville in
south Georgia. Some owners buy quail to release them, but it is generally
rough sport. 'I don't like contrived shooting', said plantation-owner
Russell Chubb, of realtor Chubb Associates.
The town found fame when rich northerners came for the winter (before the
railways were extended into Florida), as the air was good for their health,
and soon were building their own grand plantation houses. Mrs Parker Poe,
known as Miss Pansy, lived at Pebble Hill (now a museum) until recently with
an estate staff of 75 to 100 in an ordered style that only royalty emulates.
Devoted to pursuit of the fox and any other outdoor activity, even alligator
hunting, she stuffed the house with fox and horse icons. The best is a
picture of Eclipse by Sartorius.
It is hard to buy a plantation at Thomasville as the families keep them as
sporting estates and for their timber business. But Melrose is for sale with
 -sadly or fortunately - only 30 acres as the family retained the land and
built themselves new houses. There is no lack of outbuildings, however. The
brick stable block would grace the blue grass country in Kentucky.
Showboat, the estate theatre, where reputedly Gone with the Wind was shown
for the first time, is included in the sale. Looking like a showboat tied to
the river bank, it was built of swamp cypress wood in 1928. On Friday nights
the gentry came for movies, on Saturdays, the staff. Chubb is selling
Melrose for Dollars 1.5m. The outbuildings could easily be let.
In town Chubb offers 920 Blackshear Street, a 1933 winter residence enlarged
in 1977. In tip-top condition, it has the best swimming pool and pool
house/guest house that I saw in Georgia - and garaging for six cars. Good
for entertaining or as a retreat, it costs Dollars 970,000.
At the other end of Georgia across the border into North Carolina is
Highlands in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a hill station with pines, rocks and
tin roofs where people came from Atlanta, New Orleans and Charleston in the
summer. Now it has a year-round population and a famous golf course at the
country club. By a lake next to the 18th hole is Brigadoon (Harry Norman,
Dollars 2.85m).

FT  20 NOV 93 / Property (The Deep South): Jacuzzis at their best - Gerald
Cadogan finds grand houses for grand men in Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUY A HOUSE in Atlanta, USA, and you can let it in 1996 when the Olympic
Games come to town. Splendid houses are for sale in the city, those in the
northern suburbs grand enough to excuse any chairman for moving his home and
his corporate headquarters to the thriving capital and air hub of the
south-eastern US.
Georgia began in 1733 when General Oglethorpe landed at Savannah, a place
where debtors were sent. The youngest and largest of the 13 states of the
original union, it was reluctant to secede from the Crown and in the civil
war looked for an alliance with Britain - an outlook mirrored in the
dominance of British styles in its grand houses.
In 1837 a town called Terminus was founded, becoming Marthasville in 1843
and Atlanta in 1845. Its position in the foothills at the south end of the
Appalachians made it the rail hub of the south east. General Sherman
destroyed this city in 1866 on his horrendous march 'from Atlanta to the
sea'.
When he stopped shelling, less than a tenth of the houses were intact. The
march to Savannah left a swathe of destruction 50 to 60 miles wide. His
attempt to annihilate the economy affected life in Georgia for years, and
southern memories for ever. But a pharmacist's cordial that became Coca-Cola
set Atlanta on the road to recovery.
By the 1920s, the money it brought the city was being spent on stately
homes, mostly English-style, in the area north of the city centre where the
battle of Peachtree Creek took place in the civil war. Today what is good
for Coke is still good for Atlanta.
Three clever architects led the mansion building between the wars, so
successfully that there are bus tours round these suburban palaces. Philip
Shutze (rhyming with gutsy), Neel Reid and Lewis Crook produced intelligent,
sharply detailed Tudor, Queen Anne or Georgian - and some French or
Italian-style - buildings with allusions to grand houses in Europe. They had
a good eye for siting. North Atlanta houses are in small wooded valleys with
creeks at the bottom, set well back from the road for privacy and security.
The large gardens are ablaze with azaleas and dogwood in the spring and in
autumn the 'man-made' woodland merges into the old natural forest so well
that you do not notice where one ends and the other begins.
It is suburbia, but at its best. Large, free-standing houses so close to
each other surprise Europeans who would expect each to be in its own park,
but their elegance and the beauty of the woods soon captivate. The property
market in Atlanta has been through a similar cycle to that in the UK. Prices
are well down from their 1987-88 peaks, realtor (estate agent) Harry Norman
said, as he has had to explain to vendors who would like their houses priced
at levels of five years ago. Unsurprisingly, some asking prices have been
cut. Where Atlanta differs from the UK is that, with the greater mobility of
the US workforce, there are plenty of good houses on the market.
Many have super-expensive kitchens with free-standing 'island' counters and,
attached to the master bedroom, jacuzzis - I have never seen so many before
 -mirrored dressing rooms and large clothes cupboards that are complete
rooms. Nowadays, an agent remarked, the money that in the past went on the
reception rooms is spent on these private rooms.
The chairman moving his corporate headquarters might like to buy an early
1920s Neel Reid house, 2 Vernon Road on offer from Harry Norman at Dollars
2.495m. It has splendid public rooms, a porch modelled on Gunston Hall, in
Virginia, a stepped garden leading to a creek, and swimming pool next to the
house.
To spend more, he could look at 65 Valley Road, a Tudor house in immaculate
condition on a very large lot (9.5 acres), with its swimming pool so deep in
the woods that you would never know you were in the middle of a great city.
Built for the third president of Coca-Cola, it is now the home of Edward and
Suzanne Elson, who must sell as President Bill Clinton has nominated him
ambassador to Denmark.
With a great hall, wood panelling, and painted vaulted ceilings, and
surrounded by azaleas, boxwood, dogwood and rhododendrons, the asking price
is Dollars 6.75m from Jenny Pruitt. Property tax in 1992 was Dollars 21,042.
It is hard to see how the ambassador's residence in Copenhagen can match it.
Cheaper, and with the comforting feel of not having been revamped - house
and fittings are 1930s - is 231 Peachtree Battle, for Dollars 1.25m from
Jenny Pruitt. Its pool is also next to the house. The garden is a treat,
planned as a series of rooms like Hidcote, in Gloucestershire, England,
(which of course an American, Lawrence Johnston, made) and with interesting
plants and a superb water garden around the creek at the bottom.
In 3645 Nancy Creek Road the white wood floored kitchen with reinforced
steel joists supporting the roof is like an exhibition pavilion. The pool
below is the other highlight. Also this house is a good example of extruded
mortar between the bricks, giving a rusticated texture that was news to me,
but is customary in Georgia. The price is Dollars 1.9m, and the agent Jenny
Pruitt. At the most expensive house 3640 Tuxedo Road (Dollars 9.5m from
Harry Norman) the old water garden, now overgrown, awaits resurrection. This
was once the house of Robert Woodruff, chairman of Coca Cola, sumptuous then
and made more sumptuous by the present owners. Five grand houses for five
chairmen or chief executive officers. If they buy next weekend, over the
Thanksgiving holiday, they will be in time to enjoy the Superbowl in Atlanta
in January.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Gardening: Bothered by badgers? Here's a hint - Robin Lane
Fox welcomes a new book of green-fingered tips from top people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KEEN GARDENERS are nature's insider dealers: they are extremely keen on tips
and will act on private information so long as it is not in the public
handbooks. Whenever I have given a lecture on gardening, the audience has
been most intrigued by the advice which questioners give one another without
any help from me. They know how to turn squirrels into a stew; they know why
liquid fertiliser is improved by adding soapy detergent; they usually kill
their dandelions by filling them up with salt.
I often wonder where these great reservoirs of information have been stored
up and how they circulate. We now have the ultimate book for insider
gardening: Superhints, compiled by Lady Wardington and published by Michael
Joseph at Pounds 8.99. It is the sequel to her best-selling book on
Superhints for Householders and as before, all royalties will go to charity.
Superhints for Gardeners (from the great and green-fingered) deserves a wide
public, although I admit to having contributed a re-cycled tip myself.
Some of the Superhints will satisfy your curiosity. You can discover how
Princess Michael of Kent copes with annoying wasps, or what Michael
Heseltine really thinks about the possibilities of a recovery from
near-death. I will treasure some of the practical wisdom. It ranges from a
buyer who will pay for the clippings from yew hedges and use them in cancer
research to a remedy from the experienced Paul Miles which is said to 'deal
with' honey fungus. He tells us to apply one pint of creosote, stirred (but
not shaken) in two gallons of water. This mixture should be sprayed on to
the ground, not the leaves of affected plants: that will stop the fungus
although it will also brown the grass for a while. Paul Miles ought to know
and his chief advice answers one of the most frequent queries in the FT
postbag.
It is amazing what famous people will work out for themselves. Prue Leith
takes time off from cooking to cut the legs of old tights into strips with
which she ties up her roses: they are 'much gentler than wire and cheaper
than rose ties.' I am not sure that I agree with the BBC presenter who tells
us that 'large lemonade bottles full of water' will discourage visiting cats
if put in their favourite places. But I do agree with the contributor who
tells us to 'hoe when you do not need to hoe, and then you never need to
hoe.' The most efficient weeding is carried out on apparently bare soil.
Why are tips so irresistible? Sometimes we feel smug because we all know
them anyway: Rabbi Lionel Blue feels that he has to tell us to grow basil
because it is good in sauce for spaghetti.
Sometimes, superhints are seductive because they are wonderfully cheap. I
can see the logic in making plant-supports out of old metal coat-hangers
twisted into squares and hooked on to a cane. Sometimes, one superhinter
trumps another. One tells us to spend winter evenings on the job of making
tubes out of newspaper in order to sow the seeds of sweet peas inside them
and allow the roots to spread without damage. Another has an easier tip: use
up the lavatory roll and then take out the central core and sow the seeds
inside it. You can then transplant the seedlings into the garden without
damaging the tap-roots. Seeds for the loo roll include parsley. It should be
sown on Good Friday, according to one tipper, and the seed should be mixed
into a cup of hot water, according to a head gardener, in order to soften
it.
Above all, it is fun to find how much is still unknown to dictionaries and
authors from the Royal Horticultural Society. When I try to grow eremurus,
the tall Foxtail Lily, I often find that the centre of the plant rots away
in wet weather. Gardening books have no suggestion, but Lady Salisbury tells
us to put an old tile under the crown of the plant and to spread the roots
outwards on either side to stop the damp settling under the centre. She has
also planted more yew hedging than most of us do in a lifetime; she rightly
tells us to ignore contrary advice and never to cut the top of a yew hedge
until it has reached the height which we want. It is quite untrue that that
this treatment will cause it to go bad at the bottom.
You see the range of hints on offer. How sweet it is, said Lucretius, the
Latin poet, to watch the troubles of others on the high seas from the safety
of the shore: it is sweeter, in our caring society, to read experts' long
rigmaroles about the treatment of toadstools in lawns when the answer is
simply to dose them with Epsom Salts.
It is even sweeter to discover how other people deal with uninvited animals.
Forget those Green platitudes about 'nature's fellow-citizens': keen
gardeners see off moles by putting mothballs or musical birthday cards down
the mole-run: (they are said to be deterred by the repeated tune of 'Happy
Birthday'). My brother, I discover, puts holly-leaves round pea-seeds to
deter mice which try to dig them up. I never knew that he was so prickly and
now wonder what he puts down against a brother who sometimes tries to dig up
bits of his better plants after a tour of his large garden.
The ultimate tip? It comes from Annabel Allhusen, a garden designer. I have
had a lady badger in my garden all year, but if she becomes troublesome, I
now discover that I should invite as many men as possible to a dinner party,
fill them up with wine and turn them put into the garden so that they will
'mark territory' around boundaries where badgers enter. Some of you might
prefer a superhint to deal with male guests who relieve themselves on your
lawn in the twilight. Not so Miss Allhusen: 'After heavy rain, you have a
lovely excuse for another party.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Travel: Searching for Swiss powder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LEAN OUT, lean out] Don't do anything I didn't tell you to do,' came the
guide's angry call.
I was just beginning to sidestep gingerly across the top of a steep couloir
lined with rocks. The guide's instructions were to lean outwards so the
edges of the skis would dig better into the hard crust. But the consequences
of leaning out too far made me prefer to lean in.
The danger was over in a few seconds, but it was one of three or four
moments during a week of powder skiing in the Swiss Alps that still make my
palms perspire.
John Hogg, a Canadian guide who has operated in Switzerland for the past 12
years, prides himself on being able to find untracked powder snow in the
Alps for his clients, regardless of the conditions.
And, last winter, when I joined his group for six days in the Klosters-Davos
region, there had not been any significant new snow for more than a month.
The result was that he had to lead us into increasingly inaccessible places,
such as the couloir mentioned above. Once we had cleared that we came upon a
long, broad pitch of untouched deep snow, only a couple of hundred metres
from the top of Davos's always crowded Weissfluh.
On other days, we would put skins on our skis and trek for an hour or more
from the top of a lift to get to faces - almost always on the north sides of
mountains - where there was a chance that the snow would still be skiable.
It was, without doubt, the most strenuous holiday I have ever taken, and not
just because of the climbing at high altitudes. With the lack of snow and
the warm weather, our skiing always ended up in nasty conditions at the
bottom - breakable crust, slush and then just rocks and mud, forcing us into
long walks.
But in addition to the occasional moments of fright and the frequent
fatigue, there were wonderful moments. I remember sitting down for a packed
lunch in a mountain surrounded valley on a cloudless day, only a mile or so
from Klosters but alone.
There was satisfaction even in the simple achievement of the steady rhythm
maintained by trekking up a slope on skins, or in making a couple of
relatively competent parallel turns in heavy, deep snow.
Is this sort of holiday for you? It is certainly not for everyone. Two in
our group of eight decided on a couple of mornings that they would rather
rest, and Hogg says dropouts are not uncommon.
The main prerequisite, surprisingly enough, is not a high level of skiing
skill, although familiarity with the technique of sidestepping across steep
couloirs helps. One of our number, a Swiss, was a modest snow-plougher. Nor
does age matter. The best performer in our group was 60.
The real key is fitness. In his English language brochure, John warns
potential clients that they should be able to run five miles in 45 minutes
three times a week. 'I do not have to put it in the German language
brochure. The Swiss and the Germans understand,' he says.
As for the level of danger, John has an impeccable record as a guide. He is
a stickler for safety, forcing everyone to wear an avalanche beeper, carry a
shovel and, since last season, wear the new ABS inflatable air bag that is
intended to prevent the user from being buried in an avalanche.
'I accept that there are risks, but I try to cut them to a minimum,' he
says. 'When I come across a difficult place, I always ask myself what is the
worst that can happen.'
John's view is that this type of skiing is ideally suited to the Alps. The
lift network there is dense enough that you never have to trek too far, and
there is always a pleasant inn at the end of the run and a taxi, bus or
train to take you back to base.
The less strenuous alternative of heli-skiing has become too expensive and,
in an increasing number of areas, has been prohibited.
But the strain of it all, especially with the paucity of snow in the past
few seasons, has taken its toll even on him. He and a Swiss guide are
planning to move to British Columbia next year to set up a heli-skiing
business.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Travel: A little Big Mountain - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT IS not easy to find the town of Whitefish on a map of the US
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
it is up near the top left-hand corner, tucked between the borders of
Montana, Idaho and the Canadian province of Alberta.
Modern travel being what it is, however, you can fly from New York to
Whitefish in just a few hours, via Salt Lake City to Kalispell airport. A
few miles away is Whitefish, a small place (population: 4,500), with no big
hotels, a few shops and a handful of bars. The nightlife is limited, but
pursued with enthusiasm, particularly at the 'World Famous Kick-Ass' Palace
Bar, home to local heavy metal bands and midnight mouse racing.
Although you might not notice it at first, Whitefish is also a ski town  -
which is why I was there. About 20 minutes' drive from downtown Whitefish is
the ski resort of Big Mountain. Like Whitefish, Big Mountain is a
determinedly unglamorous place. A cluster of small, functional buildings
sits at the base of uncrowded pistes. Below, an unobtrusive collection of
houses and lodges is hidden within the treeline. There is not a Marriott or
a Ritz-Carlton in sight and the car park is packed with pickups and
beaten-up saloons.
Again, like the town and the resort centre, the mountain itself does not
look much at first - but first appearances can deceive. Big Mountain boasts
a 2,400ft vertical drop, 56 trails and six main chairlifts - an
average-sized resort by North American standards. Yet, off the marked trails
it has hundreds of acres of skiing among fir trees (many bent into bizarre
shapes by the weight of the frost, creating the region's trademark 'snow
ghosts'), along gullies, through glades, down chutes, and into the basins of
small bowls.
The front face of the mountain offers a variety of comfortable green and
blue runs and the occasional challenging black. Each day I started with an
intermediate trail called Inspiration, a fast descent down the mountain that
takes in views of Whitefish lake and the agricultural lands of the Flathead
valley. Later in the week, those views were obscured by clouds which lap at
the feet of the mountains like waves in a thick cotton sea. Clouds are
common on Big Mountain, but then so is snow.
Although there was no powder the week I was there, the north face of the
mountain, where the slopes escape the freeze-thaw cycle, offered a fresh
supply of light powdery snow that keeps its condition throughout each day.
Here, steeply pitched mogul runs, like the intimidating Bighorn, challenge
both technique and courage.
What Big Mountain may lack in size, it more than makes up for in extras,
such as Snowcat skiing - for Dollars 35 (Pounds 23.40) a snow tractor will
take you into the back country in search of powder - and night skiing. The
latter is especially thrilling. On my first day, I skied late into the
afternoon, then continued under the floodlights in the cooling night air. I
finished, just as the mountain was closing, by skipping off the main run to
end the evening alone on shadowy slopes lit only by a three-quarter moon.
Each day, or night, always ends at Big Mountain's favourite slopeside haunt
 -the Hell Roaring Saloon. The Hell Roaring is an apres-ski bar from the
days before they called them apres-ski bars. Crowded with skiers, locals and
mountain workers, it is wood-panelled, comfortable, and noisy.
The Hell Roaring is also home to the most unusual special offer in mountain
retailing. Buy a Hell Roaring Saloon cap for Dollars 15 and you are entitled
to one free draught beer every day for the rest of your life. Cap on head,
pint in hand, I quickly worked out that at two bucks a beer, I needed to
stay at least seven days to make a profit on the deal. If ever there was an
incentive to stay in Montana, skiing and drinking beer, this was it.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Gardening: Rod to break a grower's back - In the first of an
occasional series, Teresa McLean tames an urban jungle against the
bureaucratic odds / Me and my Allotment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN APRIL 1991 the town council gave us an allotment. It had taken me years
to resign myself to the fact that we only have a tiny back garden, facing
north, at once rampant and barren, a non-event for vegetables.
When the sun shone, I longed to treat everyone to my mother's summer classic
for supper, adelight of my childhood: peas, beans and bacon. Only home-grown
peas and beans could make the real thing.
Overcoming my subconscious feeling that allotments should belong to those
who live in the north of England, or beside railway lines, I wrote to the
council and asked for one.
They placed us on a waiting list. Then, in spring 1991, the council's
amenities and recreation department sent us some documents of a splendidly
historical flavour, granting us the yearly tenancy of a plot 'five rods big
or thereabouts', at a rent of Pounds 1 per rod per year.
I have always had a soft spot for rods. They were next to poles and perches
on the back page of my arithmetic text book at school, waiting to be learnt.
Or identified. (1 rod = 16 sq ft.)
These days it is five rods of land waiting to be cultivated, an old, rich
measurement of old, clay soil choked with weeds. We paid our rent and set to
work, with the help of the council's site map, swallowing at the third of a
mile or so between us and our plot.
Most of the other allotment holders on this patch are from the council
houses overlooking it. On hot days all they have to do is go home for a
drink. We drink before we go. It was after our second summer of persecuting
slugs and tearing out bindweed, the scourge of cultivation, that I went to
the allotment one evening to pick some spinach and found a note flapping on
a stick.
It was from the amenities and recreation department, ominously renamed
leisure services. A man called Mr Fish, technical officer of leisure
services, was going to reclaim our plot, 17A, because we were cultivating
land that belonged to some-one else.
I sent Mr Fish copies of the documents assigning 17A to us. He rang and said
he was sorry; he had got the wrong plot. Early this summer, to make a
change, Mr Fish said he was going to reclaim 17A because we had not been
cultivating it. We have only recently found out about the National Society
of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, which offers its members everything from
cheap seeds to help in disputes with local authorities.
At that stage we were on our own, unsupported and up against it, and we
decided the soil must fight its own battles. I took a carrier bag full of
peas, runner and broad beans, carrots, lettuces and immense radishes to the
council's leisure offices, to show those within how hard we had been
cultivating. I could not bring myself to cut and bring the globe artichokes,
pride of our plot, before they were ready. They were meant for a higher
fate.
In all the endless entrails of the allotment civil service, even in the
ranks of 'inspectors' out in the field, reporting back to base on the state
of the plots, I am pretty sure no-one had recognised our globe artichokes
for the noble vegetables they are.
To the ignorant inspector, they might look like unusual bushes, covering
their delicious globes with their great leaves. As Mr Fish was out when I
stormed into leisure offices, hell-bent and muddy, I spread out our humbler
vegetables in front of a minion, who looked nervous. I made him write down
their names and numbers, then took them home. Mr Fish soon wrote to say that
we could keep our plot, provided it is always weed-free. Fair enough.
Although productive, ours did have a few weeds, which we removed.
Apparently, the council fears that it may have to sell some allotment sites
to make money and perfect plots are the best argument against that. No more
intrepid weapon grows within them than the potato.
The ones we planted to break up the ground have done their stuff with a
vengeance and, in so doing, have given us a super-abundance of spuds.
Instead of turning up at dinner parties with unwanted bottles of wine, we
turn up with bags of unwanted potatoes. 17B, the other end of strip no 17,
belongs to a friendly man with a pony-tail. His strenuous exertions to turn
his wilderness into a vegetable patch have unearthed a few antique potatoes,
presumably left from his predecessor's efforts.
We urged him to leave those and take ours instead, before one of the
inspectors mistakes our chopped-off potato stalks for weeds. So far he does
not seem to have done so. Privacy is a basic principle of allotments and I
have never seen anyone spilling over from their own plot - least of all the
one next door, which is sacrosanct.
Mr 17B happily receives our potatoes but does not like to help himself. He
takes naturally to allotment life. I do not. I cannot resist picking up
fallen fruit and vegetables round about us, rather than leaving them to rot.
A sure sign of an alien.
Also, Mr 17B's opening act, when given his plot, was to build a compost
holder above ground level so that air can pass through it, changing dead
plant life into steaming muck for the future. All we have is a rusty
cupboard containing a few bits of mesh and bamboo poles. At least it is not
our fault; it was there when we arrived.
On the 18 side of us there is a shaggy man and on the 16 side a womens'
commune, both with the intermittent approach to gardening, keeping it close
to nature and free of constructions. Inspectors evidently keep their
distance. The lady at no 15 is of a different order. She has the whole
strip, all 10 rods, and every last bit of it is full of cabbages. A panoply
of cabbage colour from purple, through blue-grey and dark green to young,
bright green. Six hours a day, she told us, she spends on it in the summer.
Her plot furnishings are well-kept, stocked and used. She makes her own
sprays to keep aphids and lip-licking slugs at bay. I lean on my spade and
watch her at work sometimes, thinking to myself that I will have become an
allotment holder proper, not just a hit-and-run agent, when she does not
offer me one of her cabbages. Then I will not be able to accept it.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (23): Necessary luxuries - Puritans may try
to purge useless objects - but they never succeed for long, we all need them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY archaeologist will confirm that there is nothing unnecessary about
luxury goods. Far from it. In the silent graves of innumerable past
societies, the relics most eloquent about individual status and power are
precisely those whose beauty has got the better of their functionality. The
golden filigree fibula; the chased silver drinking cup; the outrageously
plumed helmet; the inlaid horse bits, and the delicate brazen chariot.
Accoutrements like these were never intended for hard, everyday use. They
were wheeled out for ceremonies to dazzle and intimidate. They were not so
much the instruments of rule as the signals of authority.
There is a timeless quality to the accumulation of luxuries which has
resisted campaigns to be censorious about excess and cleave to the simple
life. Anti-sumptuary strictures have never held for long. In Cromwell's
time, Puritans purged luxuries as diverse as poodles, tapestries and
petticoats. To the committed Puritan, there is hardly anything that cannot
be deemed impure. Envy, and the sheer pleasure of unpunished vandalism,
probably account for most of those moments in history when someone briefly
cajoles his fellows into making bonfires of their vanities. But the poodles
and petticoats return. It is inhuman to do without them; we are lost in an
unnatural limbo of egalitarianism.
The nexus of luxury and power does not, of course, release luxury from moral
evaluation. Stern antique Romans regarded luxury and avarice as twins; and
sometimes they went further in their disapproval by pairing luxury with
insanity. Nero's wife, who had her favourite horse shod with golden shoes,
was thereby as mad as Nero himself. The love of luxury was traced to a
contempt for nature: not, I think, a necessary connection, although it is
certainly true that the collectors of ivory knick-knacks do not care whether
the elephant population declines or dies. The truth is that each individual
will regard some luxury or other as offensive. In my case, it is
personalised car number plates; in my father's, a bottle of champagne. But
this does not mean that we want to legislate against those who cherish these
things. So long as we are left with our own indulgences (Egyptian cotton
sheets; a little cigar at Christmas), we will tolerate the foolishness of
others.
There is, however, a terrible irony about the consumption of luxuries in the
late twentieth century. By definition a luxurious lifestyle ought to be easy
and hedonistic. Yet the reality is that modern luxury goods are aimed at
those who lead anything but a relaxed and otiose life. So many of the
luxuries themselves are concerned with strict timekeeping and frenetic
travel. No wonder that the best place to survey the exposure of luxury goods
is an international airport (at Heathrow par excellence).
Partly the airport luxuries are designed to glamorise what is essentially a
tedious and still unnerving form of transport. The departures lounge is a
sort of prison for the condemned, but it does not seem that way if there is
a bar dispensing oysters and caviar. Partly the airport luxuries are
pandering to Oriental gift cultures, in which a bottle of brandy costing
Pounds 500 duty free can be billed as a bargain. But primarily the cocoon of
luxuries protects the social status of the travellers.
Picture the businessman dispatched abroad. What the trip really entails is a
flog across continents to a lonely room in an anonymous hotel for a series
of stuffy encounters with alien people. But no captain of industry can admit
to that. So you see him in the airport shopping malls, both determined and
obliged not to return home empty-handed. He glances at his Rolex Oyster,
finds he has time to buy his wife a bottle of Chanel; signs for it with his
Mont Blanc pen, and slots it into his Bond Street hand baggage. The names of
the goods manage to be both discreet and significant: and they are what
counts, for they say that the business trip was not hellish at all, but what
everyone else would love to be doing.
Hence that curious new phrase, essential luxuries. It ought to be a paradox,
if luxuries are understood to be such items as are desirable but not
indispensable. But it is more than the remorseless logic of conspicuous
consumption. It is precisely what our Bronze Age ancestors understood.
Luxuries massage our egos and buttress our place in the world. We could
hardly do without them.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (24): Forget the peeled prawns, you want
macaroni cheese - Luxury does not lie in brand names, nor in goods that used
to be scarce. It is a much more subtle commodity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER YORK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES Mrs Thing really look the business in her mid-tone full length ranch
mink, thrown over an appliqued cashmere twin-set, setting off in her
walnut-lined Daimler to eat prawn cocktail in pink sauce at the Tudor Grange
restaurant in Something-on-Thames. The poor old biddy, they will say, has
clearly lost the plot.
Luxury is re-defined in every decade. A raft of traditional luxuries - mink,
cashmere, trad' British 'quality' cars and prawns - have been re-classified
by fashion, political correctness and increased availability. Mink has
suffered all three. Supermarkets sell peeled prawns by the bucketload.
The old imagery of luxury was based on the notion of the cornucopia - a
hectic abundance of whatever is in short supply. The cornucopia pours forth
out-of-season fruit. Luxury was easily defined when the shopping list was
short (no Apple Mackintosh, no liposuction) when there was consensus about
what was best and when most of the world lived at subsistence level.
But postwar technology and marketing have upset the traditional Veblen
notions of conspicuous consumption - wotalotigot - by providing an abundance
of former rarities (farmed salmon and venison for everyone), and by
providing an extraordinary flow of novelties to subvert the traditional
status of luxuries (mobile telephones, dental bonding).
Even Paul Johnson, the distinguished sourpuss, noted on turning 65 last week
the extraordinary range of former luxuries that had become commonplace over
his lifetime. He saw the development as one of the compensations for bad
manners, worse thinking and social disintegration.
J K Galbraith pointed out as early as 1958 in The Affluent Society that 'no
useful distinction can be made between luxuries and necessities' (but he was
talking about America's Golden Age).
Meanwhile marketing has imposed a new definition of luxury - a curious,
1980s notion of luxury as symbolism and reference rather than reality - the
world of 'added-value', today's version of 'de-luxe'. Recognised luxury now
comes primarily in the marketeer's coinage, the 'luxury brand'. A luxury
brand is one believed to confer magic status on its owners. Luxury brands,
whatever their origins, are vigorously promoted names in the marketplace
now. Their values are totemic ones; the name is everything.
In the 1980s wonderful new money and new aspirations emerged in new places.
The flaunt-it imperative stretched from Essex to Seoul via Dallas and Tokyo.
This coincided with changes in the ownership and control of the majority of
specialist luxury manufacturers and design houses in Europe. From the late
1970s on practically every leading couture house and accessory maker was
acquired and run by a marketeer who treated the company as a 'brand
management' business, owners of a set of rights which could be licensed,
franchised and generally deployed to add value. They talked about 'the
equity in the brand' - they usually outsourced the product.
The new owners did everything in the marketeers handbook: they looked for
diversification opportunities (new products to sell under the old valuable
name); they looked for new markets, opening the Seoul shop in 1988, just
after Atlanta and, above all, they looked for new kinds of people to 'extend
the franchise'.
These new people were, typically, aspirants, socially mobile Wannabes who
had significant disposable income rather than serious money but wanted to
relate to the Great World they saw in the raft of 'style' and social
magazines that publishing groups produced throughout the decade.
These strategies worked well until at least 1989. The accounts of the big
luxury brand-owners show super-normal profits through the late 1980s, a
quite embarrassing share of which derived from the Far East. It worked
because the approach recognised the identities the new people wanted to
assume, often 'traditional' European ones. And it worked because it was not
that hard - the new funny money seemed to mop up anything it was sent -
every office girl in Tokyo with money to burn seemed to have something from
Louis Vuitton.
At fever pitch, in the late 1980s, it was truly surreal to see the imagery
of the 19th century Faubourg St Honore and St James's replicated in theme
park concessions round the world.  And of course it was complete alphabet
soup with letters everywhere - double Gs for Gucci, the Chanel C, YSL -
metallic initials twinkling from all over the New People.
Real businesses at scale were built on the luxury branding device - LVMH,
the pre-eminent luxury house, is big on the Paris bourse. Factories were
filled with tiny religious offerings stamped with the magic symbols. But the
scale of the enterprise depended to a great degree on an 1980s cast of mind,
an 'everything possible' view, and on what the Japanese call the 'bubble
economy'.
It is gone somehow, that sublime belief in the magic power of brands; not
just because of recession but because each generation learns through the
great educator, shopping. Shopping familiarises people with the mechanics of
luxury brands, makes them cynical about the promotional devices, the
atmospheric outlets, the inventive packaging. They feel eventually they have
been there, done that. In the 1980s the learning process was accelerated as
more and more brands entered the market.
Shopping eventually teaches aspirants that people like themselves buy these
brands. The brands' status moves rapidly from desirable to acceptable to
unsurprising. New money constantly looks for new ways to express itself.
Real luxury continues to move more quietly on different rubber wheels. Real
luxury, for seriously rich people, means having your own way. It means
servants - whatever you call them - and it means things hand-built for you.
In the houses of the seriously rich, often very short on the style the
magazines show, there is always something that has absorbed a great deal of
money and craftsman time, contrived to do exactly what its owner wants.
The Queen's life illustrates this principle vividly. In a plain bathroom
wholly unlike any high concept room-set the bath is run by helping hands. In
the royal clothes, dowdy to the critics, everything has been elaborately
thought through to meet HM's distinct personal requirements. Macaroni cheese
and eggs on toast will be available on a 1950s Formica tray exactly when and
how she wants them.
The 'thrifty' repair and restoration of a host of shabby loved Royal objects
will have cost more skilled man and woman hours than a raft of Taiwan-made
luxury accessories. The luxury brand names with royal warrants will still do
the real discreet hand-made specials for her, their loss leaders. But they
will almost certainly have to leave the initials off.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The lure of the drug trade - A
year ago Dr Jan Steiner became her own boss. She tells Clive Fewins the joys
of being a one-woman company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM HER early days as a medical student in Sydney Jan Steiner was hooked on
drugs. The obsession was not a clinical condition but professional. Steiner
decided early on that she wanted to work in research rather than follow her
father into general practice.
After Steiner qualified in 1969 she took the academic route, working as a
clinical pharmacologist in London, Kansas City and Oxford.
'I never thought I would end up running my own business in the medical
field,' said Dr Steiner. 'But I suppose from the time in 1981 when I was
offered a job at the G D Searle laboratories in High Wycombe I began to
hatch the idea of doing my own thing one day.'
In 1985. when she was made redundant when Searle closed the labs and working
in senior management jobs with two other large pharmaceutical companies, Dr
Steiner is indeed her own boss.
Twelve months ago, at 46, she started Oxford Therapeutics Consulting Ltd. It
is a one-woman show, and that is the way she intends to keep it.
'If I am successful I do not necessarily see the expansion route as
employing other people,' Dr Steiner said. 'I have a number of collaborators
whose expertise I can call upon. Their specialities lie in areas of
expertise different from my own, from scientific, to patenting, to venture
capital and regulatory matters.'
'Where I am based at The Oxford Science park on the outskirts of the city
there is an excellent back-up service that includes typing, photocopying and
telephone answering, so really I plan to stay on my own. I am my own
managing director - managing to direct me.'
At times the direction wiggles a bit, but the essential path is clear.
Steiner's company is a consultancy that helps start-up companies in the
biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields to establish themselves. It does
this by helping them to assess the market fully and thoroughly, before
investing what might be several million pounds in research at the cutting
edge of medical science.
Steiner knows of only a handful of start-up companies of this sort in the UK
but approaching 400 in the US, so her interests cross the Atlantic. On a
recent trip to the US she visited 15 companies in nine days, and came back
with potential orders worth Dollars 15,000. However, this work was geared
less to assessing markets than smoothing the passage across the Atlantic of
the products of the US companies, most of which are larger and a few years
older than their British start-up counterparts. Not very patriotic one might
think. But Steiner, who still carries an Australian passport, points out
that in such an embryo field of applied medical science there is room in the
market for everyone.
'From a trip to the States like my recent one I am able to show my British
clients how the American companies have managed to grow and to market their
products,' Steiner said. 'By studying closely what is happening over there I
am in a good position to help British companies to fly the flag and to avoid
costly mistakes. In this business the stakes are so high and the costs so
astronomical that there is no leeway if you make a mess of it. It is
incredibly important to get it right first time.'
The problem of successful biochemical start-up has to be cracked in the
universities, Steiner thinks. 'A lot of the work going on in British
universities is so clever that it is a desperate shame not to develop and
commercialise it,' she said.
'Yet so often all the odds seem to be stacked against the academics who are
trying to develop their discoveries. If you are an academic in America and
you have a classy discovery you set up a company to develop it. It's as
simple as that. All the back-up and assistance you need is usually in place.
'But here in Britain it's very different. For a variety of reasons people
here are not so motivated to grow rich. But also here academics are not so
well-served by their universities. Far too often they just publish their
findings and leave it at that. Alternatively they might licence their
findings to a major producer - all too often an American company. Far too
much intellectual property still goes out of the country.'
But political and economic pressures, have helped create a new alertness in
some of Britain's biggest universities, says to Steiner.
'They are also realising that as a lot of these discoveries and inventions
are funded by Joe Public in the first place, the public purse can rightly
expect to see some return on its capital,' she said.
Many British universities now have technology transfer offices and are
carrying out technology audits, scanning through scientific advances to
assess which might be worth large-scale commercial development. Steiner is
working with some of these departments in the biochemical field.
She is also helping to steer some of them along the tricky path to seedcorn
capital or wealthy 'business angels' who are happy to invest in a field
which is forbiddingly hard to understand and frighteningly long-term in the
eyes of the average investor.
After 12 months of hard work Steiner is seeing little so far in the way of
profits. 'I put Pounds 30,000 of my own money into OTC, and my business plan
indicates that I will need to spend Pounds 20,000 including start-up costs,
to run the business for the first year,' she said. 'As far as I can tell
those figures are about right, and make ample allowance for my visit to the
States, which cost Pounds 2,500.
'As I expect to turn over Pounds 20,000 in the first year I therefore expect
to break even.
'I am quite prepared to put more of my savings into the business in the
second year should it prove necessary. But the indications are that, even
paying my collaborators for the expertise I buy in, I should be sowing a
profit by this time next year.
'I am optimistic. And even on my less optimistic days I am enjoying working
for myself so much that optimism pushes me along.
'On top of that at the end of it all I am hopefully doing something that can
do people a bit of good and advance people's quality of life.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (22): Smell the tenderness, laughter,
candour . . . - Perfumes are very big business. Lucia van der Post meets a
man trying to identify the scent of money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEAN Courtiere, President Directeur-General of Parfums Givenchy SA is
sitting at his desk in Le Vallois in Paris sniffing. 'This one is a leetle .
. . shall we say . . . heavy. This one, it is not audace enough and this one
. . . it, perhaps, needs to be a leetle softer.'
Three times a week, between nine and 10 o'clock in the morning, this is what
he does - he sniffs, sifting the fragrances. From the essential oil houses,
from the big international creators of successful smells, from smaller
independent 'noses' they come with their little phials which they offer for
approval.
Courtiere has already defined the concept, he knows the name (Insense), has
commissioned the bottle and he is relatively sure that when he smells it he
will know the fragrance that fits the bill.
It is a race with only one winner. 'It is heartbreaking, but that,' says
Courtiere, 'is the name of the game - the winner takes all. We give them all
the same marketing brief, the same concept and ask them to bring it to
life.'
After 12 months there are just four parfumiers left in the race. Just one of
them will win the prize - the contract to supply the essential ingredients
for as long as the fragrance goes on selling. For everybody else there is
nothing but to hope for better luck next time.
For Parfums Givenchy there is a lot at stake. If Courtiere manages to usher
in a world-wide classic, the pot of gold can run to many, many millions.
(Chanel No 5 and Guerlain's Shalimar, two of the all-time best-sellers, are
each rumoured to have a turnover of Pounds 50m a year). If it fails . . .
and even the most golden of names have their disasters . . . then a great
deal of time, money and effort will have been wasted, not to mention the
loss of face.
In the US, where, it is said, a perfume is launched every six days, only one
out of six will still be doing business after three years. Everybody in the
industry shudders at the memory of Lacroix's C'est La Vie which is rumoured
to have lost LVMH some Dollars 40m.
It takes roughly two years to bring a fragrance to the marketplace - 'if
everything falls into place, ' says Courtiere. 'It begins with a concept. In
the case of Insense it was easy. We had launched Amarige ('sunlight made
woman, a hymn to joie de vivre'), in 1991 and what we needed next was a
man's fragrance to match it. 'What,' I asked my female colleagues, 'appeals
to you in a man?' 'Laughter, candour, tenderness, romanticism, a bit of dash
and unexpectedness,' they said. So all that went into the brief.'
After much adding and subtracting of elusive ingredients, the 95th version
of one of the original recipes is deemed to be the one and Insense ('names
are difficult but this one I had had in my head for a long time') is born -
'Wild and Impulsive, The man who will capture the heart of Amarige.' The
packaging is planned and the price fixed - though an up-market men's
fragrance it cannot be too highly priced for men's fragrances are usually
bought by women who, it seems, are meaner (or poorer?) and will not pay as
much as men will pay for the fragrances they buy their women.
One fine day Insense is ready to be launched. A plane-load of journalists is
flown to the Dordogne in the LVMH jet. In the garden of a perfect little
manoire awash with blue and yellow flowers (the Insense colours - no detail
is too small) Insense is born. Champagne corks pop, music plays, Hubert de
Givenchy flies in, cameras click, mounds of foie gras are consumed.
If you ask what all this costs, you get a pretty shifty answer. Dollars 50m
for a major US-style launch is the industry guess but Courtiere says many
are launched with much less. 'Kenzo Parfum, for instance, is a very small
company and it has done very well because it clearly relates to Kenzo's own
story. Boucheron, too, is small and did not have millions to spend and yet
it, too, has been a success according to the goals they set themselves.
Jean-Paul Gaultier's fragrance is another great success that did not cost
millions to launch - it is exceptional, so consistent with his image, so
honest that it has attracted a whole new category of customers.'
The good old days when Chanel could summon up her exclusive 'nose', Ernest
Beaux, and ask him to make something that simply smelled ravishing seem to
have gone. These days it is all about life-styles and niches and keeping up
with the trends.
We have, so say the fragrance supremos, done with power and aggression - out
with assertive scents such as Giorgio, Obsession, Poison.
Sweet, sensitive 1990s woman (have you met her yet?) first had a little run
with floral essences and softer smells such as Calvin Klein's Eternity,
Ralph Lauren's Safari and Cassini.
She has now gone 'green' as well as a bit fey. She likes a bit of
counter-culture (Jean-Paul Gaultier with his funky woman-shaped bottle) and
a breath of Eastern mysticism (L'Eau D'Issey). She also, it seems, is not at
all averse to smelling of melon (Dior's Dune) and water melon (New West For
Her), of ginger (Jean-Paul Gaultier), of lychee and nectarine (Yves St.
Laurent's Champagne) and of Orange Blossom mixed with Vanilla (Van Cleef).
These New Age perfumes depend upon something called Ozonics. If that
conjures up images of ocean and fresh air, then you are on the right track.
Fresh, natural, that is what the latest perfumes are all about.
Then we come to the matter of price. There are those who seek to prevent the
customer paying over the odds for ingredients that add up to a fraction of
the retail price. But today's customer is not fooled. She knows she is
paying for image and packaging, for launches and concepts but she knows,
too, that perfume was never about logic. Who wants a wonderful smell out of
a utilitarian bottle sold in a warehouse? (What happened when Marcel Bich
tried to sell a lovely smell in a plain glass phial for Pounds 1.85 a time?
Nothing happened. Nobody bought it.)
When a customer complained to Christian Dior about the exorbitant price of a
hat given the cost of the materials, he dismantled it, gave her the wisp of
tulle and the rose saying, 'the materials, Madame, are free.' It is the
invisible, the magic that most of us are happy to pay for.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (21): The case for stylish travel / A look
at luxurious accessories for gentlemen going on a journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a time when the requirement for membership of the Traveller's Club
was to have journeyed for 500 miles measured in a straight line from the
club. Nowadays, most day-trippers would therefore qualify. But if we are all
now gentleman travellers, few of us maintain the kind of style and luxury in
which those gentlemen used to undertake their journeys. And if we are
looking for the ultimate travel kit, then it has to hark back to those days
of grand travel.
We have to ignore the modern middle manager's concern with the lightweight
and the miniature (which inevitably become the flimsy and the meagre), and
look instead for both substance and style. Remember that the Duke of Windsor
went away for three months at a time, with up to 118 square leather trunks;
all were numbered and inventoried, and all came, of course, from Louis
Vuitton.
Vuitton has long been regarded as the premier malletier; its upright steamer
trunks are virtually fitted bedrooms with handles. But more practical for
any man who travels under his own steam is their lighter but still luxurious
new Taiga range, in a masculine, grained, dark green leather with brass
fittings. This range brings a masculinity missing from many of Vuitton's
lines; it includes a shrewdly-designed soft leather travel bag, called
Helanga (Pounds 800), which contains a pop-out suit carrier, a laptop
computer case (Oural, Pounds 995) and a pochette for a mobile phone (Baikal,
Pounds 275). These confirm the essential principle of luxury luggage: that
cases should cost more than the items they contain.
Louis Vuitton may be the name which most evokes luxury luggage, but the
particular item which recalls grand travel is not Vuitton's; it is the
classic plain tan leather suitcase. Swaine Adeney Brigg (185-186
Piccadilly), still sells rigid leather suitcases, in three shades of
sumptuous bridle hide. Built on a wood frame, with capped corners, and with
retaining straps inside. They range from Pounds 825 to Pounds 890.
Harrod's sells similar tan leather suitcases by Tanner Krolle (Pounds
850-Pounds 1250) but the leather has a glossier finish, new money to Swaine
Adeney's old.
Dunhill, another classic touring outfitter, has its Cambridge range of
structured leather luggage, in rich shades of racing green as well as
English tan; suitcases start at Pounds 860, with an impressive trunk at
Pounds 2,050. And for sheer indulgence, the luxury traveller will demand
Dunhill's Cambridge train case for Pounds 860.
Along with your dedicated shirt case, you will require a special case for
your ties, to keep your neckwear safely strapped and pressed. Leather tie
cases are available from Swaine Adeney Brigg (Pounds 125). But the best
design is that of the porta cravatte by Rodeo Star (Pounds 42, from
Revelation, 170 Piccadilly) - less luxurious perhaps, but it incorporates a
neat hanging device so that the creases can fall out of your ties when you
arrive.
And do not forget to exhibit a British attitude towards the weather, no
matter your destination, by packing the most impressive travelling umbrella
of them all. The Brigg M &amp; F umbrella (from Swaine, Adeney Brigg) unscrews
into three parts - handle, body and ferrule - to fit into an attache case;
unlike common travelling umbrellas it does not actually collapse, either
intentionally or otherwise. With the silk cover, it is a cloud-busting
Pounds 255.25; with the more plebeian nylon, Pounds 135.
Once your luggage is safely stowed, you will need something to carry around
your money and tickets. The truly aristocratic use a butler; for those just
a notch down the social ladder, there is the travel document wallet from
Gidden (Clifford Street, W1 and Burlington Arcade), saddlers to the Queen
and makers of a range of classic leather goods. This paperback-sized folder
in bridle hide (Pounds 186) has separate divisions for air tickets,
documents, foreign currency, cash and travellers cheques, and also
incorporates a removable leather passport holder. Gidden's leather writing
case, in a folding, envelope design (Pounds 125), is also a necessity to
write those letters home in style.
Perhaps the greatest luxury of travel is time; the Grand Tours of the 18th
century often lasted five years. Few of us now have such time on our hands,
but we can still sport time on our wrists. The most sophisticated travel
wristwatch is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Geographique, a hand-assembled,
mechanical wristwatch which takes its owner around the globe. At a twist of
the crown, the displayed time will leap to that in any of 24 cities,
representing time zones from Los Angeles through Auckland. Only a limited
number of Geographiques are made each year, with prices ranging from Pounds
8,500 to Pounds 13,000.
Something similar is offered by the Ebel Voyager, which has a rotating bezel
which indicates the time in major cities, but in a less sophisticated
manner; prices are from a more modest Pounds 1,880.
For those who will be flying their aircraft personally, the Breitling
Chronospace, along with slide rule aviation calculations, offers two time
displays simultaneously, one analogue and one digital, for time home and
away; prices are from Pounds 820.
All these watches are available from The Watch Gallery (Jermyn Street and
Fulham Road).
You will, of course, be woken by room service, so instead of the
conventional folding travel alarm clock, the contemporary traveller packs
the Braun world travel calculator. It combines the classic matt black Braun
calculator with a world time clock and alarm; Pounds 42 from Oggetti (Fulham
Road). And alongside it at the bedside, another contemporary item; the
ultimate world radio, the Sony ICF-SW77 (Pounds 399), with memory for 162
frequencies, station-name tuning, a timer, and the ability with its
short-wave reception to pick up the BBC World Service virtually anywhere on
the planet.
Once you have succeeded in travelling with style, a gentleman needs to
travel in style as well. Grooming kits seem to contain devices ranging from
the indispensable to the incomprehensible. At Liberty (Regent Street), there
are the waxy nappa leather sets by W A Goold; a padded case containing
full-size razor, collapsible toothbrush, nail clippers, mirror and comb is
Pounds 34. Goold also make a traditional hair brush which contains a
manicure set zipped into its body (Pounds 39.95).
At The Conran Shop (Michelin House, Fulham Road) a leather case (Pounds 74)
contains a clothes brush and sewing kit along with all the grooming
essentials. But perhaps the most impressive contemporary set comes from
Oggetti, a nine-piece toilet set in black leather pouch, where even the
razor is matt black (Pounds 113.35).
For those who insist on an electric shave, the neat little Payer
battery-operated razor, designed by F A Porsche, is by far the most
impressive (Harrod's, Pounds 37.80). But luxury travel is all about
tradition, and that is embodied in Penhaligon's beautiful razor and shaving
brush, housed in engine-turned nickel tubes (Pounds 45 each, from Harrod's
and branches of Penhaligons).
For sustenance, the traditional traveller turns, naturally, to Fortnum &amp;
Mason (Piccadilly, W1), who offer a buckled leather roll containing a pewter
flask and four pewter cups (Pounds 107). His destinations are kept in his
beautiful Three City address book (Pounds 17.95) from Smythson's (New Bond
Street), cleverly divided into three separate alphabetical sections for
London, New York and Tokyo (or Paris). And his money is similarly divided,
held in money clips by Murray Ward in Pounds , Dollars and Y designs (gold
on silver, Pounds 45 each) from Simpson (Piccadilly).
Surrounded by the beauty of this ultimate travel kit, a gentleman can indeed
relive the days of grand travel; and perhaps he will recognise another truth
in Emerson's statement - 'Though we travel the world over to find the
beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A sophisticated endowment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGEPT is the acronym for the latest investment trust to specialise in with
profits endowment policies. The trust will be run by Exeter Asset
Management, best known for split capital investment trusts.
The trust has a complex structure. As well as ordinary shares, the trust
will issue a zero coupon debenture. This will pay no interest in the
conventional sense, but will be repaid at a much higher level than its issue
price.
The plus point is that the roll-up in the zero's value is tax-deductible. To
take advantage of this, EGEPT (which stands for Exeter Geared Endowment
Policy Trust) will invest in the income shares of split capital trusts, as
well as in endowment policies. The trust can offset the tax it pays on the
income shares against the zero roll-up. Thus, it will be able to receive
gross dividends from the income shares.
Furthermore, the trust will use the revenue from the income shares to fund
the payments on the endowment policies it buys. EGEPT will have a 15 year
life and will concentrate on policies maturing around 2008. Full details
will be available next week.
Meanwhile, reader Roger Honey has written with a timely reminder of the
dangers faced by individuals when they invest in second-hand endowment
policies. In November 1991, he bought a Scottish Amicable policy for Pounds
16,493 from market-maker Policy Portfolio. At the time, Policy Portfolio
gave an illustrated maturity value in May 1993 of Pounds 21,568. The
illustration was prefaced with the warning 'Future bonuses cannot be
guaranteed as past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future.'
As it happened, Scottish Amicable cut its terminal bonus rate from 53 to 20
per cent. The final payout from the policy was just Pounds 16,585.23. After
Honey allowed for the additional premiums he had paid, he had suffered a
loss on the deal. He complained, and although Policy Portfolio said the
information it gave was of 'meticulously correct', the FIMBRA consumer
arbitration scheme awarded Honey Pounds 2,377.
Finally, market-makers are pushing to eliminate the use of the term
'second-hand' to describe these investments. The Association of Policy
Market Makers wants the phrase 'traded endowment policies' used instead.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exemptions and inheritance tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I believe the Pounds 55,000 exemption rule for inheritance tax applies only
to non-domiciled spouse(s) of less than '17 out of 20' years residence in
the UK and that once this milestone is passed the normal UK exemption of
(currently) Pounds 150,000 applies irrespective of domicile. Is this
correct?
The limited Pounds 55,000 exemption applies to transfers to non-domiciled
spouses. Domicile, in the case of Inheritance Tax, is determined according
to the Common Law, subject however, to the provisions of the Inheritance Tax
Act in so far as they alter the Common Law.
You are correct in saying that non-UK domiciled individuals who are resident
in the UK for '17 out of 20 years' are regarded as UK domiciled for
Inheritance Tax. Therefore, the above restriction does not apply to non-UK
domiciled spouses with the requisite period of residence.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax deductions and rental income
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I notice the booklet from the Inland Revenue 'Filling in your tax return,
Form 11P (1993)' states: 'interest paid is not an allowable deduction from
foreign rental income.'
When was this change was introduced and on which date it became effective?
This has always been the law - a fact which was confirmed in 1982 in
Ockendon (Inspector of Taxes) v Mackley (56TC2).

FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Capital losses on BES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY investors will have learned that their ventures into Business Expansion
Schemes devoted to building homes for rent are turning out badly, especially
true for schemes initiated around 1988-90. In a typical case an investor
will have put in Pounds 10,000, received Pounds 4,000 in tax relief and now
has an investment worth Pounds 6,500. His apparent net gain of Pounds 500 is
derisory, but does he have a capital loss of Pounds 3,500 to offset gains
elsewhere?
No, because section 150(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992
says: 'A gain or loss which accrues to an individual on the disposal of any
shares issued after 18th March 1986 in respect of which (BES) relief has
been given to him and not withdrawn shall not be a chargeable gain or
allowable loss for the purposes of CGT.'
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR51 (Business expansion scheme)
and IR85 (Business expansion scheme: Private rented housing).

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Try your luck with Ernie - With
interest rates at low levels, the prize potential of Premium bonds make them
an increasingly attractive investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WILLSHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH inflation running at less than 2 per cent and building society savings
rates as low as we have seen them for some time, this could be the moment to
resume your acquaintance with Ernie - the electronic random number indicator
equipment used by National Savings.
Premium bond winnings are free of UK income tax and you do not lose your
capital. You can cash in your holding at any time. Each month, Ernie selects
more than 180,000 prizes, ranging from Pounds 50 to Pounds 250,000.
Bonds can be bought at the post office or direct from National Savings at
Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. They are available in blocks of 10 numbers of
Pounds 1 each and there is a minimum cash investment of Pounds 100 unless
you are re-investing Pounds 50 prizes. But you have to wait three months
after purchase before your bonds go into the draws.
The maximum holding was increased to Pounds 20,000 earlier this year and
spouses may each hold the maximum. Bonds may also be bought for children, up
to the same amount, subject to the Pounds 3,000 annual inheritance tax limit
for each parent. Parents do not pay tax on prizes won by children.
The value of bonds eligible for the draw now totals about Pounds 2.5bn. A
prize fund, which may be varied from time to time, is calculated at 5 per
cent on this figure and allocated according to a formula set out in the
National Savings prospectus.
Every month there is one prize of Pounds 250,000, five of Pounds 10,000 and
25 of Pounds 5,000. Weekly draws are for one prize each of Pounds 100,000,
Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 25,000. The remainder of the prize fund is split
between prizes of Pounds 1,000, Pounds 500, Pounds 100 and Pounds 50. Most
prizes - more than 160,000 - are worth just Pounds 50.
What, then, are the chances of winning a prize? National Savings calculates
that the probability of each single Pounds 1 bond winning a prize in each
monthly draw are 15,000 to 1. At these odds, it reckons the chances of not
winning any prize, if you own the maximum holding for a year, are 8,900,000
to 1.
A person with 'average luck' holding the maximum of Pounds 20,000 is likely
to win 16 prizes a year. If each prize were the minimum Pounds 50, the
tax-free return on capital would be 4 per cent a year - within spitting
distance of the net return on an instant access building society account.
One larger prize puts you firmly in the money. One north London investor
quotes his return so far this year on a holding of Pounds 10,000 as 7.5 per
cent, with two months still to run. And then there is the delicious prospect
of a big win.
At this point, I hear murmurs. Is it fair? Is it not rigged in favour of
investors in the south? Do not people who hold blocks of Pounds 500 or
Pounds 1,000 stand a better chance than those with small numbers?
National Savings goes to great lengths to make sure that all bond numbers
stand an equal chance of winning. People from the south do win more often,
but that is because they own more bonds.
People usually assume that the bond numbers are inputted and a computerised
tombola does the rest. In fact, Ernie is provided with the configuration of
letters and figures which it must use, and then assembles its own patterns
entirely at random. These are matched separately against bond numbers in the
draw to find the lucky ones. Tests are made by the Government Actuary before
and after each draw to ensure that the random nature of the process is
operating correctly.
Premium bonds are worth thinking about if you are going to have cash to
spare for a reasonable period of time - say, a year or so. Those paying tax,
and especially people on fixed pensions, surely resent paying tax on
interest from building society or bank deposit accounts. While interest
rates and inflation remain at a low level, it costs little to take a punt;
after all, at worst, all you stand to lose is the net interest you would
have earned on your deposit and the inflation effect.
For many, the thrill of a letter in the post from Ernie is part of the lure
of the investment. Some sort of prize could arrive on your doormat at just
about any time. But, if you get tired of waiting, you need the cash or your
faith in Ernie runs out, you can always ask for your money back.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (20): Follow your heart when you buy
diamonds - Buy jewels because you want to wear them, not as an investment,
and do not be afraid to ask questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIENNE BECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FINE jewel, precious, personal and romantic is likely to be one of the
most emotional purchases of your life. Any advice that is purely hard-headed
and practical would be a mistake: it may seem simplistic, but buying what
you like most, not what you think you should like or what may be a good
investment, is most likely to guarantee a 'good buy'.
Part of the problem with buying precious jewellery, as opposed to say
couture dresses or cars, is the dreaded investment element.
To avoid disappointment, give up any thoughts of reselling on at a profit,
at least for 100 years or so. On the whole, modern jewellery simply does not
hold or increase its value, unless perhaps it is a particularly rare or
unique precious stone. Buy for beauty, for indulgence, and buy the best
quality you can afford.
A little knowledge may be a dangerous thing, but many jewellers like
customers to ask questions. They like giving information so that prospective
buyers will know quality when they see it.
David Morris of Conduit Street likes to explain everything to his clients.
Today's buyers, he finds, are more aware and selective. Tiffany, famous but
informal, prides itself on its commitment to the customer, and hands out
booklets on How to Buy a Diamond and How to Buy a Pearl.
The chief decision for the buyer lies between whether to go to a retailer or
an individual designer jeweller.
The safest route is to put yourself in the hands of professionals by going
to a reputable, long-established retailer of fine jewels, who would not risk
a hard-earned reputation by selling dubious goods and who will provide a
good after-sales service.
Daniel Reveyron of Boucheron in London has worked at the top end of the
trade for 15 years and says that he cannot remember any genuine complaints
about authenticity in the London trade. Long established companies survive
for good reasons; a good name is not a licence to print money, it has to be
earnt.
A reputable retailer can be either your local jeweller, with an individual,
up-to-date approach, selling the work of several different makers; an
international independent such as David Morris; a single designer shop such
as Lalaounis or Elizabeth Gage or one of the international jewel houses such
as Cartier, Boucheron, Bulgari.
At the sky-high end of the market, the new House of Graff in Bond Street is
unique: the home of the world's rarest and most beautiful gemstones, woven
into story book jewels for an elite clientele.
It is as well to look carefully at as much jewellery as you can, (Harrods
Fine Jewellery Room has many jewellers under one roof), find a salesperson
you trust, try things on and ask as many questions as you like before making
your choice.
Consider carefully exactly which jewels suit your tastes, your budget, your
clothes and lifestyle. Do you prefer all gold, matt or shiny, or gemstones,
cabochons, deep and rich, or light, bright and sparkling? Reveyron finds
that men buying jewellery for women often seldom think deeply enough about
matching the jewellery to the woman they have in mind. If they have the cash
it is almost ridiculously easy to buy.
Alongside the formal gem-laden high jewellery, all jewel houses offer more
fashionable, wearable ranges and often an even more casual, less expensive
boutique range. Bulgari, aiming at a younger market, has recently launched a
superbly scaled down versatile and affordable collection which starts at
around Pounds 500.
Tiffany, the least intimidating jeweller in Bond Street, is an excellent
place to look and learn, with the widest possible choice of fine jewels by
different designers from Peretti to Schlumberger, from under Pounds 100 to
hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The other alternative is to search out an individual designer-jeweller whose
work you admire. Tracking them down is usually done by word of mouth,
although the World Gold Council advises and direct customers with a specific
brief.
Most designers will happily weave their own style and skills around your
ideas and themes, but be sure to see and understand a good working drawing
before giving the final go ahead for the work. Since individuality and
versatility are the keynotes of the fine jewellery market today, more
retailers, such as Asprey and Boodle and Dunthorne, are offering the work of
named designers such Leo de Vroomen, who creates classics in rich colours
and enamels.
It is not a good idea to try to buy your gemstones separately. Most gemstone
dealers deal exclusively with the trade. Do not trust any 'bargains' offered
on exotic holidays.
The exception to this basic rule may be buying gems at auction which is
becoming more and more popular. It is of course a case of buyer beware, but
there are experts and gemmologists at hand to advise and direct and any
expensive gem will have been tested and certificated by a gem laboratory.
The stone could then be taken to a favourite jeweller to be incorporated
into a design of your choice. This is also a good idea for any gemstone that
you already own, perhaps set in a family jewel or in a tired, outdated
piece. Most retailers provide a design service and prices for special
commissions are not necessarily higher, although of course a one-off
hand-made jewel will always cost more than a semi mass-produced line.
Jewel fashions tend to move slowly. There is a definite trend away from
blatantly cash-flashing jewels to quieter, more personal ornaments with an
emphasis on good design and the art of the jeweller. Opulent fantasy is
making a come back: look at the vivacious Verdura works of art or the
exciting Rene Boivin collection at Garrard. Colour and more colour is the
essence of design today: at the top end of the market coloured diamonds,
especially the ravishing pink Argyle diamonds from Australia, have become a
popular trend. Lower down the price scale all sorts of semi-precious stones,
once looked down upon, are opening up wonderful design possibilities: there
is a huge vogue for tanzanites, iolites, rubellites, citrine, tourmalines,
amethysts and even amber.
The fine jewellery market has responded to the recession and the growing
popularity of costume jewellery with renewed creativity. It is slowly
de-mystifying, conscious of providing value and service for a new, canny
clientele and yet preserving all the artistry, romance and magic of the
noble art of the jeweller.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: BES deals sprout - Take advice
before you invest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALS concerning arranged-exit business expansion scheme continue to
mushroom amid a proliferation of trading company issues.
PAYE investors should note when BES 3 tax relief certificates will be sent
out. If these are sent much beyond mid-February next year, there is unlikely
to be enough time to get a tax coding change which may result in a lower
projected return.
The following are the latest releases - but there are many good schemes
still available, so it is well worth taking advice before making an
investment.
Sponsors Close Brothers and Save &amp; Prosper have launched a second issue of
BESSA Oxbridge after the first issue was fully subscribed at Pounds 41m.
There are two choices. The fixed exit price is 121p, equivalent to a return
of 13.5 per cent for higher rate taxpayers.
Alternatively investors can opt for a fixed return of 60p plus 2.5p for
every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE 100 index, capped at a 36 per cent
increase. There are lock-ins at increases of 24 per cent and 36 per cent.
Both options are fully cash backed. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
The Tweed Premier Return Companies is sponsored by the British Linen bank
with a Bank of Scotland guarantee to pay a fixed return of 122p after five
years for every Pounds 1 invested. The company will buy residential
properties from the Bank of Scotland for assured tenancy lets.
The scheme is recommended by BES analysts, Allenbridge Group which are
publishers of Best BES investment, and by BESt Investment for its low risk
and good return. Since BES 3 certificates will not be available until the
end of April, returns will be higher for Schedule D taxpayers than for those
on PAYE, according to BESt Investment .
The Cavendish CHG Scheme sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson offers a
cash-backed fixed return of 121p. The company will buy up residential
properties from Community Hospitals plc, a quoted company, which will form
part of CH's nursing home expansion. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
BESt Investment says the relatively high minimum subscription of Pounds 1.6m
raises the risk of the scheme.
Image III sponsored by IM Group, which specialises in property and car
distribution, is offering a fixed return of 123p after five years for every
Pounds 1 invested, equating to 14.5 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The
return assumes that the investor paid 99p a share before December 10. IM
Group is providing the cash backing but, according to BESt Investment,
'unlike previous IMAGE issues, there is no Bank of America guarantee and
there are accordingly better returns available elsewhere.'
Queens College Tenancies and Capital Reversions are both sponsored by
Capital Ventures. The first is to raise money for the Cambridge College.
Investors are being offered 75p after five years plus 2.1p for every 1 per
cent increase in the FT-SE 100 with a lock-in at 25 per cent growth in the
index. Capital Reversions is a residential property investment which is
already trading. The size of returns on this and other commercial property
ventures depend on the degree to which the property market recovers in five
years time.
The London Opportunity Fund has been buying up undervalued properties in the
London area for letting as assured tenancies. It is seeking to raise up to
Pounds 4.8m and costs have been contained to 3.5 per cent of the amount
raised if the maximum is reached. BESt Investment describes it as 'a lower
cost offering with reasonable dilution.'
Raptor will buy up unmodernised London properties for refurbishment and
letting as assured tenancies. Best BES Investment says this is a low cost
issue but in a market which offers lots of choice.
Trading ventures include Bloomsbury Films which aims to produce
'commercially viable films structured to return monies to investors before
cast and crew are paid their deferred fees.' Bruce Sherman, the chairman,
was producer of Henry V and the directors include Christopher Parkinson of
city law firm Gouldens, which has raised BES money for Leon the Pig Farmer
and Staggered.
Johnson Fry is sponsoring Criterion Productions to raise up to Pounds
750,000 to stage productions usually at the Criterion theatre in London's
Piccadilly Circus. Another famous West End name, the L'Escargot restaurant
in Greek street is launching a BES comprising two companies, one of which
aims to raise money to expand the existing restaurant and to open a second
L'Escargot in Kensington or Chelsea, while the other company seeks to
acquire flats to rent to restaurant employees.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Offshore bond funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFSHORE bond funds pay income gross which is an attraction for
non-taxpayers. The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds recognised
by the Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the
financial services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year
performance record.
Figures have been taken from Hardwick Stafford Wright and show the top 10
performing SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector.
They are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single
price but add an initial charge. If all funds were quoted on an offer-to-bid
price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage.
Investors seeking income should not base their choice entirely on the size
of the yield, since a bond fund can achieve a high yield at the expense of
capital. Some offshore funds, such as that of Barclays, charge their annual
management fee to capital rather than income in order to maintain the
relatively high yield.
The standard practice onshore is to charge the fee against income otherwise
the investor will suffer an erosion of his capital growth. However, last
month Foster &amp; Braithwaite found a loophole in the regulations which allowed
them to launch an onshore unit trust which deducts the charge from capital
rather than income. The SIB is seeking to close the loophole.
The Association of Unit Trusts says that investors should be given a choice.
Those who prefer high yields to capital growth benefit from charges made
against capital. The association has called for full disclosure of the way
in which the charge is deducted.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A problem with banks - Bethan Hutton
finds out why foreigners dislike British banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN foreigners working in Britain swap stories of their experiences, one of
the commonest gripes is not the weather, or the food, or even the beer, but
British high street banks.
It seems that every expatriate has a horror story about the length of time
and number of pieces of paper needed to open a bank account in the UK, or
was deeply insulted by being put on a few months' 'probation' before being
granted a Pounds 50 cheque guarantee card, when any 18-year-old embarking on
a degree is showered with offers of plastic cards and overdraft facilities.
One Belgian banker, now working in the UK, complains that opening an account
in London was more time-consuming and bureaucratic than in Belgium, Germany,
the US, Argentina, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
'In New York, when you open a bank account you may have to queue up for half
an hour, but you walk out with a temporary cheque book and everything,' he
says. 'Here, it takes forever and a day to get a cheque book.
'You have to give them copies of your passport, employment details, they
want to have a letter from your lawyer, from your accountant, they want to
see bank statements from where you have banked before . . . in no other
country has anyone ever asked me for all that.'
Most banks say they treat all applicants the same, whatever their
nationality, but the fact is that the application process is designed for
long-term UK residents. The biggest stumbling block is the banks'
requirement for a permanent address before an account can be opened. Few
overseas nationals arrive with permanent accommodation arranged - most have
to spend a period staying in a hotel or with friends - but before moving
into a longer-term home, letting agencies demand deposits, advance rent and
sometimes even a direct-debit mandate for the rent, all of which require
banking facilities.
One European banker who moved to London earlier this year found that
Barclays would not open an account for her until she had a permanent
address, but she needed a bank account to avoid paying a hefty deposit on a
flat in cash. The problem was solved after the intervention of her employer.
One American bank has resorted to arranging private banking facilities for
non-UK employees at its London office. Employees of smaller or less
international companies have a tougher time.
Carolyn Chao, a New Yorker working in music publishing, tried to open a
building society current account, but was turned down after several weeks of
effort, in spite of calling in her boss for help. She finally managed to
open an account with Abbey National, the bank, but still does not have full
current-account facilities. Abbey National says its policy is to give
current accounts only to UK residents, usually with UK passports.
The British fondness for overdrafts means that an application to open a bank
account is effectively treated as an application for credit, even if all the
customer wants is a simple account with cash and cheque facilities.
Jeannie Zakharov, a subeditor with FT Information Services, arrived from
Australia in 1990, and wanted an account in which to deposit her pay cheques
and withdraw cash. She did not ask for a cheque card, overdraft facility or
any other kind of credit. It took NatWest two months to open the account,
and another three months to grant a cash card. For the first two months,
even though she accumulated cheques worth over Pounds 2,000, she had to rely
on money transferred from Australia.
Banks are increasingly using credit scoring to judge applicants. Anyone
newly arrived, with a new job, is at a distinct disadvantage, particularly
since they will also lack a track record of paid-back loans and well-managed
credit cards in the UK.
As mitigation for the length of time spent checking new customers'
credentials, banks also point to new anti-money laundering rules, which
oblige them to be wary of large cash deposits or transfers. This makes life
more difficult for those wanting to open an account, move money from their
home bank accounts and gain immediate access to it.
Overseas nationals are possibly less attractive customers by banks' normal
standards. Foreigners working in the UK may leave the country after a few
years, closing their accounts. They may also be less likely to buy insurance
and investment products, a greater source of profit for many banks than
their core personal banking services.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (19): Not so obscure objects of desire -
Watches

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of
all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along
the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to
Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which
is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth.
WATCHES come in all shades of geometry - round, oval, square, oblong, even
the Daliesque squashed ellipse of the Cartier 'crash' watch. Yet at the
250-year-old company of Blancpain, watches have always been round.
The shape is the most obvious statement of Blancpain's claim to be perhaps
the most traditional of all the great Swiss watch makers. Its timepieces are
also always mechanical. 'Quartz' is a word never heard at their workshop in
the Jura mountains.
All this makes a Blancpain essential for the self-assured businessman who
abhors designer labels but whose discreet brand of anonymity marks him out
as surely as a screaming logo.
But even the greatest traditionalist must reconcile himself to modern
technology in the interest of accuracy. Even Blancpain's longest-serving
craftsmen acquaint themselves with the latest methods and materials. A small
factory makes, from the most high-tech materials, components for what passes
at Blancpain as a mass-produced model - although even this is
hand-assembled.
This watch, costing more than Pounds 2,000, makes up most of the tiny annual
output of 7,000 watches a year, but it is the company's recent
mould-breaking horological masterpieces that have established its reputation
and attracted clients such as former King Constantine of Greece.
Blancpain's latest venture may seem out of character but it allies craft and
tradition to a clever marketing ploy. The company has revived the lost art
of the erotic watch. An erotic design is engraved or enamelled, with the
mechanics for the - er - moving parts housed in the slim case with the watch
movement.
All this activity takes place on the watch's reverse. The face it presents
to the world is Blancpain's usual discreet roundel.

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of
all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along
the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to
Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which
is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth.
Range Rover became a cult car by pure chance. In the 1990s it is the smart
car beautiful people everywhere like to be seen in. But it started life as
something quite different. Land Rover had been building rough, tough four
wheel drives since the late 1940s. British farmers were big customers. Land
Rover reckoned that there might be a market for a car a farmer could use on
the land all day and then take his wife out in that night. So in 1970, Range
Rover appeared as the ultimate dual-purpose car.
Only a group of men could have thought that one up. Picture the scene.
Farmer proposes an evening out with dinner and theatre. Wife puts on her new
frock and high heels. Farmer brings mud-plastered Range Rover, reeking of
cow manure, to front door. Wife takes one look and declares: 'If you think
I'm getting into that disgustingly filthy thing in these clothes, you must
be mad. Get the Jaguar - now]'
Like the US cavalry, the horsey set rode to the rescue. Accustomed to
hauling hunters behind primitive Land Rovers, they eyed the Range Rover
approvingly. With a big V8 engine and full-time four-wheel drive it was
perfect for towing a two-horse trailer on the road to meets or across fields
at point-to-points.
Then a new kind of customer appeared. They did not own chunks of Wiltshire,
but hoped to give the impression that they did. Reluctantly at first Land
Rover offered them Range Rovers with power steering, four doors instead of
only two, automatic transmission and diesel engines. Out went plastic seats
and rubber mats; in came Connolly hide and Wilton carpet. Land Rover
concedes that at least nine Range Rover owners in 10 never dirty the tyres
by driving off tarmac, and that the severest obstacle most climb is a high
curb outside a Chelsea restaurant.

Trunks

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of
all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along
the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to
Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which

NOBODY buys a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk for sensible reasons. If all you
are looking for is something to keep your belongings safe and dry, then
there are a hundred cheaper, less exalted solutions. No, those who buy a
steamer trunk are after more than a practical solution to luggage dilemmas:
they are yearning for the golden age of the travelling classes, the years of
the transatlantic steamers and the early days of motoring, when travellers
were embarking on feats of derring-do.
With your steamer trunk you, too, could be heading for Arabian deserts or
the African bush, for with the trunk comes the invisible aura of all those
long-gone travellers who would never have set off without one - the Empress
Eugenie with her voluminous crinolines (they emerged without the tiniest
crease) and the Congo explorer Savorgnan de Brazza for whom Vuitton made a
trunk that opened into a bed.
The steamer trunk was introduced in 1858 when Louis Vuitton saw the way
travel was heading. Stage-coaches were doomed. Steamers and railways were
the coming thing. Instead of the dome-shaped, cumbersome trunks so
appropriate for stage-coaches, flat-topped trunks that could be stacked on
top of each other would be much more practical.
They are still made by hand. Each takes up to 60 hours; the inside is lined
with padded cotton; craftsmen tap in the nails one by one; and all have a
five-lever pick-proof brass lock invented by Vuitton in 1896. Today, even at
between Pounds 4,200 and Pounds 13,000 a time they are as sought-after as
ever. They don't always find their way on to aeroplanes or trains but sit
happily at home, chic repositories of books and drinks - and dreams.

Cult objects

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of
all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along
the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to
Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which
is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth.
REAL CULT objects can be identified by their stamina. Not for them the
sudden onset of instant fame and then the humiliating relegation to the
dusty back shelves. They have staying power. These are the names and the
labels that can be spotted across a crowded room, that draw their owners
into a sense of kinship with each other; thus, the Gucci loafer.
Ever since it was introduced in 1960 the distinctive loafer with the snaffle
on the front has been snapped up by modish dressers, by Sloane Rangers, by
Voguettes, and by those who simply love a really comfortable shoe. All
through the 1960s it sold as if it were one of life's great essentials. Even
in the nightmare years when the Gucci logo became so devalued that its sales
figures went into free fall the loafer sailed serenely on.
For, as with all objects that leap from mere success to cult object, behind
the hype there lay genuine quality. Anybody who has ever slipped on one of
those soft, featherlight mocassins recognises that here is the perfect
all-purpose luxury shoe. It looks good with anything from Levis to sleek
grey flannels or a pinstripe suit.
Even Dawn Mello, called in by Gucci to restore its tarnished name, felt
little need to tamper with the loafer. Handbags were scaled up and down,
gilded Gs taken off everything from belts to luggage, but she made sure that
the classic loafer was still available in all its original simplicity. She
brought back hand-stitching, insisted on quality, toned down the gilt of the
snaffle but the basic mocassin has changed little.
The loafer comes in soft novocalf, black, dark brown or larice (tan to you).
It costs Pounds 195 for the men's version, at Pounds 170 for women. Those
who are prepared to shell out for it say it is worth every penny. Those who
cannot are busy buying up the copies that are to be found in every high
street.

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of

THE Hermes Kelly bag was, well, just another bag until the day in 1956 when
Grace Kelly, the Hollywood movie star who had just become a Crown Princess
of Monaco, appeared on the cover of Life magazine with her handbag placed
firmly over her stomach to hide her pregnancy.
Hermes received so many orders that it rechristened the bag the Kelly, in
honour of its royal patron. The Kelly has been a classic ever since. Year
after year thousands of women spend anything from Pounds 1,970 for a basic
bag, to Pounds 33,000 for a Kelly with a few little extras, such as a solid
gold and diamond encrusted clasp. Why, oh why, do they do it?
To its devotees the Kelly is much more than just any old status symbol: it
is a compelling combination of style and substance. Everything about the
Kelly says that it is elegant and expensive but also practical.
A dinky little Chanel bag might be fine for the babes who only need a couple
of charge cards and a change of make-up to get them through the day. But the
Kelly is a bag for the woman of purpose: big enough to cram in A4 papers and
bulky enough to thwack any mugger.
The Kelly has its roots in the 1930s when Emile Hermes designed a daintier
version of one of his best-selling saddle bags. The Kelly of today is the
product of 15 to 20 hours of handiwork by the craftsmen at Hermes'
headquarters in Paris.
Princess Caroline, once the bump that her mother covered with a Hermes
handbag, now carries a Kelly of her own.

Exclusive Clubs

There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of
all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along
the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to
Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which
is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth.
A CLUBBABLE man regards his tie as a badge of recognition and exclusiveness
but there is one club that remains exclusive even though anyone can join.
This is the fraternity of Hermes tie wearers. The phrase 'it takes one to
know one' might have been invented for the owner of this sumptuous and
ultimately frivolous strip of silk. In spite of the company's huge
repertoire of designs and the plethora of similar ties from lesser
competitors, the Hermes wearer always says he can instantly tell another
from the same stable.
What he really means is that he is able to spot another individual who can
justify spending a minimum of Pounds 59 on a piece of neckwear. But he will
wax lyrical about the wittiness of the designs, the depth of colour and
quality of silk, which sets the Hermes tie above its peers.
Most ties have about four colours; the Hermes tie contains up to eight, and
far more on scarf-print designs which correspondingly cost Pounds 78. Each
shade must be printed on a separate screen. Finishing is done by hand,
stitched with one unbroken thread of special quality silk, to allow maximum
strength and flexibility for the man who likes to pull his knot tight.
Turning and pressing is a skilled job so the tie lies perfectly flat; a
twist fails quality control.
Ask Hermes owners what it is that makes their ties so special and the
surprising answer is the confidence they give. Andrew Wiles, press and
public relations director at Harrods, could choose from 60 other brands in
the store but picks Hermes. 'I bought my first one - a scarf-print - in the
1980s because it was so different from anything else then available. There
had been nothing like it since kipper ties but this was so much more
tasteful.'

Transactions

<TEXT>
THREE MEMBERS of the board of Tibbet &amp; Britten, including Sidney Gould, the
vice chairman, sold a total of 258,000 shares at 730p.
The shares have been trading between 670p and 760p since January of this
year and one of the non-executive directors sold 50,000 shares at 750p in
June. Interim results were announced in September and the chairman expected
a better year once the recovery in the clothing and west European motor
sectors came through. Each director retains a sizeable number of shares.
At Alexanders Holdings, which holds Ford dealerships in the UK, Aleksandra
Clayton, the chairwoman, bought 4,870,000 shares from T Cowie. This means
that T Cowie no longer has a stake and Clayton's holding has been increased
to 68 per cent.
In July we noted a large purchase at 25.5p by Paul Kelly in Gardiner Group,
the surveillance system company. Since, the shares have risen to 32p but
have fallen slightly and Jeff Caplan has bought 130,000 shares at 25.5p.
Final results are not due until March 1994. The forecast is for growth in
excess of 70 per cent.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Pensions - knowing the value /
Debbie Harrison considers a survey of personal pension providers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH more than 100 providers of personal pensions, each offering a plethora
of funds, it can appear virtually impossible to judge which offers best
value for money. Yet in one of the most rigorous surveys published to date
on these products, out of 193 funds, just three emerged with impeccable
credentials.
National Mutual, Standard Life and Sun Life proved their mettle in terms of
strong, consistent performance combined with a low, flexible charging
structure. Two other funds, offered by Rothschild Asset Management and
Scottish Widows, were commended. The rest failed on one or more important
criteria.
The survey, published by the private client department of consulting
actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, is only concerned with unit linked policies -
that is, policies where the unit price is directly linked to the value of
the underlying investments. Managed unit-linked funds, which invest in all
of the main sectors, were selected as the best measure of the overall skill
of the provider's investment team.
The analysis assumed that no commission was paid by the provider, since this
is how Bacon &amp; Woodrow conducts business. Where commission would have been
paid Bacon &amp; Woodrow negotiated enhanced terms with the provider, so that
more money is invested on the client's behalf.
The screening was conducted in two stages. Stage one analysed investment
performance while stage two considered product features and charges.
Commenting on performance, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the partnership
pensions section of Bacon &amp; Woodrow's private client department and author
of the report, said: 'The use of past performance statistics in conjunction
with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved, an
assessment of the current investment style of a management team and a
knowledge of whether the individuals responsible for past performance are
still in place, is probably the best guide to future performance.
'The objective of this stage of our analysis is to identify those funds
which have achieved consistent good past performance with low volatility.'
Out of an initial 193 funds listed in the performance statistics provided by
FINSTAT, only 153 had five year track records. The survey examined
'percentile' scores where the best performing fund in each quarter scored
100 points and the worst one point.
Test 1 was relatively straightforward and simply excluded those funds whose
average percentile score over the period of analysis was 50 or less. Only 78
funds passed.
Tests 2, 3 and 4 which screened for high performance and low volatility,
left just 22 funds in the running after casualties. At this stage 40 extra
funds which had three or four year track records were also screened. Only
Gartmore's Long Term Balanced Fund passed and this was added to the
contestants for stage two.
The 16 providers with a total of 23 funds shortlisted on performance
criteria for stage two were: Albany Life (Multiple Investment); Cannon
Lincoln (Managed S3); Clerical Medical (Mixed, GMPP Mixed, Fidelity FRP
Mixed); Commercial Union (Prime Managed); Friends Provident (UK Provident
Managed); Gartmore (Long Term Balanced); London &amp; Manchester (Balanced,
Flexible); National Mutual Life (Managed); NM Life (CCM Vanguard); Norwich
Union (Managed, Mixed ULP, Mixed RP); NPI (Managed); Pearl (ULP Managed S1,
ULP Managed S2); Prolific (Balanced Growth); Standard Life (Managed, Stock
Exchange Managed); Sun Life (Managed); and TSB (Managed).
Funds under Pounds 20m were then excluded. 'Clients should invest in funds
that have the prospect of a realistic degree of diversification and of
remaining financially viable without substantial increases in management
fees,' Warwick-Thompson said.
Other criteria included the requirement that the provider must deal via
independent advisers and must be prepared to offer nil commission terms.
Policies that imposed penalties on early retirement or on transfer to
another provider were dropped on grounds of inflexibility.
'Our concern is that clients should be able to take a transfer at any time
or retire without penalty,' Warwick-Thompson explained.
On these criteria the following funds were cut: Cannon Lincoln, Clerical
Medical (all three funds), Friends Provident, London &amp; Manchester
(Balanced), Norwich Union (Mixed RP and Mixed ULP), NPI, Pearl (both funds)
and TSB.
The remaining ten funds were scrutinised on the basis of their charging
structures. The 'reduction in premium' (RIP) analysis reveals on a
consistent basis how much of each premium is absorbed in providers' charges
and therefore not invested on behalf of the policyholder.
The only three 'Category 1' providers to clear this hurdle were National
Mutual Life, Standard Life and Sun Life. Each was checked for financial
stability and administration facilities and was given a clean bill of
health. National Mutual and Standard Life also received top marks in last
year's survey. In Category 2 were Rothschild Asset Management and Scottish
Widows, two of last year's top providers.
The rest of the funds will not be recommended by Bacon &amp; Woodrow for the
next 12 months. Also out of favour are with-profit funds, which face serious
investment problems following over-investment in property, and fixed
interest products coupled with excessive bonus payouts between the mid-1980s
and 1992.
However, although the survey recommends equity based managed unit-linked
funds for new contributions, existing conventional with-profits policies
generally should be left undisturbed, it states.
Clearly, with top providers changing almost on a yearly basis, it is vital
to retain the flexibility to take advantage of current best advice. To keep
control of the timing and the level of contributions it is wise to opt for a
series of one-off single premium policies. If the performance of your chosen
fund begins to lag, it is essential to be able to switch to another provider
without penalty.
However, Warwick-Thompson stressed that the regular premium policies
recommended in the survey would not penalise on switching or early
retirement because of the stringent terms arranged by his firm. This is a
vital point to check with your adviser before committing yourself to a
contract.
Where normal terms are arranged and your adviser receives full commission
the results would be very different. For a high earner contributing Pounds
15,000 per annum to a personal pension from age 36 to retirement,
Warwick-Thompson calculated that total commission payable over the term of
the policy expressed in 1993 money terms would be Pounds 48,589 and the
pension policy at age 60 would be worth Pounds 2,369,440.
On a fee basis the cost of the initial consultation and setting up the
policy on a nil-commission basis would be about Pounds 900 plus VAT and the
annual fee for administering contributions would be about Pounds 120 plus
VAT in 1993 money terms.
Total fees over the term, allowing for inflation and an 'opportunity cost'
to offset the loss of investment return on the amount paid in fees, would be
Pounds 6,724 and the pension fund at age 60 would be worth Pounds 2,626,029
 -a difference of more than Pounds 256,000.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (12): Gifts for the county set - Jonathan
Young's presents for the huntin', shootin', fishin' fraternity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRY people are a tough lot. Ask them to drive a three-ton horse-box,
round up a dozen loose bullocks or help with a difficult lambing and they
will volunteer without blinking.
Shopping, and city traffic, is another matter. Most blanch at the very
thought. Fortunately, there is no need for soulless pavement-pounding.
Country sportsmen have an excellent choice of kit, most of which is
available through mail-order.
This is just as well, because those who hunt, shoot or fish, need kit -
acres of it. Enough to fill tack-rooms, gun-rooms and rod-rooms.
Hand-made riding boots are the ultimate present for anyone horsy but bought
from London's West End they cost the equivalent of a half-decent racehorse.
Dennis Davies from Gwent will make a hand-made, fitted pair for just Pounds
420 (tel: 0495-313045). Alternatively, ring Calcutt's, which specialises in
quality second-hand riding kit (0962-760210). The company has a wide range
of butcher and top-boots, starting from Pounds 120 and Pounds 200, as well
as red and black hunting coats, breeches and silk toppers for those who
hanker to cut a dash at the Boxing Day meet.
A rash of 'Cobber clobber' followed in the steps of the hit film Crocodile
Dundee, and the Australian stockman's waxproof coat has become ubiquitous.
Far more stylish are the traditional rubberised fawn riding mackintoshes,
Pounds 145 from Exeter Saddlers, 0392-71141).
However, for all aspiring Perditas and Ruperts, nothing can match polo's
glamour. A string of polo ponies may be an over-ambitious Christmas gift -
unless your beloved is in the Kerry Packer league - but you can start
stick-and-balling at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club for just Pounds
52 for a lesson (0344-890060).
Ask a fisherman why he spends hundreds on his annual Scottish salmon lottery
(sorry, holiday) and he will smilingly reply that there is more to fishing
than catching fish. What he will not admit is that all fishermen are tackle
junkies. Farlow's of Pall Mall (071-839-2423) is their London Mecca,
stocking everything from exquisite gold fly-reel cuff links (Pounds 450) to
monstrous steel reels for 1,000lb marlin (Pounds 475). But beware. Rods and
reels are highly personal and it is easy to gaff.
Orvis UK (0264-781212) stocks an intriguing selection of fishing
accessories, from soft leather salmon fly wallets (Pounds 18) to a leaded
staghorn priest for administering the last rites (Pounds 12). Their clothing
range is equally extensive, with a set of silk longjohns and vest at Pounds
56.
More peculiar, but fun, are the 'Wet Gun Dog' after-shave (Pounds 12.50) and
the magnificent Cracker Thrower 'which propels two Ritz crackers at amazing
speeds, providing a fabulous challenge for even the best shot' (Pounds 18).
It is hard to find many other cheaper items for keen shots. Shooting kit is
restricted, but expensive. Those who are still smarting after Lloyd's
insurance losses might jib at the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 35,000 now asked
for a Purdey or Holland &amp; Holland shotgun, though they are the best that
money can buy.
For those who were in a bad syndicate the hand-knitted shooting stockings
with the knitted legend 'Damn Lloyd's' might bring some comfort at Pounds
27.50, from Almost Unwearoutable Socks, 04346-32283. A similar pair,
emblazoned 'Bang] Bang]' on one leg and 'Bugger]' on the other, might
persuade the recipient to seek a series of shooting lessons. Holland &amp;
Holland and the Royal Berkshire run courses of six one-hour lessons for
Pounds 275 and Pounds 250 respectively.
It is generally bad form to look anything other than drab at a shoot, the
only exception being the hat. The old school still swear by Lock's, though
there is strong minority following for Herbert Johnson's and Bates, all of
St James's, London. Whichever is favoured, always buy one two sizes too
large - it will fit perfectly after the first downpour.
Hats for women are more tricky. Unless you want to look like a stable lad
ignore caps and buy a proper weather-proof hat which is warm and, most
important, keeps your face covered. (A beaming visage has ruined more grouse
drives than the average eagle.) Lock's has brought out a new ladies' range
which the company will trim with feathers from your own pheasant (Pounds
100). These are gorgeous enough for Ascot but pretty bright for the field.
Stylish and more subdued are the ladies' deer-stalkers from the Asprey Gun
Room (Pounds 39, 071-493 6767).
The once-ubiquitous waxproof coat is still popular, but being rapidly
replaced in all country sports by the new generation of Ventile and Gore-Tex
jackets. Warm, waterproof and breathing, this new generation of outdoor
coats include the no-nonsense Barbour Ventile (Pounds 295) and Musto
Highland (Pounds 270). Both will survive practically anything  - even massed
labradors in the shoot trailer - and are machine-washable.
The real hit in the shooting world, however, is the new generation of
Gore-Tex-lined tweed shooting jackets. Walter Norton &amp; Sons of Savile Row
produces a splendid affair for Pounds 495 off the peg or Pounds 680 bespoke
(071-437 0829).
If you cannot travel to London, Charles Gale will measure you at home or at
the office; his bespoke waterproof tweed jacket, cuffs trimmed with leather,
is Pounds 395 (0329-237698).
All country people are obsessed with boots. Green wellies are an endangered
species, except on Fulham Road. Real credibility is conveyed by black,
steel-toed milking-parlour gum boots, preferably composed from different
pairs. Far warmer, though, are the leather-lined Chameau gum boots, which
are seen on all the best ploughs, even though they cost Pounds 107 a pair.
The High Church old school eschews even these and sticks to iron-shod hill
shoes from Hogg's of Fife (0337-860202) - just Pounds 80, but you could
expect them to survive you.
No matter how wrapped up, clothing alone will not warm the inner spirit.
William Powell (021-643 0689) stocks a prodigious array of hipflasks. The
8oz stainless steel flask is excellent value at Pounds 15.95 but for the
steadfast sloe-ginners the 15oz solid silver version is a must (Pounds 625).
Powell also sells sets of four nesting stainless beakers, in a leather case,
for Pounds 21.95.
Sporting households tend to be manic, only gathering for Christmas Day, the
one occasion in the year when no one hunts, shoots or fishes. On Boxing Day
they will scatter, but hopefully carrying something lasting to remember you
by - other than a hangover.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (13): Simplicity - the stamp of modern
opulence / Alice Rawsthorn considers the aesthetic of three chic new
designers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE sumptuous 18th century square of Place Vendome is the historic heart of
the Paris luxury trade. It is here that Madonna parks her white stretch
limousine when she checks into the Ritz and where Arab princes slip into
Boucheron to buy baubles for their mistresses.
A glance through the arched entrance to 16 Place Vendome reveals a different
brand of luxury. An old stable in the courtyard has been turned into a
modern building with white walls and an industrial floor to house the
European headquarters of Comme des Garcons, the fashion and furniture
business owned by Rei Kawakubo, doyenne of avant garde design.
Kawakubo's designs conform to the conventional definition of luxury by being
made from the very best materials, finished to the highest specifications
and sold at achingly expensive prices. Yet where most luxurious products are
steeped in nostalgia, her work, like that of other modernist designers such
as Jasper Morrison and Marc Newson, is contemporary in terms of how it looks
and the way it is made.
Nostalgia looms large in the luxury trade as do other sepia-tinted terms
such as 'tradition' and 'authenticity'. Most luxury companies are at pains
to remind clients that they have been around for centuries. Anyone who buys
an Hermes silk scarf or a piece of Louis Vuitton luggage is made aware that
it carries the legacy of years of craftsmanship and an aura of privilege.
The horses trotting across an Hermes scarf reassure the consumer that, by
spending Pounds 135 on a silk square, they are tapping into a tradition
dating back to 1837 when Emile Hermes made saddles for the swankiest stables
in Paris. The traveller splurging Pounds 13,860 on a Stokowski trunk from
Vuitton knows that it has been made by hand in virtually the same way as
when Leopold Stokowski, the conductor, ordered the original 50 years ago.
The affluent shoppers at Hermes and Vuitton are the 1990s' counterparts of
the nouveau riche 19th century industrialists - described by Corelli
Barnett, the historian - who celebrated their new found wealth by copying
the lifestyles of the landed gentry. Part of the attraction of an Hermes
scarf or Vuitton bag is that they are instantly identifiable as expensive
because of their association with an aristocratic past.
Modern luxury has the appeal of being unequivocally rooted in the present.
Prada bags, made from fabric developed for the aerospace industry, have a
clean, contemporary look that could only come from the latest technology.
The Pleats Please collection of intricately pleated silks developed by a
Japanese laboratory for Issey Miyake also have a modern air.
Other designers achieve a contemporary effect through the aesthetics of
their work. The Lockheed Lounge, designed by Marc Newson, an Australian
working in Paris, is an abstract slither of shiny aluminium which was
originally inspired by a 19th century chaise longue. The Lockheed Lounge has
the same opulent shape as the original chaise and, having been made in a
limited edition of 10, a similar whiff of exclusiveness.
There the resemblance ends. The Lockheed Lounge is unmistakably modern in
style: so much so that Madonna ordered one for her Rain video. But it is
made by hand through a laborious process of hammering aluminium panels on to
a mould. Marc Newson is now working on a sleeker, streamlined series of
aluminium furniture, the Event Horizon table and Orgone chair, which are
also hand-made by a special technique first used to make Aston Martin sports
cars. 'I liked the idea of making something by hand that was so complex it
looked as though it must have been manufactured by machine,' he says.
Whereas Newson's furniture is unashamedly luxuriant, the Progetto Oggetto
range of household objects belongs to the restrained school of modern
design. Progetto Oggetto is a collection of everyday products - everything
from a first aid box, to clothes hangers and ash trays - commissioned from
contemporary designers by Cappellini, the Italian furniture company.
The aim of the range, according to Jasper Morrison, the London-based
furniture designer who helped compile it, was that the designers should
'reinterpret forgotten products' and that their designs should have 'a
rational quality so that the function is obvious'.
The result is a collection of subtle objects. The first aid box by Thomas
Eriksson is made of lacquered steel in the shape of a red cross. Andreas
Brandolini has designed a cunning set of library steps that doubles as a
book basket. Each product is meticulously made and extremely expensive:
Pounds 260.85 for the first aid box and Pounds 434.28 for the steps. Yet
Progetto Oggetto also marks a new departure for the luxury industry by
devising thoughtfully designed, highly priced products that are practical,
rather than decorative.
Comme des Garcons' version of modern opulence has the same iconoclastic
stamp. The recurrent themes in Rei Kawakubo's designs are minimal styling
and technological innovation. The discoloured dresses in her current
collection are typical. They are made from patchworks of faded paisley
fabric from which the dye has been extracted, sometimes so strongly that the
original pattern is little more than a smudge.
The ethereal effect is the result of the latest textile technology.
Kawakubo, who for years has worked mainly in black, says that she wanted to
create a completely new colour. Hiroshi Matsushita, the Japanese textile
technologist with whom she has worked throughout her career, developed a
special process to remove dye without damaging the fabric.
The discoloured dresses, with their faded fabric and ragged edges, could
scarcely look less like conventional status symbols. Crumpled or not, there
is a market for Rei Kawakubo's vision of modern opulence. Her dresses went
on sale earlier this autumn at the Comme des Garcons shop in London and sold
out.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Warning to fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUDULENT insurance claims will soon run a greater risk of being detected,
as UK insurance companies use computer registers to share information on
insurance claims and applicants.
Insurers say that fraudulent claims have more than doubled in the past four
years. Fraud now costs insurance companies and their honest policyholders
Pounds 400m a year. Up to 10 per cent of claims are thought to be bogus.
The new system, called Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, or CLUE UK,
is based on an American prototype. The first register will cover household
buildings and contents insurance and will soon be followed by motor and
travel insurance.
The registers will have access to three years' information, allowing
insurers to check on a new applicant's previous claims history and to
cross-check when claims are made to prevent multiple claims for the same
loss under different policies.
CLUE should make it easier to detect cases such as the Gloucestershire
businessman who was burgled three times, and each time claimed under two
different policies, making a profit.
He was prosecuted, and sentenced to community service as well as paying
compensation and costs.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: How to find forgotten investments -
Are you worth a fortune? / Tracking lost riches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAOTIC home filing is a common failing. Investors who salt away money in
shares, trusts or building societies may lose vital documents at the bottom
of cupboards, or keep them in cardboard boxes. Years later, the papers are
rediscovered and the owners wonder whether they could be worth anything -
but finding out can be difficult.
Here is a guide to tracking down some of the most commonly forgotten
investments.
Insurance-related investments, for example investment bonds, and endowments.
Write to the last address you have for the insurer. If the company has
moved, appears to have gone bust or merged, you could try writing to the
Association of British Insurers, at 51 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ,
which has a register of company changes, and should be able to tell you who
is now responsible for the policy.
Many people have old insurance policies issued by friendly societies or
similar bodies. The Register of Friendly Societies has a telephone inquiry
service on 071-437-9992, or write to 15 Great Marlborough Street, London,
W1V 2AX.
Building society accounts. First try writing to the last address you have
for the society. Over the years, many societies have merged and may no
longer exist under the same name, or have moved headquarters.
If you write to the Building Societies Association, Consumer Affairs
Department, 3 Savile Row, London, W1X 1AF, with the details, they should be
able to track down which society took over the old business, or give you an
up-to-date address.
Investment trusts. The Association of Investment Trust Companies may help if
you can find no trace of the fund in which you invested, because it has
merged, changed names or been wound up. Write to the AITC at: Park House,
6th Floor, 16 Finsbury Circus, EC2M 7JJ.
Unit trusts. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has records
can help trace your unit trust investment through name changes and mergers.
Write to Autif at: 65 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6TD.
Company shares. If you discover an old share certificate, check first
whether the company's shares are still listed in the FT, then try writing to
the last registered address you have on the share certificate.
The next resort is the public library. Until 1989, the Stock Exchange
published an annual Register of Defunct and Other Companies which were no
longer listed, because of merger or collapse. Since 1989, a supplement to
the Stock Exchange Yearbook has updated this annually. Larger libraries
should have copies.
Companies House, official repository of company information, has an archive
search service for companies registered since 1844. It costs Pounds 15 per
company. For details, write to Nicola Lynch, Archive Search Service, Room
G16, Companies House, Cardiff, CF4 3UZ. Tel: 0222-380928.
If the company failed a long time ago, the share's only value may be as a
collector's item - see the information on scripophily, under bonds. Premium
bonds. Many people have a sneaking suspicion Ernie has forgotten their
holding. If you have moved home, or changed your name without letting
National Savings know, there could be an unclaimed prize waiting. Inform
National Savings of your changed details, either by returning your yellow
holder's card or sending in a special form obtainable from the post office,
and the department will run a check on outstanding winnings.
As at October this year, more than 200,000 prizes, adding up to Pounds
11.2m, remained unclaimed 18 months after they were drawn. Otherwise, you
could consult the list of all unclaimed prizes dating back to 1957, kept in
main post offices. National Savings warns that you would need 'a long wet
afternoon' to work your way through this bulky document. If a premium bond
holder has died, winnings from a draw up to a year after the date of death
can be claimed by the estate, with no time limit.
Bonds issued by countries. In the late 1980s there was a rush to check
drawers and files for old bond certificates, as Russia, China, and many
eastern block and Latin American countries agreed to redeem old bonds, often
dating back to the 1920s or earlier, as a pre-condition for raising new
money on the international bond markets. Bonds had to be submitted by fixed
deadlines for the holders to receive a portion of their face value. Most
countries have gone through this process and deadlines have passed. One
possible exception is the former East Germany.
If you have a bond from a country which you think has not yet come to an
arrangement, you could try writing to David Wooten, at the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, Nationality Treaty and Claims Department, Clive House,
Petty France, London, SW1 9HD.
If your bonds stand no chance of redemption, they could still be worth
something to collectors - known as scripophilists - who often buy the more
decorative and exotic bonds or shares to frame and hang on their walls.
There are specialist dealers and Phillips, the auction house, holds
quarterly sales. Rare certificates can fetch thousands of pounds. For
advice, write to the Bond and Share Department, Phillips, 101 New Bond
Street, London, WIY 0AS.
Pensions. If you worked for a company for a few years, even decades ago, you
might be entitled to a small pension. Or if you belonged to a personal
pension scheme, and lost track of your investment, the Pension Schemes
Registry, run by the Occupational Pensions Board, has a database of 170,000
occupational and personal schemes.
It offers a free tracing service if you provide as much information as
possible about the employer's/pension scheme's last known name and address.
The database goes back to the 1970s, but can often help with entitlements
dating back 40 years. The service's success rate is 90 per cent. Write to
the Pension Schemes Registry at: PO Box 1NN, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE99 1NN.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (11): My dear, you can smell the money -
Josephine Fairley monitors the Loughley-Cash family on a spending spree
after a big insurance payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ARAMINTA Loughley-Cash's mother had always instilled in her that every cloud
has a silver lining. 'Positively platinum - in this instance,' mused
Araminta, fingering the generous insurance cheque intended to replace every
last stick of inherited furniture, hideous ancestral portraits and demode
jewels which had so recently gone up in smoke.
Luckily, nobody had been hurt (although Lloyd's, it appeared from the number
of zeros on the end of cheque, had been somewhat singed). As it turned out,
Araminta and Harry Loughley-Cash had overnight become the envy of their
Kensington contemporaries, who rather yearned to throw off their Puffa
jackets, chuck out the chintz and have carte blanche to reinvent themselves
in the fashionably minimalist 1990s.
Araminta planned to begin in Bond Street, with her eldest daughter,
21-year-old Eloise, in tow. They would start, she vowed, with Gucci, where
Araminta had her eye on a chic half-moon shaped Mezzaluna shoulder-bag in
butter-soft black suede, before progressing on to Chanel.
Eloise, who usually shared her generation's nonchalance about timekeeping,
had grown positively punctual at the prospect of acquiring Chanel's newest
status timepiece: the square-faced, quilted-strap Mademoiselle. For her son
Caspar, Araminta had earmarked Tiffany's stainless-steel-strapped
Streamerica watch, with time zone windows enabling him to work out precisely
when to call his globetrotting friends. But in the time-keeping department,
10-year-old Celeste was easiest (not to mention cheapest): a Beauty &amp; The
Beast Disney special, which would have her contemporaries in the Lower Third
aching with envy.
How grateful Harry had been when Araminta had offered to re-equip their
life, and the empty modern Chelsea Harbour apartment they had rented.
Personally, after a life-time spent rearranging bibelots, Araminta would
have been happy with a Futon Company mattress on the floor, a Baccarat
crystal bud vase and a single rose (from Ken Turner), but she quite
understood that her family's comfort threshold soared way above her own.
Nevertheless, since they were indeed camping for the moment, what better
excuse to invest in Hermes 'Pippa' campaign wood-and-leather beds for the
family, with a portable folding writing desk for Harry? (And so practical,
later, for the occasional family safari to the Masai Mara). Who knows,
perhaps Harry might finally get round to writing that detective novel he had
always dreamed of? So, just in case, she treated her husband to Mont Blanc's
limited edition 'Agatha Christie' Meisterstuck, with its silver serpent
snaking up the shiny black cap.
Of all their losses, Araminta most lamented that of the crisp, crested
family sheets, but cheered up enormously on discovering that Thomas Goode
could have personalised Irish linen replacements for her in a week. She
could not resist the aptly-named Cocoon bed linen, at Harrods, either; how
recklessly extravagant (and a tad impractical) to have an all-silk duvet,
but frankly, Araminta had tired of hospital corners.
Harry, meanwhile, had been mainly despondent about his collection of hunting
and dog pictures, and that very afternoon had an appointment with Dover
Street dealer Richard Green, swiftly followed by Kensington Church Street's
Lucy Campbell, to peruse some equine replacements. This, Araminta divined,
could prove the source of some connubial conflict, since - having trawled
Cork Street - she rather fancied a complete change, something large and
splashily abstract from Waddington's, or some pencilled nudes from The Fine
Art Society in Bond Street.
Not for Harry, then, the total image overhaul Araminta had planned for
herself. Wardrobe-wise, it was to be pyjamas from Sulka, socks and boxers
from Dunhill and 24 soberly-striped Sea Island cotton shirts from Turnbull &amp;
Asser. As usual. She hoped he would like the positively daring paisley ties
from Etro that she had picked out. Harry, who knew what he liked and liked
what he knew, had wasted no time making a Savile Row appointment with
Huntsman for his suits and Gieves &amp; Hawkes for a blazer., Then he had hopped
in a cab to Farlow's in Pall Mall for a new fly-reel, picking up a
replacement Barbour on the way. 'Can't let a little hiccup like this get us
down,' chirped Harry, with the fighting spirit that had first attracted her,
over mah-jong, a quarter of a century before. All of which reminded Araminta
. . . 'New playing cards and bridge scoring books, from Smythson's,' she
scribbled, on the back of the insurance company's envelope.
Their 18-year-old son Caspar, presently studying for Oxbridge at Harrow and
rather more Gatsby-ish than his father, planned a weekend raid on Gianni
Versace and Emporio Armani (with a pit-stop at Cutler &amp; Gross for
sunglasses, having lately shocked his schoolmasters with his godfatherish
taste in clothes).
He had patiently informed his computer illiterate parents that to replace
his precious (now melted) stereo, he simply had to have an Apple Mac Quadra
computer with its own CD player. (Araminta was rather relieved to discover
that the 'turbo-mouse' he'd also specified wouldn't need a cage).
Meanwhile, Eloise, heavily influenced by the Superwaifs, was fantasising
about her autumn wardrobe, planned to the last detail: brown velvet
wide-legged pants from Ralph Lauren, a suede button-through waistcoat from
Miu Miu (the 'baby sister' line from top Italian accessories empire Prada)
and suede high-heeled clog boots by Manolo Blahnik.
At these, Araminta rolled her eyes in despair, although she was considerably
more cheered by the prospect of a splash-printed, cosy velvet scarf from
Georgina von Etzdorf and - to complete the Upper Crustie look - a pair of
Cartier's hippyish rimless Madison glasses.
Araminta consoled herself with the thought that Celeste, her youngest,
leaned sartorially more towards the sweetly smocked velvets on offer at The
White House and Patrizia Wigan, and was positively pining for a
velvet-collared cashmere overcoat, from Anthea Moore Ede.
Personally, Araminta had always yearned to indulge herself with couture, but
had rarely ventured further afield than dear old Jaeger. This, however,
seemed an unmissable opportunity to compromise with the clean lines of a
made-to-measure suit (or five) from Robinson Valentine, the design duo
responsible for Viscountess Linley's charming going-away outfit, currently
luring half of Kensington to cross the river to Wandsworth in quest of
perfect tailoring in velvet and satin-backed crepe.
She also lusted after an unstructured Armani jacket, a frock coat from
Georges Rech and, for evenings, a perennially stylish Saint Laurent
'smoking'.
Then on to Catherine Walker for serious after-dark wear, Janet Reger for her
new silk smalls (very smalls, she noted), and a swift, painless Pounds 200
on opaque and black lace Fogal tights. In her comfortably elegant Ferragamo
heels, Araminta was beginning to feel quite wicked, not at all a familiar
sensation in a mother-of-three no longer in the first (hot) flush of middle
age.
She hoped that Harry would look up from the cricket reports long enough to
notice, and nipped into Les Senteurs for a new fragrance, settling upon
Patricia de Nicolai's appropriately sinful-sounding Sacre Bleu.
Replacing the ghastly Victorian family jewels would of course be a piece of
cake. Besides, nobody wore tiaras any more. Araminta rather craved a simple
cabochon sapphire ring (to match her new navy suit) from Bulgari, a single
string of South Sea pearls seen in Garrard's window and a stunning hematite
choker from Annabel Jones (where she could not resist indulging Harry with a
pair of bee-shaped cufflinks). This, Araminta mused, sipping a pit-stop
capuccino at The Berkeley, was proving rather a whizz.
When it came to shopping for their new home - so chic to rent, she thought,
now that Princess Anne's doing it - Celeste came along to 'help', although
it was not long before Araminta gave up struggling to divert her attention
away from her Nintendo Gameboy, all the rage in the Lower Third.
To Wedgwood for china - the all-white, basket-effect Nantucket dinner
service so restfully understated - and Asprey's, for crystal and cut glass.
She had a brief pang about the loss of Great Aunt Eglantine's much-loved
picnic hamper, but even Celeste got (temporarily) excited enough in Fortnum
&amp; Mason's to abandon Sonic the Hedgehog and pick out a replacement; complete
with a tartan rug the size of Rutland.
Upon returning home to their stark chrome and glass abode in Chelsea,
Araminta was relieved to find that Harry, ever the good scout, had assumed
control in the luggage department. She was thrilled, though not in the least
surprised, to discover two huge Louis Vuitton steamer trunks sitting in the
middle of the limed wood floor, exuding the delicious smell of new saddlery,
containing compartments enough for all her purchases and acting as the
perfect temporary wardrobe-cum-dining table. Sweetly, and so like dear
old-fashioned Harry, he had even set them with sleek silver candlesticks she
had bought from Georg Jensen, and laid out an impromptu supper from The
Caviar House.
Eloise was out on a date. Celeste snoring lightly on her campaign bed in the
bedroom. It all seemed such a blissfully long way from leafy Kensington, and
slaving over a hot Aga. Harry looked up. 'You look topping, Minty,' he
beamed. Araminta had a temporary crisis, realising she could never again
lie: 'Oh, this old thing? I've had it decades.' Her husband sniffed at the
air. 'And what's that wonderful smell?' Araminta smiled enigmatically and
whispered to herself: 'It's money, Harry. Money.' Mummy had been right.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (10): Global groups win out - Smaller
houses are losing their independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a rowdy group of grape growers burst into the opulent Intercontinental
Hotel in Paris this summer to shout 'Thief] Thief]' at the dapper figure of
Pierre Berge, chairman of Yves Saint-Laurent, it looked like little more
than yet another outburst from France's stroppy farmers.
Yet the grape growers' protest was only the start of a lobby by the French
champagne industry against YSL's decision to call its new fragrance,
Champagne. A French court last month ruled against YSL by banning it from
using the name in France. YSL is appealing. If it loses again, YSL, which
also faces similar cases in Britain and Germany, may face writing off
millions of pounds that it has spent on the launch.
The Champagne affair is a blow for YSL and for Elf Sanofi, the French
pharmaceuticals company that bought it this spring. It also casts a cloud
over the rest of the luxury goods industry.
YSL is not the only famous name in luxury to have forfeit its independence
this year. This autumn, Maurizio Gucci this autumn lost control of his
family's leather company after a bruising battle with Investcorp, the Arab
investment consortium. Dunhill, one of biggest British businesses in the
sector, has been merged into the Vendome group with Cartier, the French
jeweller, by Richemont, their secretive South African parent company. Kenzo,
another French fashion house, has sold out to LVMH, the French group which
also owns some of the champagne houses now fighting YSL.
Yet other companies have emerged unscathed from the industry's difficulties.
Hermes has continued to expand. Asprey has built on its base as an exclusive
gift shop on Bond Street, London, by buying a string of jewellers. Jil
Sander in Hamburg and Prada in Milan have been building up their fashion
businesses.
These companies are all tightly focused operations that have carved out
discreet niches in the luxury market. Hermes' success is rooted in decades
of investment in craftsmanship and quality. Asprey has flourished by
positioning itself as the gift shop for the 30 or 40 people in the world who
are so rich that they have barely noticed the recession. Jil Sander and
Prada are both renowned for the understated fashions that have come to the
fore in the early 1990s.
But the real winners in the luxury industry this year have been the global
groups that emerged in the 1980s. The doyen is LVMH, the French company
assembled by Bernard Arnault in a 1980s bid battle, which is a force in
fashion, cosmetics and luggage through Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix,
Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, as well as the recently acquired Kenzo.
The other contenders are Vendome, which owns Baume et Mercier and Piaget,
the watchmakers, as well as Dunhill and Cartier; Investcorp, which already
owned Tiffany, the famous New York jeweller, before taking over Gucci; and,
after its recent acquisitions, Asprey. Meanwhile, the beauty market is
dominated by France's L'Oreal, Estee Lauder of the US and Elf Sanofi.
Most of the global groups have been affected by the recession. But they also
have the advantage of scale: their activities are so broadly-based that they
are less vulnerable. LVMH has compensated for losses on Lacroix and its
ill-fated fragrance, C'Est La Vie], with the success of Dior's new Dune
perfume and Vuitton's cuir epi collection.
L'Oreal has been burnt by its investment in the relaunch of Lanvin, the
French fashion house. But Lanvin's losses should be offset by the profits
from the record-breaking launch of Gio, the new Giorgio Armani perfume.
Cartier's performance has helped Vendome to counter Dunhill's difficulties
in the Japanese market.
These companies, along with the other survivors in the luxury trade, should
soon be able to benefit from less difficult competitive conditions as
economies edge out of recession. The European market is still under pressure
but the US scene is more encouraging. Barneys opened a stylish new store in
uptown Manhattan in September and it has got off to a roaring start. Other
US stores were busy buyers at last month's Paris and Milan fashion shows.
The growth of the emerging Asian economies - South Korea, Taiwan, and even
China - is helping to offset the downturn in Japan. In theory the whole
industry should be helped by the new Asian markets, but in practice it will
probably be the larger groups that benefit most. They have the resources to
meet the start-up costs. Also, the bigger companies have, so far, been first
to take advantage of the luxury market's new-found stability by investing in
new product launches.
YSL's dilemma shows just how vulnerable the smaller houses have become. One
of the main reasons behind its decision to sell to Elf Sanofi was that, as
an independent company, it could no longer afford to compete in an industry
where it can cost Dollars 500,000 to stage a fashion show and Dollars 50m
for the global launch of a fragrance.
Thanks to Elf Sanofi's support, YSL was able to press ahead with the launch
of Champagne, its first new women's scent since Paris in 1973. That support
now seems even more important in the light of the Champagne court case. If
YSL loses the legal battle, Elf Sanofi would, at least, be big enough to
absorb the potential losses, which could have been crippling for YSL in its
old guise as an independent company.

Two new offshore funds have been added to the range offered without initial
charges through US broker Schwab's International FundSource Service, which
was launched two months ago.
The two latest additions are the Guinness Flight Global Strategy Fund, a
managed currency distribution fund, and Guinness Flight International
Accumulation, a managed currency accumulation fund. Investors can now buy
into more than 50 offshore funds without the usual initial charge of about 5
per cent. Annual management charges are still payable. The minimum
investment is Dollars 2,000 per fund and Dollars 1,000 for subsequent
investments. For details call 0800-526027
                    *         *        *
Artscope, the specialist fine art insurance broker, has launched a high-tech
system to store images of art works and help track them down if they are
stolen.
The system, known as Artist (Artscope Imaging and Storage Technology),
captures images of paintings and antiques on site and stores them digitally
on a secure computer, from where they can be transferred instantly to
police, antique dealers and auction houses if a theft occurs. The service is
available free to qualifying Artscope clients. More details from
0252-544000.

Foster &amp; Braithwaite is offering a 1 percentage point off the initial charge
on its two unit trusts which invest in investment trusts. According to
Micropal, the F&amp;B High Income Investment Trust fund is ranked second (out of
12 funds) in its sector over the year to November 1 and the F&amp;B Investment
Trust fund is third over the same period. The normal initial charge on the
F&amp;B funds is 5.5 per cent and the annual charge 1.25 per cent.
                    *         *        *
Capital Ventures, the Cheltenham-based financial services company, has
launched an enterprise zone trust to buy a retail unit in phase 2 of the
Parkgate, Rotherham development which is let to Focus DIY on a 25-year
lease.
The initial yield after expenses on the scheme, which is called Cert XVII,
will be about 6.7 per cent on the gross investment, according to Capital
Ventures, which estimates that this equates to a return of 10.5 per cent to
a top rate taxpayer.
The deadline for subscription both to this EZT and Cert XVI, which will
build retail units at Flint in North Wales, is December 24. Capital Ventures
is hoping that investors in its Cert I EZT launched in 1987 will use their
capital distribution from the investment to reinvest in Cert XVII and is
offering them priority rights until November 30.

Alliance &amp; Leicester building society has reduced the rate on its two-year
fixed rate mortgage from 6.25 per cent to 5.95 per cent because of

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Making good in bad times - Unit
Trusts / M&amp;G Dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE CAN be few blue chip companies which have matched the income record of
the M&amp;G Dividend fund. Founded in 1964, there has never been a year in which
the trust has cut its distribution to unitholders.
Since launch, it has grown by a compound 14.7 per cent per annum (including
net income reinvested). Someone who initially invested Pounds 1,000 would
now be receiving an income of Pounds 564.
But like other trusts in the M&amp;G range, things have not been easy over the
past five years. The high yield philosophy of the trust means that, like its
sister Recovery fund, it tends to invest in weaker companies, which perform
badly in recessions.
Manager Patrick Harrington says that 1991, the year he took charge, was an
awful time for the fund, with many companies in the high yield sector of the
market either cutting dividends or simply not surviving.
The good news has come since sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate
Mechanism which, for the Dividend fund, was a golden, rather than a black,
Wednesday.
Over the year to November 1 1993, the fund has returned 36.6 per cent
(offer-to-bid with net income reinvested: source Micropal) to unitholders.
Furthermore, the problems which have faced the Dividend fund have also
plagued the rest of the UK equity income sector, so its relative performance
looks good. It is 20th out of 106 funds over one year, 17th out of 104 over
three, 27th out of 94 over five years and 9th out of 51 funds over the
10-year period.
Yield is the first consideration for Harrington when he selects a share.
When the trust was first established, it aimed to produce an income 50 per
cent higher than that on the All-Share - a very difficult target these days.
Nowadays, Harrington only needs to produce a yield which is 10 per cent
higher than that provided by the Index.
Even that target has caused difficulties for some funds in the UK equity
income sector, since it is measured after the manager's annual charge has
been deducted.
With an annual charge of just 0.75 per cent, compared with a sector norm of
1 per cent to 1.5 per cent, M&amp;G Dividend has found the going easier than
most. The fund currently yields 4.07 per cent; Harrington hopes to be able
to push up the yield to 20 per cent above that of the All-Share.
The recession has made Harrington concentrate on those high-yielding
companies which are soundly-financed. 'The problems we have suffered were
with companies where the balance sheet was weak.' His favourite situations
occur when companies are restructured. 'If new management comes in and
shakes things up, performance can be changed quite rapidly,' Harrington
says.
As with other M&amp;G managers, Harrington is very much a stock-picker. 'One
cannot worry about sector weightings because of the yield consideration,' he
says. 'For years we had nothing in the low-yielding health and household
sector.'
At the moment, the fund has quite high weightings in depressed sectors such
as food manufacturing. 'In the early 1980s, the trust made quite a lot of
money out of restructurings in the manufacturing sector,' he says.
Harrington hopes that the same thing might apply to the consumer sector in
the 1990s.
The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio are: BT, Zeneca, Harrison &amp;
Crosfield, BAT, Dalgety, ECC, British Gas, Booker, Commercial Union and T&amp;N.
Harrington says that around 50 per cent of the fund is in FT-SE 100 stocks;
25 per cent is in the next 100 (the so-called Tootsie); the remaining 25 per
cent is in smaller companies.
Even though M&amp;G Dividend, at Pounds 821m, is one of the largest trusts in
the industry, Harrington perceives his role on a commendably human scale. 'I
run the fund for the old lady in Southport who is living off the income. We
try at least to maintain the dividend in real terms,' he says.
That has not been possible during the recession, but at least the trust has
managed to increase its distributions, when many funds in the sector have
been making cuts.
Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual charge is 0.75 per
cent; the bid-offer spread is 5.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
500, or Pounds 40 a month. Both income and accumulation units are available;
distributions are made twice a year. The trust is available in Pep form;
minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.

Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group reporting on Tuesday,
is expected to show a rise of some 24 per cent in pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 290m - but by a more modest 7 per cent if exceptionals and
restructuring costs are excluded. The pace of progress at the trading level
is likely to be even slower.
The results will include the first contribution from its UK brewing joint
venture with Carlsberg launched early this year into a fiercely competitive
and still declining UK beer market. The pub trade recovery remains patchy.
PowerGen, the electricity generator, is expected to announce half year
profits of between Pounds 105m and Pounds 110m on Wednesday, against
interims last year of Pounds 95m. City attention will focus on dividends.
Following the company's announcement of a change in cover policy, analysts
expect dividends to rise by at least 15 per cent annually in the next few
years. But with the industry regulator considering whether to refer PowerGen
and National Power to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, there is
pressure on the company to be conservative.
Scottish Power, the vertically integrated electricity company will announce
half year figures on Thursday with analysts expecting about Pounds
107m-Pounds 118m, against Pounds 95m this time last year, and a dividend of
4.09p-4.12p (3.72p).
Interim results from Northern Foods due on Tuesday are expected to have a
downbeat tone although pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds
68.4m to around Pounds 72m for the half to end-September. Although still
chirpy at the annual meeting, the company has encountered worsening trading
conditions since the second quarter.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (9): Watch this (pricy) space - It's
seconds out as Richard Garnier takes time to visit watchmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GONE IS Lady Doodah's wristwatch, the one given to her by her doting husband
years ago and carried off by the burglar last month. So, she who thought
that little gold number would do for life, is forced to seek a new watch, or
even two: one for evening; and one for day wear.
And gone, too, is the notion of the watch for life, be it in steel,
gilt-metal or gold. Many of us these days sport different models to suit our
mood, pretentions and aspirations.
Gone, too, is the 1950s complicated calendar watch to the dealer at the back
of the room - who will, of course, sell it to a vintage watch collector.
But not gone, very much thriving, is the desire for the latest models. We
could all and, at some stage probably do, wear a classless Swatch - be it
plain, chronograph or automatic type - but let us look at luxury watches as
it is these personal statements that reveal so much. As with much luxury
buying there are cult forces at work and so let us try and establish who
buys . . . and for whom.
9am. Lady Doodah, making an early start, is through the shop door within
minutes of opening time. Her quest for a replacement gold watch, small and
neat, traditional yet beautiful, is answered by a Baume &amp; Mercier's gold
quartz bracelet watch at Pounds 2,990.
9.30. Almost as early is Camilla, swept in by her mother 'never be able to
park otherwise, darling', to find a watch of suitable elan to carry her
through the vicissitudes of the Season. They are instinctively drawn to
Cartier and the tank watch - in vermeil (silver gilt) at Pounds 700. The
origins of this design go back to the tanks of the First World War, although
Camilla may not realise this, whereas her brother, Max, a graduate trainee
in the City has already been attracted by the conscious revivalism of the
Bill centenary watch, resurrecting original Bill designs of the 1930s -
priced in a range of six designs from Pounds 1,900-Pounds 2,500 in gold -
but he went for the steel range at Pounds 445-Pounds 795.
10. On his way to opening his own shop, Miles a successful antiquarian book
dealer, is guided towards a marque with style and history. Breguet, founded
in 1775 by the greatest watchmaker ever, fits the bill with its recreation
of 19th century pocket watch models as modern wristwatches. He plumps for a
gold automatic moonphase, calendar strap watch at Pounds 15,450, with the
indicators placed eccentrically on the finely engine-turned silver dial.
10.30. Brad, the north-American yachtsman, hoves to but needs no steering
towards his choice of a Corum Admiral's Cup bi-colour automatic strap watch
with tidal indication for Pounds 3,905.
11. Just as unmissable in a camel coat and slick suit is Winston, on the up
and needing a watch to complement his gold jewellery. He decides to pass on
a Rolex Oyster day-date watch with a diamond-studded dial at Pounds 10,545,
in favour of a Cartier Panther diamond bezel black-dialled quartz bracelet
watch at Pounds 12,500.
11.15. Avuncular Archibald has arrived by appointment with only 10 minutes
to spare in his busy schedule. He is choosing the watch that he will be
given on his imminent retirement as chairman of the board. He is seeking the
equivalent of his father's gold half-hunter and settles on a Patek Philippe
plain Calatrava with its craftsmanship, quality and unsurpassed performance
 -an heirloom for the future at Pounds 4,325.
11.30. But in no hurry to decide is His Excellency the Chief from Nigeria.
His choice narrows eventually between a gold Rolex with diamond bezel and
diamond pave bracelet at Pounds 35,385 and a white gold and diamond set,
black opal dialled, bracelet watch at Pounds 73,710 by DeLaneau.
Midday. On his way to lunch, Freddie an ebullient 18-year-old from Chelsea,
is here to scout out what's what after passing his A-levels. He selects a
Rolex Oyster Automatic steel bracelet strap watch at Pounds 1,430.
12.30pm. Norman and Patsy, both keen golfers, are in to buy his 'n' hers
watches to celebrate their improving handicaps. They are naturally attracted
by the sportif Ebel range, but choose the Senior Sport quartz bi-colour
watches at Pounds 1,200 (his) and the similar ladies sports watch at Pounds
1,050 (hers).
1.15. Arriving in a taxi is the Brigadier to get a new battery quartz for
his 18 carat Omega Deville quartz watch on a strap (price Pounds 875) which
had attracted him originally because of its clear dial with sweep secondhand
and date.
1.30. Marc, the young City dealer, is in to get a Tag Heuer GMT professional
watch, waterproof to 200 metres and advertised as for those who 'Don't crack
under pressure' in gold plate on a leather strap at Pounds 475.
2. Monty, on his way back to Harley Street, has been consulting at the
hospital all morning. He appreciates IWC's quality and understated design
linked with total functional reliability but in the brief time he has
available cannot yet decide between two perpetual calendar strap watches: a
Novecento yellow gold rectangular watch at Pounds 10,800 and a circular
white gold Da Vinci chronograph stop watch at Pounds 12,000.
2.30. Chris, on his way back to his City desk from lunch, fancies himself as
an outdoor type. His peers will appreciate his choice of a Breitling
Chronomat, tachometer chronograph, blue faced and blue sharkskin strapped in
steel and gold at Pounds 1715.
3. Helen is being treated to a sumptuous 25th wedding anniversary present
and is immediately ravished by Blancpain's classic mechanical strap watch in
combinations of precious gems at Pounds 57,450 because it will complement
her existing jewellery so well but decides to contain herself to a Pounds
17,900 'Bagnoire' automatic bracelet watch by Cartier with triple-row
diamond brilliant bezel.
3.30. Norma, who has rather more immediate needs, having just won the pools
in a big way, loses her heart to a fantastic gem-set watch by Piaget at
Pounds 208,875; the diamond pave dial surrounded by marquise diamond petals
extending into the flexible emerald bracelet.
4. Sapphire, recently flown in from LA to appear on a television chat show,
just loves Rene Boivin's range of 'Chrysallis' watches on coloured crocodile
straps which transform from day watches into jewelled cocktail watches by
means of a sliding movable segment round the bezel. She goes, of course, for
a sapphire-set example at Pounds 12,345.
4.30. The shop is full of shortish dark men in dark suits. From their midst
emerges Sheik Mehmed, just returned from his success in the Breeders' Cup in
California to buy a present for his trainer. His choice falls on the
timelessly elegant, fashionably revivalist, yet understated rose gold
automatic power reserve strap watch by Vacheron Constantin at Pounds 6,550.
5. Risking parking on the double yellow lines outside the door, Simon rushes
in to choose a watch for his wife, Jane, who has just given birth to their
third child. His attention is caught by an Asprey gold watch with diamond
bezel and diamond dots for the numerals, on a black crocodile strap at
Pounds 3,395.
5.15. With an eye for lasting quality, Paris, a fine art publisher, makes
his aesthetic choice a second-hand quality watch - a Patek Philippe yellow
gold watch from the late 1940s at Pounds 5,800.
6.30. The guests for the Christmas customer evening are arriving.
Jonathan, now married to someone richer than himself, is being cajoled into
upgrading his old Rolex for a Patek Philippe Calatrava with hobnail bezel at
Pounds 4,935.
Aimee, perhaps not so permanently attached, is being pressed by her ardent
companion to accept a Happy Diamond quartz strap watch by Chopard at Pounds
1,920. Three freely spinning diamonds can move about in the glazed zone
between the diamond-edged dial and outer bezel.
Kevin, aglow with the success of his latest deal, originally had in mind an
image-conscious gold Rolex Oyster day-date bracelet watch (Pounds 9,335),
but was seduced by the class of the uniquely styled Garrard 150th watch,
limited to 150 pieces and presented in a sterling silver box, celebrating
the royal appointment as Crown Jewellers 150 years ago, for Pounds 10,550 in
gold.
Jo, media personality, single and 30-something, carries off a
Jaeger-LeCoultre smaller man's sized bi-colour mechanical Reverso strap
watch. Launched in 1931 it epitomises trends in watchmaking, giving homage
to the past, proving that good design is enduring and that luxury was never
transient.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (8): A little essential luxury - Life's
important non-necessities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE, when asked to name a luxury, hesitate only briefly before
gazing into the middle distance and allowing covetousness to carry them
away. A private jet, they mutter dreamily. A house in St Paul de Vence. An
entire set of Vuitton luggage. A yacht. A Rolex. A magic no-bills platinum
Amex card. A Bulgari necklace. A Chanel handbag. A Rolls-Royce. A driver.
servant.
Certainly they are all luxuries. But they are great luxuries, the things
daydreams are made of. Push someone on life's little luxuries and, for a
moment, they are likely to be perplexed. A Bulgari ring? One piece of
Vuitton luggage? No, life's little luxuries are the real thing.
They are not daydreams. They are the vitally important non-necessities
without which life would become, if not dreary and desperate, then drab and
difficult. They are the expenses which Mr Micawber would not incur.
They are such little things. But they make such a difference. Most of them
are about convenience. They are the cost of car parking in central London.
They are the washed, prepared vegetables from Marks &amp; Spencer which permit
15 more minutes in bed before the Sunday pot roast has to be slammed into
the oven. They are the Fauchon individual souffles which go into a cold oven
at 20 minutes to eating time.
They are a private fax, an American fridge, an extra four hours of the
cleaner's time the morning after a party, still eating dinner in
restaurants, paying the bills on the second car so the children never take
the first, the laundry service, car-valeting, constant hot water, a
telephone in every room, tights by the boxful.
The luxuries of convenience vary from person to person. Women will value a
taxi to the door because it keeps their Emma Hope velvet shoes from too
bruising a contact with the pavement and spares anxiety concerning
strangers. Men, on the other hand, have no such apprehensions and often find
the Tube quicker. However, while a woman might grudgingly wield an iron if
her clean American percale cotton sheets depended on it, a man might be
certain the end of his world was at hand should the laundry close. For all,
though, convenience is a matter of time and comfort. It is an intensely
rational motive.
Other motives for insisting on life's little luxuries are less so. Take the
luxuries which are about certain standards. They are little differences by
which we define ourselves, which ensure that we stand out from the herd.
They include: travelling first-class; picking up the bill; Chanel cosmetics;
hardback books; buying not renting videos; a bottle of good wine with a
take-out pizza; keeping up one's membership to a club one never uses;
Laurent Perrier in the fridge, and tipping generously.
These are also about expert knowledge and insider information. This kind of
luxury is about paying a little more than necessary for something which
other insiders will recognise has been bought as a consequence of expert
knowledge.
These luxuries take in Armani spectacle frames, Herbert Johnson's roll-up
panama, a Brigg umbrella, bespoke shoes from Lobb's, a travelling writing
case from W &amp; H Gidden, a Parker 51 fountain pen, fruit teas from Wittard of
Chelsea, a Mason &amp; Pearson hair brush, Glycerine and Rosewater soap from
Woods of Windsor, a subscription to World of Interiors, a blanket jacket
from Ralph Lauren, fresh flowers and Eva Gunderson to arrange them, an Aga,
an amber necklace from Cobra &amp; Bellamy, Lorna Wing to make your canapes and,
failing that, Gentlemen's Relish.
Others are little indulgences, kindnesses to ourselves which make us feel
loved.
This is known as the feel-good factor and is held to bolster confidence,
effectiveness and a sanguine temperament.
These are the luxuries without which, many women are convinced, life would
be unendurable. Numbered among them are: lots of time in the bathroom and
plenty of shiny jars on the bathroom shelves; an occasional day in Harrod's
beauty salon; a weekly manicure; scent by Guerlain; a new Georgina von
Etzdorf scarf twice a year; Emma Hope shoes; La Perla underwear; a Pringle
cashmere dressing gown; regular lunches with a girlfriend at Le Caprice;
therapeutic afternoons in Joseph; fine china and fresh croissants for
breakfast; crystal glasses on the supper table and Vogue every month.
Whichever category a little luxury falls into, it only qualifies if it is
habit-forming, if the mundane but adequate alternative becomes quite
unthinkable.
My mother simply could not drink tea out of a mug. It had to be a china cup
with, most emphatically, a saucer. A friend cannot sleep under sheets and a
blanket. It must be a goose-down duvet. Another friend cannot, she swears,
live without a view of trees as she draws back the morning curtains. I must
leave home with my my car or I will have an anxiety attack along the lines
of 'how will I ever get home again?' Silly, but necessary.

WHEN Peter and Hilary Rost helped set up the Mutual Share Ownership
Investment Club in 1962, they wanted to invest more in the stock market than
their resources would allow, so pooling money with friends seemed the
solution. Now, their club is probably the UK's oldest.
Although Peter Rost was a stockbroker, Hilary stresses that it has always
been an 'amateur club' with a cross-section of members, including farmers,
plumbers and housewives.
The club is unusually large with about 60 members. 'We elect a committee
which makes the day-to-day decisions and we meet every three months,' said
Hilary. 'We meet more frequently when there is new money to add stocks to
the portfolio. About 15-20 people usually attend.'
Meetings are held at the Rost's home in Berkhamsted, Berks. Hilary says it
was important to have a lawyer draw up club constitution and rules. The club
has used nominee accounts from inception.
New members either make a lump sum downpayment or monthly contributions
using a banker's form. The average monthly payment is Pounds 15 to Pounds
20. The portfolio is valued at the beginning of each month and the new unit
price calculated. Hilary took over this task once the accountant's fees
became 'ridiculous.' It only takes her only half an hour now that the books
are kept on computer.
The portfolio holds five or six stocks which include: Eurotunnel, BP,
Lonrho, Fleming Chinese Investment Trust and Abtrust's recently launched
Emerging Economies Investment Trust. Dividends and profits are reinvested.
Hilary says the main early difficulty was lack of stock market
understanding. 'Choosing shares was also difficult. We did not, for example,
know what distinguished the shares of one food company from another. So we
spent a lot of time reading and cutting out articles to discuss at the
meetings.'
She said: 'We outperformed the market until the recession and the portfolio
is now worth Pounds 65,000 although it has been as much as Pounds 100,000.
It is great fun - you can be the last of the big spenders and you feel you
have a stake in the companies.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Setting up a club - Investment clubs
are coming to Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AN INVESTMENT club is like a DIY unit trust with the members of the club
deciding which stocks to invest in collectively.
Tony Drury, managing director of ProShare Investment clubs, emphasised the
importance of setting up the club safely using correct procedures.
ProShare's Investment Clubs manual is a guide to how to do this and contains
a draft constitution and draft club rules, suggestions for the agenda for
the meetings and Inland Revenue forms.
SIZE
The ideal number of members, according to William Lowe, who used to run the
NAIC and is now President of ProShare Investment Clubs, is 15 to 18  -
partly because a larger group is likely to result in fewer people having a
say in discussions.
ProShare suggests that the club is organised as a partnership, for which the
legal maximum is usually 20 people. However, some clubs are happy to be much
larger (see below) but should take legal advice about their structure.
WHERE TO MEET
Although some clubs meet in members' homes, this can be a strain. Since the
club is meant to be as much a social affair as a way to invest money, many
clubs meet in the back room of a pub or in a hotel or restaurant.
ProShare suggests monthly meetings in a regular pattern, such as the first
Monday of each month. At its first meeting, the club should pick a name and
elect a chairman, treasurer and secretary.
SECURITY OF FUNDS
ProShare says it knows of no instances in which a member of an investment
club has run off with the funds. It advises registering shares in the name
of the nominee company of the club's stockbroker as the most secure way of
holding the club's securities.
Since company reports and correspondence will then be sent to the nominee
company, the club should arrange with its stockbroker that the material is
forwarded to it.
Another common method of holding the assets is to appoint two or three
members as trustees and register the shares in their name. A club will also
need a bank or building society account in which to hold liquid assets. The
account should be in the name of the club with cheques requiring the
signature of at least two members.
KEEPING ACCOUNT
ProShare suggests that members probably need about Pounds 500 before it is
worthwhile making their first stock market investment.
It is up to the club to set the level of contributions and whether these
should be collected in a lump sum or on a regular basis. The club should
also decide whether it wants to pay out a dividend to members or reinvest
the income.
Since members will drop out of the club, or some will want to encash their
holdings, it is essential to have an easy method to determine who owns what.
The unit valuation system is probably the simplest way to do this.
The club needs to set the initial value of units - Pounds 1 is the easiest
number. If members contribute Pounds 30 each at the first meeting, they will
each hold 30 units.
To obtain the value of a unit at any future date, the club's net assets (its
investments and cash in hand, minus liabilities) should be divided by the
number of units bought by members.
A member will then be able to calculate the value of his or her investment
based on the number of units held.
LEAVING THE CLUB
Members should give notice if they want to encash units or leave the club.
ProShare suggests that they should be required to give warning of their
intention before the next meeting and that the rules of the club should
state a maximum period of three months before a payout. Although the payout
will often be made much sooner, the 90-day clause should cover the club for
the amount of time it might take to pay several members giving notice.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Savers who are caring, and sharing -
Investment clubs are coming to Britain. A new way for investors to pool
ideas and money for profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA is widespread in the US but has never taken off with the same
enthusiasm in the UK. This week, however, Proshare, the organisation which
aims to promote deeper and wider share ownership, launched ProShare
Investment Clubs to inject renewed interest into the concept.
Investment clubs are a way for people who know, like and trust each another
to meet regularly in order to make collective stock market investments by
pooling knowledge and funds.
The idea is to make direct stock market investment affordable. For example,
if 10 individuals can each afford to save up to Pounds 30 a month for a
stock market investment, it would take at least a year for each to build a
worthwhile lump sum to invest. By pooling the amounts, it would only take a
few months before entering the market could become viable. People who want
to invest, but do not have the confidence to do so on their own, may find
being part of a group the answer.
Brokerage costs also account for a smaller proportion of the total
investment when compared to the costs of buying and selling 10 separate
investments. Moreover, informal meetings can make investment as enjoyable as
any of the more conventional club activities, such as golf or playing
bridge.
Sir Peter Thompson, chairman of ProShare says: 'Investment clubs are for
everyone - they are a fun, sociable and cost-effective way for the British
public to discover the excitement of investing in the stock market. You
don't need a fortune, just enthusiasm, a group of friends, business
colleagues or acquaintances, a few hours a month and a little surplus cash.'
The first investment club was founded in Texas in 1898 but it is the Mutual
Investment Club of Detroit, set up in 1940 by Frederic C Russell, an
American businessman, which is regarded as the spur to the worldwide
investment club movement.
Russell died in 1965 but the investment club he founded, and which has
averaged 18 members, is still in existence. Over the years members have
subscribed Dollars 300,000 and the club now has a portfolio worth Dollars
2.5m (Pounds 1.67m) after withdrawals of Dollars 1.2m.
There are more than 9,000 investment clubs in the US, with a total of
230,000 members, and 15,000 clubs in France. Investment clubs were first
launched in the UK in the late 1940s. Although the National Association of
Investment Clubs, established in 1959, helped to create 2,000 investment
clubs, the 1987 stock market crash contributed to a fall in numbers to an
estimated 600 today, with an average of 12 to 15 in each.
ProShare has taken over the NAIC and relaunched it as ProShare Investment
Clubs with membership costing Pounds 50. Members will receive a 70-page
manual on establishing and running an investment club, a monthly newsletter
and the ProShare Guide to Information Sources, a useful directory of places
to search for investment advice.
Membership brings with it automatic registration with ProShare Investment
Clubs and allows access to any special offers and discounts as well a
helpline. ProShare is also offering, free, its Shares for You video and two
copies of its Guide to You and Your Stockbroker. Alternatively, the manual
can be purchased for Pounds 25 and the video will be sent free.
ProShare will not introduce individuals to existing investment clubs. Since
money in a club is pooled, trust between members is important and it is
unlikely that any club will welcome the inclusion of strangers. Instead
ProShare recommends that an individual gathers round them like-minded people
to form their own club (see the accompanying panel).
One disadvantage of investing through a club is that it is not possible to
take advantage of tax-efficient personal equity plans which are for
individuals only. However, many investment club members are likely to have
investments of their own and can use a Pep for these shares. Sir Peter
Thompson says if the investment club movement takes off, ProShare will lobby
for similar tax advantages to be extended to club investments.
Barclays stockbrokers has linked up with ProShare to offer investment clubs
a sharedealing and administration service. Other brokers are likely to
provide a similar service in the near future.
Barclayshare Investment Club package offers a portfolio service from Pounds
12 a quarter (plus VAT) or an advisory service from Pounds 30 (plus VAT) a
quarter.
The minimum brokerage fees for equities are 1.5 per cent on the first Pounds
10,000 in the portfolio service and 1.35 per cent in the advisory service.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (7): Hand made in Britain . . . but at a
price - Across London craftsmen are still creating top-quality products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the great misconceptions of our time is that the British are no
longer any good at making things. Happily, the British remain skilled
manufacturers, particularly of top-quality made-to-measure goods.
Across London there are still small craftsmen creating beautifully made
luggage, shoes, riding-boots and hats.
It is possible, not only to buy top quality, traditional luggage, but also
to commission your own special portmanteau from companies such as Tanner
Krolle. 'We are one of the few companies in the hand-made leather industry
still able to offer a bespoke service. We see each bespoke item as a
challenge and take great pride in being able to make our client's dreams
come true,' says Philip Davis, managing director.
Commissions have included a hand-crafted case to house an old master
painting; a made-to-measure compartmentalised suitcase that serves as an
office, an overnight bag and, most important, a seat on which to rest in
between airline connections; and a jewellery case in leather, tanned
specially to a client's wife's favourite shade of blue. The firm's work is
distinguished by excellent materials ranging from bridle-hide to ostrich,
solid frames in tempered steel and proper brass locks.
The same high standards of craftsmanship are apparent in the work of case
maker Simon Baker, a former fashion designer who abandoned the fleeting
charms of plastic for the more enduring appeal of leather.
'The British craftsman has always had a vocational attitude to his work, and
will go to great lengths to produce the perfect item,' says Baker. He says
he senses a revival of interest in durable, artisan-produced goods. Baker
studied leather construction at Cordwainers College in London and, after a
period as a restorer, perfected a method that combines the best of
traditional Victorian craft techniques with lighter materials and more
contemporary construction. Everything is stitched by hand and lined in
leather. His work is handsomely robust and is generally made from the most
hard-wearing bridle hide he can find. It is especially popular with
photographers, who order portfolios and cases with special compartments to
carry equipment. Other commissions include a case that combines the
facilities of an attache case an overnight bag and a large music case. 'If
people can draw, I can make it,' says Baker, whose prices start at Pounds
400.
Britain also produces bespoke shoes. Some of the most beautiful are made by
Cleverley in London's Royal Arcade. The shoes are distinguished by a
wonderfully elegant chiselled toe and its products have graced the feet of
Sir Laurence Olivier, Gary Cooper and Clark Gable and boast a committed
following. 'There is absolutely no substitute for a bespoke shoe,' says
director George Glasgow. The shoes are made the same way today as they were
at the turn of the century. Glasgow, and his partner John Carniera, go to
enormous lengths to 'jiggle the twin imperatives of shape and comfort. A new
client is shown around thirty basic styles from which he decides exactly
what he wants. His feet are then measured and a last carved. A paper pattern
is then cut to fit the last and the shoe is cut-out.' A meticulous process
follows involving five craftsmen and several fittings before the shoes are
completed. Cleverley charges Pounds 750 which, although pricy, is
considerably less than other better known makers and is excellent value for
money.
Also excellent are British-made riding boots. Some of the best are to found
at Schnieder Boots in Clifford Street, London W1. Rudolf Schnieder is a
third generation bootmaker who, as his name suggests, was originally from
Germany, but found Anglo- Saxon life so 'fascinating' that he settled in
England.
He says: 'The British make very good craftsmen because they still take their
glorious past seriously and feel almost patriotically-obliged to do a good
job.'
Schnieder's firm makes a vast range of of boots of all equestrian types for
clients including royalty, the army and several Olympic teams. His bespoke
boots are incredibly dashing, are made entirely by hand and fit like a
glove. They also bear the princely price-tag of Pounds 2,000. For less
well-lined pockets there is a range of factory made-to-measure styles, from
Pounds 600, and sets of ready-to-wear models in 11 different fittings for as
little as Pounds 239.
Made to measure is of course not restricted to leather goods. British
handmade suits and shirts are justly famous, but many might be surprised to
know that it is still possible to order bespoke hats.
This steamy craft endures at the Dickensian premises of S Patey. Patey makes
top hats, academic mortar boards, riding hats, bowlers and all manner of
ceremonial headgear. The hats are made-to-measure using an elaborate machine
called a comformater. All the manufacturing processes are done by hand and
involve building ad shaping layers of shellac-impregnated cotton into
elegant headwear that exactly fits and flatters in the way a soft
off-the-peg hat never could. Prices start at Pounds 125.
Even the smallest sartorial embellishments can be custom-made.
Longmire, in St James's, London, hand-enamels or engraves cufflinks and
blazer buttons to order. The firm obligingly claims to be able to depict any
subject including a coat-of-arms, family crest and tartan, a pampered pet, a
favourite sport, hobby, car or painting, corporate logo, racing colours and
yachting burgees. The workmanship is of a very high standard: a single
design can take up to three days to be immortalised in miniature. Prices
start at Pounds 1,000.
Finally, the edible custom-made accessory: the monogrammed chocolate. Gerard
Ronay, Britain's most recherche and expensive chocolate maker, will embed
initials or other simple designs on after-dinner bitter chocolates,(Pounds
22 per pound plus Pounds 1 per chocolate personalised) and will even produce
a personalised box actually made of chocolate (Pounds 20). Self-indulgence
indeed.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Behind every statistic lurks a pigeon - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE never-never land of economic statistics the sun always shines,
nightingales sing, inflation is low, unemployment falls, and the economy
grows for ever and ever. In the cold, windswept, pigeon-infested world of
business, however, markets are tough, margins under pressure and the threat
of tax increases before Christmas worries industrialists everywhere.
That gulf between the economy on paper and the impressions of people working
in it seemed wider than ever this week, particularly in the equity market.
To the casual observer who did not trouble to look at the date, this week's
economic figures might have been reprinted from the mid-1960s by mistake.
Underlying inflation, which had been expected to tick up, fell to a 25-year
low on Wednesday. The headline figure fell to a very un-British 1.4 per
cent.
The dark side to low inflation is the fear in the market that a weak economy
is holding prices down. In spite of the sunny economic outlook the FT-SE 100
index could manage a gain of only 8.9 points on the week.
Yet retail sales are up sharply over the year, as Wednesday's figures
confirmed. A more plausible explanation for continuing low inflation is that
cost pressures are weak. Commodities remain subdued, and unit wages in
manufacturing have fallen through the year.
Paul Turnbull, economist at Smith New Court, is happy that the economy is
recovering nicely and that inflation will not accelerate in the near future.
As companies take up the slack, productivity gains mean that unit costs fall
automatically. That should encourage those who think that the equity market
has been riding ahead of companies' ability to deliver.
Even Thursday's unemployment figures warmed the heart, if not the market.
The largest jobless fall for four years brought the total down to 2.85m.
Ever since the total knocked at the door of 3m and turned away, the City has
been suspicious that special factors were at work. Now it looks as though
the reforms of the 1980s really have made the labour market more flexible.
Had you spent the week in chilly Harrogate instead of looking at a City
dealing screen things might not have looked so rosy. While taking the waters
the Confederation of British Industry rumbled about the dangers of tax
increases to the delicate flower of recovery. Retailers have also made much
of the potentially destabilising effects of a tax-raising budget in the run
up to Christmas.
Still, not all of the depression is special pleading. Companies reporting
this week continued the real-world gloom of many recent trading statements.
Courtaulds and BOC are both suffering. BOC, which follows the prescient
practice of announcing its dividends a year in advance, was forced to call a
halt to its 20-year run of increased payments. It had perhaps run ahead of
itself in boom times, but the industrial gases business tends to recovery
late in the economic cycle. Its shares fell 13p to 618p.
Courtaulds fared even worse with the shares falling by 51p to 433p over the
week. In its global businesses the clampdown on the Chinese economy is
encouraging many Asian producers to divert their low cost output to other
markets, cutting margins. It will take a substantial upturn in the world
economy before the chemicals giants can look for much of an upturn in
profits, or dividends.
There was good corporate news, at least for some. Lucas Industries was
distinctly perky when it was able to finally announce that it had persuaded
George Simpson to become its new chief executive. The loser in the
tug-of-love struggle was British Aerospace, which needs Simpson's services
so badly that it is going to hang on to him for another six months. As the
chairman of Rover he has revolutionised working practices and slashed costs
while retaining the loyalty of the workforce. Lucas is looking forward to
similar treatment. Since the fact only echoed the rumour, neither share was
much affected.
Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, was also in chipper mood when he
reported a 30 per cent increase in half year profits. The figure owed a
great deal to the fall in sterling against the dollar, and the shares
unenthusiastically fell by 35p to 462p. But the jewel in the ex-colonial
company's crown, Hong Kong Telecom, continues to shine brightly. Not only is
business in Asia booming, but the surge on the Hong Kong stock market has
boosted the value of C&amp;W's 57 per cent stake. Mercury's new One-2-One
cellular service in the UK is also becoming so popular that it could do for
electronics retailing this Christmas what video games did in 1992. Dixons
apparently wanted 20,000 phones to sell in December, but the manufacturers
cannot make them fast enough. Book early to avoid disappointment.
Such upbeat sentiments are, however, rare. The caution of company chairman
about earnings prospects is starting to get through. Fears that the Budget
may raise substantial new taxes also overhang the market. Tax-exempt pension
funds are concerned that the chancellor may view the tax credit they get
with dividend payments as an easy target. Since dividends are only thinly
covered, companies could scarcely afford to increase payouts to compensate
for the pension funds' loss of income.
Yet if the inflation outlook is really as benign as this week's figures
suggests, and growth, at least in the UK, approaches 3 per cent in 1994, the
equity market has little to grumble at. The last time that equity yields
exceeded inflation for any length of time was during the great bull market
of 1966-68 when share prices doubled. Rising inflation and the balance of
payments crisis eventually burst that bubble. But this week, even the trade
figures were good.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Joys of duty-free shopping - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HALF-year profit increases reported this week by British Airways and
BAA, the privatised British Airports Authority, have confirmed civil
aviation as one of the UK's corporate success stories.
At a time when most other international airlines are still struggling to
return to the black, BA's interim pre-tax profits rose 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 235m, which including an impressive 26.5 per cent increase in second
quarter profits, making it the most profitable airline in the world.
BAA, the only privatised airports operator in Europe, showed an 8.7 per cent
rise in interim pre tax profits to Pounds 237m and said some 20 to 30
airports around the world were interested in forming collaborative or equity
partnerships with it to help them expand and modernise.
The performance of both UK air transport stocks was much in line with
analysts expectations. Both are seen as good buys since both companies are
well positioned to take advantage of the gradual recovery in air travel from
the prolonged slump caused by the combination of the Gulf crisis and the
economic recession.
However, the City is divided on which stock is the better bet. For some, BAA
is the safer investment in that its income flow is directly related to the
increase in passengers using its airports without the competitive risks
faced by airlines.
BAA's latest traffic forecasts predict that demand for its seven UK airports
will grow at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent up to the end of this century.
Faced with a more stringent regulatory pricing formula for its landing
charges, BAA has continued to expand its retailing activities which are
turning its airports into large shopping malls. For the first time,
retailing has become the company's largest source of income overtaking
landing charges.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, has been travelling to China to
discuss airport joint ventures in an air travel market growing at 30 per
cent a year. He is also in discussion with airports in continental Europe,
especially Rome, where government's are beginning to see in BAA's
performance the positive benefits of privatising airports.
'We have shown we can make profits and reduce landing charges as a private
concern,' Sir John said this week.
But as a quasi-monopoly, BAA's dividend yield remains conservative at 2.2
per cent and its decision this week to raise the interim payout by 8.6 per
cent to 6.75p a share proved somewhat disappointing to the market.
Moreover, the company faces heavy spending in the next years to build the
new Pounds 900m-Pounds 800m fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport, its
star asset, as well as in possible future investments in other international
airports. There is a suspicion that the company will launch a rights issue.
BA's 3.3 per cent dividend yield reflects the greater risks attached to the
stock. Although airline shares are not for the faint-hearted - the UK-US air
war over BA's ticket codesharing deal with USAir, its US partner, flared
again this week; ticket discounting continues; and over-capacity plagues the
market - BA is probably in the best position of any international carrier to
profit form the overdue cyclical recovery in the business.
While continuing to drive down its cost base (by the end of this year BA
will have reduced underlying costs by Pounds 500m in the last three years),
BA has taken a lead in the industry to form a global network with partners
in the US, Australia and Europe.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, reported signs of improvement in the
airline's two most important markets, the US and the UK, as well as some
recent growth in first and business class premium traffic. It also plans to
bring fewer new aircraft into service next year and in 1995. BA appears
poised to see sustained profit growth. Chris Tarry, Kleinwort Benson's
aviation analyst, upgraded his profit forecasts for the airline this week
and expects BA to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m in
1995.
All in all, many in the City believe BA could provide risk inclined
investors with more attractive rewards than a lower yielding privatised
utility such as BAA.

The US House of Representatives' approval of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) on Wednesday had been widely anticipated by investors on
the Mexican stock market, who expected the agreement to boost Mexico's
economy.
Shares have risen strongly in recent weeks: the IPC index went to record
levels on five successive days in the run-up to the vote, tailing off only
during Wednesday's session. Trading on Thursday, after news of the expected
result, was characterised by alternate strong demand and profit taking.
However, in dollar terms the index made only a modest gain on the week. In
the longer term, equities are expected to gain.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: Emerging risks for your portfolio - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING markets are so fashionable nowadays that a good contrarian is
rightly suspicious. When markets are in fashion, they often rise to
unsustainable levels, and those who buy at the height of the trend suffer
the most.
Certainly, the phrase 'emerging markets' seems to guarantee the success of a
fund launch at the moment. Fidelity has raised more than Dollars 100m
(Pounds 67m) for its offshore emerging markets fund since its launch in the
middle of October.
Large sums are flowing into emerging markets from the US, where investors
are both dissatisfied with the returns on cash and concerned with the high
valuations placed on US equities. According to Micropal, the 100 largest
emerging markets funds grew by over Dollars 7bn in the first six months of
the year.
One sign that the trend might be getting feverish came when the Hong Kong
market, seen as the gateway to the ultimate emerging market of China, jumped
20 per cent in five weeks. The market has shown signs of running out of
steam in the last few days.
Dr Arnab Banerji, who is chief investment officer of Foreign &amp; Colonial
Emerging Markets, reckons that some markets are overheated at present and
that 'there will be tears' for some investors. But he adds that the
overheated markets are only a small subset of emerging markets as a whole,
and he believes the long term investment arguments hold good.
The economic case for emerging markets has been highlighted this week by the
US House of Representatives' vote in favour of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) and by the trade talks between the US and the Asian
countries in Seattle. Both indicate the degree of importance the Americans
attach to trade with the developing world.
High economic growth rates, the presence of increasingly educated workforces
and institutional change in favour of free market capitalism all add weight
to the argument for emerging markets investment.
And Dr Banerji points out that, in spite of the recent inflows,
institutional investors still have very little exposure to the emerging
markets. Estimates of the correct weighting for emerging markets in their
portfolios tend to vary between 10 and 20 per cent; most are nowhere near
that levels.
Nevertheless, private investors should be cautious unless they can take a
long-term view. If you can afford to wait at least five years, and possibly
ten, then a broadly based emerging markets fund still makes sense for 10-20
per cent of a capital growth portfolio. An extra layer of safety could be
added by investing via a savings scheme. But if you are investing on a one
or two year view, the risk of a correction in these fashionable markets is
too great.
THE UK Equity Income sector may be less exotic than the world of emerging
markets, but it remains one of the favourites of private investors. Now that
unit trusts are so often bought in the form of Personal Equity Plans,
investors will naturally gravitate towards any sector which offers a higher-
than-average yield.
But the latest report from Fund Research shows what a difficult year it has
been. The average dividend paid by UK companies has fallen by 3.9 per cent.
Around 95 per cent of trusts in the sector have been forced to cut their
distributions over the last two years (a notable exception is the M &amp; G
Dividend fund, profiled on page IV).
The yield offered by the sector has dropped from 6.2 to 3.8 per cent over
the past 12 months, although that mainly reflects the enormous rise in share
prices since sterling left the Exchange Rate Mechanism (as share price rise,
yields fall and vice versa).
This shift has created a problem for the sector's fund managers. To qualify
as an equity income fund, they must produce a yield to investors which is
110 per cent above the All-Share. But this yield is measured after charges
and as equity yields have fallen, overcoming the charges hurdle has become
more and more difficult. Assuming an All-Share yield of 3.76 per cent, Fund
Research calculates that managers would have to invest in a portfolio
yielding 5.64 per cent to meet the target.
Some managers have attempted to bridge the gap by investing in fixed
interest securities and convertibles; others seem to have given up the ghost
altogether. Fund Research calculates less than half of the trusts in the
sector offer the requisite yield. The Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds is re-examining its guidelines, which might ease the
pressure on the managers.
There is some good news to report, however. High-yielding shares have
performed particularly well since Black Wednesday, and the average trust in
the UK equity income sector has outperformed both the All-Share and funds in
the UK equity growth sector.
Furthermore, Fund Research feels that, in terms of income, the worst is
behind the sector and investors can look forward to resumed growth in
distributions, although not at the rate which was achieved in the 1980s.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Markets: The bulls intend to go down fighting - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER spending the best part of a week biting their nails over the outcome
of the Nafta vote in the House of Representatives, US investors wasted
little time celebrating Wednesday's decision. Instead, they immediately
returned to what they had been doing for most of this month  - biting their
nails over the implications of rising long-term interest rates.
For several days the financial markets had been unsettled by the uncertainty
over whether the House would approve the legislative changes that paved the
way for implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade
pact was viewed as positive for stocks, because it should boost exports, and
for bonds, because removing trade barriers should help dampen inflationary
pressures in the world.
Although concern about the House vote showed more in bond prices than
stocks, some analysts were fearful that defeat for the President on Nafta
would have been sufficiently jarring to trigger a stampede out of stocks -
the kind that might have heralded the end of the long bull market in US
equities.
By Tuesday, however, sentiment in the House seemed to be shifting the
President's way, and optimism about the outcome fed through into the stock
markets. On Tuesday afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average closed above
3,700 for the first time, and investors had decided the time was right to
discount a pro-Nafta vote.
There was nothing unusual in that, except that by celebrating Nafta's
approval before the event, investors left themselves with no room to buy
stocks after the vote. As Michael Metz, the market strategist at broking
house Oppenheimer said on Tuesday night: 'If Nafta is approved, it (the
market) goes down quietly. If it is rejected, it goes down noisily.'
In the end, Nafta was approved by a comfortable margin, and the markets went
down, although not as quietly as Metz had anticipated. At one stage on
Thursday the Dow was down 35 points, before a late round of computerised
program buying helped the average finish the session only 20 points off on
the day.
It was a different story in the bond market, however. Like equities, bond
prices suffered from pre-Nafta nerves. Unlike equities, bond prices never
enjoyed the luxury of discounting a pro-Nafta vote. Instead, they fell
steadily throughout the week, under pressure not just from Nafta worries but
also from the latest evidence of a strengthening economy.
That evidence came in several forms, including: a rise in October industrial
production; a big decline in weekly jobless claims; fresh signs of recovery
in the housing market; improving business activity in the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank's district; and a jump in export sales.
The declines in bonds pushed long-term interest rates higher. This spooked
the stock markets, which worry that higher long-term interest rates will
choke of the supply of funds flowing into equities, as well as hinder
corporate profitability.
The fact that equity investors are choosing to mostly ignore the signs of an
improving economy, and focus instead upon rising interest rates, suggests
that the equity markets may undergoing an important transition.
For the past two and a half years investors have been buying stocks because
of declining interest rates. Now that interest rates appear to have bottomed
and are heading up again, investors will have to look to corporate profits
for inspiration.
At some point - and it has not yet been reached - the stock markets will
have to learn to live with higher interest rates, and start drawing strength
from the fact that the economy is getting stronger and corporate earnings
are improving.
Before they reach that point, however, the markets are going to have to give
up some ground. Stocks are just too expensive for the transition from an
interest rate-led market to a profits-led market to be a smooth one. Those
analysts who expect a correction are looking for a decline in the Dow in the
region of five per cent, or at least well below 3,600.
This may be an overly pessimistic outlook. Consider what happened yesterday.
The bond market, in the wake of yet more positive economic news, plunged,
pushing bond yields up to 6.35 per cent, their highest level since
mid-August.
The jump in bond yields hit the stock markets hard, but by midday the Dow
was down 20 points and rebounding from its lows, and a good deal of the
selling could be put down to trading related to the expiration of stock

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (3): He liked it so much, he wears the
company - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights
in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Joe Kanoui

JOE KANOUI adores luxury goods.
'If I were in the nail manufacturing business, I would be rich because I
would not buy so many of my products,' he says wistfully. 'But they are so
beautiful]'
It is just as well. Kanoui is chairman of the new Vendome luxury goods group
formed in August by putting together the luxury goods interests of
Richemont, the Swiss holding company based on the South African Rupert
family's Rothmans tobacco fortune.
The main components of Vendome are the legendary Cartier jewellery maker,
which has been rebuilt in the past two decades by Kanoui himself, and the
Dunhill tobacco and leather products company.
Kanoui, a French merchant banker by training, wears and carries goods made
by all the group's subsidiaries with enthusiasm, even a Dunhill pillbox 'now
that I am getting older.'
He decamped from Paris to Geneva in the late 1960s to set up his own
business. He soon found himself faced with the opportunity to reunite the
Paris, London and New York outlets of the venerable Louis Cartier jewellery
maker, which were under separate ownership.
It took him and his financial partners, who included the Rupert family, six
years to complete the restructuring, establishing a headquarters in Geneva
and concentrating the production back in Paris.
He has headed Cartier ever since, broadening its range to leather goods and
accessories and enlarging its retail network from 10 to 100 owned shops
around the world. Sales last year topped Pounds 700m.
Throughout the 1980s, both Rothmans and Cartier continued to expand their
luxury goods lines, adding such well known names as Piaget and Baume &amp;
Mercier (watches), Montblanc (pens), Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld (women's
fashions) and Hackett and Sulka (men's clothing).
Along the way, Kanoui has evolved something of a theory of luxury goods. He
attributes their popularity to 'man's basic need to affirm his identity, to
distinguish himself from others,' and cites the early and strong demand of
the Japanese for famous brand goods.
But, one objects, when so many Japanese women carry a Louis Vuitton bag,
where is the distinction? 'If you make something for all, it no longer has
luxury,' he replies without hesitation.
'Above all, you must avoid thinking that expensive things are necessarily
luxurious. Caviar, for example, is not a luxury good, merely an expensive
consumable.'
In his view, a genuine luxury product must be instantly recognisable, like a
Dunhill lighter or a Mont Blanc pen, and it must be authentic, rooted in
history, like the bejewelled Cartier panthers.
Obviously, luxury goods must be of the highest quality, made to endure. He
claims to have a watch his grandfather bought from Louis Cartier himself -
and it still works. 'I hate throwaway things, like matches,' he says.
He recalls Cartier eight years ago making a key case for a Rolls-Royce car
owner. It was fashioned in the shape of the car, with diamonds for
headlights, rubies for rear lights, and sapphires for door handles.
'It probably cost as much as the car, but it will turn up in Sotheby
auctions long after the car has disappeared.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (4): From hippy to head man - Alice

high-profile world of luxury goods / Jean-Louis Dumas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THESE DAYS Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman of Hermes, looks like one of his
company's own best advertisements with his hand-made Hermes ties tucked
neatly into immaculately-tailored suits.
Things were very different back in the 1960s when Dumas, then a young law
graduate, set off with Rena, his wife, in their battered old Citroen 2CV to
follow the hippy trail to Kathmandu. He paid for the trip with the pittance
he earned by writing articles for the Pakistan Times.
Dumas, 55, bears few traces of his hippy youth. He might have inherited his
position at Hermes - as one of the 17 great-grandchildren of Emile Hermes,
the Parisian tanner who founded the company in 1837 - but he learnt the
luxury trade the hard way.
He began with a two year apprenticeship as an assistant buyer at
Bloomingdales, one of the biggest and brashest of the New York stores. He
left Manhattan for the more rarefied atmosphere of Hermes in 1964 and by
1978 had become chairman and chief executive.
His timing could scarcely have been better. He took over the family company
on the eve of the 1980s boom. He masterminded its transformation from its
original base, as a Paris leather goods maker, into one of the world's most
successful luxury goods groups.
Dumas expanded Hermes without compromising its reputation for quality. He
might have made more money in the short term had he licensed its name to
other manufacturers. But he realised that the key to Hermes' long term
success was its exclusive air.
He was right. Hermes has weathered the recession better than most of its
competitors. It has also emerged unscathed from the swing in consumer taste
away from the excesses of the 1980s, back to the idealistic ethos of Dumas'
youth.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (5): Secret behind Chanel's success - Alice
Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the
high-profile world of luxury goods / Alain Wertheimer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAIN Wertheimer is one of the richest and most powerful men in the luxury
industry, yet almost nothing is known about him. Wertheimer is the sole
owner of Chanel, the Paris fashion house founded in Deauville during the
First World War by Coco Chanel which is the role model for luxury companies
worldwide.
Yet while his peers blow air kisses to their favourite designers from the
front rows of the couture shows, Wertheimer has done everything he can to
ensure that he is left to lead his life - and run his business - in deepest
secrecy.
Wertheimer never gives interviews. There is no reference to him in the
French Who's Who. Chanel (ever so politely) refuses to release any
information about its owner. It even pays a special annual fee so that the
accounts of its Swiss holding company are free from public scrutiny.
This super-secretive style seems to have done no harm to Wertheimer, nor to
Chanel, in the publicity-hungry world of luxury. When he took over Chanel in
1974 its only real asset was Chanel No 5, which had been one of the world's
best-selling perfumes ever since its launch in 1924 when Pierre Wertheimer,
Alain's grandfather and one of Coco's admirers, bought the rights to her
first fragrance. But the fashion house itself was, as an editor of the era
put it, like 'Seconal City' with 'one foot in the grave and another on a
banana peel'.
Wertheimer's solution was to appoint Karl Lagerfeld, the German, as chief
designer of Chanel. The theory was that Lagerfeld's collections would bring
back Chanel's elan and generate pages of free publicity, allowing Wertheimer
to make even more money by selling its scents and accessories.
The theory has paid off. Wertheimer has turned Chanel into a company with
sales of around Dollars 500m (Pounds 331.1m) a year - without forfeiting his
privacy.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (2): Arnault proves worth the wait - Alice
Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the
high-profile world of luxury goods / Bernard Arnault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE is almost always an irritating delay before the beginning of any Paris
haute couture collection, but the audience at this summer's Christian
Lacroix show was forced to wait for even longer than usual.
Eventually a slim figure edged his way to one of the little gilt chairs on
the front row. Bernard Arnault had finally arrived and the Lacroix show
could start in earnest.
Arnault, 44, is chairman of LVMH, the company behind a string of prestigious
products from Hennessy cognac and Christian Dior cosmetics to Christian
Lacroix couture. He made his name in the 1980s as one of the bright young
entrepreneurs who sprang from the bureaucratic ranks of French industry and
is now established as one of the most powerful people in luxury goods.
In the early days Arnault was best known for the ruthlessness with which he
fought - and won - the battle for control of LVMH. He then went on, with his
army of accountants, to shake up the business by scrutinising
once-sacrosanct expense claims and hiring, or firing, designers. One
employee recalled asking him out to lunch only to be told, 'But what would
we have to talk about?' Others remember, or would rather forget, his
constant home telephone calls even on Christmas Day.
These days Arnault stresses the softer side of his nature. His publicists
are fond of saying that he always really wanted to be a concert pianist, as
if the LVMH chairman had stumbled into the grubby world of business by
accident.
But the ruthlessness is still there, as his rivals at Yves Saint-Laurent
discovered this summer. YSL has been mired in law suits since the French
champagne industry objected to the name of its new fragrance, Champagne. And
who runs the biggest champagne business in France? Arnault.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (6): Smooth progress to the top of his
trade - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in
the high-profile world of luxury goods / Naim Attallah
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time that Naim Attallah walked into Asprey of Bond Street was back
in 1971 when he went there to buy a carriage clock for his wife. He fell
into conversation with the shop assistant, a young man named John Asprey,
who persuaded his father to offer Attallah a job.
Attallah, 61, is now the chief executive of the Asprey group. He is best
known as the indulgent owner of the Literary Review and of Quartet Books and
as a publisher with a penchant for employing blue-blooded gels.
Yet he has been involved with Asprey since the early 1970s, initially as a
consultant and latterly as the architect of its expansion from the original
Bond Street gift shop into a fully-fledged luxury goods group. Asprey today
includes a string of prestigious businesses, from Mappin &amp; Webb, the
silversmith; to Garrard, the crown jeweller; Watches of Switzerland, the
watch shops; and a stake in Tomasz Starzewski, designer darling of London's
ladies-who-lunch.
Naim Attallah still prefers to see himself as a patron of the arts, rather
than a businessman, but seems to revel in his role at Asprey. His new
responsibilities seem to have done nothing to diminish his enthusiastic
manner, nor to cramp his style. He still appears at his office each morning
in his customary uniform of odd socks, knuckle-dusting rings, a (very
expensive) watch on each wrist and a psychedelic silk tie.
A quick glance at Asprey's accounts justifies his joie de vivre. Asprey of
Bond Street has always concentrated on the very top of the luxury market by
becoming the gift shop for the fabulously wealthy Asian industrialists and
Arab aristocrats.
Asprey has been sheltered from the problems that have beset its competitors
for years and Naim Attallah, reluctant businessman though he may be, has
done deal after deal to take it into yet more areas of the luxury goods
business.

FT  20 NOV 93 / If my memoirs serve me well ..: The Westland affair is now
seen as the turning point in Margaret Thatcher's career as prime minister.
What really happened? Malcolm Rutherford compares her ministers' competing
accounts of one fateful meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE middle of 1985 parts of the British government became embroiled in a
small argument about helicopters which, by the turn of the year, almost
brought about the downfall of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister.
As Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, wrote in this space a month ago
in his review of Lady Thatcher's The Downing Street Years: 'In many ways,
the turning point of her tenure was the Westland affair.'
Westland was a small aircraft company desperately in search of orders.
Michael Heseltine, the defence secretary, saw the solution in a European
consortium. Leon Brittan, the secretary of state for trade and industry,
preferred to let the Westland management go its own way and seek
arrangements with the American company, Sikorsky, and the Italian Fiat. The
affair led to the resignation of both ministers, and perhaps had other
consequences besides.
At least a dozen former cabinet ministers have given accounts and
recollections in their memoirs. Lord Howe's will be published next year. The
outstanding omissions are the principal protagonists, Heseltine and Brittan.
Even without them, however, there is some intriguing material.
What follows is not an attempt to make a political point, still less to
reconstruct in any detail what really happened, but simply to draw attention
to the frailty of human memory and the way different people have recorded
the same event.
Nicholas Ridley, the transport secretary and a man who liked to regard
himself as especially close to the prime minister, got the date wrong. 'I
have a clear memory of the first cabinet in 1986 after the Christmas recess,
on January 16,' he wrote in his book 'My Style of Government': the Thatcher
Years. In fact, the crucial cabinet meeting, during which Heseltine left the
government, took place on January 9.
Where Ridley comes closer to the general consensus is in noting that it was
'one of the most extraordinary events I have ever witnessed.'
Some cabinet ministers did not even get to see it. Lord Hailsham, the lord
chancellor, recalls airily in his memoirs A Sparrow's Flight: 'I was not
present on the famous occasion when Michael Heseltine stormed out of cabinet
and announced his resignation on the steps of Number 10 since my duties had
taken me to Delhi at the time to attend a Commonwealth meeting of Speakers
or law ministers.'
The only moral Hailsham can draw from what he calls 'histrionic performances
of this nature' is that 'they should not normally happen without a formal
discussion based on one or more cabinet papers'. He adds helpfully: 'My own
view is that, on taking office, cabinet ministers should be given a short
formal induction course in staff duties by the Sir Humphrey Applebys of the
system. I learned mine in the war.'
Lord Young, the employment secretary, was almost not there. He was on
holiday in the Caribbean when the call to the meeting came. He was told that
he could be excused but 'gained the impression that Mrs Thatcher would need
all the friends she could get'.
In his book The Enterprise Years: A Businessman in the Cabinet he tells of
how he chartered an aircraft to Miami which nearly crashed on take-off. In
Miami he found that the credit limit on his Visa card did not stretch to a
seat on Concorde. Lord Young made a scene, prayed to Lord King, chairman of
British Airways, and was allowed on board.
Norman Fowler, the social services secretary, might as well not have been
there. He recalls in Ministers Decide: A Memoir of the Thatcher Years that
he was in Washington on official business when he received the summons to
the cabinet meeting. He arrived back in London at 10 pm on Wednesday January
8 and was briefed (not very well, it seems) on the car phone.
At the meeting next morning, Fowler was 'still slightly jet-lagged.' 'I sat
in my usual place,' he notes, 'three or four down from the centre of the
table facing the prime minister. On my immediate right sat Michael
Heseltine. Although ending in unprecedented drama it was at no stage a
stormy meeting.' Fowler was still puzzling about some earlier remarks 'when
Michael's folder closed and he left the table'.
At least Fowler had the excuse that since he had not been a member of a
cabinet committee on Westland, he could not be expected to know too much
about it, though he might have read about it in the newspapers.
Another man who may have dozed off with rather less excuse was Lord
Whitelaw, the leader of the House of Lords and deputy leader of the
Conservative Party.
Whitelaw admits in his own Memoirs to having become 'bored and irritated' by
the Westland affair very early on. He writes that he thought the problems of
the Westland Aircraft Company were being tackled by a 'powerful new
chairman, Sir John Cuckney.'
'As 1985 drew to a close,' he goes on: 'I could never understand why the
government should dispute the Westland board's judgment under Sir John.'
According to Lord Lawson's book, which we shall come to later, Whitelaw had
become jaundiced by Heseltine some years earlier for bringing 'modern
gimmicks like massive computer print-outs to to the cabinet table and
generally trying to blind us with science'.
Of the famous meeting on January 9, Whitelaw remarks: 'I was thus surprised
and amazed when he (Heseltine) decided to walk out of the cabinet.' Then, in
a typical Whitelawism, he adds: 'I regretted his departure, because it takes
all sorts to make a cabinet.' He concludes, in sharp contrast from some
others: 'It was one of those incidents which, despite the furore at the
time, had no lasting impact.'
Nevertheless, Whitelaw confesses subsequently to blaming himself for what
happened. He did not play his normal role of conciliator because he says he
plainly believed one side to be right. With hindsight he should have 'helped
the prime minister more by stressing the vital doctrine of cabinet
responsibility . . . I should have realised earlier that Michael Heseltine
was labouring under what he regarded as a genuine grievance at a time when I
thought he had merely become obsessed with his own proposals and arguments.'
Certainly other, younger cabinet ministers were struck by Whitelaw's
passivity. Kenneth Baker as environment secretary was the most junior member
of the cabinet at the time. For him January 9 was going to be an important
day anyway. He was due to present his green paper on 'Paying for Local
Government' (ie the poll tax), which was perhaps why other ministers were
prepared to give the meeting a miss: Fowler in particular suggests that he
might not have returned from Washington for the original cabinet agenda.
When the agenda was changed and the January 9 meeting went awry, Baker notes
in The Turbulent Years: My Life in Politics: 'I was amazed that not one of
the experienced older ministers such as Willie Whitelaw, Quinton Hogg or
Geoffrey Howe, who had heard these exchanges, said or did anything to avert
Michael's walkout.'
Either Baker or Hogg has made some mistake for, as we have seen, Hogg
(otherwise known as Lord Hailsham) has said he was in Delhi not Downing
Street. Lord Whitelaw has stated the reasons for his own reticence. Whether
Howe could have intervened effectively, given the deteriorating relations
with the prime minister, is questionable, though we must await his account.
Yet Baker offers some corroborative evidence on what happened. He writes
that while the first 30 minutes of the discussion had gone reasonably well,
'new life was breathed into the whole issue by Nick Ridley intervening about
the ministerial statements that Michael had made off his own bat'. This,
Baker suggests, is what led to the climax. Baker's account here is backed by
Ridley several times over.
The prime minister had said that Heseltine should make no further statements
on his own account without clearance by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert
Armstrong.
In My Style of Government, Ridley wrote of Heseltine's resistance to the new
ruling: 'This was too much for me. I immediately challenged him on the lines
that if we who held one view were to conform, surely he who held the
opposite view should conform too? Michael Jopling (then the agriculture
minister) came in behind me, and then I pressed him a third time. Twice he
refused to agree. At the third time of asking, he closed his cabinet folder
and said, 'I cannot accept this decision. I must therefore leave this
cabinet.' He stormed out, and announced his resignation to some startled
journalists waiting in Downing Street.'
The problem with the Ridley version of events, however, is that it omits
most of the undercurrents. Ridley may have lit the fuse, but the few who
were close to events had a pretty good idea that drama was under way.
The fullest accounts of the Westland affair by cabinet ministers are those
by Lady Thatcher in The Downing Street Years and by Lord Lawson, who was
chancellor of the exchequer, at the time, in The View From No 11. They are
quite different from the rest in that they go into the background and help
to explain the scene that burst on an astonished cabinet.
As both Lawson and Lady Thatcher make clear, there had been several meetings
between senior ministers about Westland since mid-June 1985. Norman Tebbit,
who was then secretary of state for trade and industry, had been instructed
to encourage the Bank of England to bring together the company's main
creditors with the aim of finding new management: hence the emergence of Sir
John Cuckney.
The trouble was that all sorts of other issues became intertwined. Lady
Thatcher calls this section of her memoirs 'Keeps Raining All The Time'. The
Tory Party was going through one of its periodic bouts of unpopularity.
First there was the cabinet reshuffle in September. Norman Tebbit moved
(willingly) from the DTI to the party chairmanship; Leon Brittan moved
(rather less willingly) from Home Secretary to be Tebbit's replacement. Most
of the memoirs agree that being taken out of the Home Office  -
traditionally one of the great offices of state  - gave Brittan a sense of
insecurity.
Then there was the prime minister's rising impatience with the ministry of
defence, especially over its failure to deliver the Nimord early warning
system at the right time and the right price.
Not least there was Michael Heseltine. Cecil Parkinson writes in his
autobiography Right at the Centre that 'Michael detested Mrs Thatcher.' For
her part, she was none too sure about Michael, although she pays him a
generous enough tribute in her memoirs: 'Michael is one of the most talented
people in politics . . . Michael and I are similar in some ways, very
different in others.' She adds that Heseltine's personality alone  - 'not
mine or any other member of the government's - provided a kind of
explanation for what arose'.
It was when Heseltine insisted on seeking a European solution in spite of
the installation of new management at Westland that the warning signals
should have gone out loud and clear. They went to very few people.
Lawson, who as chancellor was naturally opposed to spending government
money, records the meeting of the economic affairs committee of the cabinet
on December 9, at which Cuckney was present for part of the time. According
to Lawson, the committee was offended by the prime minister bringing in
outsiders. 'Margaret was visibly shaken by the degree of support, which
included Norman Tebbit, for Michael's plea to be given a chance. While the
balance of argument was clearly against Michael, sentiment was with him.'
The prime minister subsequently played with the idea of sacking Heseltine,
but decided it would be impolitic to do so.
To cap it all, just before the January 9 meeting there was a huge row
between the chancellor and the prime minister over exchange rate policy.
Again very few members of the cabinet knew about it. On January 8, Lawson
agreed with Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, that
interest rates should be raised from 11 1/2 to 12 1/2 per cent 'forthwith'.
The prime minister eventually acceded to their virtual ultimatum that rates
should go up but, in Lawson's words, only after 'prolonged resistance' and
with 'conspicuously bad grace'.
This was hardly the best atmosphere on the eve of a cabinet meeting which
practically all the participants were to agree was the most remarkable they
had ever attended.
Lady Thatcher has a different view.
She writes magisterially in The Downing Street Years: 'I have learnt that
other colleagues at the meeting (on January 9) were stunned about what had
happened. I was not. Michael had made his decision and that was that. I
already knew whom I wanted to succeed him at defence: George Younger.' (It
remains unclear whether Younger had been advised in advance).
On the question of whether Heseltine went to the meeting having decided in
advance to resign, Lady Thatcher does not know. The only memoir which claims
that he did is Ridley's, and even that is with hindsight. 'At the time,'
Ridley wrote, 'I came to the conclusion that he was obsessed by his desire
for the European solution . . . I think in retrospect he was determined on
taking a course of action that would lead to a spectacular resignation, and
that this was the best issue he was able to find . . . He thought that the
next election might well be a disaster and he wanted . . . to distance
himself from a sinking ship.'
Lady Thatcher, incidentally, does not support the Ridley claim that it was
he who made the decisive intervention. According to her version, most of the
crucial talking was done by Heseltine and herself. 'I emphasised the
importance of observing collective responsibility . . . At this Michael
Heseltine erupted . . . He could not accept the decision recorded in my
summing up. He must therefore leave the cabinet. He gathered his papers
together and left a cabinet united against him.'
Then, she writes, she called a short break and walked through to the private
office. 'Nigel Wicks, my principal private secretary, brought George Younger
out; I offered him, and he accepted, the defence post. I asked my office to
telephone Malcolm Rifkind to offer him George's former post of Scottish
Secretary, which he too subsequently accepted. We contacted the Queen to ask
her approval of these appointments. Then I returned to cabinet, continued
the business and by the end of the meeting I was able to announce George
Younger's appointment. Within the cabinet at least all had been settled.'
No-one else records events going as smoothly as that. Lord Young, who like
some of his colleagues may have been nodding off, 'suddenly noticed that
Michael had closed his papers'. Young reports Heseltine's parting words as
'Prime Minister, if this is how it is to be, I can no longer serve in your
cabinet.' He adds that after an embarrassed silence the cabinet carried on
with the next item on the agenda. The coffee break was called a few minutes
later after a private secretary had passed a note to the prime minister.
Young gave a more colourful account to Alan Clark, then his junior minister,
by lunch-time. 'David recounted to me the scene,' say the Clark Diaries for
January 9. 'Michael appears to have done it semi-spastically, not the grand
geste. When he slammed his brief shut and walked out a lot of people just
thought that he'd been a bit rude and then gone out to the loo. But the
photographers were all waiting in Downing Street, so he must have tipped
them off in advance.'
Lord Lawson has it that the prime minister had set out to 'humiliate'
Michael in the full knowledge that this would almost certainly lead to his
resignation. At the January 9 meeting, Heseltine 'spoke quietly, and not at
all aggressively, and sought to find some compromise arrangement. But
Margaret was adamant. She could see that Michael was now isolated in cabinet
. . . She pressed home her advantage; whereupon Michael slammed his cabinet
folder shut, saying 'If this is the way this government is going to be
conducted, I no longer wish to be part of it', picked the folder up and
strode out of the room.'
Lawson adds that in the 'stunned silence that followed' the prime minister
announced a short break for coffee. This, according to Lawson, was to enable
her to brief Bernard Ingham, her press secretary.
Kenneth Baker has Heseltine closing his red ministerial folder 'with
dignity' and his parting words as: 'There has been a breakdown of collective
responsibility and I must therefore leave the cabinet.' At the coffee break,
he writes, Willie Whitelaw, John Wakeham (the chief whip) and George Younger
stayed behind in the cabinet room. I had the distinct feeling that the
defence secretary's vacancy had not caught them unawares.'
In the Norman Fowler account, Heseltine 'quietly closed his folder, said he
could not continue as a cabinet member, and walked to the door . . . Cabinet
continued in a rather shell-shocked way for another 90 minutes. The only
unusual feature was that we were given an unprecedented coffee break after
Geoffrey Howe had finished his report on international affairs . . .
Michael's resignation had taken everyone, including the press, by surprise.
He had left Downing Street with only a solitary photographer there to record
the moment.'
One account by someone not present at the cabinet meeting, but who was
certainly close by, comes from Bernhard Ingham in his book Kill the
Messenger. When Heseltine walked out of cabinet on Thursday 9 January 1986,
he records, 'I had to dispatch every press officer into Whitehall to try to
establish what he had said from reporters telephoning their copy from kiosks
. . . His resignation took us by surprise.'
Ingham adds that he had a telephone call from his brother from his farm in
the upland Pennines saying: 'All you silly bloody lot down there have gone
daft.'
And There is a footnote from somebody who was certainly present, but will
not write about it. The now Lord Armstrong told me the following weekend
that the prime minister tried to make light of the matter by saying after
the walkout: 'Now let's talk about something simple, like the common
agricultural policy.' But even the cabinet secretary thought that it was the
most extraordinary meeting he had ever attended.

WE CAN'T even rely on inflation as one of the fixtures of the British
economy any more. This week the forecasters were confounded once again as
the underlying rate of inflation unexpectedly tumbled by half a percentage
point for the October measurement, at just 2.8 per cent.
Perhaps even stranger has been the behaviour of the labour market, where
annual earnings growth has dropped further to 3 per cent although
unemployment fell last month.
Such news has been enough to propel the gilt-edged market to new highs (or,
in yield terms, lows). Last April in this column I speculated on the
possibility that gilts might enjoy another annus mirabilis as they last did
back in 1982. That year, long-dated government bonds produced a total return
of 54 per cent as yields tumbled from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent. Perhaps 1993
cannot be so good but it is nevertheless shaping up impressively, with a
total return so far of close to 30 per cent. Such a performance has left the
16 per cent return on the All-Share Index lagging far behind.
Investors in equities cannot think of low inflation as an unqualified
benefit. Historically the valuation basis has often been higher at times of
low inflation. But low price increases may reflect the inability of
companies to pass on costs. This appears to be especially true of retailing
in the UK at present: as for manufacturing, look at the dull figures
produced this week by well-managed manufacturing groups such as Courtaulds
and BOC. The latter warned that it feels unable to raise its next dividend,
for the first time in 20 years.
When pay inflation is low, so is dividend inflation likely to be: over the
past year dividends on the All-Share Index have fallen by more than 3 per
cent, although there is a small net gain allowing for the damage done by the
change in dividend tax last spring.
A bond market surge on the current scale happens because there is a
fundamental reappraisal of the prospects for inflation. Back in the early
1980s it was tumbling from 20 per cent to the 4 or 5 per cent it sustained
through the mid-1980s (before the Lawson boom took hold). This time it has
started quite low but it may be going much lower.
The traditional inflationary engines of the British economy appear to have
stalled. The labour market is lifeless, the housing market is drifting
sideways along the bottom. In the past inflation has been persistent because
governments, when faced with awkward choices, were willing to accommodate
these inflationary pressures by allowing the money supply to expand. The
inflation of the late 1980s, for instance, developed entirely out of the
private sector's credit explosion; at the time, the government was actually
running a budget surplus.
Now monetary growth is comparatively weak - about 4 per cent annually on the
broad money definition, M4. It does not indicate inflationary problems
during the next year or two. If inflation were to return it would be for a
different reason, that the government had lost control of its finances, and
was being forced to pay its debts by writing cheques through the banks
without funding the payments through gilt sales. In the circumstances broad
money growth would accelerate to maybe 15 per cent and sterling would begin
to collapse.
Bill Martin, the gloomy economist at UBS, has been running this kind of
scenario through a computer model. If the government cannot rise to the
challenge of imposing a massive Pounds 40bn tax increase, he says, it will
be overwhelmed by the twin budget and balance of payments deficits. The only
way out will be through devaluation and inflation, which will return to a
Lawson-style 10 per cent within five years. Such price rises, he says, would
impose a severe inflation 'tax' on the kinds of investors who this week
pushed long gilt-edged yields down to scarcely more than 7 per cent.
Most of the computers have been giving erratic predictions lately, but can
it really be true that bond investors are being caught in a trap? In the
short run inflation goes down and down and they are forced to accept lower
and lower interest rates (and higher and higher bond prices). In the medium
term, however, the economic contradictions look almost irresolvable, except
at the expense of those bond investors.
This is not just a British problem, of course; the current global borrowing
binge promises plenty of similar crises, with ten-year bond yields in Spain,
Italy and Belgium running higher than in the UK. Even in the US there are
newsletter jeremiahs predicting that it will end in hyperinflation.
The questions tend to focus on whether governments can find enough finance
to fund their ambitions, and at what price, but it may be that the problem
is really the other way round: there is so much money easily available that
governments are encouraged to undertax and overborrow.
Government bond markets have fused around the time zones into a global
casino worth many trillions of dollars. These international investors do not
have any votes, but the crucial question is whether nevertheless they have a
measure of political power. By suddenly withdrawing support from a national
bond market they could cause embarrassing weakness in the currency and force
the government in question to pay more for its money.
Wednesday's austerity package from the Belgian government, the EU's most
heavily indebted, was at least partly a response to distress signals from
the financial markets. To stay in the game, governments are under pressure
to pursue acceptable policies. But what happens when the limit is reached?
The comforting aspect for investors in British government bonds is that
there are other countries that will be earlier in the firing line. We should
get an early warning of the kind of minefield that might lie ahead. In the
meantime, let the good times roll.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (1): Dedicated borrower of fashion . . . -
Lucia van der Post goes to Paris in search of the elite, elusive haute
couture customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST be delightful to be Eleonore de Rohan-Chabot. In the lottery that we
call life, Eleonore seems to have drawn only winning tickets. The pretty
21-year-old, married to handsome 31-year-old Comte de Rohan-Chabot, already
has her own TV show, dresses in the finest clothes that money can buy and
yet does not have to pay a penny for them.
For Eleonore is one of an elite group of young French women who have only to
lift the telephone to borrow a dress for a special occasion. 'All my
friends,' she tells me breezily, 'borrow couture. Les Maisons de Couture
like their clothes to be seen out and about on young people.' Not all young
people, bien sur - only those who are attractive to look at, well-connected
and can take their borrowed clothes to the sort of places and parties where
the houses would like them to be seen.
For every couture house in Paris needs more customers, and they need young
customers most of all. As the numbers of genuine couture customers diminish,
as the life-styles that required couture dresses disappear, all the houses
are chasing the same 200 women in the world, all that is left, calculates
Catherine Riviere, Directrice de Haute Couture at Chanel, of that privileged
band that once patronised the grand couturiers.
It is a cut-throat business, finding new clients. It cannot be left to
chance. Houses peruse the business pages of the serious journals, scour
lists of the richest people in the world and issue flattering invitations to
those that are known to have the wherewithal, and could possibly be
persuaded to have the inclination, to buy. And, it seems, they send their
clothes out and about on the social scene on free loans hoping to catch the
eye of the rich and well-connected.
The nature of the haute couture customer has changed over the years. There
are, of course, fewer of them. Just a few years ago there were, according to
the houses, some 3,000-4,000 customers shared between 20 houses. Where once
the grand society woman would probably patronise a single house, buying from
it all her serious sartorial needs, today she shops around.
Riviere says that couture customers no longer buy for special events.
'Unless it is for a wedding.' Couture has had to adapt to suit the changing
lives of customers. 'Today they travel so much, they need easy pieces. There
are not so many grand parties. Our faithful customers buy between one or two
garments a season, an average of five a year, probably three suits and two
dresses. Once they get used to haute couture it is like a drug - nothing
else will do.'
A suit will cost around FFr100,000 (Pounds 11,600) a dress 'without
embroideries' around FFr80,000, an evening dress anything between FFr150,000
and FFr300,000. If all that sounds expensive remember that something like
130 hours will go into the making of a jacket, 40 into a skirt and personal
fittings are on offer until perfection is achieved. Catherine Riviere. says:
'When we get to know them very well and have their mannequin then we can do
much of the fitting on that.'
The couture customer today not only buys from more than one house but she
has plenty of pret-a-porter labels in her wardrobe as well.
So who exactly are they - these few hundred women in the world privileged
enough to be able to buy the most luxurious clothes in the world?
'Please Chanel,' I had said to their London office, 'find me a haute couture
customer to talk to, a real live example of this vanishing breed.'
They found me Eleonore. Exquisitely pretty, blonde, flawless skin, tall,
fine-boned. Papa is the Marquis de Galard Terraube which meant that when it
came to her recent marriage she was able to offer the sort of impeccable
lineage that makes Almanac de Gotha families feel at home.
Then, of course, the chateau with its parc, which has been part of the
family fiefdom since the Middle Ages, provided a perfect setting for the
celebrations of nuptials which were generally agreed to have constituted the
wedding of the year in France. A wedding, which as Point de Vue put it, was
'forcement grand.' Paris-Match, Point de Vue, Gala, (the Hello] set of the
French press) all went to town, breathless at the deliciousness of it all.
Once a week on her own television show, Eleonore interviews celebrities. And
in the time left over from being a TV celebrity, and a fashionable wife, she
studies law at Assas university. In due course she intends to become a
lawyer.
She is also very, very nice. Not an immodest word passes her lips.
'Tell me Eleonore,' I beg, 'tell me about these grand parties that these
clothes you borrow go to.'
Not a whisper.
'We mostly go out to restaurants and then I would probably wear something
black. I hate mini-skirts as I never know where to put my legs. I like a
long dress or pants though I love to bare my neck and shoulders.'
'What about the entertaining you do?' I venture. 'Surely you have to dress
up for that?'
'Well, we live in a very small flat - just two small rooms so we don't
entertain very much. I only dress in couture for special occasions. My
clothes come from all over the place. I often buy vetements d'occasion
(secondhand clothing) in Guerrisold in the Barbes (an immigrant district
renowned for its markets). I often buy coats there though this winter Dior
has given me a coat so I don't have to buy one.'
Today, for instance, she is wearing black leggings from she can't remember
where, her husband's white shirt, a little black waistcoat, 'very important
to me, waistcoats', a long black cardigan and high heeled boots.
'I mix in three different worlds - one is the world of students, the other
is my husband's world (he is a financier 10 years older than she is) and the
other is the world of tv. I need different wardrobes for each of them. For
my student life I wear leggings and jeans, cardigans and waistcoats. Now
that I am married I can't dress like a little girl. I have to dress more
soberly. My husband loves me in haute couture. I have never worked before
and now that I have to develop a professional working relationship with my
colleagues I have to dress accordingly. For my shows I usually wear
designer-label pret-a-porter.'
'So,' I press her, 'would you like to buy haute couture, can you imagine
doing it?'
'Oh, yes, it is a dream for me. I like very simple things and la simplicite
ne supporte pas la mediocrite. The quality of the materials is so beautiful,
the work is all done by hand and it makes me feel more beautiful. It is like
wearing another skin. I dream one day of buying a very special dress but for
the moment I must keep my feet on the ground.'
The habit of couture, the addiction if you like, runs in families.
Eleonore's mother was a Dior model who was able to buy Dior clothes at a
discount so Eleonore, of course, grew up knowing all about couture (and its
discount possibilities). Eleonore loves Chanel and Dior in particular and
always goes to their shows.
'There are many imitations of Chanel but they don't compare with the real
thing. Chanel has the simple style I love. Givenchy, too, is beautiful but I
think it is a little older.'
Today in the haute couture salon at Chanel's Paris headquarters in the Rue
Cambon, Eleonore is trying on the dress of her dreams. She has a big charity
ball to attend at Versailles, at which the Queen of Denmark will be present,
and it will be a glittering opportunity to show off the talents of the House
of Chanel. Exquisitely simple, as is her taste, it is a feather-light drift
of navy-blue chiffon. She will wear it very simply. 'I think I am too young
to wear huge jewellery and because this dress is very simple and fluid it
should look very natural. I will wear it with high heels, my hair very lache
and very little make-up.'
She does indeed look a picture. Papa, the Marquis de Galard Terraube, thinks
she looks so lovely in it that he decides to buy the dress for her and it is
now her very own. No longer will she have to rely on borrowing from the
couture houses. Eleonore de Rohan-Chabot finally has become a real haute
couture customer.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Yeltsin acts to protect business at local banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, bowing to the demands of powerful Russian banks
three weeks before parliamentary elections, has banned most foreign banks
licensed to do business in Russia from dealing with Russian customers until
January 1996.
The ban, described yesterday by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, as
'gentle protectionism', affects all banks in Russia that are more than 50
per cent foreign-owned and have not begun serving residents  - the label for
Russian-registered companies, including lucrative joint ventures.
The decree reverses the terms of most of the licences given to about a dozen
western banks in the last few months by the Russian central bank, which
favours foreign competition as a means of improving the performance of
Russian banks.
Only a few western banks' subsidiaries, such as Credit Lyonnais Russie and
BNP-Dresdner Bank Rossija, are already open for business and have Russian
customers.
Most of the others, such as Chase Manhattan of the US, have not yet started
their planned subsidiaries but had intended to do so in the next few months.
The decree means they may be able to serve only foreign companies and
individuals  - operating on an offshore basis.
Chase insisted: 'We believe it won't affect us, because we received our
licence before the cut-off date.' However, like other US banks which have
already received licences to operate in Russia, it had yet to see the
details of the decree.
The banks' plans in Russia are based largely on acting for clients elsewhere
in the world who want to trade with or invest in the country. However,
business with Russian customers also figures as a high priority.
Although Russia is not the only country to impose such restrictions, they
mark a rethink of the government's earlier unbridled liberalism. Moreover,
the decree reverses commitments made by a state which is desperately trying
to bolster foreign investor confidence.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard though it is to credit, Tiphook appears to have achieved something
positive. News of the proposed sale of its container division to
Transamerica Corporation for Pounds 830m left market watchers boggle-eyed
when it flashed up on trading screens. Transamerica seems willing to pay an
astonishing premium to control strategic assets.
Even if the sale is completed, however, Tiphook will remain miserably placed
with a loss-making trailer business and some Pounds 400m of debt. The sale's
premium to book value will be whittled away by trading losses leaving
shareholders' funds of perhaps Pounds 200m by the year-end. By Tiphook's
standards, the resultant 200 per cent gearing would appear almost normal.
The company would have a fighting chance of evading a wholesale financial
restructuring although it would need to squeeze cash with a rare ferocity.
The chief worry would be Tiphook's remaining capital expenditure
commitments, although it may be possible to reschedule payments. The
lingering recession in mainland Europe, where Tiphook is heavily exposed,
could also frustrate its hopes.
Tiphook's secured creditors will be mightily relieved if the sale is
secured. Equity holders, though, will want to comb the accompanying circular
before deciding what to do. Theoretically, Tiphook could yet emerge as an
attractively-geared recovery stock. Yet given bitter experience, retaining
the shares would be a bold bet.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be much ranting and raving before Parliament changes the
legislation affecting Sunday trading. But whatever the outcome, investors in
the retailing sector will lose little by plugging their ears. Some evidence
suggests total consumer spending would rise as a result of deregulation. A
contentious study, commissioned by the Home Office, forecast that 19,000
jobs would be lost and prices would fall as more sales were won by efficient
multiple chains. Even if correct, these considerations are marginal when set
against the bigger forces shaping the industry. The overall impact of
deregulation is likely to prove inconsequential.
That is clearly not true for some individual sectors, such as DIY. But
despite the moralistic rationalisations, the main division between retailers
about whether to open boils down to crude self-interest. By and large, those
shops which find it economic to trade on Sundays are already doing so. In
Scotland, where Sunday trading is unrestricted, only about 25 per cent of
retail space opens on the sabbath. In England and Wales, that figure now
amounts to about 29 per cent. Deregulation would probably just formalise the
existing arrangements.
The big grocery chains would continue to open seven days a week to help
defray the heavy overhead costs of their superstores. But the exercise is
proving only marginally profitable. Other big retailers, such as Marks and
Spencer, Sears, and Burton, which trade chiefly on the high street, may only
find it worthwhile to open on Sundays in the run-up to Christmas.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's setback for the equity market shows just how nervous investors
have become ahead of the budget. The week's slew of economic statistics gave
weight to the idea that the UK is growing without reigniting inflation, a
combination of circumstances which should be favourable for equities. Low
inflation helps justify low gilt and equity yields, while growth promises
that earnings recovery will eventually arrive. The combination is not,
perhaps, as surprising as it first appears. The large output gap in the UK
and the productivity rise which accompanies the early stages of recovery
tend to keep cost-push inflation down.
Yet equities have already discounted a great deal of good news. Against that
the Budget could hurt the market both by damaging consumer confidence in the
vital four weeks before Christmas, and if the tax benefits of pensions come
under renewed fire. Fund managers' pips have thus far notably failed to
squeak, but the policy is not without cost. This week saw both Whitbread and
Cable &amp; Wireless resuming pension fund contributions. Others are likely to
follow.
The weight of new issues may also give pause for thought. This year the
demands on both gilt and equity markets have been eased by the Dollars 30bn
a quarter flowing from the US to international markets. Unless American
investors take fright at a strengthening dollar and rising US interest
rates, UK equities look well underpinned. If the funds flow out again,
however, they will prove hard to replace.

FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Liquefied Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be little doubt that the MMC inquiry has helped British Gas focus
its attention on where growth opportunities lie. Since its UK business is a
mature one in a heavily regulated market, there is a case for
diversification into the expanding markets of the developing world. These
may carry higher risk, but they also offer higher returns. In the context of
diversification, it makes little sense to hold on to Consumers Gas of Canada
which is also a mature business in a heavily regulated market. There is also
the disadvantage that by limiting the UK company's stake to 85 per cent, the
Canadian authorities ensured that Consumers' cash flow could not be freely
redeployed to any other part of the group.
That said, by selling Consumers, British Gas has made a quantum leap away
from critical mass in the global gas business. In sterling terms, Gas claims
to have earned an internal return of some 16 per cent from its investment in
the Canadian company. Though the figure is boosted by exchange rate gains
and perhaps also by a relatively attractive disposal price, the test will be
to see how easily Gas can invest the proceeds at a higher return.
Gas argues that there is no shortage of opportunities, but that only makes
it more important to pick the right ones. Its gearing is on an upward path:
using the company's preferred measure of debt as a percentage of total
assets the figure reached 31 per cent in September. So it can even less
afford to make a mistake. Until the MMC came along, it could claim a
particular strength in its expertise from production to domestic supply.
Breaking up the UK business may harm its global ambitions.

FT  20 NOV 93 / German industry sheds further jobs

JOBS GLOOM in Germany deepened yesterday as two of the country's leading
employers  - the BASF chemicals group, and IBM Deutschland  - announced
workforce cuts totalling 9,000 in the next two years.
The cuts follow thousands of job losses already announced, and confirm the
trend towards higher unemployment, forecast at over 4m next year, even if
the current recession bottoms out.
The news of further redundancies came as negotiations at Volkswagen, the
motor industry giant, failed to produce an agreement over the introduction
of a four-day week. VW is calling for cost savings of 20 per cent from the
programme, which is designed to avoid 30,000 job losses.
At Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD), the Cologne-based diesel engine and
industrial plant manufacturer, a further 800 jobs are to go from its 11,000
workforce as part of a continuing restructuring programme.
The pressure on Germany's mainstream engineering industry was also
underlined yesterday with the announcement of a merger between Schiess, the
Dusseldorf machine tool manufacturer, and Dorries Scharmann of
Monchengladbach. The closure of the Dusseldorf plant will cost some 600
jobs.
At BASF, some 2,300 jobs are to be cut in 1994, and a further 700 in 1995.
Since 1990, the company has slashed its workforce from almost 58,000 to a
target of 45,900 by the beginning of 1995.
The latest 6,000 job losses at IBM's German subsidiary are in addition to
3,500 redundancies in 1993 alone. Since 1986, the company has cut its
workforce from 29,000 to 21,000.
Mr Edmund Hug, IBM Deutschland's new chief executive, said the emphasis
would switch to software and servicing from traditional computer hardware.
The job cuts in Germany are part of a broad retrenchment by IBM, which plans
to cut 35,000 jobs worldwide this year, most of them outside the US.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Civil service urged to draw from private sector: Report
calls for radical reform of career structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS should consider recruiting top civil servants from the private
sector as part of a radical reform of the official career structure, a
government report will urge next week.
The report, drawn up by the Efficiency Unit of the Cabinet Office, is the
government's strongest response to date to criticism that reaching the top
echelons of the civil service is based on background rather than brainpower.
It urges ministers to look for more top officials from business and industry
at a time when executive agencies and the private sector are being invited
to tender for certain operations within the service. It also calls for
regular assessments of how leading civil servants perform their tasks.
A senior Whitehall official said yesterday the recommendations in the
report, Career Management and Succession Planning, would 'change the blend
of our senior operational structure', adding that Mr John Major, the prime
minister, had welcomed its findings.
The report follows nine months of research, led by Sir Peter Levene, the
prime minister's efficiency adviser.
But it is unlikely to satisfy calls for a management revolution in
Whitehall. It falls short of setting specific quotas for how many external
candidates should be recruited to top-level posts.
It also claims that large private sector companies recruit most of their top
managers from within the organisation  - partly to preserve the morale of
junior personnel  - and that the civil service should be no different.
And it is unlikely to appease Sir Peter Kemp, a former permanent secretary,
who irritated ministers earlier this week by attacking Whitehall's 'old
attitudes and the old guard'.
According to Whitehall officials, only 10 per cent of the top 620 officials
in the civil service are recruited through open competition. A few others,
such as Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, were appointed
after spending much of their careers outside government.
The report stresses that mandarins must continue to possess home-grown
expertise, such as political awareness and advisory skills. But they list
other skills which come with private sector experience, such as team
building and good communication.
One official said: 'There used to be a culture whereby you could start at
the lower grades of the civil service and work your way up to permanent
secretary level. This report recommends a change of that culture.'

FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico looks deeper into Nafta
prospects - Damian Fraser sees a varied effect on companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American Free Trade Agreement should boost Mexican equity values
over the long run, but not all companies stand to gain from the pact.
Since the beginning of November, when investors began to conclude that
Nafta's passage was probable, the bolsa has gained about 9 per cent.
Yesterday the market closed 0.9 per cent up at 2,186.
The market rose strongly in the run-up to the vote, largely because Nafta is
expected to lift the economy. The agreement should attract capital, lower
interest rates, and raise economic growth. Mr Jay Peloski, of Morgan
Stanley, reckons that the agreement should add 1 percentage point to
Mexico's economic growth rate in the long run.
The agreement also makes the risk of a sudden reversal in economic policy
less likely, and may lead to a partial closing of valuation differences
between Mexico and the US, as Mexico is considered more mature, and less
like an emerging market. Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs reckons that the
current market p/e of about 12, excluding Telmex, should soon rise to about
15.
US investors may be more comfortable about investing in Mexico with the
trade pact in place. 'There will be bucketfuls of US institutional money
coming into the market as Mexico becomes part of the North American
economy,' predicts Mr Javier Munoz de Baeza, head of LMB,the Mexican money
managers. US instititutions, says Morgan Stanley, currently invest less than
1 per cent of their money in all emerging markets combined.
However, some stocks may be hurt from the treaty's passage. The trade pact
is likely to strengthen the peso, squeezing companies exposed to
international trade. That bodes ill for names like Vitro, the glass marker,
Cydsa, the petrochemicals group, and Alfa, the steel to petrochemicals
conglomerate, which have already suffered from the steady appreciation of
Mexico's peso over the past three years.
The treaty over the long run will also remove tariff barriers on imports
into Mexico. This should put further pressure on trading companies,
currently protected by an average tariff of over 10 per cent.
If, as expected, the treaty raises economic growth and wages, then companies
in labour intensive industries which are faced with international
competition may find it increasingly hard to compete with low wage countries
in Asia. Already, textile, paper, and toy companies have folded in droves
since 1986, when Mexico opened to trade, and wages began to recover in
dollar terms.
Most brokers say that the best corporate bets under the treaty will be
protected or well-placed to face domestic competition, and in a market which
will outgrow the economy. Companies expected to benefit most from higher
domestic economic growth include those in the consumer and retail sector,
such as Femsa, the soft drinks company and Cifra, the supermarket chain;
services, such as Telmex; construction and cement companies, like Cemex and
ICA, and banks, including Banamex and Bancomer. In general, earnings of
these companies rise by more than the increase in economic growth.
Lower interest rates will help groups which have taken on debt to finance
expansion, such as Aeromexico, the airline, Televisa, the giant media
cocnern, Cemex, and ICA, and Alfa. While much of the debt is in dollars, the
likely strengthening of the peso will reduce interest payments in peso
terms.
The banks are particularly sensitive to lower interest rates, since loan
growth would increase and defaults fall, as financing costs come down. Mr
Douglas Campbell of the brokers DA Campbell, strongly recommends both
Banamex and Banacci, and believes the banks' poor loan quality will soon
improve.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, says approval of Nafta could
enable Mexico to be given investment grade status on foreign debt as early
as next year, and several Mexican companies could then expect their credit
rating to improve. Investment grade will help construction companies, such
as Tribasa and ICA, to securitise toll roads, and finance other huge
infrastructure projects.
Over the long term the reduction of investment and trade barriers will
reduce profit margins in all Mexican industries. Nafta gradually opens up
the service sector to foreign investment, and in industries where margins
are abnormally high (such as banks and telephones), new foreign competition
is likely.
Fears of competition in the telephone sector have kept Telmex shares at a
discount to the market. Under Telmex's concession, profitable long distance
and international telephone calls will be opened up to foreign competition
after August 1996.
In many cases foreigners will buy into or form strategic alliances with
existing companies rather than start new ones afresh. This has already
happened in the retail sector, in consumer goods, in telephones and in
media. Baring Securities reckons more such agreements might be expected
under Nafta.

FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Surge of late buying restores
Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
ANOTHER big rise in bond yields initially pushed US share prices lower
yesterday, but a surge of late buying related to the expiration of stock
options and futures contracts helped blue-chip stocks end the day on an
upbeat note, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 8.67 at 3,694.01, more
than 30 points above its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended 1.02 lower at 462.60, while the Amex composite finished
down 1.56 at 467.98, and the Nasdaq composite off 2.78 at 751.56. Trading
volume on the NYSE was 300m shares.
US stock markets ended a difficult week in mixed form. Although fear that
the House of Representatives would reject Nafta gave way to relief at its
comfortable passage on Wednesday night, the steady rise in long-term
interest rates meant that any celebration was short-lived.
Once again bond prices were in retreat. This time it was a combination of
economic news - rising imports and exports in September widened the monthly
trade deficit to Dollars 10.9bn - and heavy selling of Treasury-bond futures
that undermined bonds. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down
1 1/4 points, and the yield was up to 6.33 per cent, the highest level since
mid-August.
The rise in bond yields upset stocks, which posted steady declines
throughout the morning. At one stage the Dow was down almost 30 points.
Prices gradually recovered, however, and thanks to heavy late buying related
to the expiration of stock and stock index futures and options, the leading
average finished in positive territory. Several leading Dow constituents
posted declines, although most recovered some of their losses late in the
day. United Technologies fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 , Caterpillar
dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 85, and IBM gave up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
51 7/8 . Bank stocks were under pressure because of rising long-term
interest rates. Citicorp eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 34, JP Morgan gave up
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 69 1/2 , Chemical fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36
7/8 and Wells Fargo slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 115 1/8 .
Chevron, which fell sharply on Thursday on the news that Pennzoil had sold
almost half its stake in the company, rebounded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 89
7/8 .
General Mills fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 after the broking house,
Dean Witter Reynolds, cut its earnings estimate, citing the intense
competitive environment in the food business. In spite of the markets'
weakness, retailer Talbots made a successful debut. Floated at Dollars 19.50
a share, the stock ended at Dollars 22 5/8 in volume of 6.8m shares. On the
Nasdaq market, Ornda Healthcorp fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after
the company said it would merge with American Healthcare Management in a
deal valued at Dollars 400m.
Canada
TORONTO share prices posted a small gain in moderate trading. The composite
index was up 3.43 points, or 0.08%, to close at 4238.17, a loss on the week
of about 65 points.

FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm follows US chop for
Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC relationships, and the attraction of them came in for a
hammering in Sweden yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM dropped 2.6 per cent in heavy trading as US disappointment with
Ericsson on Thursday night brought the B shares down SKr55, or 13.3 per cent
to SKr358.
Turnover was SKr3.29bn, up from SKr1.76bn, and SKr1.75bn of yesterday's
business was done in Ericcson B alone. The telecommunications group forecast
that profits would 'somewhat more than double' this year.
Ericsson brought most shares down along with it but Investor, the Wallenberg
holding company which takes in the Saab-Scania industrial interests, fell
SKr6 to SKr147 on a slump in nine-month profits, while good Thursday
progress reports from Skandia, and Volvo, saw the insurer, and the carmaker
up SKr2 at SKr184, and SKr1 at SKr423.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday afternoon's downtrend, the DAX index closing
5.23 lower at 2,077.37 on the session, still 3.1 per cent higher on the
week, and trailing off in the post-bourse where it finished at an
Ibis-indicated 2,072.13.
Turnover rose from DM9bn to DM9.1bn. Mr Nigel Longley, an institutional
adviser at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said that a number of 'end investors' -
institutions, rather than traders - were scared away by yesterday's options
expiry, which can make prices volatile.
There was some profit-taking: Porsche, higher on the dollar earlier this
week, lost DM20 to DM765 and Kaufhof, which had seen switching out of
Karstadt, fell DM15 to DM543.50.
In blue chips, BASF and Bayer looked ahead somewhat dolefully to next week's
autumn press conferences, showing falls of DM5.70 to DM268.50, and DM5 to
DM326.70 respectively in the London afternoon.
There was more late action in the pharmaceutical group, Schering, which slid
DM14.00 to DM1,051 on the session and continued downward until it hit
DM1,038 at the end of after-market trading. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research
said yesterday that revenue estimates for the company's Betaseron multiple
sclerosis treatment may not live up to expectations.
AMSTERDAM kept a watchful eye on KLM after it was reported that the airline
was to meet with the government last night. There were suggestions in the
market that this might signal a break through in the Alcazar talks and the
airline's shares hit a day's high of Fl 41.50 before falling back a little
to close up 80 cents at FL 40.50.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 137.2, a week's gain of 1.3 per cent, as
options related volatility affected trading in the afternoon.
PARIS found little incentive and the CAC-40 index closed down 4.44 at
2,145.23, up 2.3 per cent on the week.
Turnover was some FFr3.3bn.
LVMH remained in the news, the shares up FFr30 at FFr3,800, as the group
announced a re-organisation of its champagne division.
News of a sharp decline in Ericsson was claimed to have depressed sentiment
in Alcatel Alsthom, a competitor in the telecommunications sector, with the
shares seeing a low of FFr746 before closing off FFr5 at FFr752.
MILAN was subdued ahead of this weekend's local elections although activity
was seen, particularly in the finance and banking sector.
The Comit index lost 3.75 to 544.31, little changed on the week.
Among the banks, news that Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza
(Cariparma) was holding discussions on the possible purchase of Credito
Commerciale from Monte dei Paschi di Siena excited interest. Credito
Commerciale, which was suspended on Thursday ahead of the announcement,
closed at L6,300, up L3,160. Cariparma said that it would offer L6,400 per
share under the terms of the deal.
MADRID closed lower, but turnover was a bigger feature than share prices on
the day as it soared from Pta43.2bn to Pta58bn on the expiry of futures
contracts. The general index fell 1.63 to 304.53, 1.5 per cent higher on the
week.
One share that mattered, Nissan Iberica, remained suspended as the
carmaker's Japanese parent said that it was proposing to buy out the near-30
per cent minority in its lossmaking Spanish unit. The most active stock of
the day was Iberdrola, at Pta885, up Pta13 after strength in the utilities
sector earlier in the week.
BRUSSELS fell back after recent record gains as some investors decided it
was an opportunity to take profits ahead of the weekend. The BEl-20 index
shed 3.03 to 1,405.8 in turnover of BFr2.8bn. Solvay lost BFr225 to
BFr14,175.
HELSINKI noted a sharp fall in Nokia as the effects of Ericsson's results
spilled over into the market. The Hex index fell 17.0 to 1,555.9, down 1.6
per cent on the week, with Nokia down FM22 at FM299.

FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average closes
below 18,000 level

A FALL in the futures index prompted heavy arbitrage selling, and the Nikkei
average lost 1.2 per cent, closing below the 18,000 level for the first time
since March 16, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 225.13 at the day's low of 17,941.19, having
risen to a high of 18,337.73 in the afternoon on reports that the finance
ministry was planning to securitise bank loans and create a secondary
market. The Nikkei has fallen 3 per cent over the week.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 11.73 to 1,539.59, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index 0.79 to 1238.04. Volume was 260m shares with
losers exceeding gainers by 712 to 251, and 183 issues unchanged.
Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that trading patterns
were becoming increasingly similar to that of summer last year when the
market tumbled to a six year low: 'Poor sentiment, technical selling, and
the lack of positive noises from financial authorities is just not helping'.
Reports that the ministry of finance planned to create a market for
securitised bank loans failed to help bank stocks: Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell
Y10 to Y2,270 and Fuji Bank lost Y30 to Y2,250.
Foreign investors sold high-technology issues as Fujitsu lost Y23 to Y796,
NEC fell Y19 to Y895 and Matsushita Electric Industrial declined Y20 to
Y1,420.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 143.21 to 20,199.74 in volume of 28.6m
shares. Roundup
THE region's markets charted different courses yesterday.
HONG KONG once again saw a fairly turbulent session, although the Hang Seng
index picked up towards the close, finishing down 71.49 at 9,263.94. Over
the week the market has lost 4.5 per cent.
Turnover was down to HKDollars 6.6bn from Thursday's HKDollars 8.1bn.
Following Morgan Stanley's midweek downgrade of the market, Nomura's global
equities team yesterday came out with a contrary recommendation.
Explaining that recent weakness was a good opportunity to buy, Nomura's
strategists raised their weighting to the maximum - from 6 to 8 per cent,
against a benchmark of 3 per cent: 'The combination of growth, re-rating and
weight of money make this an unstoppable bull market which has scarcely
begun'.
SEOUL continued its bull run with the composite index adding 17.73 to
840.36, for a week's rise of 6 per cent.
Turnover was steady at Won1,240bn.
TAIWAN saw a heavy round of profit-taking in the electronics sector drive
the market lower. The weighted index fell 89.89 to 4,226.32, off 1 per cent
on the week. Turnover swelled to TDollars 51.1bn, its highest level since
April.
United Microelectronics fell by 7 per cent, closing limit down at TDollars
52.00, and helping to drive the sector index down by 4.3 per cent.
KUALA LUMPUR advanced 3 per cent in late trading on a strong rally in
Tenaga, the power utility. The composite index rose 28.35 to 984.92, for a
week's gain of 1.2 per cent.
Tenaga advanced MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 15.20 on news that it was to be
included in Morgan Stanley's global index from December 2.
AUSTRALIA took a dip downwards on widespread profit-taking and the All
Ordinaries index lost 24.8 to 2,083.2, barely changed over the week.
The banking sector took some of the heaviest losses with Westpac off 19
cents at ADollars 4.41, ANZ 14 cents at ADollars 4.74, and NAB 12 cents at
ADollars 12.76.
NEW ZEALAND ended a difficult week 4.4 per cent higher, although the NZSE-40
capital index closed down 17.21 at 2,097.22.
KARACHI rose on active buying of chemical and pharmaceutical stocks which
left the KSE index up 12.84 at 1,771.72.

FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES trading was severely upset yesterday by the effective failure of
the Seaq electronic reporting network, writes Terry Byland. The inability of
marketmakers to update price meant that screen quotations became indicative
only, making it impossible to calculate the market indices on which so much
futures trading depends.
Expiry of the November Footsie Traded Option, due at 10.30, had to be
postponed until 2.30, to the anger and dismay of traders who had to try to
engineer their closing positions without knowing where the market was
standing.
'An absolute mess. Fred Karno's circus,' commented one leading house.
The December contract on the FT-SE Index had a similarly disruptive session,
closing finally at 3,111, a premium of only about 3 points over cash and at
a discount to the estimated Fair Value premium of 6 1/2 points. Volume was
good, with nearly 12,000 contracts traded, although arbitrageurs had
difficulty in completing trades.

FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham fell sharply after US brokerage
Wertheim Schroder published a critical piece of research on the company
which contained a 'strong sell' recommendation.
Analyst Dr Jonathan Gelles said: 'I think the main concern we have is a
judgment that the consensus forecasts for the portfolio of new products are
unachievable. We are particularly concerned about the company's
anti-arthritic drug, Relafen.'
Dr Gelles cut his pre-tax forecast for 1994 by about Pounds 90m to Pounds
1,110m and slashed his earnings per share estimate by 5 per cent to 26.9p.
He believes SmithKline 'A' shares could fall to 330p. The 'A' shares fell 22
at worst but marketmakers said another US house, Alex Brown, had issued a
buy note and the stock recovered to close 9 lower at 402p on good turnover
of 6.4m shares.
The weakness affected other leading pharmaceuticals sector stocks. Glaxo
fell 8 to 643p and Wellcome shed 16 to 633.
Hanson avoided the weakness within the market, closing marginally firmer at
281p.
TSB dropped to 214p, depressed by one marketmaker cutting what was viewed
around the market as a bad book in the stock, but later stabilised to close
4 1/2 off at 215p on heavy turnover of 215p after another broking house
moved in to pick up what is said was cheap stock.
Some big switching out of HSBC 75p stock into the HSBC Dollars 10 stock saw
the 75p's close 5 higher at 738p on 5.7m and the HKDollars 10's settle 6
firmer at 749p on 3.2m.
The market was said to have been dismayed with new business figures released
by Prudential whose shares fell 6 to 332p
A fresh bout of straight selling pressure and switching operations,
triggered by last week's disappointing third quarter figures left General
Accident a further 10 off at 661p. Commercial Union were on the buy side of
the switch but nevertheless closed 8 off at 597p after turnover of 1.6m.
News that British Gas would make an important market announcement at 12.30pm
yesterday triggered a nervous 45 minutes for dealers in the company's
shares.
In the event the news, detailing the sale of Gas's 85 per cent stake in
Consumers Gas of Toronto and other interests in Alberta, for around Pounds
615m, prompted signs of relief around the City's trading desks but no real
action in the shares.
They settled a further 3 1/2 off at 321 1/2 p after unremarkable turnover of
7.9m shares. The fall in the stock was attributed, according to energy
specialist, to a follow-through of selling after Gas's disappointing figures
released on Thursday. The Canadian sale was described by one analyst as 'a
strategic u-turn.'
Container group Tiphook rose 19 to 63p after announcing that it had agreed
outline terms for the cash sale of its core container division to
Transamerica Corp. The proposed purchase price is Pounds 830m less
associated debt, which will not exceed Pounds 119m to be assumed by
Transamerica.
Plans for new ownership rules are expected to be unveiled soon, which could
lead to a bout of takeovers among ITV network broadcasters. The department
of Heritage disappointed those who had hoped for an announcement yesterday
on media ownership rules. However Anglia Television rose 8 to 429p, LWT
(Holdings) 4 to 503p, and Central Independent Television 27 to 2085p.
Carlton Communications improved 5 to 760p.
The flotation of Gartmore, the investment management group and one of the
leading fund managers in the UK, proved a disappointment. The shares,
offered and placed at 168p, slipped back in early trading but later rallied
to close at 170p on 11m shares.
Ross Group, importer and manufacturer of electrical and electronic products,
slumped 6 to 16p after announcing that trading conditions last month were
worse than expected.
Office furniture distributor Black Arrow fell 8 to 31p after announcing
interim profits of only Pounds 346,000 down from Pounds 1.55m last time and
a halved dividend of 0.5p.

FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI bucks trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals giant ICI bucked a lacklustre trend in London after a strong
performance in New York on Thursday night and encouraging comments from some
sector analysts.
Smith New Court reiterated a buy recommendation, arguing that ICI was not
saddled with the same problems that bedevilled other leaders in the sector.
Mr Charles Lambert, of Smiths, said: 'The message coming out of ICI
contrasts with that of BOC and Courtaulds - the steadily improving trend
appears to be still there.' UBS was also said to be recommending the stock.
The shares had risen  1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 late on Thursday and picked up
10 in London to 686p yesterday. Meanwhile BOC rallied 6 to 618p after a
sharp slide earlier in the week. Courtaulds recovered 3 to 433p.

FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Banking sector switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in the banks sector of the market was given a substantial boost by
a series of big switching operations involving Abbey National and Lloyds
Bank.
The switch involved heavy selling of Lloyds Bank and buying of Abbey
National with institutions said to have been keen on buying Abbey because of
its defensive qualities and a perceived pick up in the UK housing market.
The market was said to have been happy to accommodate the selling pressure
in Lloyds because of follow through buying interest in the bank triggered by
the recent bullish note on the bank published by BZW.
By the close, Abbey shares were only marginally up at 409p but easily
outperformed a generally easier banks sector and a notably weak FT-SE 100
index. Turnover in Abbey reached 2.7m Lloyds Bank, sustained by BZW's
positive stance, held at 580p with turnover an above-average 4.5m.

FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Seaq problems distort weak market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIFFICULT week on the UK stock market came to an unhappy close yesterday
when nervousness over the outlook for US markets was compounded by problems
with the Stock Exchange electronic reporting system. Share price quotations,
and therefore calculations of market indices, were 'indicative only' from
9.45am to 2.00pm, causing postponement of the expiry of the November FT-SE
Traded Option and considerable disruption to trading.
These technical mishaps tended to mask the market's increasingly concern
over reports that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
had called for a two point rise in US interest rates. Weakness in US bonds
unsettled sentiment in London at the close of business.
At 3,108.0, the FT-SE Index, down 17.5 on the day, was above the worst. But
traders agreed that the period of more than four hours without firm screen
price quotations had cast doubts on the reliability of the final picture.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, more closely linked to direct telephone
negotiations on share prices, continued to advance, gaining 2.8 to 3,455.3.
Seaq volume totalled 514.4m shares, down from 706.3m in the previous
session.
Share prices were easier from the market opening and by the end of the
session, the Footsie had retained less than nine points of the week's gain.
'The stock market has achieved very little over a week that brought
excellent news on domestic inflation and employment as well as the success
of the NAFTA vote in the US,' said the head dealer at one leading securities
house.
The government bond market had a quiet session, however, making little
response to the late weakness in US Federal bonds. Short-dated gilts eased
back a touch but hopes for a base rate cut were not seriously challenged.
The longer end also closed a shade easier as the market digested this week's
flow of economic data.
Uncertainty in the US bondmarket, quickly reflected in a fall of 11 Dow
points on Wall Street during London hours, brought falls across the range of
US-influenced stocks. While losses were mostly small, there was little joy
among pharmaceuticals, oils and the conglomerates.
Domestic stocks, which benefited earlier in the week from the improved
October Retail price index, were also lacking supporters yesterday.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar gains on D-Mark, Yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar made significant headway against the D-Mark yesterday, boosted
by talk of Federal Reserve tightening and Bundesbank easing, writes Conner
Middelmann.
In its annual country report on the US, the OECD called for an increase in
the Fed Funds rate to 5 per cent by the end of next year and recommended the
Fed should start tightening by Christmas.
'Whether or not the advice is taken, it serves to underline that interest
differentials are likely to move sharply further in favour of the US dollar,
both in the near term and over the course of 1994,' predict analysts at Bear
Stearns in London.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.7150, up from DM1.7110 on Thursday, but
breached DM1.7180 in late inter-bank dealing. Against the Yen the dollar
closed at Y108.30, up from Thursday's Y107.15.
According to Chris Turner, a currency strategist at BZW, German and US rates
are likely to stand level by the end of 1994, stripping away any lingering
short-rate support for the D-Mark and underpinning the dollar, which he
expects to rise to around DM1.75 by the end of this year.
However, 'as the dollar-bullish bandwaggon gathers pace, we are not inclined
to get any more optimistic than that for the near term,' he said. 'The scope
for the dollar to continue rallying on the short rate expectations theme is
limited. Don't be surprised to see DM1.68, or even DM1.6650, before DM1.75.'
Such a correction might be sparked by higher-than-expected German
money-supply and inflation data, both of which are due next week.
M3 is expected to come in around the top of the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per
cent target range while inflation is expected to have slowed to around 3.7
per cent year-on-year from 3.9 per cent in October.
Sterling rose early in the day on the smaller-than-expected October UK trade
gap with non-EC countries, but talk of a large cut in base rates at the
November 30 Budget put a lid on sterling's upside and prompted some late
profit-taking.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, expects sterling
to trade nervously in a DM2.50-DM2.55 range ahead of Budget day.
Following recent encouraging inflation and earnings data, market talk has
shifted to a one-point base rate reduction, from previous forecasts of a
1/2 -point cut.
'If they cut the base rate by a point, sterling will dip initially but could
gain more ground on prospects for further improvements in the real economy,'
said Mr Shepherdson.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German M3, CPI eyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal joined the European rate-cutting party yesterday and lowered two
key money market intervention rates by  1/8 point, writes Conner Middelmann.
The Bank of Portugal offered to inject seven-day funds at a fixed rate of
11.25 per cent in a securities repurchase tender, down from 11.375 per cent
at the start of the previous period on November 12. In addition, it offered
to drain funds with seven-day certificates at 10.25 per cent, down from
10.375 per cent.
The past week has seen money-market easing in the Netherlands, Belgium,
Norway and Austria following Tuesday's nine basis-point cut in the Deutsche
Bundesbank's rate for two-week securities repurchase agreements. The
Bundesbank also set a fixed-rate 14-day repo at 6.25 per cent for this week,
reinforcing market hopes for continued - albeit slow - easing.
Despite Tuesday's cut in the Nederlandsche Bank's special advances rate, the
Dutch guilder's continued strength against the D-Mark and easier Dutch
money-market rates spurred talk of another easing. However, the central bank
left the rate unchanged at 6 per cent at its operation yesterday.
In Germany, all eyes are on next week's release of October M3 money supply
and November inflation data. M3 is expected to come in around the top of the
Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range while inflation is expected to
have slowed to around 3.7 per cent year-on-year from 3.9 per cent in
October.
Subdued M3 and inflation data could fan rate-cut speculation, despite
comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer who warned on Friday that
'we now have to stay on the cautious side'. He said the Bundesbank's recent
rate cuts had already taken account of developments it expected to happen in
the future.
In the UK money market, the short sterling futures contract eased 0.01 point
in thin trade to 94.61.
The Bank of England forecast an early shortage of Pounds 1bn. In its market
operations it purchased some Pounds 328m of bills and provided late
assistance of around Pounds 510m. A small liquidity squeeze pushed the
overnight interbank rate to around 6 1/4 per cent, but according to one
trader, this should not be seen as an attempt by the Bank of England to
quash rate-cut rumors.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nine-month reverse at Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SLIDING profits at Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, and falling
capital gains sent pre-tax profits tumbling to SKr216m (Dollars 26m) in the
first nine months from SKr1.63bn at Investor, the company which groups the
prime industrial holdings of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family.
Sales at Saab-Scania, which is a subsidiary of Investor, slipped to
SKr19.3bn from SKr19.9bn as assistance from the devaluation of the Swedish
krona failed to offset flagging demand in Europe for its trucks and
aircraft. Profits at Saab-Scania fell to SKr930m from SKr1.55bn.
Investor repeated its half-year warning that it expected Saab-Scania's
full-year profits to be 'significantly lower' than 1992's SKr2.13bn because
of continued weak demand.
Capital gains, mainly from the sale of Investor's stake in Asea, the Swedish
half owner of the engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri and of holdings in
Stora, the forestry group, fell to SKr1.22bn from SKr2.27bn.
The value of Investor's strategic portfolio stood at SKr25.14bn at
end-September. The portfolio includes most of Sweden's top industrial names,
including Astra, Stora, SKF, Ericsson and Atlas Copco, but the rise in value
was significantly less than the stock market rise.
Investor's net worth stood at SKr34.26bn at September 30 with Saab-Scania
shown at book value. Group net debt was SKr7.95bn, down from SKr8.7bn at the
end of last year.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Packer raises stake in John
Fairfax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KERRY Packer, the Australian businessman, has raised his interest in John
Fairfax, the newspaper publisher, to 14.97 per cent - within a whisker of
the maximum 15 per cent stake permitted.
Nine Network Australia, the quoted media company in which Mr Packer's
Consolidated Press holds a large minority interest, said it had bought 29.5m
participating convertible notes in John Fairfax from Hellmann &amp; Friedman,
the US investment banking business. The price was ADollars 3.05 per note, or
close to ADollars 90m (USDollars 59m) overall.
The purchase takes Nine Network's total holding in Fairfax to 82.39m shares
and notes, or 10.42 per cent of the newspaper group's issued capital. When
added to 36m shares held by ConsPress, the total stake in Fairfax held by
Nine and its associates is 118.39m shares and notes, representing 14.97 per
cent of Fairfax.
Nine Network Australia said it agreed to buy the notes in Fairfax in line
with its policy 'of being a long-term strategic investor in Fairfax'.
A political dust-up developed yesterday after Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian
media tycoon, said he was interested in increasing his 25 per cent stake in
John Fairfax.
The stake is pegged at this level by foreign ownership rules, but Mr Black
claimed, on ABC television, he had spoken to Paul Keating, the Australian
prime minister, about a relaxation of the limit.
His comments were given an added twist because, in a newly published
biography, Mr Black said Mr Keating had undertaken to consider lifting
foreign ownership restrictions on the Fairfax papers if the papers became
more disciplined in terms of political balance.
The suggestion that ownership concessions could be tied to editorial
coverage prompted angry outbursts from opposition leaders. However, Mr
Keating said he had not received any specific proposal from Mr Black to
increase his holding in Fairfax.
'I saw Conrad Black the other day . . . and mostly as all proprietors do, he
asked for something,' Mr Keating was reported as saying. 'In Conrad's case
he wants a bigger share of John Fairfax. I've told him that there are real
national interest questions and something easily given isn't something
generally worth having.'
Asked if he had made any increase conditional on balanced reporting, Mr
Keating replied: 'I had a conversation with Mr Black late last year when
John Hewson (leader of the opposition Liberal Party) offered him 50 per cent
of equity in Fairfax, and I said to him I wouldn't consider that, but I
would consider going to 25 per cent.
'I said we'll think about (a request to lift Black's holding above a then
14.9 per cent) but we want a commitment from you that the papers will be
balanced, and if there is any notion of bias, that is, that you barrack for
the coalition on the basis of conservative proclivities in other places,
then there's no way you would qualify as the kind of owner we would like.'

SKANDIA, the Swedish insurer, yesterday announced a SKr3.95bn (Dollars 477m)
nine-month management operating profit and said it was on course for a
full-year result 'which may be amongst the best we have ever achieved'.
This is a dramatic turnround from 1992 when the group had a management
operating loss of SKr3.74bn due to heavy credit insurance losses, falling
property values and large claims from Hurricane Andrew.
Group performance this year has been helped by a one-time SKr1.45bn gain
from the sale of its 26 per cent stake in the German life insurer,
Hamburg-Mannheimer.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan to buy out Spanish unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is offering to buy out minority shareholders
in its troubled Spanish subsidiary Nissan Motor Iberica.
The Spanish operations have run up heavy losses in the past two years,
forcing Nissan to undertake a radical restructuring to comply with Spanish
corporate solvency law.
Under the impact of heavy losses, expected to total around Pta40bn (Dollars
290m) this year, Nissan is planning to write off about two-thirds of the
company's share capital, which will be reduced from Pta60bn to around
Pta20bn.
The takeover by Nissan of full control of the Spanish operations is expected
to be followed by drastic rationalisation measures.
It is seeking to cut its costs by about Pta10bn in the three years 1993-95
and to eliminate around 1,100 jobs from its workforce which totalled 7,200
at the start of the year.
The Japanese carmaker, which holds 70.3 per cent of the equity of Nissan
Iberica, said yesterday it had filed an offer with the Spanish stock
exchange commission for Nissan Europe to acquire the outstanding 29.7 per
cent minority holding in the company ahead of the capital write-down.
The Japanese carmaker said it was offering shareholders the possibility to
sell their shares 'in conditions that we believe to be favourable in view of
the current and mid-term situation of NMISA'.
Shares in Nissan Motor Iberica, suspended on Thursday, closed on Wednesday
at Pta147. The share price has slipped from a high for the year of Pta434 as
its financial crisis has deepened.
Details of the offer, which were not disclosed, must be approved by the
stock exchange commission. It is believed the final Nissan offer could be
worth about Pta250 a share, which would value the bid for the minority
holding at around Dollars 65m.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Credito Italiano warns of higher
loan loss provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITO Italiano, the Italian bank to be privatised next month, warned
investors yesterday that provisions for possible loan losses this year will
be much higher than in 1992 and exceed amounts deductible for tax purposes.
In spite of the warning, made in the preliminary prospectus, a senior
executive did not foresee any need for a dividend cut and said 1993 profits
should be in line with the net L202.2bn (Dollars 121.2m) made in 1992.
The need for higher provisions stems from the bank's heavy exposure to some
leading problem debtors, notably Ferruzzi. The impact of a big increase in
provisions would be accentuated by Italy's tax rules, which oblige banks to
pay tax on setting aside more than a marginal increase in provisions.
The effect of higher provisions and tax will be partly offset by the 55 per
cent jump in the bank's fee income to L536bn in the first half of 1993, when
group earnings after tax and provisions were L150.6bn.
Mr Romano Prodi, chairman of the IRI state holding company which controls
Credito Italiano, said the sale was 'essential' to restore IRI's finances.
IRI's group debt is expected to rise to L74,000bn by December, about
L1,000bn more than the previous year, although the proportion attributable
to the parent company should fall marginally. Mr Prodi said IRI hoped to
raise about L20,000bn from asset sales.

<TEXT>
SWEDBANK, the Nordic region's largest bank in asset terms, yesterday
withdrew its request for state support after announcing a SKr2bn (Dollars
242m) rights issue and much improved financial figures for the first nine
months.
Its move means the three Swedish banks which applied for state aid earlier
this year have now withdrawn their applications, testifying to the recovery
in the country's financial sector.
The bank said the rights issue was the final part of an action plan designed
to strengthen its capital base by SKr8bn and increase its capital adequacy
ratio to more than 10 per cent.
Other measures, already announced, include the sale of a 90 per cent stake
in a fund management unit and two large issues of perpetual stock.
The share issue will be in the form of a private placement and will be
launched in the first quarter of next year. A maximum of 38m shares is to be
offered to existing owners and Swedish and international investors at a
minimum price of SKr55 a share. The bank is also aiming for a stock exchange
listing within the next three years.
Nine-month figures from Swedbank confirmed an improving results trend, with
operating losses cut to SKr2.65bn from SKr8.81bn.
Cost-cutting helped the bank to lift its result before loan losses to
SKr6.21bn from SKr5.07bn. Credit losses shrank 36 per cent to SKr8.86bn, and
problem loans fell 19 per cent to SKr18.9bn.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Foreningsbanken have also withdrawn
requests for state assistance after announcing big share issues.

Demand in Quebec was helped by the start-up of two new aluminium smelters,

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Murdoch tones down super-vote
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday toned down key features of
its proposed 'super voting share' issue, in a bid to win approval for the
controversial scheme from the Australian Stock Exchange and fund managers.
The media company said it would place a 'cap' of 40 per cent on the
aggregate number of votes which could be exercised by the holders of the
super shares.
In addition, new shares would be transferable without any loss of voting
power, and they would be quoted on the ASX.
'It is also probable that quotation of the super-voting shares will be
sought on the London Stock Exchange and, in the form of American depositary
shares, on the New York Stock Exchange,' a letter from News Corp's lawyers
said.
Despite the concessions, the Australian Investment Managers' Group -
representing most of major fund management groups - said its members still
strongly supported 'one share-one vote' and had 'grave concerns' about the
plan.
Differential voting rights do not feature in Australia, and the News Corp
plan would require an amendment to the ASX's listing rules.
News Corp had never formally revealed details of the original scheme.
However, it was understood shareholders would have been granted one new
share for every 10 ordinary held, and each new share would have carried
around 25 votes. Critically, the 'super' voting rights under the first plan
would only have attached to the new shares as long the original owner did
not sell them.
This structure could have allowed Mr Murdoch - who owns around 32 per cent
of News Corp's equity, either directly or through his family company - to
achieve 'creeping control' as other investors sold their super shares. He,
and other family interests, could also have sold their ordinary shares
without significantly diluting their voting rights.
News Corp's justification for the plan was that the company might need to
issue equity to fund deals and joint ventures, and did not want to endanger
management's security of tenure.
Under the revised scheme, the super voting shares would still be distributed
to shareholders by way of a one-for-10 bonus issue. However, the 40 per cent
cap would ensure the number of votes conferred by each super-voting share
would be much lower than 25 - more like six and two-third votes per share.
If, over time, new ordinary shares were issued, the 40 per cent cap would
remain and votes attached to the super shares would change. For example, if
a further 900m ordinary shares were issued, the super-voting shares would
confer 10 votes a share. The process would continue until the number of
votes per super share was effectively 25.
The ASX recently released a discussion paper dealing with the principles of
differential voting rights and is seeking comment.

FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cost of job cuts forces NTT to
slash profits forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone, the world's second largest
telecommunications company, yesterday warned that its full-year profits
would be more than halved because of Japan's recession and the costs of
workforce cuts.
The company estimated that pre-tax profits would fall to Y106bn (Dollars
991m) for the year to next March - Y43bn lower than its original forecast -
from Y247.2bn in 1992.
On top of this, NTT will make a Y19bn extraordinary charge for the costs of
voluntary redundancies, as part of the 30,000 job reductions it is seeking
over the next 10 years. This will bring pre-tax profits after extraordinary
charges down to an estimated Y87bn for the full year, said NTT.
NTT yesterday posted a pre-tax profit of Y103.94bn in the first half-year to
September, down 1.8 per cent on the same period of the previous year, on
operating revenues of Y2,911bn. Net profits fell 10 per cent, from Y45.59bn
to Y40.94bn.
The continuing slide in income from dial calls, sluggish sales of new
telephone lines and the impact of the reduction in telephone charges made in
June 1992, produced a 1.7 per cent decline in operating revenue in the first
half. Competition to attract new customers is intensifying, said NTT.
It added that 'the Japanese economy as a whole has faced severe difficulties
in the first half of fiscal 1993, due to prolonged economic sluggishness
brought on by stagnant private consumption and lowered corporate capital
investment'.
Another factor was the revenue lost following the spin-off of NTT's mobile
telephone division in July 1992. Adjusting for this, underlying group
operating revenues rose fractionally, by 0.7 per cent by comparison with the
first half of 1992.
However, the spin-off, plus a reduction in the workforce, helped to reduce
operating expenses by 1.3 per cent to Y2,746bn.
The group said it would make 'significant efforts' to protect market share
and it would push ahead with streamlining plans.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Cocoa
prices reach 5-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COCOA market this week resumed preparation of the launch pad for its
widely-expected blast-off into regions unknown to most of the present
generation of traders.
A Pounds 69 aggregate rise took the March futures contract at the London
Commodity Exchange to Pounds 1,040 a tonne, the highest second position
price since July, 1988.
Some traders expressed doubts about the timing of this week's advance - just
as the west African harvests were getting under way - and did not rule out a
temporary setback before expected resistance between Dollars 1,050 and
Dollars 1,060 a tonne was overcome. For the longer term, however, there was
general confidence that a major bull market was going to develop as
continuing supply deficits ate into the excessive stocks that were built up
in the 1980s. London trade house GNI said this week that it could see cocoa
prices tripling over the next three years.
This week's price rise was topped off by a Pounds 21 jump yesterday in
response to renewed buying from one US trade house in particular.
The LCE coffee futures market also had its tail up for most of the week  -
the January delivery position rising Dollars 107 to reach Dollars 1,317 a
tonne at one point. However, a retracement yesterday afternoon left the
price Dollars 54 up on balance at Dollars 1,264 a tonne.
The rise was encouraged early on by news that the Brazilian government had
last Friday bought 51,000 bags of coffee (60kg each) for its export
retention stockpile, taking the total to 76,500 bags. However, that still
left the Brazilian purchasing programme - part of a concerted effort by
producers world-wide to boost coffee prices by holding 20 per cent of
production off the market - considerably behind schedule. And some traders
remained sceptical about the effectiveness of Brazil's participation in the
international scheme.
LCE raw sugar futures regained some of last week's setback, but in late
trading yesterday the March position was 0.1 off at 10.55 US cents a pound,
up 0.34 from the end of last week. The earlier rise had gained momentum on
Thursday after London trader C. Czarnikow revealed that it had raised its
estimate of the 1993-94 stocks drawdown to 2.28m tonnes from the 1.8m it had
predicted in August.
The gold market ended what had been a comparatively quiet week with a flurry
of activity on Thursday and yesterday as repeated attempts were made to find
a firm foothold in fresh high ground.
On Thursday the price failed to better the recent high of Dollars 378.50 a
troy ounce, however, and yesterday's renewed advance stalled just short of
Dollars 380. By the close it was back to Dollars 378.60 an ounce, up Dollars
1.35 on the day and Dollars 3.40 on the week.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that heavy US investment and
professional buying pushed prices upwards but previous resistance held and
profit-taking eroded the gains.
'It has been threatening a test of Dollars 380 all week,' one dealer said,
adding that Dollars 382 was now the near-term target.
Silver prices followed a similar pattern but in a more exaggerated fashion,
and the spot price in London ended 18.5 cents to the good at Dollars 4.72 a
troy ounce. In addition to recent strong demand from India and the Far East,
silver benefited this week from a renewed surge of buying by US investment
funds, dealers said.
At the London Metal Exchange, nickel was easily the strongest market. What
dealers described as a 'correction' to the oversold condition that developed
last week lifted prices by more than Dollars 100 a tonne in the first half
of the week. Then came a minor retracement, ironically coinciding with a
very bullish supply/demand projection by Inco of Canada, the world's biggest
nickel producer. But the buyers were back yesterday and the three months
delivery price closed at Dollars 4,727.50 a tonne, up Dollars 134 on the
week.
The Inco announcement suggested that a big cut in Russian nickel production
and exports had brought supply and demand of the metal virtually into
balance. And it predicted that the market would be in deficit next year. Mr
Peter Salathiel, the company's executive vice president of marketing,
projected that total exports of Russian nickel to the west would fall by
40,000 tonnes to a 'miserly' 80,000 tonnes in 1994.
The copper market had a much less happy time as what dealers termed 'shaky
technicals' pushed the three months position down Dollars 17.25 on the week
to Dollars 1,649.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, despite news of a third
consecutive fall in LME warehouse stocks. But that was still Dollars 20
above the low point reached on Wednesday.
Aluminium put in a parallel performance, three months metal ending Dollars
13.25 down at Dollars 1,063.25 a tonne after dipping to Dollars 1,046 on
Tuesday. Dealers attributed the metal's lacklustre showing to disappointed
selling following its failure last week to break resistance at Dollars 1,080
a tonne, exacerbated by Far Eastern selling and trade offerings. There was
support, however, on dips towards Dollars 1,050 a tonne, they added.
Zinc prices were held within a narrower range as three months metal
registered a net fall of Dollars 8 to Dollars 946.50 a tonne. The market
took little notice of a warning on Monday that the Budel smelter in the
Netherlands, which accounts for about 5 per cent of western world supplies
of zinc, would have to close by the middle of 1995 if no agreement about
waste storage could be reached with the Dutch authorities by the end of this
year.

charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ross Group dived 6p to 16p yesterday as the industrial holding
company warned that profits for the current year would be below earlier
expectations, after charging non-recurring costs of at least Pounds 2m for
restructuring.
The company said trading conditions in October were worse than expected and
with the exception of Gemini and Tadmod where growth had continued, measures
had been and continued to be taken to reduce further overheads, albeit at a
substantial short term cost.
The company yesterday completed the purchase of Cascade and Keenon from
Tomei of Hong Kong for Pounds 4m, payable by the issue of 13.3m new ordinary

MMI, the financial services and communications company, reported a return to
profits for the half year to August 31 with Pounds 201,000 pre-tax, against
losses of Pounds 282,000.
Acquisitions, which provided Pounds 1.93m of the total turnover of Pounds

of a total of Pounds 405,000, against losses of Pounds 72,000.
The most recent acquisitions of Pelham Communications, Park Avenue
Productions and Mediamix made a significant contribution. The BES business
increased turnover but the recruitment advertising business incurred a loss.
Mr Ian Perry, who replaced Mr Alan Bradshaw as chief executive at the
beginning of the month following a disagreement over strategy, is developing
the company into a business communications group.
It is proposing to change its name to Pelham Communications.
Earnings per share were 0.47p (losses 2.15p). An application to remove the

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders requisition egm at Bristol
Scotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS have thrown down the gauntlet at Bristol Scotts, the stadium
and restaurant group run for more than 50 years by the publicity-shy Kerman
family, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr Ian Stevens, whose family owns just over 20 per cent of the shares, has
requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to appoint himself and fellow
investor, Sir Ian Rankin, to the board.
The move is believed to be due to dissatisfaction over the running of the
company, including the merger in 1990 with a restaurant group controlled by
the Kerman family. The merger was based on an asset valuation of Pounds
6.43m. However, an independent valuation claimed assets of just Pounds 2.3m.
The Kerman family then held 23 per cent of the voting shares. Mr Nicholas
Kerman, a director, recently sold 707,640 shares, or just over 11 per cent,
at 52p. Meanwhile, Mr Nicholas Berry, who bought 13 per cent subsequent to
the sale, has not been allowed to register his shares. If the shares are
registered before the egm, Mr Berry says he intends to vote for the
appointment of Sir Ian and Mr Stevens.

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho in gold mine venture with Uzbekistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the UK-based con-glomerate, said yesterday it hoped next week to
sign a joint venture agreement to develop a new gold mine in Uzbekistan,
part of the former Soviet Union.
'We are in the final stages of negotiations and it would be very good timing
if we could sign during the president of Uzbekistan's visit to London next
week,' the company said. 'But the negotiations are proving very tough.'
The potential mine would be 'substantial' in world terms and 'very large'
for Uzbekistan, the eighth largest gold producer in the world with an annual
output of between 70 and 80 tonnes.
Mr Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's president, told Reuters the venture would be
at the Kokpatas and Amanmaitau mines near Zarafshan, about 560km north of
the capital, Tashkent. It would be a joint venture between Lonrho, the Uzbek
Ministry of Geology and a mining enterprise in the Navoi region and the mine
would take three to four years to reach full production.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has agreed to sell its 85 per cent stake in Consumers Gas of
Canada for CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 612m), three years after it bought
Canada's largest gas supply company in its biggest foreign acquisition to
date.
The sale of the company to Interprovincial Pipeline System of Edmonton,
Alberta, will bolster British Gas' ability to take advantage of new
opportunities in less mature international markets where returns are higher,
according to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive.
British Gas shares fell 3 1/2 p to 321 1/2 p, although the sale 'sent the
right signal to the market that the company was willing to sell off non-core
assets and re-invest in higher return businesses,' said Mr Simon Flowers of
Natwest Markets in Edinburgh.
British Gas has been under pressure to improve the returns from its
non-regulated businesses since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry
into the company began last year.
Consumers Gas, which has about 1m customers in Ontario and New York state,
was bought in 1990 by British Gas under the Global Gas banner for CDollars
1.1bn. An additional CDollars 46m was injected in 1992, just before a public
flotation of 15 per cent of the company raised CDollars 162. Two related
companies, worth about CDollars 60bn, are excluded from the sale and will be
retained by British Gas.
Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said the sale proceeds and the removal
of Consumers' debt from the British Gas balance sheet would reduce
borrowings by Pounds 1.5bn. Gearing, as of the end of September, would fall
by about six points to 25 per cent.
IPL is buying Consumers because it sees a brighter future in natural gas
supply and demand than in IPL's existing business of transporting crude oil.
Mr Brian MacNeill, IPL's chief executive, noted that the prospects of
finding major new oil reserves in western Canada are slim. On the other
hand, he said that opportunities for additional gas reserves appear to be
plentiful, while the long-term growth of demand for gas is assured by its
environmental attractions.
The sale of Consumers will remove Global Gas's main revenue stream, leaving
it with a smattering of medium-sized businesses mainly in Latin America and
Asia.
British Gas officials say that a new strategy to develop its international
businesses can only be finalised after the government decides on whether to
implement the main MMC recommendation to break up the company.

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca sells subsidiary for Dollars 65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, Imperial Chemical Industries' former bioscience group, yesterday
announced it had sold its Thoro System Products business to a new company
formed by D George Harris &amp; Associates, the fast-expanding New York
chemicals holding group.
The Zeneca subsidiary, which makes speciality building products, had a
turnover last year of more than Dollars 62m. It is understood to be
profitable and to have been sold for about Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.6m).
Zeneca said the sale was consistent with its strategy of shedding non-core
businesses and concentrating resources on those businesses that share common
technologies and skills. The Miami-based subsidiary became part of ICI in
1985 as part of the Beatrice Chemical acquisition.
Mr D George Harris, chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition would
be called Thorchem International and would form the basis of a new building
materials and chemicals company with sales of between Dollars 250m and
Dollars 350m over the next few years.
He had identified two possible further acquisition targets, one based in the
US, another in Europe, although they both had businesses in the two regions.

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dwyer makes Pounds 34.4m buys and seeks
Pounds 12.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DWYER, the property company, is acquiring seven properties for a maximum of
Pounds 34.4m cash and raising Pounds 12.3m net through a 1-for-1 rights
issue.
The company also announced pre-tax losses for the year to September 30 of
Pounds 7.74m, against Pounds 7.13m restated for FRS 3. Operating profits
were Pounds 3.28m (Pounds 3.14m) but there was a fall of Pounds 4.24m
(Pounds 4.78m) in property values and a loss of Pounds 3.23m (Pounds 4,000)
on the sale of properties.
The company is also considering moving from the Irish Republic to the UK.
Dwyer is buying the Arndale Centre in Middleton, Manchester from P&amp;O
Property Holdings and a portfolio from Winglaw Developments, which holds
24.1 per cent of Dwyer.
It is issuing 25.7m shares at 50p. Winglaw has undertaken to take up its
rights and the balance is being underwritten by UBS, the broker to the
issue. The shares closed unchanged at 57p.
For the year to September 30 losses per share were 30.18p (25.47p). The rise
in operating profits was the result of cutting administrative expenses to
Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.88m). During the period 12 properties were sold
realising Pounds 35.5m and cutting gearing from 206 per cent to 51 per cent
at the period end.

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: In search of markets further afield -
British Gas has embarked on a strategy of global expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MONTHS, British Gas has been running expensive advertisements
proclaiming itself as 'a world class energy company', stressing the size of
its global business. Yesterday it sold off the largest chunk of that
business, the CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 612m) Consumers Gas company in Canada.
Was this a change of tack?
Certainly not, maintain British Gas' top executives. If anything, it
represents a desire to attack world markets more aggressively than before.
Although British Gas bought Consumers Gas only three years ago, the world
market has undergone huge changes in that short time, says Mr Cedric Brown,
the chief executive. A liberalisation trend has swept through the gas
business; countries are privatising state energy companies, and new markets
are appearing.
In this new world, the 11 per cent after-tax return that British Gas
obtained from its Pounds 506m investment in Consumers began to look
unexciting. Canada was a mature market where the gas distribution business
was heavily regulated, so when an unsolicited offer arrived from
Interprovincial Pipe Line System, British Gas was receptive.
'There's limited potential for upside growth there,' said Mr Brown. 'The
world has moved on. It makes a lot of sense to take a very good offer, then
we can use the money much more effectively elsewhere.'
The reason for this optimism is that British Gas sees itself at the
forefront of a dynamic world business. With gas now the fastest growing
energy source, the company expects investment in both the upstream and
downstream ends to total between Dollars 800bn and Dollars 1100bn (Pounds
740bn) over the next 20 years.
Mr Russell Herbert, the director in charge of the global business, sees
worldwide demand growing by 500bn cubic meters over the next 10 years. 'If
you need to get a feel for the weight of that, it's the size of the entire
UK market,' he said.
The direction in which British Gas is looking for opportunity is towards
changing markets and the developing world. One instance of the former is,
ironically, Europe, where national gas systems are still fragmented, but
ripe for growth, particularly once the EU unified energy market gets going.
Further east, British Gas has bought a stake in a gas pipeline system in
east Germany, and will be looking for opportunities in the former communist
states.
But the most interesting prospects lie much further afield. British Gas is
now involved in a string of deals particularly in East Asia to supply and
distribute gas and operate power generation projects. One of the largest
involves a Dollars 3bn gas exploration and transmission project in
Kazakhstan. Another announcement that came yesterday was a joint venture
company to distribute gas in Bombay.
Recently British Gas also signed an agreement to participate in a project to
transport and distribute Argentinian gas to Chile through a new trans-Andean
pipeline. The Dollars 600m venture comes alongside British Gas' acquisition
last year of a 29 per cent stake in MetroGas, the newly privatised gas
distribution company which serves Buenos Aires.
The proceeds from Consumers Gas will help feed British Gas' investment
budget which will be about Pounds 2bn this year. However, there are risks in
British Gas' strategy. One is that it is striking out from traditionally
safe markets into areas where the returns may be higher but the potential
for political and financial trouble is too.
Mr Brown says that sceptics should bear in mind that the bulk of British
Gas' business is still in the UK, in a safe, regulated market. And though
his company is now hunting for new gas supplies in exotic territories, a
large part of its reserves lie no further from home than under the safe
waters of Morecambe Bay.
Another risk is that management may be taking on more than it can handle. Is
Sid, who bought British Gas' shares in the 1986 privatisation, going to get
his fingers burnt?
Mr Philip Rogerson, the finance director, says the commitment was made clear
in the prospectus that British Gas would be seeking to expand away from its
domestic regulated business, and that strategy is now being pursued.
Ironically, he says, the area of greatest uncertainty is currently the UK
where the recent monopoly inquiry recommended that British Gas be broken up
and its monopoly abolished. The company is hoping for an early decision from
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary.

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telspec pathfinder prospectus out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELSPEC, the fast-growing Rochester-based manufacturer of sophisticated
electronic telecommunications equipment, which is coming to market next
month, issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday. The placing is likely to
value the company at more than Pounds 40m.
The group designs and manufactures advanced equipment which enables
customers like BT, Telecom Australia and Deutsche Telekom, to improve the
efficiency of their networks and reduces the cost of installing or expanding
local telephone services.
In the year to December 31, Telspec, which has manufacturing operations in
the UK and Australia, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.36m on turnover
of Pounds 18.2m. In the first half of the current year, pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.94m were reported on turnover of Pounds 8.53m.
The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 5m for the company, which
will be used to fund increased capital expenditure and expand overseas
service and support facilities.

acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lynx Holdings reported a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 115,000 to
Pounds 619,000 for the half year to September 30.
At the same time the supplier of computer services and leisure products
announced two acquisitions financed by a placing and open offer.
The shares rose by 8p to close at 45p.
It is acquiring Financial Systems, which provides software for banking and
trust management, and Chess Valley Computers, which provides software and
systems for the mortgage and secured lending markets.
The consideration for Financial is Pounds 2.88m, to be satisfied by 7.82m
new ordinary shares. The consideration for Chess is Pounds 2.4m, satisfied
by 6.61m new shares. Some 9.11m of these shares have been conditionally
placed at 36p by Guinness Mahon to raise money for the vendors.
Turnover rose from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 10.8m. Earnings per share were
4.27p (1.34p) and a final dividend of 0.95p (0.75p) lifts the total to 1.25p
(1p).

FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Savoy creates committee to find new
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the Savoy hotel group has asked a three-man committee to
resolve the deadlock over who should take over its chairmanship when Sir
Anthony Tuke retires in May next year.
The committee members are Sir Oliver Wright, former British ambassador to
the US, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of the Forte hotel group, and Mr John
Sinclair, who was appointed to the Savoy board earlier this year. Sir
Oliver, who was also ambassador to Denmark and Germany, has been on the
Savoy board since 1987.
The disagreement stems from Forte's attempt to take over Savoy during the
1980s. The acrimonious bid battle ended in 1989 with Forte owning the
majority of Savoy shares but short of a majority of voting shares.
Two Forte directors, Mr Forte and Mr Donald Main, the finance director, were
appointed to the Savoy board.
Forte undertook not to increase its shareholding in Savoy, which also owns
Claridge's and the Connaught, before November 1994 and then only after
giving 12 months' notice.
This meant that if Forte wanted to increase its shareholding next November,
it would have had to give notice at the beginning of this month. It did not
do so, however, and is believed to prefer a negotiated settlement.
The need to find a replacement for Sir Anthony has led to a re-emergence of
the simmering antagonism between the two sides. The Savoy camp has proposed
that either Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, or Mr
Giles Shepard, the managing director, should become chairman. Forte has
objected to both candidates.
Forte's preferred candidate is Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New
Court, but he is being opposed by some of the Savoy partisans on the board.
The committee may look for an outside candidate acceptable to both sides.

Sir, Thank you for featuring Sir Peter Hall as 'Minister for a Day'
(November 13/14). To imagine - however briefly - a situation where the arts
were administered effectively, rather than just cheaply, was a delight, even
though under the present regime it must seem a curious fantasy.
Less curious, though, than the brand of economics favoured by Ian Hargreaves
in his 'Why the BBC should be privatised'. 'Although at Pounds 83 a year the
licence fee does not look expensive today,' he writes, 'it will come to seem
so when up-rated steadily in line with inflation.' Really. Noting that he is
your deputy, Sir, I do wonder whether this thinking will determine your
future pricing policy?

FT  20 NOV 93 / Major's risky crusade: The UK prime minister's Ulster
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more cruel truths of Northern Ireland is that politics has long
favoured the status quo. No matter how vicious the violence, post-war
governments on both sides of the Irish Sea have never been threatened by a
failure to restore peace.
Instead politicians in London have been mesmerised by the dangers of
undercutting the Protestant, unionist majority. Irish leaders have looked
over their shoulder at the nationalist aspirations of the Republic. In
Belfast, the constitutional parties - Protestant and Roman Catholic - have
felt safer with the status quo than with the risks of a new political
settlement.
Mr John Major this week declared it was time to end that depressing
paralysis. After weeks of intensive contacts between London and Dublin he
put Northern Ireland at the top of his personal agenda.
He is ready to table his own comprehensive proposals for devolved government
in Ulster and a re-definition of the relationships between Britain and the
Republic, and between north and south.
He made explicit the offer of a place in negotiations for Sinn Fein if the
IRA called a permanent halt to their terrorist campaign. He said he was
aiming for peace as well as a political settlement. He warned the hard-line
Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev Ian Paisley it could not exercise a
veto.
Senior British officials said that all sides would have to make
uncomfortable compromises. Mr Major, jolted by the terrorist atrocities
which began with last month's IRA bombing of Belfast's Protestant Shankill
Road, was ready to do so. He is confident of his own skills as a conciliator
and negotiator. He is spending more time on Northern Ireland than on any
other subject.
Not everyone thinks it is a wise decision. The high-profile approach is
described variously in Whitehall as naive and dangerous, as well as
courageous. His advisers say he knows it is a high-risk strategy. Old Ulster
hands regard that as a understatement.
Mr Major sees the rewards as well as the risks. An end to the killing after
25 bloody years would be the ultimate prize. But even a political deal which
fell short of that would do much to restore his authority.
A discernible mood for peace on both sides of the Irish border, however,
cannot of itself untie the knot which has wrecked past initiatives. Nor will
it erase centuries of mistrust. Mr Major must find the elusive formula which
reassures the unionist majority they retain a veto over constitutional
change and recognises the nationalist aspirations of the Republic and the
Catholic minority in Ulster.
So at the kernel of any agreement there must be a willingness on Dublin's
part to modify its constitutional claim to sovereignty, and a recognition by
unionists that the Republic has a legitimate interest in the way the north
is governed.
None of this is new. Some of these realities are incorporated into the 1985
Anglo-Irish agreement. Mr Garret Fitzgerald, the then Irish prime minister,
offered in 1984 to submit to a referendum the offending articles 2 and 3 of
the Irish constitution. Lady Thatcher did not believe he could deliver and
the idea was abandoned.
Mr Major believes the mood has changed. He trusts Mr Albert Reynolds, his
Irish counterpart. British officials say the two have a rapport.
But as a leak of Dublin's draft proposals for a settlement revealed, the
price it is demanding for renunciation of the South's territorial claim is
still too high for Unionists. Though the words 'joint sovereignty' never
appear, the idea suffuses the document.
That runs straight into the unionists' determination to preserve the
province's present status. Here the pivotal figure is Mr James Molyneaux,
the 73-year-old leader of the Ulster Unionists. Mr Major is ready to accept
that Mr Paisley's DUP may boycott talks. But the prime minister cannot get
anywhere without the support of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs.
Much has been made of the deal struck by the prime minister and Mr Molyneaux
to secure the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the summer. But the
foundations of Mr Molyneaux's authority runs much deeper. Mr Major, a
self-declared unionist, cannot agree anything without the consent of the
Protestant majority. Mr Molyneaux' veto is cast-iron.
So far he has kept his counsel on Mr Major's initiatives. But some suspect
he expects the process to founder. Mr Major might then have to accept
unionists' agenda for integrating the province more fully into the UK.
Mr John Hume of the mainly Catholic SDLP has a different sort of veto. His
joint initiative with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein was rejected in both
Dublin and London. But to the discomfort of Mr Major, Mr Reynolds has taken
on board the idea that peace is an essential ingredient of any political
settlement. No Irish government can disown the SDLP
Then there is Sinn Fein. British intelligence reports suggest Mr Adams may
be serious about extricating the IRA from violence. But there is no
certainty and many risks.
There is unease on the Tory backbenches about 'concessions' to terrorists.
One minister warned that, if Mr Major leans too far towards Sinn Fein, the
resultant split in the Tory party would make Maastricht seem a 'tea party'.
In the past few weeks London and Dublin have cleared some of the historical
debris strewn across the path to peace. But for all his determination Mr
Major has no idea yet whether he has set off along another cul de sac.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Solvency test needs support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R J WHITELAM and Miss P M WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Goode Committee has proposed that in future occupational pension
schemes should be required to hold a minimum level of assets to back the
pension promise given to members. This has generated considerable discussion
among pensions professionals. Some alarmist claims have been made to the
effect that the solvency test will cost individual companies tens or
hundreds of millions of pounds. As a result, pressure seems to be growing
from some quarters for the proposal to be either abandoned or substantially
watered down.
We believe this would be a pity. A solvency test would do much to improve
benefit security in the minority of schemes which are currently not
adequately funded. What is needed is a cool-headed analysis of how the
proposed test could be fine-tuned so that it brings the recalcitrant schemes
into line, without jeopardising the position of the majority of UK pension
funds which are already soundly funded and invested.
Some alarmist claims appear to be based on the assumption that many large
schemes would currently be either barely 100 per cent solvent or indeed
below that level. However an analysis of the solvency position of 20 of our
largest pension scheme clients showed they are currently all more than 100
per cent solvent on the proposed basis, and the vast majority are
comfortably above 120 per cent. This is because, like most UK pension
schemes, they are funded on sound bases allowing for projected final pay
benefits.
The solvency test is designed to ensure that schemes should at all times
contain enough assets to meet members' accrued benefits based on current
pay. This is a laudable aim. A number of practical issues need to be
addressed during the consultation stage, such as the introduction of some
smoothing to make the test less susceptible to daily fluctuations in asset
values. There also needs to be discussion about the treatment of very large
mature schemes and whether remedial action should always involve a
three-year funding plan rather than the current proposal for immediate cash
injections from the employer when solvency falls below 90 per cent. These
are details which can be sorted out and are not reasons for rejecting the
substance of what has been proposed.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Accountants have skills now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS MCRAE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Geoffrey Owen's article in your Accountancy Column (November 18) is
a welcome contribution to the debate on the role of accountants in business
life. He and his colleagues at the London School of Economics correctly
identify the need for accountants actively engaged in business management to
be trained for total management, as opposed to the narrower traditions of
accountancy.
The fact is, however, that the 'five most important skills' he identifies as
necessary for the future are all catered for already, with precision, by the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
The whole ethos of our training is towards producing versatile people
trained as management accountants and equipped to hold senior management
positions. Among their basic working tools is the ability, as part of
management, to provide and manage information, financial and non-financial,
gathered from inside and outside the business as the basis for fundamental
business decisions.
It is no accident that British Airways, which has just been presented with
the CIMA Training Award, now relies almost wholly upon CIMA training for its
graduate accountancy recruits.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Different time, different place: The contrasts between JFK
and WJC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man at the centre was a gifted professional politician reacting to
events he often neither foresaw nor understood, handling some well, others
badly, but always ready with a plausible explanation. He was intelligent,
detached, curious, candid if not always honest, and he was careless and
dangerously disorganised.'
He was also in his mid-40s, partly educated in Britain, married, a Democrat
and president of the United States. Just about every word quoted above could
be applied to the current inhabitant of the White House, Bill Clinton.
Of course, they do not. They are an extract from Richard Reeves's assessment
of the character of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. But as the world relives,
through written words and television programmes beyond number, what it was
doing on November 22 1963, when he was assassinated in Dallas, comparisons
between the second- and third-youngest presidents this century cannot be
avoided.
Kennedy and Clinton did once meet. On July 24 1963, the 17-year-old from
Arkansas, representing a youth group, shook hands with the president on the
White House lawn, a moment captured on film for the Kennedy archives and
shown to wild applause at last year's Democratic party convention. This was
no accident, for the Kennedy mantle is one which every aspiring young
Democratic politician has sought to put on.
America had changed much since then, for good (civil rights), for ill (the
rising tide of violence), and for even more in between. What Richard Reeves
has done, in his riveting President Kennedy; Profile of Power*, is to
provide all the benchmarks that make political comparisons possible. He
writes not of JFK's rise, nor of his death, but only about his term in
office. The subject of sex is not skimped but nor is it exaggerated.
If additional testimony for this exceptional book were needed, Bill Clinton
(henceforth, for stylistic juxtaposition, WJC) devoured it and promptly had
the author round to a White House lunch. Their conversation, reported Mr
Reeves, was all about then and now. 'His identification with Kennedy is
quite close,' he added.
Style and background apart, similarities and differences leap out of every
page. Both relied on those nearest and usually dearest - JFK on his brother,
Robert, whom he made attorney-general, WJC on his wife Hillary, an
ex-officio member of the government in most things and a policy maker on
healthcare. JFK hardly knew most of his first Cabinet, though it contained
some illustrious names (McNamara, Dillon, Heller) while the extensive WJC
network produced most of his from relative obscurity.
JFK came to office with little interest in domestic affairs. The only such
reference in his 1961 inaugural address were the words 'at home', inserted
at the last moment by a young aide, Harris Wofford (now the senator from
Pennsylvania). His principal concern about the civil rights 'freedom riders'
of his first year was the harm they - and less their repressors - might do
to America's image overseas. Early on, he avoided meeting black leaders.
WJC, always at ease in the company of minorities, has the self-defined
mission to set America right at home, a theme JFK never really picked up
until his third State of the Union message, mostly for electoral reasons.
Still, his language then was very much a harbinger of what WJC says today.
JFK, who never pretended to be an economist but surrounded himself with
Nobel Laureates-in-the-making, believed taxes should be cut. WJC, with at
least applied knowledge of the field but no towering intellects on board,
has come to a partly different conclusion. JFK muscled big steel into
rescinding a price increase, WJC took on big labour over Nafta. Both got
important trade legislation passed, though in JFK's days it was the Japanese
who were complaining about the US bilateral trade surplus.
Both had indifferent first years in the foreign policy arena. JFK's crosses,
mostly self-inflicted, were the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, a disastrous
first summit with Khrushchev in Vienna ('worst thing of my life; he savaged
me' was his own verdict), and the fateful first steps into the Indochina
quagmire. Only avoidance of outright conflict with the Soviet Union over the
building of the Berlin Wall was a mitigating factor, but, in 1962, the fear
of annihilation by nuclear war was real.
WJC may have inherited Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, but he has solved none of
them and Europe has as many misgivings about him as Harold MacMillan and
Charles de Gaulle initially had about JFK. Nor does he have JFK's perennial,
but accepted, excuse of the need to fight communism. Perhaps Cuba, with
Castro near the end of his reign, will give him a victory, much as it did
JFK in the shape of the 1962 missile crisis. WJC can only hope that the
irrational Kims of North Korea do not fire off a bomb.
JFK had fewer external constraints than WJC. He could order assassinations
which worked (Vietnam's Diem) and did not (Castro), interfere in Africa and
tell off President Sukarno of Indonesia when he presented a non-aligned
report JFK did not like. The US may be the only remaining superpower, but
the CIA's hands are pretty much tied and WJC's inclinations to order foreign
leaders around are less evident, poor Mr Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan excepted.
Congress was a blight to both, in spite of nearly identical Democratic
majorities. JFK's biggest problem was with conservative southerners,
committee chairmen who simply sat on any legislation they did not like,
especially on civil rights. WJC has a moveable feast of an opposition
depending on the issue, though his first-year record with Congress,
especially after this week's Nafta triumph, is much more substantive than
JFK's.
In no areas are the differences more marked than in their relationships with
the media, even though both knew how to use television and both professed to
enjoy the company of journalists. JFK was ruthless. He socialised heavily
with the Washington big shots - Krock, Bradlee, Bartlett, Reston. They
responded by drawing a veil not only over his sexual affairs but also over
his health, which often left him a near-cripple. But he thought nothing of
ordering stories to be pulled from the New York Times nor of bugging the
media. And inexorably, to quote Richard Reeves, he directed 'their attention
away from the edges of government to the very centre' - himself.
More than that, TV transmission 30 years ago was neither instant nor
ubiquitous. It could take days for bad news to come through from Indochina
or Berlin, giving JFK precious time. Today WJC may hear about crises first
from CNN. He cannot even get a haircut, let alone go to the doctor or dine
out, without it being reported. And if he dared to lean on a newspaper to
change a story, or wiretap a reporter's phone, there would be an unholy row.
Yet he cannot reverse, much as he might like to, the focus JFK brought to
the centre.
Next week the Clintons, an hospitable if serious couple, will hold their
first formal state banquet, for the South Korean president Mr Kim Young-sam.
By November 1961, Washington was already Camelot, a city where charm, brains
and power were the indivisible triumvirate. But it was a different capital
of a different country at a different time. Only the political common
denominator remains. The two pres-idents might not want it other-wise.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A tax with no supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NOEL PAULLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The 75 Conservative MPs who recently expressed deep unease about the
planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel ('Many Tory MPS want deeper
spending cuts', November 15) were, in my judgment, a very accurate
reflection of Tory grassroots opinion in the constituencies. During 25 years
work for the party, I have never encountered a measure which was so widely
unpopular with fellow members.
The poll tax was unpopular, but it did have its supporters within the party.
VAT on domestic fuel appears to be friendless, and the government would be
wise to reconsider.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Fresh dose of political will: The countdown to Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's triumph in getting the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) through the US Congress has reignited optimism in Europe
that a Gatt world trade deal is now within grasp.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, stated
cautiously on Thursday: 'I hope this will now enable the US administration
to contribute fully to the solution of the limited number of substantial
problems that still remain,' to complete the Uruguay Round by its December
15 deadline.
In Washington, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, was confident
that the momentum created by Nafta would produce 'concrete offers' from
Asian leaders at the Asian-Pacific summit in Seattle for the bargaining
table in Geneva. He acknowledged that there were several outstanding issues
but said there was sufficient time to reach agreement by the deadline.
'There will be a Uruguay Round deal,' he said.
He dismissed as propaganda the contention of Brussels officials that
Washington's near-total redeployment of its crack trade negotiators to deal
with Nafta had badly disrupted the impossibly tight Uruguay Round schedule.
He knows, however, that there is an unremitting slog ahead, especially to
settle differences between the US and the EU. If these two giants do not
agree, the Round cannot be concluded.
The meetings between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor on Monday and Tuesday are thus
pivotal. 'We want a serious, hard, long negotiation,' an aide to the EU
commissioner stressed.
The signs are that the US is moving fast. This weekend, in Brussels, Mr Joe
O'Mara from the US agriculture department is expected to hold important
detailed talks with Mr Guy Legras, head of the European Commission's
agriculture directorate. At stake is the extent to which Washington can make
any of the additional concessions on last year's Blair House accord - in
which the EU and US agreed substantial cuts in subsidised food exports -
demanded by the French government as a condition for concluding the Round.
Farm trade is the issue which has prolonged the negotiations for seven years
and threatened repeatedly to sink them. There is a growing feeling, in
Brussels and Geneva, that Washington will offer concessions on farm trade
while preserving Blair House as a basic building block for the Round. But,
equally, there is concern among senior Brussels officials that compromises
on agriculture designed to get Paris off the hook with its militant farmers
will be paid for in other sectors where agreement is still needed.
Chief among these are:
Market access and cuts in industrial tariffs. The EU is demanding that the
US at least match the offer by Brussels to cut high tariffs. The EU is
targeting US protection of its textiles, ceramics and glass industries.
In a deal to get the backing of US textile interests for Nafta, the Clinton
administration was careful not to tie its hands in the Round. It
'anticipated' tariff cuts that would not go 'substantially beyond' those
agreed between the US and EU industries, and said it would work 'diligently'
to harmonise tariffs to no higher than 7.5 per cent for man-made fibres -
thus addressing the demands of Portugal and Greece - 15 per cent for yarns,
30 per cent for fabrics and 35 per cent for apparel.
The US administration is still seeking zero tariffs for wood products and
paper. It has apparently lost hope that tariffs will be eliminated on
electronics and non-ferrous metals, but is proposing to drop the latter to
no more than 3 per cent.
Steel: 'We want peace in the marketplace, past, present and future,' a
Commission official said, indicating that the US should scrap existing
punitive duties on European steel and undertake to deal with future disputes
multilaterally.
In return, the EU is willing to restrict the terms under which it subsidises
its steel industry.
Cinema and broadcasting. This is another French bugbear because of the
perceived threat to European culture from Hollywood. Washington has softened
its opposition to existing EU subsidies for cinema and videos and voluntary
quotas for indigenous programmes, but is demanding a free market in the new
technologies - fibre optics, satellite-delivered programmes and other forms
of pay television. The 12 member states have yet to decide on a common
position on technological development. Aircraft manufacture. The two sides
have a bilateral deal restricting EU direct subsidies to Airbus, and US
indirect subsidies to its manufacturers through the defence budget. Brussels
is strongly resisting US attempts to rewrite the bilateral accord inside
Gatt. The US is also considering a twin approach on subsidies - eone for the
US and EU, and another for other countries such as Japan and South Korea.
The EU is determined that the future Multilateral Trading Organisation (MTO)
to replace Gatt will blunt the US bilateral trade sanctions arsenal, in
particular by forcing Washington to adapt its so-called 301 trade laws to
the new MTO order. While Congress would not pass any agreement to forgo
unilateral action completely, it could agree to bring complaints first to an
international body if the settlement mechanism were sufficiently strong and
swift.
There is still a lot to resolve. But senior EU officials acknowledge that Mr
Clinton showed courage in getting Nafta through, and that the same political
will is now demanded from European leaders - particularly from Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister.
Mr Kantor, who has met French officials on at least two occasions in the
past month, is optimistic that common ground has been established. But
everyone, he said, must rise above national interests to boost growth in the
world economy. Only then can the tortuous Gatt negotiations be concluded and
a new era of freer trade begin.

FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A simple boost to rented sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN THURLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman's report, 'Clarke to boost initiative on private finance'
(November 15), that the Treasury is about to 'breathe new life into the
private financial initiative' is good news. It at least suggests that the
Treasury is capable of movement.
Before tackling the complex task of introducing private capital to major
infrastructure projects, why not do a simple job first?
The private rented sector is crying out for investment to build the 100,000
new homes that are needed each year. Minor changes to the inequitable tax
regime that penalises landlords in favour of owner occupier could be made on
Budget day.
Designing a modified investment trust to attract institutional funds for
investment in the private rented sector should not take long either.
Good practice for the Treasury, you may feel, before it gets round to roads,
bridges and railways.
