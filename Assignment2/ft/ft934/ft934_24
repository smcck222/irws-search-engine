FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: White House gathers up endorsements for
Nafta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MOVING with all deliberate speed and flashes of passion and anger, the US
House of Representatives yesterday approached its climactic vote on the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue emotion of a different sort - barely
suppressed elation - was evident as the White House totted up the steady
stream of new endorsements for Nafta and calculated, though it would not
admit it publicly, that it would win.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was among those convinced that
the administration's application of maximum political force was on the edge
of producing a great victory for President Bill Clinton. Anything bigger
than a margin of one would be 'academic,' said Mr Bill Daley, the White
House's Nafta co-ordinator.
An evening Associated Press count suggested that the agreement had secured
support from 10 more members than the 218 needed for passage, though some
may be released from their promises once the magic number had been passed.
Significantly, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the Democrat from Ohio and a
leading Nafta opponent, conceded that she thought President Clinton would
carry the day, mostly, she added with scorn, on the back of support from the
Republican party.
The President went running in a pro-Nafta teeshirt and said 'it's never in
the bag until the vote's in.' He had despatched officials by the dozen to
Capitol Hill to keep up the pressure, as had the anti-Nafta forces. Mr Ross
Perot, the Texas populist, was behaving exactly like the lobbyists he
constantly condemns as he toured the halls exhorting members to vote
against.
In the House itself, the debate was briefly interrupted by anti-Nafta
demostrators shouting that Mr Clinton was bribing his way to victory and
throwing fake Dollars 50 bills on to the floor. Earlier Mr David Bonior, the
Michigan Democrat and chief anti-Nafta strategist, had opened the debate by
proclaiming 'its Nafta Claus time at the White House.'
'Its Dollars 50bn in goodies and give-aways,' shouted Mr Gerald Solomon, the
New York Republican.
Mr Solomon was at his most abrasive, which is saying something. He charged
that Nafta established an 'unelected, unaccountable bureacracy' that would
undermine the US constitution. But his assault on everything Mexican,
especially its '64-year-old one party dictatorship' of a government, was too
much for the venerable Kika de la Garza, the Democrat from Texas who rules
the House agriculture committee.
'I share blood with the Mexican people,' he barked back, 'and I resent the
xenophobia I've been hearing on this floor.' Reaching back into the last
century, he turned on Mr Solomon and others who had spoken in the same vein.
'They want a Mexican government run by the US, but let me remind you, we
tried that and it didn't work.'
Perhaps unconsciously, George Miller, the California Democrat, evoked
memories of Harold MacMillan's words condemning the Thatcher government's
attitudes to the British miners 'who had helped defeat the Nazis.' The
American worker, Mr Miller declared, 'had helped win the cold War and now
are not even being given an afterthought.'

BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer, yesterday announced that the
next-generation development of its best-selling 737 airliner had been
secured through a Dollars 2.5bn order from the Dallas-based Southwest
Airlines. The airline has ordered 63 of the 737-X airliners for delivery
from late 1997. Some 32 of the orders result from the conversion of options
on the existing 737-300 variant.
The 737-X has been designed by Boeing to be more competitive with the range
of small airliners manufactured by Airbus Industrie, the European
consortium. They will fly further and faster than existing 737 variants
thanks to improvements to the wing design and a new engine from CFMI, a
joint venture between General Electric and Snecma.
Southwest Airlines has a fast-growing network of short-haul, frequent
flights in the US. Its policy of offering no-frills services at low cost has
turned it into one of the few airlines currently making profits in the
fiercely competitive US market.

FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Caribbean rum producers seek a fuller EU
measure - France is being blamed for what is seen as foot-dragging on
opening the market further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN rum producers have asked the European Union to increase the quota
for rum they can ship duty free, and then to abolish the quota to end a
shortage of the product in Europe.
A senior official of the European Commission said the rum quota would be
increased by previously agreed levels next year, and the possibility of
abolishing the quota would be studied. The producers say, they need more
immediate action to end what they say is the disruption of the market.
The rum producers, part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of
countries, have criticised the EU for being slow to honour legal commitments
to react by increasing the access for rum to meet the growing demand.
They say this is written into the Lome Convention, a trade and aid treaty
between the EU and the ACP. The current quota stands at 220,000 hectolitres
a year, following a 20,000 hectolitres increase.
'To the extent that the consumption of rum increases significantly in the
(Union), the (Union) undertakes to carry out a new examination of the annual
rate of increase fixed by this protocol,' says the convention.
Officials from the rum producing countries say that what is seen by many as
the Commission's foot-dragging is the result of pressure from France which
wants to protect its domestic rum industry in Martinique and Guadeloupe, its
two Caribbean departments.
'Rum is the only industrial product covered by the Lome Convention which is
subject to quotas,' says Mr Yesu Persaud, chairman of the Caribbean
Association of Industry and Commerce. 'Because of the quota system, the
Caribbean rum industry is now experiencing serious disruption because the
demand for rum in the (Union) has been growing rapidly.'
Mr Peter Pooley, director general of the Development Directorate of the
European Commission, has assured rum producers that the automatic quota
increase of 20,000 hectolitres will be effected next year. 'In February 1994
we will begin work a report on dismantling the rum quota,' he said.
One Caribbean official describes this as 'cold comfort' to an industry that
had a market 'begging for the product but which is being obstructed for
reasons known only to themselves' by the EU.
Before the Lome Convention was agreed, rum from what are now the ACP states
entered Europe unrestricted. There were no quotas, although the product was
subject to duty. With the first Lome agreement, France insisted on a quota
for the quantity of rum that could be imported duty free, and this was
written into the current agreement.
Demand for rum in Europe has been expanding steadily since 1989 when the EU
legislated on the definition of rum, establishing that it had to be made
from sugar cane. This destroyed a lucrative market for several other spirits
which had been marketed in Europe as rum, and also drove counterfeiters out
of the market.
'This growth has continued and is now outstripping the quota we have,' says
Mr Patrick Mayers, chairman of the West Indies Rum and Spirit Producers
Association. 'The quota was exhausted at the end of the quota year which
ended in June, and will soon be for the current year.'
Mr Mayers says many European importers and distributors have told their
Caribbean suppliers to ensure that the problems of the last quota year are
not repeated, as they would not be able to handle shipments which exceeded
the quota. Such imports attract a 'punitive' duty which makes the product
too expensive to be sold, says Mr Mayers.
The automatic increase of 20,000 hectolitres which they will get next year
is considered by the producers insufficient to resolve the problem. They say
that the rate of growth of demand for rum in the EU will soon outstrip the
increased quota, and that the situation will become tighter when new members
join the Union.
The European market brings the Caribbean producers about Dollars 20m (Pounds
13m) a year, and these earnings could increase significantly if access were
to be improved, says Mr Mayers.
Rum producers fear that a continued shortage of the product will lead
European consumers to turn to other liquor, leaving rum a difficult task in
regaining market share if and when access for the product is increased
either through higher quotas or an abolition of the quota.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Talks on Irish wage pact falter
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND faces the prospect of a wages free-for-all following the breakdown
of talks yesterday between the government and the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU) over a new centralised pay bargaining agreement.
ICTU yesterday notified its affiliated unions to prepare for a return to
free collective bargaining, having failed in its attempts to persuade the
government to remove an unpopular 1 per cent income levy over the next two
budgets.
For the past six years, public and private sector pay rises have been
regulated through tripartite agreements between the government, employers'
organisations and ICTU, the latter representing the bulk of organised labour
in the country. The first agreement, known as the Programme for National
Recovery, ran from 1987-1990 and the second, known as the Programme for
Economic and Social Progress (PESP), ran from 1991 and expires at the end of
this year.
The two agreements have been largely responsible for the economic stability
in Ireland over the past six years, peace on the industrial relations front,
and the achievement of one of the best economic growth rates and one of the
lowest inflation rates throughout the European Union.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, introduced the 1 per cent income levy
in last January's budget to help meet pay deals in the public sector and
raise funds for a job creation programme. Its critics have argued that the
levy amounts to a 2 per cent increase in the basic income tax rate, in that
it is calculated as a 1 per cent of the whole income, without any
allowances.
Mr Peter Cassells, the general secretary of ICTU said the levy 'struck at
the heart of the PESP, acting as a clawback of pay deals that had already
been settled and so our members have lost confidence in the process'.
The levy is worth some IPounds 145m (Pounds 138m) per year to the Exchequer,
and Mr Ahern has said that even if the levy were to be removed, in time, it
would have to be balanced by tax increases elsewhere. Mr Ahern said earlier
this week that 'the government is anxious to enter into a new agreement, but
not at any price'.
Public sector pay has risen by 46 per cent since 1987, while inflation has
risen by only around 15 per cent.

MR Giuseppe Leoni, one of the most prominent parliamentarians in the
populist Lombard League, resigned yesterday.
Mr Leoni has been under investigation since last week for allegedly failing
to declare L10m (Pounds 4,000) worth of campaign contributions to fight his
seat in the northern city of Varese. He announced his resignation yesterday
to clear his name, although he had been urged to remain by Mr Umberto Bossi,
the League leader. Mr Leoni was one of the founders of the League, along
with Mr Bossi. The sum of money involved is the smallest known to have been
investigated by magistrates in the corruption scandal.
The League is convinced the move is part of a campaign to paint the party in
the same colours as the rest of the political establishment, which has been
discredited by the scandals. Almost the entire media, as well as the main
parties, are on the offensive against Mr Bossi and the League, claiming the
party risks forcing the break-up of Italy.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Naples to name successor to the mob: A vote that will
determine who will replace the disgraced former city bosses - Municipal
Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STREET sellers in Naples have given the ultimate accolade to Antonio Di
Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate. As the traditional
nativity figures come on the market for Christmas cribs, his effigy has been
included alongside the wise men and shepherds.
When Mr Di Pietro visited the Naples magistrature this week the throng of
well-wishers was so large he was obliged to leave through a side entrance.
The man he came to interrogate, Mr Francesco Di Lorenzo, a former Liberal
health minister and one of the city's former political bosses, also had to
leave by a side entrance - to avoid a hostile crowd.
The law has suddenly become a hero in this city with a reputation for
cheerful anarchy and honouring the law merely in the breach. In less than 12
months a once impregnable political clique of mainly Christian Democrat and
Socialist politicians has been discredited and humbled by revelations of
bribe taking on a scale unparalleled elsewhere in Italy. Mr Di Lorenzo this
week was even offering to hand back L4bn (Pounds 1.6m) taken in bribes.
But if the traditional political bosses have been forced to the sidelines
and face jail, no clear successor has emerged to run this chaotic sprawling
metropolis, which is due to host the summit next July of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations. The big test comes this weekend when Naples'
960,000 voters, along with nearly a quarter of the Italian electorate, go to
the polls to elect a new municipal administration.
Opinion polls suggest that the four parties long associated with governing
Naples - Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats -
can scarcely muster 20 per cent of the vote against 60 per cent bought with
political patronage in previous elections. Their candidate for mayor, Mr
Massimo Caprara, a former communist and elder statesman, is trailing fourth.
The contest has narrowed down to Ms Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of
Il Duce, who is running for mayor on the neo-fascist MSI ticket, and the
veteran former communist, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the mayoral candidate of the
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
Ms Mussolini, elected as a Naples deputy in April, is marginally ahead in
the polls. Her campaign of photogenic smiles and bold talk of rediscovering
the 'real Naples' has little to do with her success. She is a political
lightweight riding on the back of nostalgic evocations of the Mussolini name
and her film star aunt Sophia Loren's close identification with Naples. She
has benefited from the MSI's strong local roots and the party's distance
from the various corruption scandals that have seen 60 of the 80 previous
local councillors implicated. Ms Mussolini has also picked up support
switched from the old ruling parties. The police meanwhile believe the vote
controlled by organised crime, estimated to number 80,000, will swing behind
Ms Mussolini.
The PDS, backed by a leftist alliance, is campaigning hard on promises to
restore the rule of law and make Naples work. 'From the traffic to
industrial production, from the schools to the municipal apparatus, Naples
today is on the edge of collapse . . . . In all these areas the mayor has to
and can do something,' says Mr Bassolino of his programme 'My Naples'.
In the partial municipal elections of last June, PDS-backed administrations
won eight out of 10 municipalities in the Naples area, long dominated by
Christian Democrats. In Naples itself, PDS supporters hope enough voters
will recognise the city's problems are so dramatic that a Mussolini vote
would only make them worse.
Naples has been under special administration since the council was dissolved
in July and the city declared bankrupt. The 1993 budget had been drawn up
with creative accounting that grossly over-estimated sales of municipal
property and tax collection while under-estimating expenses. The main
municipal services are in chronic deficit, and all the parties are promising
varying forms of privatisation.
Mr Bassolino has produced a brave 100-day action plan to end years of
deliberate municipal neglect in the water supplies, traffic control,
accountancy standards, supervision of contracts and building licences and
schooling. Naples has school truancy rates as high as 40 per cent in some
areas, which both influences, and is influenced by, the high instance of
juvenile crime.
A combination of low productivity, political patronage, the presence of
organised crime and poor infrastructure have long frightened away
investment.
Recession has made matters worse as have cuts in central government
transfers. As a result Naples has 350,000 unemployed, close to 30 per cent
of the workforce. The sole element that thrives is the contraband and drugs
trade which remain tolerated in part because of the income generated.
Against this background, Sunday's vote will mark either the beginning of an
attempt to revive the fortunes of Naples or a further stage in its decline.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday stepped up
their criticism of the monetary policy of the Bundesbank, accusing it of
causing 'hundreds of thousands' of job losses in German industry.
At the annual conference of the SPD, they called for a 'more appropriate
external value' of the D-Mark to promote jobs, but denied that they were
seeking an outright devaluation of the national currency.
At the same time they warned of the need for 'massive cuts' in public sector
consumption in the medium term, in order to bring the country's ballooning
national debt under control.
And they gave strong support to plans for a Europe-wide strategy on economic
growth and job creation, calling for the proposals drawn up by Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, to be strengthened and
extended.
Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD and party spokesman on the
economy, rounded on the Bundesbank in a statement of party strategy on job
creation, intended as the basis of the next year's election platform. He
said the high interest rates imposed by the central bank had made the D-Mark
too strong.
'We should not always believe in the absolute wisdom of the Bundesbank,' he
told the party conference in the spa town of Wiesbaden. 'It was a great
mistake to have raised interest rates once again, at the beginning of the
recession. That has cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, because exports
have collapsed.'
He said that the effective revaluation of the D-Mark against other European
currencies by some 10 per cent had the same effect on German export prices
as a wage increase of 33 per cent.
His extraordinary attack, in a country where the actions of the central bank
are usually regarded as beyond criticism, was immediately backed by Mr
Rudolf Scharping, the SPD party leader.
'It hits the nail on the head, especially in the European context,' he said.
'When I see how we have damaged the French economy with our high interest
rates, I must say that was not clever. That was a policy focused on our own
national navel, paying attention only to our own domestic conditions.' Mr
Scharping denied that the party was calling for a devaluation of the D-Mark,
in a resolution seeking 'lower interest rates and a more appropriate
external value of the D-Mark.
Mr Lafontaine warned the party that it would have to take drastic action to
control public expenditure if it wins the elections next October, by seeking
to shift spending from consumption to job-creating investment. He stressed
that the party intends to keep the growth in public spending below the
nominal growth of the gross domestic product, in a long-term strategy to cut
the national debt.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday set the scene for today's crucial
ministerial meeting on restructuring the west European steel industry by
approving amended plans for the sale of Ekostahl, the state-owned east
German steelmaker.
The Commission also attached strict safeguard clauses to the plan, to dispel
private steelmakers' fears about distortion of the market.
Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, is to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl from
the Treuhand privatisation agency, and build a new mill with a capacity of
900,000 tonnes. But Riva has now also pledged to close one of its own east
German mills, cutting capacity by a further 320,000 tonnes by mid-1994.
State subsidies to Ekostahl will be reduced from DM883m (Pounds 350m) to
DM813m.
The Commission said it was now up to EU industry ministers, meeting in
Brussels today, to tackle the steel crisis by unanimously approving plans
for restructuring east German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese state steel
producers. Only the Italian government has failed to agree with the
Commission on an acceptable balance between state aid and closures.
Officials are sceptical about the chances of a breakthrough today, but if
the Commission's proposals are implemented the EU's state-owned steelmakers
will have to cut capacity by a total of 5.5m tonnes, and will be allowed to
receive Ecu6.8bn (Pounds 5.18bn) of subsidies in return.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Plan for European security conference soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Union plans to host a European security conference in the first
half of 1994, aimed at settling latent frontier and minority problems in
eastern Europe, diplomats in Paris said yesterday, writes David Buchan.
Plans are far advanced for the 12 members of the EU to use their Brussels
summit next month to launch the initiative for a European 'stability pact',
first broached several months ago by France, the diplomats claimed.
They described the plan as 'an exercise in preventive diplomacy', designed
to deal with unresolved ethnic and border problems in east European
countries that 'have a vocation to join the European Union or be very
closely associated with it', rather than existing conflicts in the Balkans
or the Caucasus.
Invitations to attend the conference would probably go to members of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europea (CSCE), including the US,
Canada and Russia, but excluding those in the Caucasus and central Asia.
However, the geographical scope of the 'stability pact' would be limited to
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and the
three Baltic republics. The planned EU initiative would take the form of an
opening conference, followed by bilateral negotiations between East European
countries on 'good neighbourly' accords. Such agreements would form part of
the 'stability pact' which, if all went well, could be adopted by a
winding-up conference in 1995. The final document would be deposited with
the CSCE.
The Belgian presidency of the EU had sounded possible participants in the
conference and drawn a generally favourable reaction, the diplomats claimed.
Hungary was described as being the most enthusiastic about the idea because
of the possibility of improving the lot of the large ethnic Hungarian
minorities in Romania and Slovakia.
A key doubt had been the possibility of whether Russia would want to deal
with the issue of the large ethnic Russian minorities in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania bilaterally with those new Baltic republics. But President Boris
Yeltsin was said to have recently confirmed to Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, who first raised the stability pact idea in April, that Russia
would negotiate minority issues in the Baltic region in a multilateral
forum.
The stability pact is designed to be on the Twelve's first joint foreign
policy initiatives since their Maastricht treaty came into force this month.
According to diplomats here, the Twelve hope the prospect of entry into the
EU will serve as a political incentive for East European countries first to
settle differences among themselves. 'But the stability pact is not a strict
pre-condition for East European countries joining the EU,' said one
diplomat.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Balladur urges banks to ease credit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Edouard Balladur yesterday asked French banks to ease the
credit crunch that has pushed many small companies under, in a move
reflecting concern about the weakness of the country's economic recovery.
In return, Mr Balladur yesterday reviewed with leading bankers their demands
for a change in the bankruptcy law to give creditors greater security; an
extension of government guarantees on bank loans to small and medium-sized
companies; and a cut in the tax on bank deposit interest.
Defending itself against criticism that banks have been squeezing small
companies, the Association of French Banks, which represents about 60 per
cent of all banks in France, said yesterday its total loans outstanding at
September 30 1993 were 2.5 per cent larger than a year earlier. But the
association acknowledged that the recession had forced banks to be more
cautious in lending to smaller companies.
The government is already in the process of meeting several of the banks'
demands. A reform of the bankruptcy law, to give creditors greater
protection when a company declares itself bankrupt, is to go before the
national assembly next week. Meanwhile, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, yesterday said the government intended to cut tax on the recovery'
bank deposit interest from 39 to 19 per cent in 1995. The 39 per cent tax
rate has encouraged savers to put their money into lower-taxed money market
funds rather than deposits which banks can count into their balance sheets.
'Banks must play their part in the recovery,' Mr Alphandery told the
national assembly. 'It would be very damaging if a lack of dynamism in our
banking sector put a brake on the recovery which could begin in the months
to come.'
The minister's parliamentary statement and the summoning of banking chiefs
to the prime minister's office are part of the government's desire to show
it is leaning on bankers to raise economic activity and cut joblessness.
After the meeting, Mr Michel Freyche, president of the Association of French
Banks, said that 'to the extent we have given them (small companies) the
cold shoulder, we will do so less in the future'.
Mr Balladur's caution over interest rate cuts was again evident when he
discussed next year's economic prospects with his own RPR party's
backbenchers earlier this week.
'In 1994 France should return to a growth rate which is feebly positive,' he
said, hardly a ringing reaffirmation of his government's official forecast
which is still for 1.4 per cent real growth next year.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Belgian rates cut in wake of austerity plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN government agreed early yesterday to a wide-ranging austerity
plan, prompting a reduction in two leading interest rates and a euphoric
reaction in Belgian financial markets.
After 16 hours of talks, ministers backed a three-point package which
imposes curbs on social spending and limits wage increases to the rate of
inflation until the end of 1996.
The pact also contains new measures to tackle rising unemployment,
particularly among young people.
The Belgian National Bank responded by cutting the discount rate from 6 per
cent to 5.5 per cent, while reducing the money market rate from 9.4 per cent
to 8.3 per cent. The Belgian franc strengthened against the D-Mark to close
at BFr21.25 yesterday on hopes the rate cut would help revive the economy.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, hailed the agreement as good for
Belgium and good for Europe.
The plan draws some inspiration from the forthcoming European Commission
White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment which will be the
centrepiece of next month's EU summit in Brussels, to be chaired by the
Belgian presidency.
Among the social pact's chief points are a planned reduction of around
BFr75bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in spending on health care, family allowances and
pensions.
The most sensitive proposal is to reduce family allowances in relation to
family income, starting at a threshold of BF750,000 a year.
In order to promote job creation, the government proposes to reduce sharply
the costs of hiring labour.
Businesses will be fully exempt from paying social costs in the first year
when employing people under 26 years old, sliding down to 75 per cent and 50
per cent exemptions in the second and third years.
It also proposes job-sharing to expand the number of people in work.
To raise revenue, the government proposes to raise withholding tax on
interest income from 10.3 per cent to 13.39 per cent.
The witholding tax on dividends is planned to fall from 25 per cent to 13.4
per cent.
The fate of the package will depend partly on whether Mr Dehaene's fragile
centre-left coalition can win support among opposition parties and blunt
opposition within Belgium's public sector trades unions.
This week, rolling strikes took place in Belgium in protest against the
pact.
Initial reaction among potential opponents was guarded. The Socialist party
declared that it had helped to make the austerity plan more equitable, but
it would remain vigilant on the application of the planned measures.
The Belgian economy is expected to shrink by 1.5 percent this year. It has
the highest public debt in the EU as a proportion of GDP.
Worries about this indebtedness have unnerved financial markets, and damaged
confidence in Belgium's claims to be part of a hard-core currency club built
around the D-Mark, particularly after the collapse of the exchange rate
mechanism on so-called Black Wednesday, September 16, last year.
On the markets yesterday, Belgian government bonds climbed nearly a point
following the cut in interest rates.
The Bel-20 index of leading shares jumped 21.8 to close at 1,397, despite
earlier worries that the effect of new taxes might undermine the positive
impact of lower interest rates.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Claes warns on talks over EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TALKS ON reforming the decision-making structure of the European Union
should not be mixed up with enlargement negotiations, the Belgian presidency
of the EU said yesterday.
'You can't do the two (at once): a choice has to be made,' Mr Willy Claes,
Belgian foreign minister, told the European parliament yesterday.
The Union has set itself a tough timetable of finishing negotiations with
the four candidate countries - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - by the
beginning of March 1994, in the hope that they will be able to join the EU
by the beginning of 1995.
But the parliament is concerned that the addition of new member states could
hinder EU action, unless substantial reforms are made in sensitive areas
such as majority voting by ministers, the number of European commissioners,
and the composition of the three-country 'troika' which carries out foreign
policy missions on behalf of the EU.
Smaller members of the EU have frequently voiced concerns that reforms -
particularly of the existing weighted voting system - might simply mean that
they are railroaded into decisions by larger countries, which have more
votes.
But certain MEPs believe that reform should be tackled as soon as possible,
to avoid confusion later.
Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French conservative MEP, yesterday warned
against using the argument that small member states had to be defended as
'an excuse for not doing anything'.
The parliament last night voted in favour of a resolution calling for
institutional changes to 'accompany' enlargement, including greater use of
an improved system of weighted majority voting. These changes 'must be
incorporated in the accession treaties', said the resolution.
Mr Claes said he would draw the attention of his fellow foreign ministers to
the parliament's resolution when they meet on December 6 and 7.
In theory, MEPs have the power to block the accession of new EU members but
sources close to the enlargement negotiations said yesterday they believed
the parliament would be reluctant to hold the accession process to ransom
over institutional reform.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Norway's PM optimistic on EU: Oslo may reach membership
compromise on control of energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY has held out hopes for a compromise on the difficult question of
aligning its laws on oil and gas licences with the proposed new European
Union energy directive.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, said she was
optimistic of negotiating an agreement by next spring on Norwegian
membership of the EU.
This would allow the issue to be put to a referendum in Norway next autumn,
as part of the proposed accession of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden on
January 1, 1995.
In an interview in London with the Financial Times, she stressed that Norway
would join the EU only if the other countries of western Europe adjusted
some terms of membership to Norway's special needs.
The EC needed the 'political will' to accept that Norway's geographic and
economic conditions required adaptation in the fields of fisheries,
agriculture and energy. 'We will join only if we feel we are welcome - if
other countries see that the scene in Norway is different (from elsewhere in
the EU),' she said. Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government is itself
split on the question of membership. About 60 per cent of Norwegians are
against participation in the Union, according to recent opinion polls.
This makes Norway by far the most sceptical of the four European Free Trade
Association (Efta) countries negotiating to join.
A crucial part of the negotiations centres on the question of Norway's
control over its oil and gas resources.
Norway has been allowed to take part in EU discussions on a proposed
directive to increase competition in the energy sector which would require
changes in the country's present laws on oil and gas field licences.
However, it has been unhappy about proposals under which Statoil, the
national oil company, would no longer have an automatic right to 50 per cent
participation in exploration of oil and gas fields. Additionally, the EU
wants Statoil to give up its role managing the state's financial
participation in the country's energy resources.
Mrs Brundtland said, however, that a compromise was possible here. 'If we
open for Statoil to be put in an equal situation as far as licences are
concerned, then that could be acceptable if we could keep the logical
situation that Statoil manages the present state participation. We are
looking to see if we can find solutions.'

FT  18 NOV 93 / UN seeks to end convoy attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and RON VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations will today seek firm guarantees from the three warring
factions in Bosnia that its humanitarian convoys will be given safe passage
over the coming winter to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people
in desperate need of food and shelter.
Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
described the meeting in Geneva today between the High Commissioner, Mrs
Sadako Ogata, and Bosnian political and military leaders as 'a last-ditch
effort' to ensure aid would get through.
The lives of as many as 3m people who were beneficiaries of UNHCR aid were
at risk as the bitter Bosnian winter has begun to bite with snowfalls and
temperatures well below freezing point.
'Very soon it's going to be 18 degrees centigrade below zero,' Ms Sylvana
told diplomatic correspondents in London yesterday. 'The average adult in
the enclaves has already lost 12 kilos. We are talking about people in a
very bad state indeed.'
They needed not only food, but building materials to provide adequate
shelter where many houses and apartments had been destroyed. One of the
biggest needs was for plastic sheeting, nails and plywood to give the
minimum protection against the elements, as well as coal for heating.
The aid crisis has been compounded by the continuing attacks by the warring
factions against UN relief workers and soldiers, in one of which a Danish
driver was killed last month. That incident led to the suspension of UN aid
supplies for the past three weeks by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general.
The UNHCR requires firm guarantees that all such attacks cease before
resuming its relief convoys.
A Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was yesterday officially inaugurated, to
attempt to prosecute perpetrators of murder, rape and enforced expulsions in
Europe's bloodiest conflict since the second world war, writes Ron Van de
Krol in The Hague.
The 11 judges of the international tribunal were sworn in at the
International Court of Justice for an initial period of four years.
Doubts have already been raised about the effectiveness of the UN-sponsored
tribunal because it will not try suspects in absentia. A further problem is
that UN troops have no power to make arrests.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Telecoms groups to step up outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BID by European telecommunications operators to develop a large-scale
business from 'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinational companies
intensified this week with the European Commission's clearance of a joint
venture to service the international financial services market.
The Financial Network Association, a venture company between 12 national
public telecommunications operators, six of them European, was cleared by
the Commission on condition that its services were not cross-subsidised by
revenue from monopoly operations. The FNA is the latest of a succession of
joint ventures in the last two years intended to tap the international
outsourcing market.
Europe now has at least four alliances targeted at the market, with AT&amp;T,
the US giant, set to launch its 'Worldsource' outsourcing venture in Europe
next year.
The European participants in FNA are Mercury, the UK subsidiary of Cable &amp;
Wireless, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Belgacom of Belgium, Telefonica
of Spain and Italcable of Italy. Other members include MCI, the second
largest US long distance carrier, KDD of Japan and Telstra of Australia. The
company will be offering specialised international network services to the
financial sector, in particular high-capacity networks for the conveyance of
data and image.
Mr David Bland, FNA's general manager, said: 'We will be providing
connectivity, and a seamless service, to a market under-provided for at the
moment.' The alliance will be offering 'managed bandwidth' for services
largely designed by the users.
The FNA faces strong competition not only from other outsourcing ventures,
but also from Swift, the body jointly owned by international banks to manage
their main network functions.
The FNA reflects the growing complexity of international telecommunications
alliances. All of its members also belong to others alliances, some of which
are competing with fellow members.
MCI, the US long-distance carrier, formed a joint venture this summer with
BT, with whom Mercury competes in the UK; while Mercury's parent, Cable &amp;
Wireless, has a 24.5 per cent stake in Optus, the main competitor to Telstra
in Australia.
'Technology transfer is a very complex issue - the agreements run to nearly
100 pages,' says Mr Bland, who is also an MCI executive.
The size of the outsourcing market is unclear. Financial institutions are
among the highest corporate spenders on telecoms, but they have
sophisticated networks and managers of their own.
Mr Ian Moore, director of the financial services group of the UK
Telecommunications Managers' Association, said: 'I don't believe there is
going to be much of an outsourcing requirement.
'For truly international institutions, telecommunications are strategic; for
the rest, their international requirements are minimal.'
Mr Bland said FNA had received expressions of interest from 'several very
large companies', but declined to name them.

FT  18 NOV 93 / S Africa's blacks get the vote: Deal on majority rule
constitution ends 350 years of white oppression

SOUTH AFRICA last night adopted a majority rule constitution, effectively
bringing to an end 350 years of white minority oppression and giving blacks
the vote for the first time.
'We have reached the end of an era . . . millions who were not allowed to
vote, will do so. I, too, for the first time in my short life, will vote,'
said Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader and the man
widely expected to become the country's next president.
Mr FW de Klerk, the South African president and the man whose vision and
reforms made the new constitution possible, will remain in charge until next
April's general election when the new constitution will take effect.
He heralded the document as the 'distillation of the dreams of generations
of disenfranchised South Africans'.
Weary negotiators reached agreement on the historic 158-page document late
last night after years of negotiation. The process was set in train when
government ministers met Mr Nelson Mandela in the months preceding his
release from jail in 1990, after 27 years in detention for opposing the
racist state.
The constitution will remain in force for up to five years and is based on
traditional western values which contrast sharply with apartheid, one of the
most repressive regimes in history.
It guarantees multi-party democracy, equality before the law, fundamental
human rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and a free press.
Mr Matthew Phosa, the ANC's constitutional negotiator, said the 21 parties
which agreed the constitution had dug 'the grave for apartheid'.
Mr Roelf Meyer, the government's chief negotiator, shocked delegates to the
negotiating council when he announced that the government had agreed to a
very weak form of multiracial power-sharing, a capitulation by the ruling
National party.
All parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote will be granted a seat in
cabinet in a government of national unity, with two deputy presidents to be
chosen from the two top parties. The president will be elected by the
national assembly.
But the new constitution has powerful opponents, among them the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the white right
wing, led by retired army general Constand Viljoen.
They form the so-called 'Freedom Alliance' which poses a substantial threat
to the stability of the government which will emerge after elections on
April 27 next year.
Mr de Klerk has left open the possibility that the Alliance may ratify the
constitution after it has been adopted by the other 21 parties, but this
seemed increasingly unlikely.
Concessions were made to the Alliance in last night's debate, including
allowing regions to write their own constitutions and requiring a two-thirds
majority of the regional house of assembly, the senate, to change the powers
of regions. But these did not appear sufficient to bring the Alliance back
on board.
With a low-level civil war already raging in Natal province between Inkatha
and the ANC, and with the right wing heavily armed and well trained, the two
could prevent elections altogether unless they are accommodated. The
president will try for a consensus, but will have the final say where this
is not possible.

FT  18 NOV 93 / City groups raise Pounds 1m fund to counter IRA bombers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE City institutions have assisted in raising a Pounds 1m fund to help
police reward those with information about IRA attacks on economic targets.
The unprecedented move was announced yesterday by Scotland Yard with minimum
details so as to protect the main sponsors from further terrorist attacks.
In a rare example of an institution prepared to comment, the National
Westminster Bank, whose City of London tower office was badly damaged in the
last attack by the IRA on the City in April, said it strongly backed the
initiative.
The bank said: 'This is an important additional mechanism that will help
pursue those responsible for terrorist attacks.'
According to Scotland Yard, the initiative had been jointly developed over
the past year by senior officers of its anti-terrorist branch S013 and top
managers of UK-based companies. S013 has national UK mainland responsibility
for conducting anti-terrorist operations together with MI5, the security
service.
Money already committed comes from dozens of unnamed companies throughout
the country and will be administered by joint agreement between the police
and the main sponsors.
It is not clear yet if the full sum will be held in an escrow account or
remain the responsibility of the companies until needed. The amount to be
paid out at any one time will depend on the quality of the information.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch said last night: 'Our
experience is that we do not have to provide financial inducement to get
useful information on terrorist activities. But if there is the slightest
chance that an individual might be tipped over by a reward, then we should
take it.'
The initiative was prompted by business concern at the commercial costs of
IRA attacks over the past two years in the City and elsewhere. Neither the
Corporation of London nor the headquarters of the Confederation of British
Industry in London would comment on the initiative.
In Northern Ireland, the local business community will today back a trade
union initiated 'community day of action' in support of peace.
Mr Nigel Smyth, the CBI's Northern Ireland director, said there was a
widespread feeling now that every effort should be made to bring violence to
an end. 'People have to accept that we have to look to the future and we
need compromise and understanding,' he said.
Business leaders in the province are holding back from detailed political
pronouncements for fear they might be targeted by terrorists. But
significantly the CBI has not rejected any option for getting peace talks
under way.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Nigeria's civilian leader ousted by military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened last night as General Sani Abacha, the
defence minister, deposed the country's civilian head of state.
Chief Ernest Shonekan, leader of the interim administration appointed in
August, was said by aides to have been forced to resign by senior army
officers at a four-hour meeting in the capital, Abuja, yesterday.
Gen Abacha, a key member of former military governments, has been the most
powerful figure in the interim civilian-led administration since it was
appointed by the former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida. The
army remained in charge, however.
Mr Shonekan, a lawyer and industrialist, said in a statement read by an
announcer on state television he had resigned after consultations with
military chiefs, including Gen Abacha.
The statement said: 'They expressed serious concern about the general
uneasiness in the country and apparent lack of stability over the past few
months.
'They spoke about restiveness of the rank and file in the military.'
Last night the British government condemned the move. A foreign office
statement said: 'The foreign secretary (Mr Douglas Hurd) deplores the
decision of the Nigerian military to reverse the democratic process in
Nigeria and to dissolve all democratically elected institutions.'
'Military dictatorship cannot solve Nigeria's problems. This is a serious
step backwards not merely for Nigeria but for Africa as a whole,' the
statement added.
Tension has been rising since last week's decision to increase domestic fuel
prices six fold, which triggered demonstrations in Lagos and a general
strike, which entered its third day yesterday.
The development, which Mr Shonekan's supporters described as 'an effective
coup' will be a major setback to hopes for the country's economic recovery,
and raises fears of instability should Gen Abacha not have the full backing
of the armed forces.
But these fears were downplayed last night by sources close to the military
establishment. Mr Shonekan, a respected businessman who was first appointed
chairman of a civilian administration in December 1992, is a technocrat who
made economic recovery his priority.
Working closely with the private sector, he drew up a policy blueprint
designed to win the backing of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund and pave the way to rescheduling of the country Dollars 30bn (Pounds
20.1bn) external debt.
Removing the fuel subsidy, which made Nigerian petrol among the cheapest in
the world, was a fundamental part of the programme.
The country has been losing revenue with fuel intended for the domestic
market being smuggled - often with the connivance of senior military
officers - into neighbouring states, where fuel prices are several times
higher.
Successive efforts to raise the price met fierce resistance from Nigerian
consumers, convinced that the additional revenue would go not into
government services but disappear in the corruption endemic in Nigeria.
The change of power means plans to hold a fresh election next February may
also have to be suspended.

FT  18 NOV 93 / Fall in RPI boosts hopes of lower rates: Retail sales growth
remains disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP DROP in inflation last month, together with disappointing growth in
shop sales, yesterday revived hopes that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
will cut interest rates around Budget day.
Intense price competition, particularly among food retailers, pulled the
retail prices index down by 0.1 per cent in October, cutting the annual rate
of inflation to 1.4 per cent last month from 1.8 per cent in September.
As a further sign of falling inflationary pressure in the UK, BP yesterday
announced it was cutting petrol prices by 9p a gallon, 2p a litre.
Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - also
dropped 0.1 per cent on the month, returning the year-on-year rate of
underlying inflation to a 25-year low, reached in May, of 2.8 per cent. This
compares with 3.3 per cent in the year to September and the government's
target ceiling of 4 per cent. The fall in the headline rate means that
inflation has now been below 2 per cent for 10 consecutive months, the
longest run below this level since 1960.
The sluggish picture on prices coincided with and reflected other official
figures that showed retail sales growth slowing in October. Together the
figures underlined the patchiness of the recovery and consumers' reluctance
to spend.
Last month retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent
compared with the previous month to stand 3.2 per cent higher than a year
ago. This was the lowest year-on-year rate of growth for five months.
Share prices rose on heightened expectations that bank base rates may be cut
from the 6 per cent level set in January. The FT-SE 100 share index closed
up 22.5 at 3,120. Gilts prices rose about a point in response to the low
inflation figures. But interest rate speculation hit sterling, which closed
in London down a pfennig at DM2.5175 and fell almost a cent to Dollars
1.477, before regaining some ground in New York.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the
figures showed the UK had a 'once in a generation' opportunity to break out
of inflationary cycles. 'I really do think it is time we broke out of the
British belief that unless we have got inflation we haven't got a buoyant
economy,' he said.
But the weakness of shop sales is likely to increase pressure on Mr Clarke
to minimise further tax rises in the November 30 Budget for fear of damaging
demand.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the inflation and retail sales
figures illustrated the weakness of the recovery and called for interest
rates to be cut now in the interest of the economy and not when it was
politically right for the chancellor.
The latest drop in inflation reduces the chance that underlying inflation
will breach the government's 4 per cent target ceiling over the next few
months. The outlook, according to the Central Statistical Office, is that
inflation will remain subdued as big retailers compete to slash prices.
The most buoyant area of retail sales was household goods, 2.3 per cent
higher in the latest three months, compared with the previous three-month
period. Compared with a year ago, they were 10.1 per cent higher.
Seasonally adjusted retail sales values rose by 0.1 per cent on the month,
and their year-on-year rate slowed to 5.4 per cent in October from 6.1 per
cent in September.

SOUTH AFRICA was last night on the verge of majority rule as democracy
negotiators put the finishing touches to a constitution which will end 350
years of white minority oppression and give blacks the vote for the first
time in history.
By late last night, weary negotiators had reached agreement on all but a few
points of the historic 158-page constitution, the fruit of years of
negotiation. The process was set in train when government ministers met Mr
Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, while he was still

the most repressive regimes in history. It guarantees multiparty democracy,
equality before the law, fundamental human rights and freedoms, an
independent judiciary, and a free press.

With a low level civil war already raging in Natal province between Inkatha

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday refused to say if the US would cancel a
military exercise with South Korea if North Korea allows inspection of its
nuclear facilities, Reuter reports from Washington.
'I'm not at liberty to comment on that now. The negotiations are going on
and I don't think I should comment. I'll have more to say about that, I
hope, in the next few days,' he told reporters.
The Washington Times reported yesterday Mr Clinton's foreign policy advisers
want him to cancel Operation Team Spirit, a joint military exercise by the
US and South Korea planned for the spring, in exchange for a North Korean
pledge to end a dispute over nuclear development.
Pyongyang, which for years has angrily denounced the manoeuvres as a dress
rehearsal for an invasion of the North, has reportedly offered to let
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors visit its nuclear complex.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defence Secretary Les Aspin and
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake discussed the matter on Monday, but
when asked about the offer, Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary,
said: 'No decision has been made.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Moi under fire over tribal violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICA WATCH, the human rights group, yesterday warned that ethnic conflict
in Kenya could degenerate into civil war unless President Daniel arap Moi's
government took immediate steps to end the violence, Leslie Crawford writes
from Nairobi.
In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating
tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands
have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system
in 1991.
'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this
ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to
prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says.
'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President
Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere
conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.'
'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming
possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the report says.
The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the
Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are
distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority
tribes.
The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet
donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid.
Although President Moi recently announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m)
programme to resettle displaced victims, co-sponsored by the UN Development
Programme, Africa Watch urges Kenya's donors to continue withholding aid
until the government takes effective steps to curb the violence.

FT  17 NOV 93 / IMF lightens the gloom in Moldova: 'Impressive' economic
reforms by the republic have raised hopes of loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE street lights are few and the shops close early because of severe energy
shortages, but prospects have brightened in Moldova, one of the smallest
former Soviet republics.
Following strong backing for its reform programme by the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, this agricultural state, sandwiched between
Ukraine and Romania, could become one of the few ex-Soviet republics to
conclude a stand-by arrangement with the IMF this year.
If the government agrees to speed up privatisation, implement tighter
monetary policy and liberalise foreign trade and prices, it could unlock
Dollars 70m of badly needed external financing.
This would be in addition to a Dollars 32m loan under the IMF's new systemic
transformation facility  - designed to aid countries in transition to a
market economy  - agreed in September, and a Dollars 60m rehabilitation loan
from the World Bank agreed last month.
The reform programme of Mr Andrei Sanagheli's government sets targets for
1994 which include:
curbing inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of the year, down from a
monthly average of 31 per cent in the first nine months of this year;
reducing the budget deficit from this year's 6 per cent of GDP target to 3.5
per cent;
privatising one-third of state property.
Hopes of a deal are high, with the IMF and World Bank describing Moldova's
reforms as 'impressive' and pointing to a greater degree of consensus on
reform among Moldova's leadership than in other parts of the former Soviet
Union.
The government has already taken some bold and politically difficult steps.
In September, it raised bread and milk prices eightfold overnight, reducing
subsidies from 80 to 40 per cent. World Bank officials say it has also
stopped granting preferential credits to state companies, some of which were
receiving loans at 15-20 per cent, well below the 170 per cent re-financing
rate.
It also launched a mass privatisation programme last month, with its first
voucher-based auction. Under the scheme, Moldovans receive vouchers
according to the number of years they have worked for the state. They can
use the vouchers to buy their homes or to buy shares in the 1,580 state
commercial companies due to be auctioned off by the end of 1994.
A 50 per cent stake in companies in agro-processing  - an important sector
given that agriculture contributes around 40 per cent of Moldova's gross
national product  - is to be given to the farms that have supplied them for
the past 10 years, while the remainder will be auctioned.
The State Department for Privatisation hopes to interest foreign investors
once companies have been transferred to private ownership. According to Mr
Vissarion Cheshuev, the SDP's general director, foreign companies will have
access to a stock exchange, due to be set up next year, which will trade
shares in the privatised companies. They can also form joint ventures under
existing regulations.
By October, foreign investors from east and west Europe and the US, had
invested Dollars 52m in some 170 joint ventures, many of them in
agro-processing. But few expect foreign investment to accelerate until the
country resolves the conflict in its eastern Trans-Dnestr region.
Fearing that the country's ethnic Romanian majority would seek reunification
with Romania, Russian speakers on the left bank of the Dnestr river three
years ago declared themselves independent from the Moldovan government in
Chisinau and set up their own state.
A tense ceasefire has held since fighting claimed hundreds of lives last
year, but the conflict and the splitting of the country in two has
undermined the economy and complicated reform efforts.
It has also soured Moldova's relations with Russia, which has supported the
separatists both financially and through the former Soviet Union's 14th army
stationed in Tiraspol, Trans-Dnestr's 'capital'.
Russia's support of the Trans-Dnestrans is one reason why the Moldovan
parliament, which includes a sizeable lobby demanding unification with
Romania, voted against joining the Commonwealth of Independent States in
August.
However, President Mircea Snegur convinced the parliament and the country
that this decision would lead to economic disaster for Moldova, which
imports most of its raw materials and 90 per cent of its fuel from the CIS,
and he signed the economic union agreement with Russia and other former
Soviet republics in Moscow in September.
'We have to accept that our economy is nothing but part of a former huge
country's economy,' he says.
The president says the majority of Moldovans never favoured reunification
with Romania and that the country will pursue a 'strong policy of
co-operation with the east'.
But the government's attempts at rapprochement with Moscow appear to have
done little so far to resolve the situation in Trans-Dnestr.
President Boris Yeltsin declined to receive President Snegur on an official
visit to Moscow last month, in spite of Mr Snegur's strong support for Mr
Yeltsin in his battle against parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Italians yesterday demonstrated over job prospects to increase
the pressure on a government which opponents say is reaching the end of the
line, Reuter reports from Rome.
Some 50,000 building workers, angry over the effects of the country's huge
corruption scandal on employment, demonstrated in central Rome, while
steelworkers protesting against EU production cuts went on strike in the
southern port city of Taranto.
Italy's two main opposition parties, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS)
and the fast-growing, pro-autonomy Northern League, are pushing hard for
early elections.
In Rome city centre, traffic ground to a halt for the second successive day
as a result of demonstrations. On Monday, traffic wardens took to the
streets to protest against privatisation plans and to demand better
benefits.
Construction work has virtually come to a halt in Rome as city officials
suspend investment while a storm rages over bribes paid for public sector
contracts. Officials say some 120,000 jobs in the construction sector have
already been lost in 1993.

A DISPUTE between Germany's foreign and defence ministers has flared in
public with Mr Klaus Kinkel reported yesterday to have called his colleague
Mr Volker Ruhe 'a lout and a boor' for meddling in foreign policy, Reuter
reports from Bonn.
Stern magazine said Mr Kinkel had complained angrily to members of his
liberal Free Democrats, the junior partners of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats (CDU), about the defence minister, Mr Ruhe's push to
expand his foreign policy influence. Mr Ruhe is a member of the CDU.

FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the US insurance unit of BAT Industries gave investors a chance
to take profits following the surge which has taken the share price of the
tobacco and insurance conglomerate to an all-time high.
News that the California Insurance Commission will investigate BAT's Farmers
Insurance Group after it was criticised by a judge sent the shares down 13
to 503p with 8.7m traded.
However, BAT said yesterday that it was confident that the Farmers
subsidiary would pass any review into its procedures. And analysts said
problems related to an agency involved with Farmers, rather than Farmers
itself.
Paints group Kalon saw unusually high turnover as one big institutional
shareholder sold its entire stake in the company via Kalon's broker, Smith
New Court. Some 8.2m shares were bought at 164p and placed with a variety of
institutions at 166p apiece.
The shares represent 6.8 per cent of the company. In August, the leading
institutional stakeholders were Prolific Asset Management with 7.8 per cent
and 3i with 6.3 per cent. Kalon dipped 4 1/2 to 167p.
The oil majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, were 'spooked',
according to oil sector specialists, by the crude oil market's failure to
make any progress during the last week or so and also by suggestions that US
funds had turned sellers of BP, having built up holdings in excess of 27 per
cent over the past 18 months or so.
Talk of heavy selling from the US was viewed as surprising by UK analysts,
although BP shares drifted down 9 1/2 to 341 1/2 p. 'BP have come back in
line with the US oil majors, nothing more,' said one specialist.
Shell, however, was aggressively sold and settled 11 down at 681p after the
oil team at Kleinwort Benson published a straight sell recommendation on
Shell and Royal Dutch. Downgrading the stocks from 'hold' to 'sell',
Kleinwort said both 'offered a safe earnings and dividend stream but the
ratings appeared stretched on yield relative grounds'.
The sector's exploration and production stocks staged a rally, with
Enterprise up 8 to 453p on good turnover of 1.3m and Lasmo 3 harder at 133p,
after 135p.
Selected property shares continued their rise begun on Monday, with Land
Securities again showing a good advance ahead of today's results.
Analysts expect little change to last year's Pounds 116m, but a confident
statement would help consolidate the shares' recent strength. There was also
talk in the market that the group is poised to announce the development of
Stag Place in London's West End, with the Department of Environment tipped
to pre-let part of it in a Pounds 5m deal. Land rose 13 to 728p.
Gambling and hotels group Ladbroke was again under pressure as joint house
broker Smith New Court cut its profits forecast. Other brokers followed suit
as worries surfaced that the group's DIY business was suffering in the
industry's prolonged price war. Smith was said to have cut from Pounds 152m
to Pounds 140m. The shares fell 6 to 157p in turnover of 5.3m.
Forte was said to be talking to analysts about improving occupancy levels in
its London hotels. The shares improved 3 to 234p.
Drinks giant Guinness surged as NatWest Securities reaffirmed its positive
stance and James Capel was said to have issued a buy note. The stock
advanced 13 to 442p. Whitbread 'A' added 10 at 499p on speculation that
tomorrow's results will exceed market expectations.
VTR shares forged ahead 17 to 99p after the video editing group announced
profits up 103 per cent.

FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Activity in BAA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airport operator BAA endured a rollercoaster ride in the market as investors
and analysts digested the company's half-year results.
The shares tumbled initially, coming off 16 at one stage, as concern mounted
that the group's dividend pay-out implied a poorer full-year total and
hinted at lower earnings growth. However, BAA spent the day pointing out
that this was not the case and the shares recovered. They were later
squeezed up in what dealers described as a technical rally, ending 20 ahead
at 921p.
BAA's affirmation of its overseas ambitions, together with its declaration
to move to quarterly reporting, fuelled speculation that the company may
seek an ADR listing in New York. The group already has a management
arrangement with one US airport and is known to want to further its US
ambitions. Transport analysts left their full-year forecasts largely
untouched, the market range remaining around Pounds 312m to Pounds 323m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: GenAcc setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second worst performance among the FT-SE 100 list came from composite
insurer General Accident, which retreated 4.8 per cent after the group
revealed third-quarter profits well below the market's best estimates.
Dealers pointed out, however, that some of the more optimistic insurance
analysts had shifted their forecasts higher over the past week or so in the
wake of perceived good results from companies such as BAT Industries and
Royal Insurance. 'There were some very full forecasts in the market and,
sadly, they have not come off, that is why the shares have fallen so
sharply,' said one top insurance analyst.
GenAcc's nine-month profits came out at Pounds 206m, compared with market
estimates which had ranged from below Pounds 200m to as much as Pounds 230m.
Mr Trevor May, insurance specialist at BZW, said the market had got carried
away with the company's first-half numbers, which he said had been
surprisingly good. He upgraded his current year forecast, however, from
Pounds 260m to Pounds 270m and that for next year from Pounds 330m to Pounds
345m, although emphasising that the group's dividend growth scope remains
'limited'.
Hoare Govett, GenAcc's house broker, said the market had overreacted on the
downside against some rather unrealistic expectations. Hoare is looking for
current year profits of Pounds 282m and profits of Pounds 367m for next
year.
Some of the big institutions were thought to have switched from GenAcc into
Sun Alliance. The latter rose 6 to 370p on turnover of 3.2m, GenAcc settled
33 lower at 658p on much higher than usual turnover of 3m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend blow at BOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURMUDGEONLY dividend forecasts from BOC combined with caution over future
prospects prompted a savage market rerating of the shares yesterday. The
stock was the hardest hit in the FT-SE 100 Index, dropping 30 to 596p, its
lowest point for more than a year, with turnover of 8.5m nudging record
levels.
Most chemicals analysts had been expecting a continuation of a policy
established some five years ago of dividend growth above inflation. But when
BOC announced profits in line with expectations at Pounds 337.6m, up from
Pounds 215m, it also said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 23.2p for
the year to September 1994.
The company said: 'It is very difficult to look forward to that year (1994)
with confidence in economic circumstances that are becoming more uncertain
rather than more certain.'
The board made moves to persuade analysts that the flat dividend projection
was merely a shift in policy that had ignored low UK inflation and interest
rates, but most saw the move as an underlying indication of gloomy times to
come.
Moreover, having seen BOC's share price tumble from above 760p over the past
nine months, analysts had hoped the problems were now discounted in the
price.
Mr Jeremy Chantry, chemicals analyst with Kleinwort Benson, said that in
spite of heavy falls in the share price in the past months, he expected
further weakness and was downgrading his positive recommendation on the
stock. 'Most people had expected a rise in the dividend - even a token rise
would have indicated some optimism for the coming year,' he added.
Courtaulds, which is expected to announce interim profits of around Pounds
88m today, suffered in BOC's wake, the shares weakening 13 to 476p.

FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares volatile ahead of retail data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market looked increasingly apprehensive ahead of developments
pending on both sides of the Atlantic and endured another volatile trading
session yesterday. Although still firm at the close, the FT-SE 100 Index had
lost much of a mid-afternoon gain of nearly 15 points after Wall Street
turned back from a strong opening.
Several leading securities houses, US investment banks in particular,
appeared to be shifting to a bearish stance in both stocks and futures, at
least for the short term. The Footsie 3,100 mark, which is proving
increasingly elusive, was lost, regained and lost again before the index
finished at 3,097.5 for a gain on the day of 4.2.
After shedding more than 10 Footsie points in early trade, equities turned
sharply better after a larger than expected reduction in German repos rates.
This was seen as opening the way for a cut in Bundesbank rates, perhaps even
tomorrow, and also for the Budget cut in UK base rates widely expected in
the London stock market - some optimists even asked whether a two-point cut
might be possible]
Progress was fairly slow, however, and trading volume volatile as trading
statements from several leading names of British industry left investors
still cool on economic recovery prospects. Some help came from firmness in
government bonds following satisfactory Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
numbers for October.
When Wall Street came in with an opening gain of 12 points on the Dow
Average, London moved up quickly to reach the day's high of 3,108.1. But the
UK market turned down again just as quickly when the early gain on the Dow
melted away and was replaced by a minor fall at the close of UK trading
hours.
On the domestic front, attention focused on prospects for last month's UK
Retail Price Index and retail sales, both expected at 9.30 today, and
regarded as important influences on the Budget due on November 30 from Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
Most UK analysts expect annualised RPI to remain at 1.8 per cent but any
move above this could unsettle market confidence that base rates will be cut
by a full point around Budget time. Also, the market hopes that economic
recovery will be reflected in higher retail sales in October.
US houses were covering themselves in London ahead of tonight's Congress
vote on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. NatWest Markets, the
UK banking and securities house, warned yesterday of a significant chance
that the vote could fail. 'The immediate economic impact will be negligible
but sentiment in financial markets will be dealt a more serious blow,' said
NatWest. At Salomon International, Mr Marcus Grubb suggested that investors
seriously worried about the NAFTA vote might buy gold.
Seaq volume, at 654.8m shares, jumped by nearly one third from the previous
session, and dealers pointed to several bought deals as a sign of genuine
investment activity. The bright spot was the renewed interest in second line
stocks which lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 4.5 to 3,421. On Monday,
retail business in equities fell to Pounds 1.05bn, a further indication of
the cautious mood this week.

GROWING nervousness over the prospects for the London equity market was
underscored yesterday by an unusually large and exceptionally bearish deal
in traded options, writes Peter John.
Marketmakers said Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, had bought 8,000
FT-SE puts - options to sell the market at a fixed time and price - expiring
in February at 2,800. Morgan Stanley was unavailable for comment but traders
were surprised at the size of the deal, which boosted turnover in FT-SE 100
options to 27,700 and overall options turnover to 51,800.
The trade was seen as insurance against the underlying market falling below
the expiry price, and thus represented a view that the FT-SE 100 could slide
300 points over the next three months.
A further indicator of unease came from the level of implied volatility, the
measure of uncertainty within the market, which rose by two percentage
points to 17 per cent.
Among stock options, Hanson was the most active performer as one house
rolled forward exposure from November series to the February's.
The Footsie futures contract for December opened weak but traded up to 3,121
before falling in the afternoon to close at 3,106. At that level it was some
8 points above the cash market and above it's estimated fair value premium
of around 5 points. Turnover topped 12,000 lots.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record high on hopes
for Nafta vote
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER A lacklustre start, blue chip stocks roared into record territory
yesterday as expectations that Congress would approve Nafta in today's
crucial vote helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average close above 3,700 for
the first time, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Industrial Average was 33.25 stronger at 3,710.77 and
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 2.99 at 466.74. Secondary
indices, however, fared less well, with the American SE composite index
finishing down 3.09 at 474.73 and the Nasdaq composite 0.76 lower at 771.69.
New York SE volume came to 304m shares.
Trading was initially hampered by uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the
House of Representatives' vote (due some time tonight) on the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
The markets view passage of Nafta as bullish for equities - free trade
should promote exports and economic growth, say economists - but remain
concerned that a majority of House members may vote against the treaty on
the grounds that it will lead to a loss of US jobs to Mexico.
Both sides claimed yesterday that they had enough votes for victory, but
reports late in the day that President Clinton had locked up enough votes to
ensure Nafta passes into law provided stocks with a strong lift in the final
hour of trading.
The gains were achieved in spite of further declines in bond prices, which
pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.16 per cent and
fuelled fears that long-term interest rates may be on the rise.
Telefonos de Mexico, the market's biggest 'Nafta play', continued to be
buffeted by the uncertainty surrounding the treaty's fortunes. After posting
declines in the previous two trading days, Telmex yesterday rebounded
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 in volume of 8m shares.
Among leading Dow stocks, General Electric climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
96 3/8 , IBM added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 and General Motors rose
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 . General Motors class 'E' shares, however,
fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 as investors reacted to news that the company
is considering using 185m of the shares to fund its pension liability if it
receives the go-ahead of regulators.
Much of the early weakness in the Dow was attributable to a sharp decline in
Caterpillar shares, which lost Dollars 3 to Dollars 86 7/8 before rallying
to end a net Dollars 1 1/8 down at Dollars 88 3/4 . The damage was inflicted
by a downgrade and lowered earnings forecast by broking house Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
Canada
THE Toronto market retreated to a sharply lower close as today's US vote on
Nafta and tumbling natural resource shares weighed on confidence.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 24.6 to 4,257.2, while trading volume
totalled 83.2m shares valued at CDollars 777m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Credito Italiano bucks Milan
downtrend
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WITH global strategists concentrating on the big picture
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nafta, Latin America and Asia - bourses were left to their own devices,
writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN, where trading was delayed until midsession by technical problems with
the screen based system, was lower on the last day of the November account,
the Comit index shedding 11.29 or 2.1 per cent to 534.13.
Credito Italiano bucked the trend, adding L104 to L2,357 after a high of
L2,389 in a continued response to Monday's profit and dividend announcement,
and plans for its privatisation.
Heavily traded telecommunications stocks were marked down on profit-taking
and position squaring. Stet shed L107 to L3,571 and Sip L164 to L3,010.
Fiat shares dipped L31 to L3,578 as many shorts were carried over to the
December trading period, for technical reasons associated with the end of
the rights issue. FRANKFURT reflected a repo rate cut, strength in
derivatives and high hopes in banking as it celebrated today's holiday with
the DAX index 22.61 higher at 2,071.72.
Turnover rose again, from DM9.7bn to DM11.1bn. A nine basis points cut in
the repo rate suggested that another cut in key interest rates would come
sooner rather than later, and brought buying orders for the DAX future.
This lifted the big blue chips, particularly Allianz which rose DM71 to
DM2,901, with Daimler up DM7.50 to DM715.50 and Siemens DM5.50 better at
DM727.60.
In banks, the focus turned to Dresdner, DM9.50 higher at DM435.50, and to
Commerzbank, up DM7.50 to DM357.50 on talk that its impending nine-month
profits would show a rise appreciably greater than the 50 per cent plus it
forecast at the end of last month.
PARIS had an opportunity to react to the government's fixing of the
Rhone-Poulenc share offer which came in at the lower end of expectations.
The shares in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group put on FFr3.00 to
FFr156.60, compared with the price of FFr135 set for sale to retail
investors.
The CAC-40 index gained 6.76 to 2,124.66. Generale des Eaux advanced FFr65
to FFr2,646 on positive company comments while Euro Disney picked up 80
centimes to FFr34.00 as some buyers returned following a sharp decline last
week.
AMSTERDAM softened slightly as some of the major international stocks
weakened. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.3 to 137.6.
Royal Dutch shed Fl 3.00 to Fl 193.70 as one London-based broker came out
with a downgrade on the stock from hold to sell. Kleinwort Benson commented
that while the group offered a 'safe earnings and dividend stream', the
recent outperformance in the share price was a good opportunity to take
profits.
Fokker picked up 60 cents to Fl 22.30 after announcing that it had won an
order to supply new aircraft to the UK.
MADRID saw contrasts in the banking sector as the general index rose 2.04 to
302.93.
Argentaria climbed Pta290, or 4.7 per cent to a new high of Pta6,410 as
Banesto dropped Pta45, or 1.8 per cent to Pta2,425. The former was setting
the price for a second share offer late yesterday, and dealers were looking
for something at the top of the range; the latter reported a nine-month
loss, after provisions.
ZURICH was easier in low volume, awaiting tonight's Nafta vote and its
impact on US markets, and the SMI index shed 5.1 to 2,712.3.
BRUSSELS was little moved in spite of a strong rally in GIB, which rose
BFr34 or 2.6 per cent to BFr1,318, as the Bel-20 index shed just 0.38 to
1,375.92.
Elsewhere Petrofina lost BFr40 to BFr9,750 and SGB BFr55 or 2.2 per cent to
BFr2,435. Solvay advanced BFr75 to BFr14,375 on reports that a tax on some
of its products may be delayed.
STOCKHOLM lost ground after falls in both Astra and Ericsson depressed
sentiment. The Affarsvarlden general index declined 14.3 to 1,388.5.
Turnover was SKr1.4bn.
Ericsson B shares eased SKr14 to SKr408 while Astra B lost SKr1 to SKr170.
HELSINKI rose by 1.7 per cent, the Hex index closing 26.1 higher at 1,542.9.
A preliminary one-year pay deal in the paper industry took the forestry
shares index up by 2.9 per cent.
ATHENS advanced on reports that the government may impose a tax on
repurchase agreements, which analysts believe will entice cash back into
equities. The general index added 5.09 to 832.57 in good turnover of some
Dr2.6bn.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers ground
as region takes profits
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average recovered some ground after Monday's 2.3 per cent fall on
buying by pension funds and institutions, agencies report from Tokyo.
The 225-issue index finished 171.51 firmer at 18,246.12, after a day's low
of 17,877.69 and high of 18,467.25.
Volume was estimated at 260m shares. Rises outscored falls by 535 to 452,
with 174 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
improved 9.69 to 1,549.34, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.73
at 1,250.65.
Arbitrage-linked selling depressed the market in early trading but
short-covering in futures caused a technical rebound later. Comments from
government officials that the country may consider taking additional
measures to boost the economy helped sentiment.
In spite of the day's gains, many investors remain cautious ahead of the
visit of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to the US at the end of the week.
Banks and other financial stocks gained strength on bargain hunting: Nomura
Securities added Y10 at Y1,920, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y30 at Y2,280 and
Sumitomo Bank Y50 at Y2,360.
Daikyo, the building group, lost Y124 to Y946 after revising down its
forecast for earnings in the year to March 1994.
Roundup
THE region's markets were generally easier yesterday.
HONG KONG ended moderately lower as bargain hunting helped to trim early
losses. The Hang Seng index shed 49.69 to 9,683.65, having been 128 points
off at one stage.
Hong Kong Telecom lost 40 cents at HKDollars 16.10 as Goldman Sachs
downgraded its rating.
HSBC fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 88.50 but Hutchison Whampoa rose 50
cents to HKDollars 31.75. Lai Sun Garment, benefiting from institutional
switching, jumped HKDollars 2.40 to HKDollars 22.90.
SEOUL gave way to profit-taking in reaction to Monday's fourth consecutive
year's high and the composite stock index receded 8.07 to 802.65.
Among recent strong gainers, Samsung Electronics retreated Won500 to
Won47,500 and Hyundai Motor Won400 to Won32,300.
SINGAPORE was lower as brokerages imposed restrictions on intraday buying
and selling by retail investors in line with the securities authorities'
guidelines to check excessive speculation.
The Straits Times Industrial index ended 17.54 off at 2,078.01, after an
intraday low of 2,071.87. Shipyards bucked the trend, Keppel rising 55 cents
to SDollars 10.40 and Jorong Shipyard 60 cents to SDollars 13.50.
KUALA LUMPUR finished generally easier as volume shrank on lack of demand,
and buying restrictions imposed by broking firms. The composite index fell
10.07, or 1.1 per cent, to 951.30.
Some institutional interest, however, helped to push Malayan Banking 70
cents higher to MDollars 19.10.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly firmer, with the All Ordinaries index 0.9 up at
2,083.8 in turnover of ADollars 309.2m.
Activity was seen in the banks, where ANZ results disappointed many
investors and the shares lost a cent to ADollars 4.44.
NEW ZEALAND saw a fall in Carter Holt Harvey unnerve the market and the
NZSE-40 index declined 20.00 to 1,978.71. Turnover was strong at NZDollars
88m. Carter Holt finished 19 cents down at NZDollars 3.27.
MANILA strengthened, with brokers reporting activity among second line
issues. The composite index moved ahead 22.12 to 2,407.01. Turnover amounted
to 1.3bn pesos.
KARACHI ended at another record high, helped by gains in the financial and
chemical sectors. The KSE index added 62.96 at 1,780.03.
BOMBAY rose on heavy buying by foreign institutional investors after an
initial bout of profit-taking. The BSE 30-share index closed 61.91 higher at
2,848.19.
BANGKOK eased a shade, although some investors entered the market on late
bargain hunting. The SET index slipped 0.54 to 1,366.77 in turnover of
Bt15.5bn.
SHANGHAI and SHENZHEN saw brisk volume on buying by overseas institutional
funds, and their B share indices rose 5.1, or 7.3 per cent, to 75.28 and
1.36, or 1.8 per cent, to 78.15 respectively.
Over the past two weeks, Shanghai Bs have climbed 26 per cent and Shenzhen's
15 per cent.
TAIWAN fell back on profit-taking, the weighted index relinquishing 27.80 to
4,301.25. Turnover dipped to TDollars 34.9bn from Monday's TDollars 47.5bn.
Among the actives, China Steel lost 50 cents to TDollars 19.40.
COLOMBO continued to fall, the market index shedding 12.7 to 894.0, but
turnover picked up strongly to SLRs145.4m from Monday's SLRs98.6m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt speculates as AMB shares soar
 -David Waller questions whether the insurer's popularity is based on facts,
or rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the curiosities of the sharply rising German stock market in recent
months has been the performance of shares in Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second biggest insurance group after Allianz.
Over the course of the current year AMB's shares have nearly doubled, rising
from about DM750 at the beginning of the year to DM1,430 yesterday, thus
significantly outperforming the blue chip DAX index and the more broadly
based FAZ, which have both climbed by around a third since January.
Although Allianz has also outperformed the market, reflecting investors'
liking for insurance companies at a time of declining interest rates, AMB's
spectacular rise has more to do with the fact that the Aachen-based insurer
has become a 'special situation'.
In short, AMB is at the centre of an unresolved takeover battle which has
persisted, through a multitude of baroque twists and turns and varying
degrees of intensity, since 1991, when Assurances Generales de France (AGF),
the French state-owned insurance group, bought a stake in the German
company.
After much mutual hostility, the tensions between the two groups appeared to
dissolve at the end of last year. Shareholders in AMB endorsed a
'cease-fire' which gave AGF the right to votes on its entire 25 per cent
stake plus representation on the AMB board.
In return, AGF delivered Credit Lyonnais as a buyer for a majority stake in
BfG Bank, AMB's banking subsidiary which had cost it billions since it
bought it years ago as an ill-judged foray into 'allfinanz'.
The deal was struck hours before the European single market programme came
into force, engendering images of peaceful Franco-Teutonic co-operation in
the German insurance market, the largest in Europe. But just as romantic
visions of European union have turned sour during the course of 1993, the
harmony between the French and the German camps proved illusory.
Relations between AGF and AMB have not degenerated into the outright
hostility of yesteryear. But following two transactions earlier this year, a
question mark hangs over the fate of Germany's second largest insurer.
The first took place in early May when Fondiaria, a troubled Italian
insurer, sold its 21 per cent shareholding in AMB to a group of German
institutions (including Deutsche Bank, which took 10 per cent, and Allianz ,
which took 5 per cent).
Although the purchase was presented disingenuously as a friendly move on the
part of the German financial establishment, designed as an amicable
counterbalance to AGF's position in the AMB boardroom, one does not have to
be too Machiavellian to see the purchase as an attempt to block the French.
'This was a deliberate attempt to keep a second French competitor out of the
German market,' commented the chief executive of another German insurer. The
single French-controlled company in the German insurance market is Colonia.
The second transaction followed in July when AGF announced that it had
lifted its stake in AMB to 33.5 per cent via purchases in the market. AGF's
public comments at the time were far from bellicose - but the move was seen
by investors as a move to tighten control over its German target.
In the absence of any rules governing takeovers and disclosure requirements
in Germany, it is impossible to know with certainty what has happened since
July, when AGF is thought to have paid DM1,000 a share for its extra
holding. Has AGF increased its stake still further? Or have other investors
been spreading such rumours in order to boost the price of their own
holdings?
Analysts note that in the highly illiquid market for AMB shares, small share
purchases trigger sharp price rises, making it easy for the unscrupulous to
manipulate prices. None of the main parties were willing to comment
yesterday.
One thing is certain: the shares are overvalued on fundamental grounds,
trading on around 100 times 1993 earnings with no spectacular earnings
growth in sight, and at a substantial premium to net assets, based on
outside estimates, of DM1,100 a share.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark weaker across board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark weakened across the board following the 9 basis-point drop in the
rate for two-week German securities repurchase agreements to 6.29 per cent,
writes Conner Middelmann.
The French franc firmed to FFr3.465 against the D-Mark, from FFr3.476 at
Monday's close. The Belgian franc rose to BFr21.23 per D-Mark from Monday's
BFr21.35. The Italian lira also edged higher against the D-Mark, closing at
L978.2, from L984.5 on Monday.
While the fall in the German repo rate had been largely discounted, it was
seen to facilitate near-term rate cuts among its European neighbours,
notably France and Belgium. This underpinned those countries' currencies on
the belief that further rate cuts will revive their flagging economies.
The Danish krone also firmed against the D-Mark, in spite of yesterday's
1/4 point cut in its two-week certificate of deposit rate to 7.50 per cent
and Monday's  1/4 point reduction in its discount and deposit rates to 6.75
per cent. The krone rose to around DM3.9765, from DM3.9935 on Monday.
While many market participants expect the Bank of Denmark to continue
cutting rates independently of the Bundesbank, some say it may start to
throttle the easing pace. 'They are being very cautious - like the Bank of
France, they do not want to trigger speculative flows out of their
currency,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS.
Although the Danish krone has put on a strong performance in absolute terms
since the European exchange rate mechanism was revamped on August 2, it
nevertheless remains the weakest currency in the EMS currency grid.
Sterling also received a boost from the German repo rate reduction,
breaching a key technical resistance level at DM2.5175 and closing at
DM2.5275. Today's UK retail sales and price data will be closely watched and
could provide further upside for the pound, traders said.
The US dollar remained subdued in tense trading as dealers awaited the
result of today's vote in the US congress on the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta). The outcome of the vote is expected to be known around
0100GMT.
While the vote still appeared to be a close call, cautious optimism that the
trade pact might scrape through congress supported the dollar in late London
trading.
The US currency continued its slow recovery against the Japanese yen,
closing at Y106.55, up from Monday's Y106.50. Against the D-Mark it ended at
DM1.7020, up from DM1.6900. New York trading finished with the dollar at
Y106.75 and DM1.7060.
The Canadian dollar slipped to CDollars 1.3212 against the US dollar after
the Canadian government announced its budget deficit for the current fiscal
year would be CDollars 40.5bn, compared to previous forecasts of CDollars
35.5bn. The currency closed at CDollars 1.3190.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German repo rate falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE minimum rate for German 15-day securities repurchase agreements fell 9
basis points to 6.29 per cent at the Bundesbank's latest open-market
operation, writes Conner Middelmann.
A substantial drop in the repo rate had been widely expected after the rate
for D-Mark overnight funds eased by about 10 to 15 basis points last week.
Call money remained unchanged after the operation at about 6.30 per cent due
to a DM3.2bn liquidity drain at the allocation.
In spite of this week's larger drop in the repo rate - following last week's
tiny one basis-point reduction - most market participants do not expect the
Bundesbank council to lower Germany's leading discount and Lombard rates at
its meeting tomorrow. The council meets again on December 2 and 18, and most
traders are betting on another round of key rate cuts at either of these
meetings.
The Dutch central bank swiftly followed the Bundesbank, cutting its special
advances rate by 10 basis points to 6 per cent. The move had been widely
expected and caused no ripples.
Also as expected, the Danish central bank cut its two-week certificate of
deposit rate by  1/4 percentage point to 7.50 per cent following Monday's
1/4 point cut in its discount and deposit rates to 6.75 per cent.
Austria left its rates unchanged. The discount and Lombard rates are 1/2
point below German levels and the central bank cut its GOMEX rate by 10
basis points to 6.1 per cent last week.
According to Mr Andre de Silva, market strategist at PaineWebber
International, the French and Belgian authorities might soon be tempted to
shave official rates.
Having lagged behind the Bundesbank's rate cuts in recent months, 'lower
money market rates in Germany plus a relatively firm franc could well prove
irresistible (for the Bank of France) and see 20 basis points off the
intervention rate', currently at 6.45 per cent, he said.
In Belgium, the focus remains on the government talks for a social pact. 'If
a deal is struck today, we could see a rate cut by the end of the week,'
said Mr de Silva.
In the sterling money market, the Bank of England forecast a flat liquidity
situation and carried out no money market operations. The short sterling
future rose 0.03 point to 94.47.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (9): In search of full integration -
Foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL integration into suitably expanded European economic and defence
structures as soon as possible is, and will remain for the foreseeable
future, the over-arching aim of Hungarian foreign policy.
It could hardly be otherwise. The dulling effect of distance from the
traditional fault lines of European politics is a luxury not available to
Hungary. The war in former Yugoslavia has already cost Hungary an estimated
Dollars 1bn in lost trade, increased military spending and aid to refugees.
The destruction of Slavonia, including whole cities such as Vukovar and
Osijek, by Serb forces in the early months of the Serb-Croat war took place
just across Hungary's southern border. The fighting also destroyed the homes
and livelihood of many of the 40,000 ethnic Hungarians who have lived for
centuries in these lands. Thousands are now refugees in southern Hungary.
Their counterparts, the more than 400,000 ethnic Hungarians living in the
Serbian province of Vojvodina, have not suffered war and destruction. But
the delicate ethnic and sociopolitical balance of the communities in which
they live has been dangerously upset by the influx of Serb refugees from the
fighting in Croatia and Bosnia, and the grinding poverty which war and the
UN trade embargo has brought upon Serbian citizens of all ethnic groups and
convictions.
Bitterness at the consequences of a war largely brought about by Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serb leader, and his coterie of Serbian army officers,
nationalist academics and former commissars, is compounded by the deliberate
drafting of ethnic Hungarian youths to fight on the Serbian side of the
tribal war against Croats and Muslims.
Rather than fight, many young men have slipped across the border to
relatives and friends in Hungary. As in Serbia itself, the exodus includes
many of the best, those with transferable skills and energy who have no wish
to endure the risks of a senseless war or the poverty of a future
hate-filled peace.
Fearful of further undermining the fragile viability of ethnic Hungarian
communities across the former Yugoslav borders, Budapest has kept its
protests low key, while acquiring new Mig-29 fighters from Russia to defend
its airspace and quietly building up the strength and equipment of its
formerly depleted and badly equipped army.
Above all, Budapest officials plead with the amorphous post-cold war 'west',
to take a firm stand against ethnic purging and the insidious undermining of
regional security which results from the successful use of violent means to
change the ethnic balance of ancient communities.
The trouble is that Nato, already taxed by the Greek-Turkish rivalry, and
with Britain already embroiled in its own inextricable ethnic conflict in
Northern Ireland, is deeply reluctant to extend membership in a way which
would bring in new members with unresolved historical disputes in their
knapsacks.
So Budapest knows it must be circumspect in its defence of the 3.5m ethnic
Hungarians who are descendants of those left outside the historical
boundaries of greater Hungary when the borders of the Carpathian basin
states were redrawn by the victors in the 1920 Trianon Treaty and
re-affirmed, with only minimal changes, in 1947.
Hence Budapest's espousal of the principle of minimal borders, maximum
porosity and respect for minority rights. These are principles, tirelessly
put forward by Mr Geza Jeszenszky, who has become the longest serving
foreign minister in post-communist Europe, and his able senior advisers. But
he fears that Hungary's contribution to the maintenance of peace and
stability in the region is undervalued.
'Hungary's position is not sufficiently recognised. My biggest
pre-occupation is to ensure that central Europe is not overlooked by the
west,' he says. Budapest is concerned,for example,at what it perceives as EC
appeasement over the controversial Gabcikovo dam. At the EC sponsored
meeting of central European leaders in London last year Mr Vladimir Meciar,
the Slovak leader, promised that 95 per cent of the Danube's water would be
allowed to flow through the old channels which define the international
border and would not start the hydro-power facility in the dam complex. Both
promises were broken, virtually without protest from the EC.
Drawing a parallel between inter-war appeasement and the west's impotence
over Yugoslavia, Mr Jeszenszky recalls Winston Churchill's summing up of the
1938 Munich agreement: 'We chose shame and got war.'
In spite of the legitimate reasons for Hungarian nervousness over the
possible evolution of events in the region, and concern to prevent Hungary
being tarred with the brush of regional instability, the last four years
have also had their positive side.
On the trade and investment front Hungary has successfully shifted the bulk
of its trade away from Comecon to EC markets and attracted Dollars 5.5bn in
foreign equity investment. At the same time the dissolution of the Soviet
Union means that Hungary no longer has Soviet troops on its territory and no
longer has Russia as a direct neighbour. It sets a high priority on building
up links with an independent Ukraine.
With an eye on longer term prospects for a resumption of trade and other
links with Russia, however, Budapest is also acutely aware of the need to
maintain good relations with Moscow. Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister,
openly backed President Boris Yeltsin in his recent fight with parliament.
But foreign policy analysts look with concern on the reluctance of the Nato
allies to press Moscow for a complete pull-out of Soviet troops from the
Baltic states or to define clearly the kind of relationship the west wants
with Russia.
Above all, Hungarian analysts want the west to avoid leaving the impression
of a vacuum of power anywhere in central Europe, given the historical
propensity of Russia to push on open doors when it has the strength and the
temptation to do so.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (7): Tension rises as poll nears -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIAN politics and politicians tend to exaggeration, a characteristic
mirrored in the ornate, gilded parliament on the banks of the Danube and the
dramatic statues of moustachioed heroes which dot Budapest's magnificent
squares and avenues.
With elections due by May next year the atmosphere is electric as the former
communists prepare for a comeback a la Polonnaise, the nationalist right
plays on old phobias about Jews and foreigners and the ruling Hungarian
Democratic Forum (MDF) seeks desperately to consolidate its failing grip on
the centre by strengthening its hold on the mass media, especially the state
TV.
Behind all the nervous tension lies an economy which is stubbornly refusing
to deliver sustainable economic growth after a four-year, 20 per cent
decline in GDP which masks substantial, but not sufficient, structural
reform.
Even the ruling coalition's success in attracting more than Dollars 5.5bn in
foreign equity investment, and a steady flow of new foreign debt issues, has
turned into a double-edged weapon. The nationalist right, led by Mr Istvan
Csurka, thunders against the sale of Hungary's family silver and the
overweening influence of foreigners and 'cosmopolitans'.
It is sometimes hard to remember amid the cacophony of discordant sounds
that Hungary managed the most seamless transition from a reform-communist
regime to a multi-party system in 1989 or that Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime
minister, has headed the most stable and long-lived government in
post-communist Europe.
But government is a thankless task in this part of the world and Mr Antall
has seen his support dwindle, his party split and his coalition partners
lapse into internal squabbling over the past 12 months.
Questions also remain over the physical health of the prime minister who has
just returned from Germany after receiving treatment for non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, a debilitating illness which has sapped his strength for years. In
his absence the reins of power were held by his heir apparent, Mr Peter
Boross, the increasingly powerful minister of the interior.
A rising economic tide would have lifted the fortunes of the ruling parties.
But the economy, failed to oblige. Instead, Mr Antall has had to face down a
rightwing nationalist challenge led by Mr Csurka, a populist writer who
articulates the fears of many Hungarians that their distinctive language and
culture are threatened by closer integration into European structures.
After mounting a personal attack on Mr Antall's leadership, Mr Csurka broke
away from the MDF in June and took a handful of MPs with him into his new
Hungarian Justice and Life Party. It remains to be seen whether this new
party gains the 5 per cent of votes needed to secure entry into the next
parliament. It probably will.
To fend off right-wing attacks Mr Antall has been obliged to shift the MDF
towards the right and give moral support to gestures such as the
repatriation and re-burial of Admiral Miklos Horthy.
A national hero to some, and a crypto fascist to others, Admiral Horthy took
Hungary into the war as an ally of Nazi Germany and re-occupied part of the
territories that Hungary was forced to cede at the Treaty of Trianon in
1920.
The real electoral challenge to the centrist coalition which has governed
since June 1990 comes, however, from another direction.
Buoyed up by the victory of communist-era parties in the recent Polish
elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party, heir to the reformist traditions
of the former communist party, is confidently preparing for a comeback. The
party won only 33 seats in the 1990 elections compared with the 165 gained
by the MDF. But the latest opinion polls show 25per cent support, compared
to only 8 per cent for the MDF.
The party, led by Mr Gyula Horn, the veteran reform communist and former
foreign minister, is unashamedly bidding for the votes of the unemployed and
those who feel that the shift towards a market democracy has deprived them
of security and status.
Many who once berated the communists for their corrupt abuse of power now
profess to see the socialists as the party of clean hands and hold up the
last communist government headed by Mr Miklos Nemeth as a model of political
correctness and principled economic reform.
Mr Horn and Mr Csurka are competing for the anti-government vote, including
the votes of those who believe that four years of painful changes have
merely created a new wealthy class of recycled party bosses and nomenklatura
managers, who used their connections to convert former state property into
their own.
The main weakness of the socialist position is that few, if any, of the
other political parties would be prepared to join them in a coalition, as
the Peasants Party joined the socialists in Poland.
The socialists may well emerge as the largest single party but are most
unlikely to win enough votes to govern alone.
Surprises are possible. The elections are likely to demonstrate considerable
electoral volatility. All three ruling parties and the Alliance of Free
Democrats (SZDSZ), the main opposition party in the current parliament, are
expected to lose votes, leaving the socialists and the Fed-eration of Young
Democrats (FIDESZ) as the main gainers.
Fidesz, led by the char-ismatic young Viktor Orban, has consistently topped
the opinion polls for three years, but has equally consistently failed to
capitalise on this favourable sentiment at by-elections.
Its main asset, an absence of links with the old regime guaranteed by the
youth of its protagonists, has been sullied in recent months by its
involvement in a shady real estate deal.
This involved the sale of its state-provided property at a substantial
profit and partial re-investment of the proceeds in a luxury car hire
company.
Mr Orban, intelligent and articulate, looks to many like a Hungarian version
of Spain's Felipe Gonzalez who brought Spain into the modern world by
leapfrogging the generation warped by the Franco dictatorship as Hungary has
been warped by communism. He has just emerged from a bruising internal
conflict over the soul and direction of the party with victory over his
would-be rival, Mr Gabor Fodor.
The latter, defeated in his bid for the presidency of the party's national
committee, argued unsuccessfully that Fidesz was too linked to Hungary's
rising entrepreneurs and risked gaining a reputation for arrogance and
insensitivity towards the hopes and fears of the majority of voters who
remain mired in low paying jobs in the poorly performing state companies.
At present Fidesz is in loose alliance with the Free Democrats. But Mr Orban
and his close collaborators are clearly aiming for power, displaying a naked
ambition which worries some erstwhile supporters.
Mr Orban is perceived as shifting his party, which could well emerge as the
kingmaker, into position for a possible post-election power-sharing
agreement with the MDF - or whichever non-socialist party emerges as the
most likely core of a future government.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (8): Mass privatisation - Hungarian style
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JANUARY Hungary starts to sell state shareholdings on concessionary terms
to small investors through the Budapest Stock Exchange. First on the block
are minority stakes in eight companies including the Pannonia, Soproni and
Borsodi breweries, the Pannonia and Hungaria hotel chains, and plastics
producer Pannonplast.
Every adult Hungarian paying a nominal Ft2000 (Dollars 21) entrance fee will
be entitled to a Ft100,000 (Dollars 1030) interest-free credit facility
which can be used to subscribe to the public offerings. The scheme, devised
by Schroders, the UK investment bank, allows repayments to be spread over
five years and no security is required beyond the purchased shares
themselves.
The authorities hope that the generous terms will attract up to one million
of Hungary's 10m population and thus defuse the widespread feeling that
privatisation has passed by the general public.
For the sake of simplicity, the new initiative has been classified
internationally as a mass privatisation programme or even a voucher scheme
along Czech lines. But such labels cause Budapest officials to flinch.
The Hungarian scheme is different, they stress. First, relatively few
companies, around 40, will be involved, even over the full five-year
lifespan of the project.
Only minority, passive stakes will be on offer. And investors will have to
pay for their shares if they want to keep them, albeit on an instalment
basis.
The new scheme, therefore, is not a replacement for existing strategies, but
rather another ingredient added to Hungary's already complex privatisation
mix.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (7): Utilities take up the torch -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY appears to be losing its crown as eastern Europe's fastest
privatiser. The government is still well short of its target of privatising
half the state sector by the end of its term in 1994 giving rise to a
widespread impression that privatisation has been disappointingly sluggish.
In some cases that may be true. Chemicals group TVK could have been sold to
Eastman Kodak of the US in 1991 for Dollars 400m. It was not, and now the
company's prospects are bleak.
Takeda of Japan sniffed at pharmaceuticals producer Richter Gedeon in 1990,
but the authorities dithered, and the company's Comecon markets, and its
value, collapsed.
Speed counts because the uncertainty leading up to a transaction inhibits
investment.
'Managers concentrate, not on the future, but just to survive,' says Mr
Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central European International Bank.
For this and other reasons, Hungary's state auditors estimate that state
property loses about a fifth of its worth a year.
But it is easy to be wise after the event and say Hungary should have sold
out to western multinationals when they were flush with cash and naive
enthusiasm in 1990.
No one forecast the extent of the recession in western and eastern Europe,
nor the depressing effect that would have on investment flows.
Rapid disposals have a downside, too. Acquisitions made in the euphoric days
at the start of the decade now look overpriced. Early buyers such as General
Electric of the US and Ansaldo of Italy have had to commit much more than
they expected.
The shattered illusions of pioneer multinationals make a poor advertisement
for Hungary's attractions as a destination for cross-border investment.
But Hungary's reputation for dragging its heels on privatisation is somewhat
unfair. Hungary had about 2,000 state enterprises in 1989. By September 1993
the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, had sold 273
companies outright, disposed of majority shareholdings in 144 cases and
minorities in 71. Liquidation, which is privatisation of a sort, accounted
for a further 370 enterprises.
Private or partially private companies, including new start-ups, now employ
about 36 per cent of the workforce, according to an estimate cited by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
But Budapest's programmes for building up the private economy have none of
the grand sweep of the Czech, Polish or Russian voucher schemes while the
growth of new private enterprises does not yet match the vibrancy of
Poland's homegrown businesses.
Yet Hungarian privatisation makes up in depth what it may lack in breadth.
Hungary has put the creation of 'real owners' above a nominal shift to the
private sector.
Nobody can doubt that General Electric, acquirer of lightbulb maker
Tungsram, is a private owner. But this is not the case, for example, with
the state banks which manage the vouchers issued for the bulk of the Czech
Republic's privatised companies.
'What kind of organisations are these?' asks Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's
minister for privatisation. 'Holdings took the place of the state. Where are
the real owners?'
The Hungarian cigarette industry, by contrast, is now divided between four
western multinationals, the sale of the last of Hungary's seven breweries is
pending and the remnant of the sugar industry, still in the hands of the
State Property Agency (Spa), is now on offer. Foreign, decidedly private,
ownership has penetrated deeply into distilling, paper, confectionery,
newspapers and cement sectors as well.
Hungary's distinctive policy of selling - rather than distributing - state
property has its limits, however.
Privatisation revenues peaked at Ft63.2bn in 1992. In the first three
quarters of this year the privatisation authorities raised only Ft23.2bn
(Dollars 250m) in cash.
This is partly because the State Property Agency, the original privatisation
authority set up in 1990, is exhausting its portfolio.
The Spa has run out of most of the consumer goods producers with their
enticing markets, whose sale to western investors powered privat-isation
between 1990 and 1992. 'My message to foreign investors is that they must
hurry because stocks are running out,' says Mr Lajos Csepi, managing
director of the Spa.
Some potentially attractive companies remain in the Spa's portfolio however.
Confusion over property rights complicated earlier efforts to find investors
for the three main hotel chains and the Spa is now trying again. Still
lingering with the AV RT state holding company are industrial giants such as
TVK, bus maker Ikarus, engineering company Raba, and rubber processor
Taurus.
But the newly founded AV RT believes these strategic companies require
restruct-uring before sale. The Hungarian authorities are banking on a World
Bank credit to finance debt 'work-outs' for companies which could be viable
when relieved of their inherited debts.
The focus of attention now is the sale of the national utilities. 'Now come
the bigger cakes, the great, big projects,' says Mr Szabo.
International interest in the utilities on offer is intense.
But preparation for their sale has taken time because the authorities needed
time to devise the necessary regulations. 'You can't sell telecoms like a
corner shop,' Mr Szabo says.
But now the conditions for telecoms, gas and electricity privatisation
appear to be slipping into place as legislation proceeds.
The government desperately needs the privatisation revenues that only
utility privatisation can bring to finance a budget deficit that it has
warned could reach Ft350bn next year.
The authorities are due this month to shortlist bidders for 30 per cent of
Matav, the national telecoms operator, and the competition is fierce.
Front runner is a consortium led by Germany's Deutsche Telekom and including
Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech, the regional Bell operating
company (RBOC). Another strong contender is the partnership of France
Telecom and US West, another RBOC.
Matav has drawn attentionas the first state telecommunications utility to be
put on sale in eastern Europe. Advisers believe that the new socialist
government's halt to Greece's telecoms privatisation will turn the focus of
international industry investors on Hungary. 'It is the only near-term game
in town,' says one.
Schroders, the UK merchant bank, has won the mandate to privatise MVM, the
electricity industry holding company. And N M Rothschild, another UK-based
company, has a similar role for the gas sector. Legislation on both
industries has gone before parliament this month. Further down the line is
Mol, the national oil company, on whose sale Lazard Freres of France is
advising.
There are bound to be hiccups along the way. But, at the present rate of
progress, Hungary's utilities will be under private control before most of
their counterparts in continental Europe, let alone eastern Europe.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (5): Prize contributions to science
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIANS draw on an illustrious tradition in computers. A
Hungarian-American, John von Neumann, virtually invented the computer with
his work on binary arithmetic. Per head, Hungarians have won more Nobel
prizes for scientific discovery than any other nation.
Even now, Hungarian schoolchildren regularly score better in comparative
tests than their western European counterparts. Hungary's inhabitants may
only number 10m but they like to think of their country as a 'maths
superpower'.
It appeared until the start of the 1990s as if computer ventures would lead
Hungary's trek to capitalism. Companies such as Novotrade, Kontrax, Controll
and Microsystem grew explosively to dominate the top ranks of the Hungarian
private sector.
But Hungarian technical genius alone has proved insufficient. Private
computer companies have fallen, or wobbled at least, like ninepins.
Novotrade has had to shrink to survive. Kontrax has restructured its
operations and rescheduled its debts to stave off dissolution. Controll was
less lucky: the company is in liquidation. And Peter Vadasz, chairman of
Microsystem, has left the company he founded under a cloud of losses and
liquidity problems.
Hungary's infant market has offered many opportunities for quick profit. But
the companies that have given in to
temptation have risked becoming jacks of all
trades and masters of none. The Kontrax group, at its most diffuse, owned
businesses in computer distribution, office equipment distribution,
telecommunications development, property, newspapers and finance.
So Graphisoft's success is an exception rather than the rule in Hungary's
computer sector. And even Graphisoft made an unprofitable detour into sales
of Apple computers before selling its distribution subsidiary last month to
refocus on software development.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (4): Keyed up for designs - Profile:
Graphisoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON SERRAT, a young but normally hard-headed US investment banker is
enthusiastic about Graphisoft, a little Hungarian software company for which
Creditanstalt Securities is trying to raise equity finance.
Gabor Bojar, Graphisoft's president, has gone from underpaid mathematician
at Hungary's Institute of Geophysics to head of a world-beating producer of
architectural design software.
In 1981 he took advantage of Hungary's early liberalisation of private
business to set up Graphisoft and began writing programmes for
three-dimensional piping design. 'I discovered that I liked business,' says
Mr Bojar. 'No-one had ever indicated that business was fun.'
Funding initially came from his wife, a doctor, who subsidised him and his
partner with Dollars 100 each a month.
Graphisoft's big break came at a trade show in Munich. Apple Computer of the
US liked Graphisoft's 3-D design programme, gave the Hungarians Dollars
30,000 and some computers, and pushed the company towards the architectural
market.
The offspring was ArchiCAD, a user-friendly and powerful tool for architects
and builders using Apple Macintosh computers. The programme has won the
custom of companies from Disney to Renault. ArchiCAD has expanded to
leadership of the segment with a worldwide market share of about 25 per
cent.
That makes Graphisoft a big fish, albeit in a small pool. Graphisoft's
software sales may have grown nearly five times over the past five years but
in 1992 they were still only Dollars 6.2m.
Still, that is just the start. Graphisoft is poised to diversify from the
Apple platform, launch ArchiCAD for Windows and enter the vastly larger
market of IBM-compatible machines. The company expects revenues from
software sales to grow five times again within three years and that could be
a cautious forecast.
'It's like pressing the hyperspace button on a spaceship,' says David
Marlatt, general manager for Graphisoft in the US, of the entry into the
wider PC software market. 'It's a sure winner, as sure as software can be
sure.'
Graphisoft has triumphed over adversity. The west's Cocom restrictions
prohibited the supply of sophisticated hardware to communist countries. Lack
of funds was equally inhibiting.
That may have been a blessing in disguise. Eastern European developers had
to write software for small computers which could slip through the Cocom
fence and which they could afford: then PCs conquered the computing world
and Graphisoft followed in their wake.
The company's motto is apt: turn obstacles into opportunities. It is hard
enough in a PC world dominated by the US for a European software developer
to make it, let alone an eastern European one.
Yet Mr Bojar's origin has given an edge to his ambition: 'We wanted to prove
that from eastern Europe we could beat the Americans.' Graphisoft's origin
also gives it an edge on costs: 'I say to programmers that I can pay you
more than half as much as in the west; I just expect you to work twice as
hard,' says Mr Bojar.
Mr Bojar and his colleagues, while technical virtuosos, had no experience of
running a business or marketing a product. But that has an upside too.
Graphisoft's executives are unfazed by the rapid pace of change in the
computer industry. 'New is nothing new for them,' says Mr Marlatt.
Graphisoft executives constantly question why things have to be done in the
time-honoured way. Western colleagues admit irritation but say the
Graphisoft approach can inspire creative solutions.
Ignorance can also underpin a naive confidence. David Marlatt says of
Graphisoft's entry into the US market: 'They didn't know they couldn't do
it.' So they went ahead and did it anyway.
Talent and ambition are common enough qualities in Hungary. But Graphisoft
has something else which makes it special: good, old-fashioned capitalist
virtues. The company has done one thing, but done it well. 'We have a
product; we develop what we sell, says Imre Pakozdi, chief operating officer
of Graphisoft. 'We avoided the temptation to have a big Mercedes first,
revenues afterwards.'
Mr Bojar finally bought a Mercedes this spring, after more than a decade in
business. The company has no debt beyond a small bank overdraft. The
company's manager-owners have skipped dividends and reinvested all profits.
Graphisoft's headquarters building is an interior-designed, but modest,
villa in a Budapest suburb.
'Everything they've built for themselves and they haven't been greedy along
the way,' says an admiring Don Serrat.
But, depressingly for Hungary, Graphisoft has inspired few imitators.
Craftsmanship and thrift are rare qualities among Hungary's flashy new
entrepreneurs, let alone stodgy state enterprise managers. Leave
Graphisoft's silicon villa and you return to a different world. Don Serrat
says: 'You walk out the door and - boom] - back in Hungary.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (2): Poised on the verge of a recovery -
Nicholas Denton assesses the mood as Hungarians wait for a turnaround in the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARIANS have been waiting for an economic recovery for the past three
years and each year the turnaround has been postponed. Finally, industrial
activity has begun to revive - but the upturn is asthmatic and its
sustainability is questionable.
Manufacturing output, excluding the troubled food sector, is 7 per cent
higher than a year earlier. But this growth sits uncomfortably with a 20 per
cent dip in export volume and a fast deteriorating current account.
Production and exports are now coming on stream from the General Motors,
Suzuki Motor Corporation and Ford Motor Company car assembly and components
plants announced in 1990 and 1991.
But manufacturing has not been able to lift the economy as a whole. Drought
and confusion over property rights have afflicted agriculture, the pride of
Hungary's former communist regime. Cereal production has fallen 20 per cent
from last year's already depressed level.
The recession is likely to continue. The finance ministry projects a decline
in gross domestic product of 1-3 per cent for 1993 and stagnation next year,
leaving output 20 per cent below the 1989 level.
The real situation is somewhat brighter, the statisticians cannot reach a
burgeoning black economy, nor fully account for the quantum leap in the
quality of goods produced and bought.
'Something is missing,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central
European International Bank. 'The situation is not good, but it is much
better than is indicated in the statistics.'
One rule of thumb is to add 2 per cent a year to the GDP figures to take
account of unrecorded activity. Other indicators also point to a recovery,
albeit frail and patchy. Employment appears to have turned the corner. The
jobless rate, after rising inexorably from the start of the decade, peaked
in February at 13.6 per cent and has settled at about 13 per cent.
But the source of the industrial recovery remains more than a little
mysterious. Stockbuilding appears to be absorbing some production after
companies slashed inventories from the artificially high communist levels.
More important, statisticians may be missing a rebound in consumption. Some
companies report surprisingly resilient consumer demand. Electrolux, owner
of Hungary's Lehel refrigerator maker, feels that purchases began to revive
around the middle of last year.
Mr Werner Riecke, head of the monetary policy department of the National
Bank of Hungary (NBH), confirms 'we now have the feeling that consumption
and domestic use are greater than expected'.
In financial markets, low deposit rates in the first half of the year
induced households to shift to spending from saving. The savings ratio has
fallen to about 7 per cent this year, down from 15.8 per cent in 1991 and
13.2 per cent in 1992.
But a consumer-led recovery may not be sustainable. The economy is already
coming up against balance of payments constraints. Exports are down mainly
due to recession in Germany, Hungary's largest export market, and in the
rest of continental Europe, while imports are about 10 per cent higher.
Food exports have also fallen precipitately, running 38 per cent lower than
last year; western European protectionism has not helped.
Hungarian officials also confess that some exporters may have been producing
at a loss and dumping in the expectation of a bail-out by the state. Last
year's spate of bankruptcies put paid to that hope and forced companies to
reconsider unprofitable exports.
Budapest's exchange rate policy has also left the forint overvalued and
inhibited exports, according to the latest report on Hungary by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Hungary pursued a
strategy of real appreciation of the national currency until last year. But
NBH has made five adjustments in 1993, cutting the forint by 13.4 per cent.
The central bank, which managed to borrow a record Dollars 4bn this year
through international bond issues, now reckons on a current account deficit
of about Dollars 2.5bn for the year, compared with a surplus of Dollars 324m
in 1992.
But Hungary's gross foreign debt, the highest per capita in eastern Europe,
is now growing again and stood at a record Dollars 23.8bn in May, compared
with Dollars 21.8bn at the start of the year. The NBH fears that funds will
be more difficult to raise in 1994, an election year.
Twinned to Hungary's growing current account shortfall is a hefty
public-sector deficit. Most of the deterioration in the government accounts
is a straightforward concomitant of recession. Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy state
secretary at the finance ministry, says public finances have performed no
worse than those of western countries afflicted by recessions milder than
Hungary's.
Hungary's public-sector deficit deepened from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 1990 to
a forecast 7 per cent this year. In the same period, Finland's deficit
swelled by 14 per cent of GDP and Sweden's by 18 per cent of GDP.
The state is also gathering in the quasi-fiscal deficits which have
accumulated at state-owned companies and banks. Bankruptcies and defaults by
borrowers have wiped out the capital of the largest commercial banks and the
burden of recapitalisation has fallen on the state budget.
The latest agreement with the IMF, concluded in September, calls for Hungary
to rein in the public-sector deficit to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 1994. This
will require spending cuts difficult to implement in the run-up to
elections.
The government's borrowing requirement is putting strong upward pressure on
interest rates and threatening to 'crowd-out' private borrowing. Treasury
bill yields, which fell as low as 13 per cent earlier this year, have shot
back up to 23 per cent.
Faced with twin deficits in the current account and the budget, the central
bank has tightened monetary policy. The NBH raised its key overnight
open-market rates from 17 to 22 per cent between July and September. 'The
move is absolutely justified,' says Mr Suranyi. 'But it's about a year too
late.'
Mr Peter Bod, NBH chairman, says that the central bank will wait and see
before acting again.
But monetary tightening may be as difficult to sustain politically as the
current account is becoming economically unmanageable. The NBH, formally
independent since the end of 1991, has come for the first time into open
conflict with the finance ministry.
'We are now saying that we cannot refinance our foreign debt with such bad
current account numbers,' says Mr Riecke. 'But they (the finance ministry)
say they cannot finance the budget deficit through domestic savings.'
The danger now is that interest rate rises may snuff out any recovery.
Meanwhile, Hungary's politicians are learning the dynamics of political and
economic cycles the hard way.
'There are some people within the government who would definitely like to
stay the course,' says one close western observer. 'The others think: to
hell with it, we've got an election to fight. The temptation is there to let
go.'
The Federation of Young Democrats, a liberal party with an acute political
sense, last month put aside economic orthodoxy and launched a programme for
'modernisation and growth'.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (1): A fraught period ahead - As the
people of Hungary prepare for an election, they can ponder the costs of a
turbulent period of change in their country. The coalition government has
achieved peace, liberty and prosperity for some, but the economy is still
struggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HUNGARIANS go to the polls in six months' time to give their verdict on a
unique phenomenon in post-communist Europe - a democratically-elected
coalition government which will have served its full four-year parliamentary
term.
In the run-up, the electors of this small, landlocked country of 10m people,
who share an impenetrable language and a thousand years of settlement in the
Carpathian basin, are pondering on the achievements and costs of a turbulent
period of change.
The Soviet army, which re-invaded the country in 1956 to suppress Hungarian
aspirations for freedom and democracy, has quietly departed. The cautious
economic reforms begun more than 20 years ago by the late Janos Kadar's
'goulash communist' regime have been used as a springboard for the
transition to a fully-fledged market economy.
The crucial decision to honour the burdensome foreign debts inherited from
the communist years has helped give foreign investors the confidence to
inject Dollars 5.5bn of equity capital and continue buying Hungarian
government bonds - Dollars 4bn worth in 1993 alone.
Above all, the three-party coalition government led by Mr Jozsef Antall, the
historian-archivist turned politican who led his Hungarian Democratic Forum
(MDF) to victory in June 1990, has maintained internal stability and
proceeded with building the institutions required to give substance to
democracy.
Hungary was in many ways better prepared than most in the region for a
system change. But breathing life into institutions such as parliament and
the legal system, and removing the habits of thought control and mind
manipulation in other crucial areas such as the media, has been neither easy
nor yet complete. The government's controversial closure of the second
channel TV news programme has been widely interpreted as an attempt to
stifle criticism in the run up to elections, and as a sop to right wing
nationalists whose voice in the state-run media has been increased by
personnel changes.
The key institutions managing privatisation and macro-economic policy - the
State Property Agency (SPA), the National Bank of Hungary and AV RT, the
recently formed state asset management corporation, also have their critics.
But the dedicated, high quality officials who run them are impressively
capable and have gained valuable experience over the past four years.
Hungary has also been fortunate in the quality of its foreign investors. It
has had its carpet-baggers, and would-be small investors who have fallen
foul of the home-grown Mafia.
But Hungary has also welcomed a host of top rank multinational corporations,
including Alcoa, Electrolux, General Electric, General Motors, Ford, Suzuki
and Unilever. All are intent on integrating their new Hungarian subsidiaries
into their existing global operations and bringing invaluable know-how,
technology and managerial expertise in their wake.
Expatriates of Hungarian origin have also played a valuable role in trying
to re-tie links with a severed past. An outstanding example is the way Mr
George Lang, the famous American-Hungarian restaurateur, and his partner Mr
Ronald Lauder, have recreated Gundel's restaurant, the pre-war Mecca of
Hungarian high-cuisine.
After a shaky start when Croatia received guns illegally from Hungarian
sources, careful diplomacy has kept Hungary free from entanglement in the
bitter ethnic wars across its southern border in former Yugoslavia.
Budapest has also sought to defuse potential conflicts over dams, frontiers
and ethnic minorities which have arisen with the birth of independent
Slovakia and outbreaks of intolerant nationalism in Romania, another
neighbour with a sizeable ethnic Hungarian minority.
Peace, liberty and moderate prosperity are respectable achievements. But how
much thanks the ruling parties - the MDF, the Christan Democrats and the now
bitterly divided Smallholder peasants party - receive from the electorate
next May remains to be seen.
The coalition's original game plan called for an economic upswing to begin
in 1993, leading to re-election on a rising and palpable tide of economic
well-being. Instead, the economy is still struggling, like the heavily laden
barges which push upstream against the current of the River Danube as it
flows under the bridges of Budapest.
Some of the problems are home-grown. The disappointing pace of privatisation
has left the bulk of big enterprises still in state hands. The losses
accumulated by the state sector, and bad loans granted to the private sector
by inexperienced bankers, have brought many state banks to the point of
technical insolvency. Large financial infusions are needed to bring their
capital adequacy ratios up to the minimum internationally required levels.
At the same time unemployment, which has stabilised at around 13 per cent of
the workforce, has raised demands on a state budget already burdened by
heavy pension and other commitments. The net result is a budget deficit
which will require politically painful pruning if the 1994 public-sector
shortfall is to be kept under the 5.5 per cent of GDP ceiling required by
the standby agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund in
September.
Government spending and a 25 per cent fall in the value of exports has
already led to tensions in money markets and a shock 5 per cent rise in
central bank lending rates in recent weeks. Economists fear that the private
sector, including the parallel 'black economy', risks being crowded out of
the market for working and investment capital. Starving the private sector
would inevitably depress private sector investment and future job creation.
Not all the economic and political woes are policy-linked. The sharp decline
in exports is partly a sign of an over-valued currency, and has been
rectified by recent devaluations of the forint.
But it also reflects the recession in western markets, especially the
all-important German market, and the impact of another year of severe
drought on farm output. Equally important, however, is the widespread
confusion over land ownership caused by the break-up of the old state
co-operatives.
Regional instabilty is another negative factor. The UN-imposed trade embargo
on former Yugoslavia has cost Hungary an estimated Dollars 1bn. The embargo
has not only decimated a once flourishing bilateral trade but hindered
passage along the Danube and cut income from transit traffic to and from
southern Europe and the Middle East. Tourism receipts have also lost their
buoyancy.
Without the hoped-for boost from economic recovery the governing coalition
faces a tough fight against the Socialist Party, led by Mr Gyula Horn, whose
prospects for emerging as the largest single party have soared after the
recent electoral come-back of the former communists in Poland.
Even so, it is unlikely that the socialists, with few allies in sight, would
be able to form the next government.
More probable is some form of coalition between the MDF and Fidesz, the
Young Democrat party led by Mr Viktor Orban, after elections which are
likely to see a substantial shift in allegiances and voting patterns
compared with 1990.
Such an outcome, leaving both the right wing nationalists and socialists in
opposition alongside the probably reduced liberal Free Democrats, would
confirm Hungary's attachment to moderate, democratic government and its
commitment to market reforms. But six months is a long time in politics, and
they promise to be somewhat fraught.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London cocoa market breaches
Pounds 1,000 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY

<TEXT>
THE LONDON cocoa futures market yesterday broke through the Pounds
1,000-a-tonne barrier for the first time in more than five years as
technically-inspired buying by New York investment funds continued to fuel
the recent uptrend.
Early trading saw the March position leap to Pounds 1,025 a tonne, but
expectations of strong resistance between that price and Pounds 1,060 - a
former support level - took the steam out of the market and the price dipped
back below Pounds 1,000. It steadied again in late trading, however, to
close at Pounds 1,013 a tonne, up Pounds 20 on balance.
Analysts were divided about the technical picture. Some saw it as
unequivocally bullish, while others were concerned about the big 'chart gap'
left by the Pounds 66-a-tonne surge over the past week. And there were
doubts about the timing of the move - when west African crops were just
beginning to be harvested.
Unanimity remained, however, on longer term factors, which London trader GNI
said pointed to the start of a bull market that could see prices tripling
over the next three years. After two production deficits demand is generally
expected to outstrip production for several more years.

News of a substantial fall in US COFFEE stocks pushed futures prices higher
in New York and enabled the London Commodity Exchange coffee contract to
maintain its early strength. By the close the LCE's January futures position
was quoted at Dollars 1,256 a tonne, up Dollars 29 on the day. Some London
traders thought there might be a retracement, however. 'There may be a
little more room on the upside. But if the Brazilians do not buy much coffee
tomorrow (for the export retention stockpile), we'll be struggling to
maintain current levels,' one said. At the London Metal Exchange confidence
was undermined by what one dealer described as 'a somewhat shaky technical
picture' in the COPPER and ALUMINIUM markets, which both added to Monday's
losses. NICKEL prices had been firmer but fell sharply in thin after hours
trading to end at Dollars 4,620 a tonne in the three months delivery
position, down Dollars 35 on balance. The three months ZINC price slipped
below Dollars 950 a tonne, but was well supported near Dollars 940 and
prices edged off the low to close at Dollars 945 a tonne, still down Dollars
7 on the day.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India confident of near-record
tea crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, is now confident of harvesting a
crop of about 740m kg this year, up from 703.9m in 1992. The country's
record crop of 741.7m was achieved in 1991.
By the end of September the harvest was already 36.5m kg ahead of last
year's first nine months and industry officials say preliminary production
reports for October are highly encouraging.
In the year to September north Indian production was 424m kg, 18.3m kg ahead
of the corresponding period of the previous year, while south India's, aided
by congenial weather, was more than 18m kg up at 130.16m kg.
The latest figures show that the shift in production emphasis from orthodox
to CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea, demand for which is growing both inside and
outside the country, is continuing. In the first nine months of the current
year CTC production was up nearly 41m kg to 462m kg, but that of orthodox
tea was down by more than 4m kg to 88m kg. Production of green tea was
maintained at 4.4m kg.
By the end of September the government had issued export licences for 116m
kg of tea, compared with 107m kg in the same period last year. While exports
to the UK were maintained there was a strong revival in demand for Indian
tea in Russia. Libya and Egypt also bought more. Poland, however, cut its
purchases.
Industry officials point out that the current season is witnessing a strong
growth in the domestic demand for tea, particularly for the better
varieties. This explains the impressive rise in tea prices at the Calcutta
auction. The average auction price of Assam CTC leaf so far is Rs52.15
(Pounds 1,11) a kilogram, compared with Rs41.43 a kilogram last year. The
average for Assam orthodox leaf is Rs56 a kilogram, up from Rs43.82 in the
same period last yea. Darjeeling tea is fetching an average of Rs96.38 a
kilogram, compared with Rs83.87 last year.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum oversupply forecast to
continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN WORLD platinum supply this year will be well ahead of demand,
according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
Nevertheless, it suggests that present prices closely reflect the
fundamental market position and platinum's price during the next six months
is likely to range between USDollars 350 and Dollars 390 a troy ounce.
But the forecast holds only as long as there is no market-disturbing news
from South Africa or Russia, the two biggest producing countries.
Platinum is heading for a supply surplus for the fourth successive year, JM
says in a special interim report on the platinum group metals markets.
This year's surplus is predicted to be 190,000 ounces and will be much
bigger than the 20,000 ounces seen in 1992 or the 120,000 ounces for 1991.
But the market should be able to absorb it with little difficulty, suggests
Mr Jeremy Coombes, general manager, marketing, of JM's precious metals
division.
He points out that the platinum market, unlike many western base metals
markets, is no longer in turmoil because of Russian exports. Russian export
sales have been placed in the hands of one central organisation, Almaz,
which has been selling platinum mainly on long-term contract at volumes
similar to those in 1992. Mr Coombes predicts Russian platinum shipments to
the west this year will fall by about 100,000 ounces, or 13 per cent, to
650,000 ounces.
He warns, however, that the South African producers, have little room left
for further voluntary closures of capacity. 'It is difficult for the mines
to forego revenue by reducing shipments,' he points out. South African
producers will continue to increase output until 1997 when their present
expansion programmes are scheduled to be completed. 'If this aggravates
market oversupply and causes further price weakness, the mines with the
highest costs may not avoid closure or sale.'
JM predicts that platinum demand will grow by 6 per cent, from 3.8m to 4.02m
ounces, this year, thanks to increased consumption by the automotive and
jewellery industries. Automotive demand will rise by 12 per cent to 1.74m
ounces - 42 per cent of total demand - driven by the European Commission's
regulations (which have required anti-pollution catalysts to be fitted to
more cars) as well as higher car production on the American continent.
Platinum supply is forecast by JM to grow by 10 per cent, from 3.82m to
4.21m ounces. South African platinum shipments are set to reach a record
3.25m ounces this year, up by 18 per cent from 2.75m ounces, and represent
77 per cent of total supply.

Nymex seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER RECORD has been set for the purchase price of a seat on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy futures market.
The Dollars 375,000 paid last Friday beat the previous record of Dollars
370,000, set only nine days earlier.
Mr R Patrick Thompson, president of the 816-seat exchange, said yesterday
that the increase in Nymex seat values reflected 'the overall growth in
exchange volume evident last week in the establishment of an annual record
for the 13th time in 14 years.
'We expect to see continued success and opportunities for our members in
1994, especially with the globalisation of our markets reflected in the
early success of Nymex Access, our after-hours electronic trading system'.
The Access system went live in London two weeks ago.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani farmers prepare
defence against increased tax burden - A look at fears that existing
indirect taxes may not be taken sufficiently into account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOISY TRACTORS tow large trollies full of rice on a dusty road near 'Mandi
Faizabad' - a farm market in central Punjab - as a group of peasants wait at
a nearby traders shop, to be paid for their crops. It is harvest time in
Pakistan, which for many is the time to be paid for up to six months of hard
labour and grinding patience.
But a few hundred miles away in Islamabad, the newly elected government of
Benazir Bhutto is reviewing recent proposals to tax farmers, a legacy of
former prime minister Mr Moeen Qureshi. The government's decision on the
issue would not only affect the wealthy landlords, but could also have
repercussions on the poorest.
The Qureshi plan focuses exclusively on ending the tax immunity of the more
prosperous farmers, defined as those owning between 50 and 75 acres of land,
depending on its quality. The move is one of the key demands of foreign aid
donors.
Some senior officials are convinced, however, that the proposals could
eventually raise inflation rates in rural areas, which would force many
peasants to either accept larger financial burdens or move to cities,
intensifying Pakistan's growing problem of unplanned urbanisation.
There is a growing recognition among the wealthier landowners that the time
has come to start paying such taxes, although many are convinced that if the
indirect taxes they are already paying were fully appreciated the case
against them would be weakened substantially.
'There's a perception that the farmer is non-tax paying. We want to see if
this perception is true,' says Mr Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the
Cambridge-educated former finance minister of the Punjab and a member of the
national assembly.
Mr Qureshi has been appointed to head a task force to examine the taxation
proposals and report back to the government next month with fresh
recommendations. The committee is trying, among other things, to evaluate
the indirect taxes paid by farmers as a means of assessing the agriculture
sector's overall contribution to national revenues.
'Of course, they have a point that we must pay our taxes, but the taxes that
we are already paying must be taken into account when they make this point,'
argues Mr Afaq Tiwana, another landowner and member of the task force. He
claims that, while direct taxes paid by farmers may not visibly appear
large, the indirect and implicit taxes make them up to more than a due
contribution to revenues.
The indirect and implicit taxes include local duties and the government's
monopoly over pricing of grain at a level far below the international level.
Mr Iqbal Mustafa, a famous Pakistani progressive farmer, argues that up to
60 per cent of the country's indirect taxes are paid by farmers, which is
far in excess of the agriculture sector's contribution of 25 per cent to the
GDP. He quotes a recent study demonstrating that Pakistani farmers get a
price up to 49 per cent below that of imported grain.
Despite the arguments from the farmers' lobby, Ms Bhutto's government is
unlikely to scrap all of the new taxation proposals because doing so would
invite fresh criticism from donor agencies. On the other hand, its also
difficult to impose them in full because of concern over reaction from the
newly-elected members of the assembly - at least 70 per cent of whom
represent rural areas.
'We (the task force) are neither going to reject it (the proposal) outright,
nor accept it in total,' says Mr Qureshi.
Other senior government officials say that the taxation proposals may be
softened by lowering the tax bands for farmers.
Some experts see the debate as an opportunity for donor agencies to
re-assess their views on the issue.
'The World bank, the IMF and others have really not critically looked at the
literature base and the vast amount of information which is available which
clearly points to the fact that Pakistani farmers are already very heavily
taxed,' says Dr Parvaiz Amir, an eminent agricultural economist.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foreign mining companies hope
to strike it rich in Cuba - Attractions that make the Caribbean island 'a
promoter's dream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICES of Joutel Resources in Toronto could easily be mistaken for a
Cuban trade promotion agency. Gloosy coffee-table books featuring the
Caribbean island lie in the reception area. Geological maps of Cuba dot the
walls, and pictures of Cuban government officials line the chairman's
bookshelf.
The company last summer became the first western mining company to sign an
exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Its
exploration manager and another geologist will move there soon in the hope
of striking rich on the three properites, totalling 1.2m acres, to which
Joutel now has exploration rights.
Joutel is by no means alone. BHP of Australia, the UK's RTZ, and Inco, the
Toronto-based nickel producer, are among others rumoured to be seeking a
foothold in Cuba. US companies are barred from direct involvement by
Washington's long-standing economic embargo.
Metall Mining, a subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has already
agreed to spend CDollars 1m (USDollars 756,000) over four years to acquire a
25 per cent interest in one of Joutel's properties.
Another junior Canadian company, Caribgold Resources, also recently signed a
joint venture with Geominera. As in the Joutel deal, costs will be equally
shared by the Canadian and Cuban partners.
Summing up both the risks and rewards, Mr Barry Allan, mining analyst at
Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, describes Cuba as 'a promoter's
dream'. It is 'genuinely an under-explored area', he says, while cautioning
that 'you're talking about very early grassroots exploration and that's a
high-risk activity'.
Mr Hugh Harbinson, Joutel's chairman, says that 'our ambition is to find
three deposits in three years.' Joutel will be looking primarily for gold,
but also for a variety of base metals. Under the agreement with the Cubans,
the company has up to eight years to prepare a mine feasibility study. It
plans to start an airborne geophysical survey in January.
Pointing to the geological map on his wall and to some colourful rocks on
his desk, Mr Harbinson notes that Russian geologists have already done a
good deal of preliminary exploration work in Cuba. Joutel and Caribgold each
claim that several hundred mineral occurrences have been catalogued on their
properties.
As further evidence of Cuba's mineral wealth, the Canadians point to three
nickel mines in Oriente province, on the south-east tip of the island, which
have been sizeable suppliers to the former Soviet Union.
The Canadian companies are being backed by a group of securities firms,
including Gordon Capital and Thomson Kernaghan of Toronto and Yorkton
Securities of Vancouver. They are in the process of raising CDollars 4m,
mostly from Europe, to finance Joutel's share of exploration costs.
Caribgold recently raised CDollars 8m.
Thomson Kernaghan described Cuba in a recent research report as potentially
'one of the best new places to invest in Latin America'. It cited the
island's volcanic origin, educated population and the willingness of the
Castro government to allow foreign investors to repatriate profits and
dividends.
Mr Harbinson is unconcerned by the threat of political instability. He says
that no other claims have been registered against Joutel's properties and
'we're going on the assumption that any new government will honour our
contracts'.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Jobs: Decision makers ride a harder hobby horse - A look at
free-time activities that do not necessarily tell us about interviewees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE myopic, moon-faced executive leans back to absorb the well-prepared lies
that he is about to hear after posing the question: 'How do you spend you
free time'?
It is a common enough interview question, as well as one that usually
appears in the application form. It provides a wonderful opportunity, for
self-aggrandisement and impression management.
'Crosswords, computers and lacrosse' is meant to indicate 'I am literate,
numerate and sporty', while 'Numismatics and icthyology' means 'I am
pretentious, collect coins and have a fish tank'. 'Train-spotting and
fishing' probably means 'I am honest'.) Filling out this the section on
leisure activities in the a job application form is usually pleasurable, but
may pose difficulties.
Some people do not have leisure activities in a conventional sense:
'pontificating at dinner parties' or 'pottering round the house' do not
usually qualify. For others work is their passion: Sir Peter Hall, for
example, on being asked the question, replied: 'Leisure? What need I of
other pastimes when I enjoy my work so]' The other concern is being caught
out. It is all very well putting down 'modern jazz dancing' or
'cuckoo-clock-carving' to impress, but what if there is an expert across the
table who knows more about the subject than you?
According to Samuel Johnson, 'All intellectual improvement arises in
leisure', while Disraeli opined that 'Increased means and increased leisure
are the two civilisers of man'.
Most people seem to think that an individual's choice of leisure pursuits
reveals a person's needs, motives or habits. Thus extraverts, it is
suggested, choose highly arousing, sociable, varied activities (disco
dancing, amateur dramatics), while introverts prefer passive, retiring
familiar activities (reading, collecting, computing).
However, this belief overlooks two important points. First, even though one
might want to participate in a particular leisure activity (which might or
might not reflect one's personality), one may be prevented from doing so by
circumstances beyond one's control.
Second, a person's choice of occupation may also reflect needs. Thus those
who have high nurturance needs may choose the medical profession; those with
needs for order and silence, librarianship; the need for avarice may be
fulfilled in the City; the need for power in parliament.
To the extent that a person's needs are fulfilled at work, he/she may be
less driven to pursue their fulfilment elsewhere, in which case leisure
activities might be expected to reflect personality strivings only
marginally, if at all.
This notion is implicit in one of two, mutually contradictory, theories of
work and leisure.
According to the currently in vogue 'compensation theory', the last thing
the BL worker wishes to do is to spend the weekend doing mechanical work.
But if the 'spillover theory' is true, he can't wait to repair his own or
his neighbour's car.
Do people in fact spill over or compensate (or neither or both)? I did a
little, albeit casual, research on this topic. Taking a fairly recent (1984)
copy of Who's Who, I examined a semi-random sample of its distinguished
decision makers, simply by looking at the entry on the top right of every
fifteenth page. Most entrants specify their leisure time pursuits. They
differ enormously. Some people use this as a vehicle for further
self-aggrandisement: Donald Sinden lists French History and ecclesiology,
and Cyril Smith charitable works. Others show they have a sense of humour:
John Cleese lists gluttony and sloth, Frank Muir's is staring silently into
space, while Frederick Raphael lists painting things white. The vast
majority of entries, however, are curt and factual.
My research (that activity which is simultaneously private, respectable and
pointless) showed music to be very popular, but what came out top was
gardening.
Why gardening? Gardening for these Who's Whoers is a private, solo activity.
Not for them the bonhomie and cameraderie of the allotment where
working-class men escape their wives and families, and enjoy the odd glass
of home-made wine carefully stored in the potting shed.
Gardening for these decision makers is a private, quiet activity away from
other people and the drone of the boardroom.
Second, it is physically demanding exercise (in green wellies) that, quite
literally, gets one's hands dirty. This is a nice compensation for those
whose main exercise is pushing papers from left to right across smooth, well
polished oak and leather-topped desks or opening a nice claret. Being
physically tired from hard labour is a refreshing change from the exhaustion
of a day on a committee or in a plane where thevery constraint on movement
is itself exhausting.
Getting dirty - being 'messy' - even more delightfully antithetical to a
daily work routine which can be construed as a never-ending battle to impose
order on potential chaos, ie to combat messiness, a legitimate outlet for
what Freud would have termed 'anal' impulses.
Third, and perhaps most importantly, gardening offers one the opportunity of
activity producing something, and relatively quickly. Decision makers
frequently are responsible for galvanising others into action and
instigating programmes that ultimately achieve or produce something. But the
time-spans are often excessively long - a bit like being an architect for a
never finished cathedral or pyramid.
Sometimes, indeed often, one never sees the product of one's labours.
The Marxist alienation argument may apply here. Like the car worker on the
conveyer belt who only screws in the rear parking lights, and never
identifies with the completed vehicle that emerges shining and finished at
the other end, the decision maker may never identify with, say, the new
degree course or the new factory in South East Asia.
Therein lies the advantage of tomato growing. One can buy the seeds, water,
weed and fertilise them and, within a relatively short period of time
(usually just when those red and round Dutch and Jersey tomatoes are
cheapest in the shops), harvest those small, speckled, gnarled objects,
proudly displaying them as the centre-piece of a Sunday lunch.
There is one other possibility. Some people garden by planting oaks, by
landscaping, by actually changing the environment. Michael Heseltine is one
latter-day Capability Brown. For them, gardening is one way of making a
lasting contribution to the future; a living monument. Life among the stocks
and shares or on committees may provide money, but in many senses it is
utterly ephemeral - merely the creation and circulation of paper. But to
plant and tender great trees that will continue to grow and blossom long
after one is dead, that has real worth.
But what of the evidence for spillover: the librarian who comes home looking
forward to a quiet evening with a book; the car worker who downs tools on
his BL plant to take up an identical set to tinker about with his car; the
cook who leaves the over-priced health food restaurant to spend an
enthralled evening at a vegetarian cookery class?
The problem is that, ultimately, one really has no way of knowing which
theory is true in any given case. It is a little like resolving the issue of
the truthfulness of antonomous proverbs: out of sight, out of mind; or
absence makes the heart grow fonder. It is quite possible that both are
true, but in different circumstances.
What can we conclude from all of this?
The 'royal road' to understanding other people's personalities is clearly
not via an expose' of their leisure activities. The main function of leisure
questions on application forms is probably to provide interviewers both with
something to talk about when they are at a loss, and with an opportunity for
legitimate voyeurism.
So, beware of judging other people on the basis of their leisure activities.
Your judgments may reveal more about yourself than about them.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: SocGen launches 'knockout'
warrant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale has issued 400 'knockout' call warrants on Mexican par
bonds, designed to provide a play on ratification of the North American Free
Trade Association (Nafta).
The warrants give holders the right to buy Mexican par bonds, but the
'knockout' feature means that if the value of the bonds falls below a
certain level at any time during the life of the warrants, they expire
worthless. Otherwise, the warrants can be exercised on July 15 1994.
The 'knockout' feature reduces the cost of the options, particularly when
the underlying security is volatile.
Societe Generale believes there is an 80 per cent chance that Nafta will be
approved by US Congress, and that this would have a positive impact on the
performance of Mexican debt.
The ratification would 'probably lead to an upward revision of Mexico's
grading on long-term foreign currency debt', reducing the premium on Brady
bonds, said SocGen.
If the treaty is not ratified, SocGen believes there will be a short-term
increase in volatility.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices little changed ahead of
Nafta vote
</HEADLINE>

US Treasury prices were flat-to-weaker across the maturity range yesterday
as investors and dealers nervously awaited the outcome of today's
Congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 101
31/32 , yielding 6.171 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
unchanged at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.059 per cent.
Traders said activity was extremely light, with what little business there
was conducted mostly in the intermediate range of securities.
There was no fresh economic news to drive the market, and investors remained
cautious of committing funds to Treasuries ahead of the Nafta vote. The
market is concerned Nafta will fail to be approved by the House of
Representatives. The treaty is seen as positive for bonds because it would
remove trade barriers, which are regarded as inflationary.
THE cut in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase - or repo - rate provided
a welcome boost for some of Europe's government bond markets yesterday.
German bonds had climbed in early trading on expectations of a much lower
repo rate, with many market participants looking for a cut of between 5 and
10 basis points.
In the event, the Bundesbank announced a minimum repo rate of 6.29 per cent,
down nine basis points from 6.38 per cent last week. The central bank's net
drain of liquidity of DM3.2bn took the market by surprise, dealers said.
The market does not appear to be expecting a cut in the Bundesbank's key
interest rates - the Lombard and discount rate - at this week's council
meeting.
The bund futures contract rallied from 99.96 at the opening to a high of
100.18, but met with some resistance at that level and slipped back to
100.00.
ITALY provided the other main highlight in European trading with its first
auction of 30-year government paper in the domestic market. Italian
government bonds opened on a buoyant note - taking their cue from the lower
repo rate in Germany - but ended lower.
Market participants were mainly watching for the outcome of the auction of L
2,000bn of 30-year bonds. Dealers said demand for the issue was fairly good,
with bids amounting to L 3,067bn. The Bank of Italy announced a net yield of
8.62 per cent and a price of 93.75.
Dealers said the yield spread for the 30-year issue over 10-year government
bonds widened to about 65 basis points, having been as low as 50-55 basis
points in the grey market ahead of the auction. However, they pointed out
that the auction price 'seemed fair'.
UK government bonds climbed initially on futures-driven trading, with
dealers noting strong buying interest out of the US, but fell back later in
the day on selling of the cash market.
The announcement of a Pounds 2.72bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PSBR) for October had little impact on the gilt market, although dealers
pointed out that it was slightly higher than expected.
JAPANESE debt prices closed lower, with medium-dated bonds underperforming
the rest of the market. Dealers said this reflected expectations of new
supply from corporate issuers in the domestic bond market.
The March futures contract opened at 113.90 and traded in a range of 113.75
to 114.18, closing at the low of the day.

<TEXT>
THE International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private-sector arm of the
World Bank and the world's leading source of data on emerging stock markets,
has expanded its coverage to include China and Zimbabwe, writes Antonia
Sharpe.
It has launched two indices for China, a global index which contains 81
stocks capitalised at Dollars 17bn and an investable index of 16 stocks with
a market value of Dollars 1.7bn.
The global index includes Chinese shares listed in Shanghai, Shenzhen and
Hong Kong. The investable index, meanwhile, is limited to B shares and H
shares, which can be bought by foreigners.
The IFC has also created an investable index for Zimbabwe made up of five
stocks with a market value of Dollars 115m. Since Zimbabwe opened up its
stock market to foreigners in June, stocks have risen by 84 per cent in
dollar terms.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Bonds: German states make most of buoyancy in
long DM sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE German states jumped on the long-dated D-Mark Eurobond bandwagon
yesterday, encouraged by the successful launch of the Republic of Austria's
30-year Eurobond issue on Monday.
The state of Baden-Wurttemberg launched a DM750m 30-year Eurobond issue,
while the states of Hesse and Sachsen-Anhalt raised DM500m and DM600m
respectively through issues of 20-year Eurobonds, puttable at par after 10
years.
Hesse's bonds also featured a step-up coupon, which will rise from 6 per
cent to 6 7/8 per cent in years 11 to 20.
Syndicate managers said that, so far, long-dated D-Mark bonds were being
taken up quickly by investors. However, they warned that this evolving
sector of the Eurobond market could become saturated quickly due to the lack
of benchmark 30-year German government bonds.
'This market needs to be treated sensibly,' said one syndicate manager. In
general, the pricing of yesterday's long-dated D-Mark Eurobond offerings was
judged to be fair.
In the Eurodollar sector, Instituto Nacional de Industria (Ini), the Spanish
state industrial holding company, reaped the rewards of a thorough
international roadshow, to increase the size of its inaugural five-year
Eurobond issue from Dollars 500m to Dollars 650m.
The increase in Ini's offering surprised some syndicate managers, who were
under the impression the bonds were selling slowly. However, Mr Hector Lopez
Vilaseco, Ini's finance director, said the increase came in response to
strong investor demand.
He said about 30 per cent of the bonds were placed in eastern Asia, a
considerable achievement given that very few Spanish issuers had tapped that
region's large pool of investors in the past.
The rest of Ini's bonds were placed with European investors, in the UK and
Switzerland in particular.
Demand from investors was such that Ini's bonds were priced to yield 38
basis points over underlying US Treasuries, at the lower end of Ini's target
yield spread of 37 to 42 basis points.
This represented a yield differential of between five and 10 basis points
over outstanding dollar Eurobonds issued by the Kingdom of Spain. When Ini's
bonds were freed to trade, the spread remained intact.
Mr Lopez said about half of the proceeds of the issue would be swapped into
pesetas, and that the remainder would be swapped into several European
currencies, including Ecus.
National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, made its first
appearance in the Eurodollar sector with a Dollars 300m issue of 10-year
Eurobonds. They were priced to yield 70 basis points over US Treasuries,
also at the lower end of the indicated range of 70 to 72 basis points.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Finnish bank in FM2bn tap
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Finland plans to raise up to FM2bn (Dollars 341.8m) over the
next two and half years through a series of bond auctions to domestic and
international institutional investors.
The tap issue will carry a 7 per cent coupon, and be denominated in lots of
FM1m and FM10m. Subscription will be via monthly auctions between November
24 1993 and May 31 1996.
It is the first time a Finnish bank, or company, has issued bonds in this
way. Tap issues, with auctions, have previously been the preserve of the
government. The initiative is designed to enhance the development of the
Finnish bond market by offering investors new material. The maturity date of
the issue, June 15 1997, is the same as the benchmark government bond
issues'.
The bank, part of Unitas, said proceeds would be used for normal funding.
'We are looking to raise longer maturity markka to fund our longer maturity
markka assets,' said Ms Maarit Nakyva, UBF's first vice-president.
Unitas has recently raised FM1.6bn in new equity as part of a
recapitalisation drive following the Finnish banking crisis. Its capital
adequacy ratio stands at 12 per cent.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Backing a champion in China -
Profile of an HK telecoms group with important inroads to the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the darling of the Hong Kong telecommunications sector, Champion
Technology can do no wrong. Founded in 1987 by Mr Paul Kan, a computer
software engineer formerly employed by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, and taken
public in August last year, Champion is a bet - so far one-way - on China's
future.
The company is already regarded by Hong Kong telecoms analysts as the purest
China telecommunications 'play' in the market. More than 90 per cent of the
company's HKDollars 298.6m (USDollars 38.5m) revenues accrue from the sale
of its multi-lingual Kantone radio paging systems to China. And the system
is reckoned to give Champion a three-year technological edge over US and
Japanese electronics giants Motorola and Matsushita.
Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong,
says: 'Champion is a concept stock. If you believe that the market in China
will open up to foreign investment - which I do - then Champion will be a
major beneficiary. It has the golden combination of contacts and expertise.'
Last week, Champion made an agreed Pounds 21.5m (Dollars 31.8m) bid for
Multitone, the UK inventor of the electronic pager. The acquisition should
bring much needed resources to developing Champion's business, especially on
the mainland.
'We have a lot of business in China,' says Mr Paul Kan, chairman and chief
executive. 'But we are constrained by people, resources and capacity. There
are not many paging companies around that we can buy. They invented the
pager and I'm the father of the Chinese language pager, so it's a natural
fit.'
Champion makes its money in China from selling, installing and maintaining
pager systems and pagers in cities. Under current regulations, it is unable
to own equity in a paging network, although in most locations it shares in
the revenue generated by the system.
Currently it has 15 systems on the mainland, with an aggregate pager
capacity of 300,000 units, of which only 60,000 have been supplied. By the
end of the century, it hopes to have installed 100 systems with a capacity
of 2m pagers.
Mr Kan is the first to admit his company is a high-risk investment. Of his
deals in China, he freely acknowledges that 'everything is not
well-defined', and that there is 'no proper regulatory framework'
underpinning his agreements with partners.
However, what gives analysts confidence in Champion is its two-fold secret
of success on the mainland. It has expertise and technology, which allows it
to market its pager. Most importantly, however, it has contacts, especially
with China's military and public security apparatus, which controls many of
the country's radio frequencies.
Mr Kan is reluctant to talk at length about his contacts with the People's
Liberation Army, (PLA), saying that in many countries the military is
involved in business. But when pressed he says: 'They are very
business-like; in fact they are just like ordinary businessmen. But their
companies are good to deal with because they have a lot of clout. They can
give quick decisions and help speed up procedures like import licenses.'
And his contacts go straight to the top or, at least, near to it. Mr Kan
last week presented a report to the Chinese government about how it should
liberalise its telecommunications market. He gave the report to none other
than Mr Wan Li, 77, a veteran Communist party leader and supporter of
economic liberalisation - and Mr Deng Xioaping's favourite bridge partner.
Champion's future in China would be assured if it could meet its ambitious
plans for the expansion of its pager network. However, the company has set
its sights much higher, and wants to be involved in the mainland's telephone
system as well.
This year it became the first foreign company to invest in a domestic
telephone network on the mainland. It has taken 40 per cent of a mobile
communications network in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, China's most
populous province with an estimated 110m population. In doing so, it
circumvented existing prohibitions against such investment by standing one
removed from day-to-day operation of the network.
Its partners in the deal - which will entail an investment by Champion of up
to USDollars 30m - are the local branch of the ministry of post and
telecommunications (MPT) and the PLA. In addition to capital, Champion has
provided technology and expertise to the joint venture, for which it will
receive 40 per cent of the profits. These could be large.
China has to date prohibited foreign investment in the operation of
telecommunications networks. It is for this reason that Mr Kan emphasises
his company will not operate the Chengdu mobile network - which he says
should be ready for testing by the end of this year - only design the system
and procure equipment for it.
However, pressure is building on Beijing to allowed foreign investment in
networks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments unexpectedly abandoned plans at yesterday's annual
meeting for a controversial proposal that would have given 30 top executives
options to buy shares at a discount.
The proposal had run into stiff opposition from New Zealand institutional
managers, who attempted to enlist the support of the company's founder, Sir
Ron Brierley. They wanted to overturn it on the grounds that Brierley
executives were sufficiently well paid.
Sir Ron, who was displaced as chairman in an executive coup in 1990, had
previously criticised the proposal. He had undertaken to raise the issue at
a board meeting that preceded yesterday's annual meeting.
The new chairman, Mr Bob Matthew, announced soon after the shareholders'
meeting began that the proposal was being reconsidered. He said the company
had 'substantially underestimated the extent of the ill-informed and
misleading debate' the proposal had sparked.
The abandoned proposal would have given selected managers options to buy 35m
shares at NZDollars 1.22 each over the next four years, provided the gross
return on the shares was more than 15 per cent a year.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bangkok Land down in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S biggest listed property company, Bangkok Land, reported second
quarter consolidated net profits of Bt1.502bn (Dollars 55.9m) yesterday,
slightly down on last year's Bt1.575bn. Half-year profits were slightly
higher at Bt2.911bn, up from Bt2,275bn in the same period last year.
Hoare Govett's Mr Niel Semple said his Bt4.7bn forecast looked achievable.
However, with perhaps USDollars 800m in accounts receivable from home buyers
yet to move into their homes in the ambitious company's property
developments, and who have paid only a fraction of the price, there remains
some doubt about the strength of earnings.
Tanayong, a rival property company, also controlled by the powerful
Sino-Thai Kanjanapas family, reported second quarter consolidated net
profits of Bt100m, making Bt150m for the half year.
Like Bangkok Land, it seems to have selling problems with its core property
venture on the outskirts of Bangkok.

PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), the Thai oil and gas company
partially privatised this year, announced sharply higher consolidated net
profits for the third quarter of 1993 to Bt142.6m (Dollars 5.6m), compared
with Bt10.3m in the same period last year, writes Victor Mallet.
For nine months to end-September, group net profits rose to Bt259.4m from
Bt82.3m. The company says profits are expected to continue rising as
production increases from the Bongkot offshore gas field, which opened in
July.
PTTEP is Thailand's only listed exploration and production company and is
still 85 per cent owned by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.

AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday kicked off the
Australian banks' reporting season with news of a ADollars 246.5m (USDollars
161m) profit after tax and abnormal items for the year to end-September.
The figure compared with a loss of ADollars 579m in the previous year, and
was struck after abnormal items of ADollars 213.2m, compared with ADollars
0.9m. However, the market - which had hoped for net profits of around
ADollars 300m - was disappointed, and ANZ shares closed 1 cent lower at
ADollars 4.44, having posted a gain of 8 cents ahead of the announcement.
Other bank shares, notably National Australia Bank, dipped in sympathy.
ANZ's chairman, Mr John Gough, said that the bank's main aim during the year
had been 'to address asset quality' and he noted that the need to provide
for bad and doubtful debts had fallen sharply, especially in the second
half, as asset values stabilised.
Before doubtful debts, restructuring charges and abnormal items, ANZ's
operating profit stood at ADollars 1.36bn, only 3.7 per cent higher than in
the previous year. However, the specific provision for bad and doubtful
debts more than halved from ADollars 1.6bn to ADollars 628.7m, while the
general provision for bad and doubtful debts fell from ADollars 337.3m to
ADollars 5m. Restructuring costs were ADollars 54.8m, compared with ADollars
95.1m last time.
The level of net non-accrual loans (where accrual of interest and fees has
ceased) was reduced from ADollars 3.07bn to ADollars 2.18bn, and now
represents 42.6 per cent of shareholders' equity, compared with 66.9 per
cent a year ago.
Asset sales, meanwhile, were ahead of budget, and produced around ADollars
1bn. By the year end, the group's capital adequacy ratio stood at 10.8 per
cent, with 5.9 per cent in tier one capital.
A large element of the abnormal items - ADollars 101.8m - reflected a
write-down in the value of net deferred tax assets. Other major items
included a ADollars 23.5m loss from the sale of the pastoral and shipping
businesses of Dalgety Farmers, and about ADollars 83m of property-related
losses or write-downs.

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN recession and problems with the boxboard operations brought a
third-quarter loss for Cascades, the international packaging products and
fine paper group.
It posted a net deficit of CDollars 3.2m, or nine cents a share after
preferred dividends, against profit of CDollars 1.3m, or two cents a share,
a year earlier.
Sales advanced to CDollars 400m, from CDollars 217m a year earlier, and
included 59 per cent-owned Cascades Paperboard and 73 per cent-owned
Rolland.
For the first nine months of 1993 the net loss was CDollars 4.3m, or 17
cents a share, against profits of CDollars 13.6m, or 25 cents, on sales of
CDollars 1.23bn, compared with CDollars 643m.
Most packaging operations in North America and Europe were profitable, but
European boxboard markets were weak. The Duffel plant in Belgium made a
CDollars 12.7m loss in the nine months after shutdown costs. Only the
packing unit remains open.
Cascades has sold its western Canada assets held through Cascades
Paperboard, raising more than CDollars 200m for debt reduction in that unit.
The holding company has redeemed USDollars 23.8m of subordinated notes and
long-term debt has declined to CDollars 29m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wang shows small profit after
leaving Chapter 11
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANG, the former minicomputer manufacturer, made a small profit in its first
quarter since emerging from the protection of the US bankruptcy code.
Now reconstructed as a computer software and services company, it yesterday
reported income before tax, extraordinary items and reorganisation expenses
of Dollars 12.3m compared with a Dollars 36.9m loss for the same quarter in
1992.
The company said operating income of Dollars 12.4m for the first quarter
included about Dollars 5m in non-recurring income from settlements under
technology licensing agreements.
There was an extraordinary gain on debt discharge, net of reorganisation
expenses, of Dollars 294.4m, giving a net income for the quarter of Dollars
306.3m.
But Wang said net income for the quarter was neither comparable with prior
quarters nor indicative of future results.
Revenues were Dollars 210.9m, compared with Dollars 360m a year ago. No
dividend is being paid.
Mr Joseph Tucci, newly appointed chairman, said the results represented a
'solid return to profitability'.
They also showed the company could achieve sustained profitability as a
supplier of office productivity software based on open standards and
client-server designs.
Wang was placed in bankruptcy protection last year with debts of more than
Dollars 500,000. It emerged from Chapter 11 three weeks ago after its
creditors agreed to a debt-to-equity conversion. No single stockholder owns
more than a few per cent of the company, and the balance sheet is strong.
The company will continue to support users of its VS series of
minicomputers, but its new business plan focuses on client-server software
and systems integration services.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Growth slows at Bangkok Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANGKOK Bank has reported third-quarter results which confirm that
deregulation has yet to make a significant impact on the country's 15 listed
banks, although profits growth is slowing. South-east Asia's biggest bank
lifted unconsolidated net profits to Bt3.31bn (Dollars 133m) from Bt2.8bn in
the same period last year.
Mr George Huebsch, Union Securities' head of research, said Bangkok Bank's
profits, like those of the whole sector, were feeling the affects of slower
loan growth and a narrower spread between lending and deposit rates.
'The economy is coasting and some banks' clients have been lost to foreign
banks or used debt instruments to raise money,' according to Mr Huebsch.
However the latest results from Bangkok Bank are in line with his full-year
forecast of a 23 per cent rise in profits to Bt13.36bn, compared with
Bt10.54bn in 1992.
Thailand's other leading banks have also reported third-quarter results:
Siam Commercial Bank's net profits climbed by 9.2 per cent to Bt1.21bn: Thai
Farmers Bank's profits rose 10 per cent to Bt1.67bn; Krung Thai Bank showed
a 27 per cent gain to Bt1.35bn; Bank of Ayudha saw a modest 0.9 per cent
advance to Bt706m and Thai Military Bank reported a 78 per cent increase to
Bt681m.
Mr Graheame Catterwell, country manager for Crosby Research, said new
lending income from the recently introduced Bangkok International Banking
Facility should come through in the next quarter.
'Some people say Thai banks are going to fade - that's nonsense as these
figures show. Thirty per cent growth may be slower but they are still
extraordinarily profitable,' said Mr Catterwell.
The slowdown in lending was most apparent in the Siam Commercial Bank where
loan growth slipped to only 2.6 per cent in the quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING similar forays into Africa by some of its competitors, Nedcor,
South Africa's fourth largest banking group, has announced a series of
initiatives to increase its presence on the continent.
Nedcor Bank, a subsidiary of Nedcor, has entered into a strategic alliance
with Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM), to combine forces
in Africa.
SFOM, a Swiss-based holding company, has major shareholdings in banks in 14
countries in Africa with a strong presence in West and Central Africa. It is
owned by Banque Nationale de Paris, Dresdner Bank and Banque Bruxelles
Lambert.
Nedcor Bank and SFOM have also agreed, with effect from October 1 1993, to
combine forces in Namibia by merging Namibian Banking Corporation and
Commercial Bank of Namibia.
The merged bank will be jointly managed by the two partners, which hold an
88 per cent stake, and will be known as The Commercial Bank of Namibia. It
will be the third largest bank in Namibia with total assets of R725m
(Dollars 166m).
Nedcor Bank has also agreed to acquire an effective 16 per cent strategic
stake in the Merchant Bank of Central Africa, one of Zimbabwe's premier
banks, in partnership with other major shareholders including SFOM, NM
Rothschild and Hill Samuel.
Nedcor Bank said that, given South Africa's inexperience in the rest of the
continent, it had been decided to forge relationships with other banks that
had greater experience in the region. The group saw its business in Africa
as the provision of bankings services and support to its corporate and
commercial customers doing business in Africa.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canberra to sell Moomba pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday announced plans to raise over ADollars
500m (USDollars 327m) by selling a controlling interest in the Moomba-Sydney
gas pipeline to the Australian Gas Light Company, the nation's largest
petroleum pipeline company, and inviting tenders for the remaining equity.
The pipeline transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin in South Australia
on behalf of AGL, for distribution in Sydney, Canberra and regional centres
in New South Wales. It is operated by The Pipeline Authority (TPA), a
statutory authority, under a haulage agreement dating back to 1974.
It has been politically contentious in the past, and a previous attempt at
privatisation, in the 1980s, failed. The current deal is not expected to be
completed until mid-1994, and will require enabling legislation to be
passed, as well as a new haulage agreement and approvals from the Trade
Practices Commission and the New South Wales government.
Under the current proposal, the government would sell a 51 per cent interest
in the pipeline to AGL and conduct a competitive tender process for the
remaining 49 per cent.
'The government expects that total gross proceeds from the sale will be in
the range of ADollars 510m to ADollars 550m,' Mr Ralph Willis, finance
minister, and Mr Michael Lee, resources minister, announced yesterday.
AGL, which is quoted and has other oil and gas trunk pipeline interests in
New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory, would receive
ADollars 30m compensation for releasing the commonwealth and TPA from
contractual commitments to the pipeline's operation, they added.
Commenting on the proposed transaction, AGL said the sale represented 'an
acceptable solution to the current confusion over future haulage charges'
and would result in reductions in haulage charges for 'major gas users, who
are currently subsidising smaller consumers'.
The company, which has long sought ownership of the pipeline, said it would
prefer to see a number of institutional investors own the remaining 49 per
cent but added that nothing - from a trade sale to a single purchaser or a
public flotation of the remaining equity - had been ruled out by the federal
government.
The deal could have implications for ICI Australia, part of the UK's ICI
group, which plans to build a second pipeline linking the Cooper Basin and
Sydney. This would follow the existing pipeline's path, and would be used to
transport ethane to ICI's Botany Bay petrochemical plant. Total cost of this
project has been put at around ADollars 300m.
However, ICI Australia said yesterday that it still expected the ethane
pipeline to be built by TPA, and for the project to proceed as planned.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: QVC seeks Paramount bid 'poison
pill' ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC Network, the US home shopping company, yesterday asked a US court to
throw out 'poison pill' provisions standing in the way of its hostile
Dollars 90 a share bid for Paramount Communications, the film studio and
book publishing group.
The company told the Delaware Chancery Court it wanted 'a level playing
field' that would enable it to fight fairly with Viacom, the cable
television company that has made an agreed bid for Paramount worth Dollars
85 a share.
Under the terms of the agreed bid, Viacom would get a Dollars 100m
consolation prize if a rival bidder won the battle, together with the right
to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's stock on favourable terms.
QVC claims the provisions are illegally hindering other bids. It told the
court yesterday: 'It is a breach of fiduciary duty for Paramount directors
to pull this poison pill for an inferior offer by Viacom.'
Paramount vigorously denied the claim and the outcome of the court case is
likely to prove decisive in the battle.
A fall in Paramount's share price in the last two days suggests that Wall
Street is putting its money on a victory for Viacom, the lower bidder.
Meanwhile, QVC reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 21.5m, an
increase of 31.5 per cent over the previous year's figure. Net income per
share rose only slightly from 40 cents to 42 cents because of an enlarged
equity base.
Nynex, the US regional telephone company that has formed an alliance with
Viacom in its bid for Paramount, yesterday challenged US laws preventing
telephone companies offering cable services in their own regions.
It filed a suit in the District Court in Portland, Maine, claiming the
restriction violated its constitutional right to free speech and deprived
customers of a full range of choices in the video services market.

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, the fourth-largest US retailer, maintained its strong sales and
earnings momentum in the third quarter but Dayton Hudson continued to suffer
from its heavy exposure to the sluggish Californian economy.
Penney, with nearly 1,300 department stores in 50 states and an extensive
catalogue-sales business, said net income, before an extraordinary item, set
a quarterly record at Dollars 221m, or 83 cents a share, against Dollars
186m, or 70 cents, a year earlier.
In the three months to the end of October, the company took a one-time
charge of Dollars 36m to cover early retirement of debt, plus a Dollars 14m
provision to adjust deferred taxes. With both items included, net income was
Dollars 185m or 69 cents.
The earnings improvement was struck on sales up 9.1 per cent to Dollars
4.76bn. Sales in stores open for at least a year were 9 per cent ahead and
mail-order sales climbed 15.2 per cent.
By contrast, Dayton Hudson's results underscored the group's continuing
difficulties in the discount sector.
The retailer said a poor performance by Mervyn's, a clothing chain with a
strong west coast presence, had contributed to a 24 per cent decline in net
income to Dollars 43m, or 53 a share, from Dollars 57m, or 70 cents.
Revenues showed a 7 per cent increase to Dollars 4.63bn. However, on a
same-store basis, a more reliable measure of retailing strength, sales were
up by only 1 per cent.
Mervyn's operating profits were down significantly, while same-store sales
dropped by 7 per cent.

China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German carmaker, is expanding its operations in China with
the development of its joint venture with First Automobile Works, the
state-owned vehicle maker, in Changchun in north-east China.
VW signed a letter of intent in Beijing yesterday under which it is planned
that FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, the joint venture company in which
it holds 40 per cent, will take over the assembly of the Audi 100 in China.
This car has been assembled under licence since 1988 by FAW, which is
chiefly a producer of light commercial vehicles and also produces the
Chinese state limousine, the 'Red Flag'.
The Volkswagen group is already the leading carmaker in China, one of the
world's fastest growing car markets, with two joint ventures in Changchun
and Shanghai.
It is developing capacity to produce more than 330,000 cars a year in China
by 1996, by which time the country is likely to be its third most important
market worldwide.
VW said yesterday that FAW had assembled more than 45,000 Audi 100s since
the start of assembly under licence. Capacity is being raised in order to
produce 30,000 Audi cars a year by 1995. The Audi 100 is the only car
selected by the Chinese authorities for use by senior state officials.
FAW-Volkswagen Automotive, which is to take over control of the Audi 100
assembly, is already developing a plant in Changchun to produce 150,000 cars
a year by 1996 in a DM1.5bn project including engine and gearbox
manufacturing as well as car assembly.
The joint venture will assemble VW Golf/Jetta-sized cars both for the
domestic Chinese market and for export to other markets in south-east Asia.
Small-scale production has already started on the basis of assembling CKD
kits (completely knocked-down) supplied from Germany and South Africa, with
8,050 VW Jettas produced in China last year.
Volkswagen formed its first joint venture in China in 1985 when it took a 50
per cent stake in the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company for the local
production of the VW Santana.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: GM chief outlines plans for
return to net profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, General Motors' chief executive and president, outlined plans
yesterday to return the carmaker's troubled North American operations to an
after-tax profit in 1994.
Increased sales in the US, which would take the group's market share back to
33 - 34 per cent from around 31 per cent now, and further cost-cutting would
both contribute to the turnround, he said.
The projections came as GM's share price jumped on the news, released after
the stock market closed on Monday, that it would use Dollars 5.7bn worth of
shares to reduce the underfunding of its pension plan. The company's share
price rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 53 3/8 before easing back later to Dollars
52 3/4 .
Speaking after a meeting with financial analysts, Mr Smith said GM was on
course to meet its target this year of breaking even before interest, taxes
and health care expenses for retired workers.
Contributing to the turnround this year have been a Dollars 2bn cut in the
cost of materials and a 12 per cent reduction in the time spent assembling
each vehicle to 24 - 25 hours. Also, 1993 US sales are expected to reach
14.1 vehicles, up 7 per cent from last year.
In its last quarter, GM's North American operations made a net loss of
Dollars 1.12bn, after plant closure costs and other items which resulted in
a net charge of Dollars 289m.
The company is planning a 5 per cent increase in vehicle sales in the US in
1994, to 14.8m. Even if this sales target is not met, Mr Smith said GM
should make the planned returned to net profitability in North America. He
added: 'No excuses.'
Mr Gerald Knetchtel, head of North American operations, said that next
year's targets are not based on plans for further significant job cuts. The
sale of various units and normal attrition would push staff levels down to
around 245,000 next year, he said.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley up 64% in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the US securities house, yesterday announced third quarter
earnings of Dollars 181.7m, up 64 per cent from a year earlier and in line
with analysts' expectations.
The results, however, were not as strong as in the record-breaking second
quarter, primarily because of lower trading and investment banking revenues.
Although the firm's overall earnings remained strong compared to previous
years, the quarter-on-quarter decline in revenues from Morgan Stanley's two
main businesses suggests that the unprecedented two-and-a-half year boom in
Wall Street profits may have passed its peak.
The firm said the drop in trading revenues was mostly the result of
unfavourable conditions in the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market.
Trading revenues totalled Dollars 285.3m in the period, down from Dollars
300.8m a year ago and well below the record Dollars 517.9bn reported in the
second quarter.
Although Morgan Stanley did not provide details on the MBS situation,
several big Wall Street firms and institutional investors have encountered
problems in the MBS market recently.
This follows a surge in the number of borrowers paying off their mortgages
early, which has led to losses on portfolios of securities that pay only the
interest portion of a mortgage.
With trading revenues declining, investment banking took over as the firm's
main source of earnings during the quarter, bringing in a total of Dollars
295.5m, up 62 per cent from a year earlier.
The improvement was accredited to growth in structured debt underwriting
volumes, a strong equity new issues calendar, and an increase in mergers and
acquisitions and other corporate advisory business.
Brokerage commissions totalled in Dollars 101m in the quarter, up from
Dollars 76.3m a year earlier, and asset management and administration fees
contributed Dollars 67m, up from Dollars 51m. Interest and dividend income
climbed 61 per cent to Dollars 1.57bn.
Non-interest expenses increased 32 per cent to Dollars 757.6m, mostly
because of a rise in compensation payments that was related to the growth in
profits.
Morgan Stanley's shares closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76 1/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Baxter Intl announces
broad-ranging reshape
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAXTER International, the troubled US medical supplies group, announced a
broad-ranging restructuring which will lead to 4,500 lost jobs and account
for Dollars 700m of special pre-tax charges out of a total of Dollars 925m
this year.
The company also said it was in talks to sell its diagnostics manufacturing
business, and was considering joint ventures, partial flotations and other
moves to further the development of its businesses.
The moves represent Baxter's response to the restructuring in the US health
care industry, and to growing unrest among its shareholders.
The company's shares, which were trading at Dollars 35 before Baxter first
attracted shareholder disquiet when it pleaded guilty to supporting an Arab
boycott of Israel in March this year, have fallen to a low of Dollars 20 in
recent weeks.
Mr Vernon Loucks, chairman and chief executive, said the restructuring was
intended to make the company better organised in the US to cope with the
'dramatic changes' under way in the health care market.
Its salesforce, operating through 20 product divisions, will be amalgamated
and organised regionally, making it better adapted to sell to the large
regional buying groups which are beginning to dominate the industry.
Powerful buyers have pushed down prices in Baxter's core hospital products
business, putting profits under pressure.
Also, the company will concentrate much of investment - expected to reach
Dollars 2bn over the next three years - abroad, where growth prospects are
greater.
The restructuring will result in a pre-tax charge of Dollars 700m in the
fourth quarter this year, taking the company into a loss for the year. The
cost cutting, which will result in a reduction of 7 per cent in the
workforce over the next five years, will lead to savings of Dollars 100m
next year, rising to over Dollars 350m in 1998, the company said.
Baxter said it would take a Dollars 225m pre-tax charge to cover litigation
costs, primarily from its breast implants and blood-clotting agents.
The global settlement of a class action over leaking breast implants, agreed
last month, would result in costs of Dollars 475m - Dollars 618m, Baxter
said. After insurance cover, the company's share of the settlement cost is
expected to be Dollars 128m. It has also provided Dollars 47m to cover its
share of a settlement over HIV-infected blood-clotting products, and Dollars
50m to cover other smaller product liability actions.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: JC Penney sets record as Dayton
Hudson slips

<TEXT>
JC PENNEY, the fourth-largest US retailer, maintained its strong sales and
earnings momentum in the third quarter, while Dayton Hudson continued to
suffer from its heavy exposure to the sluggish Californian economy.
Penney, with nearly 1,300 department stores in 50 states and an extensive
catalogue-sales business, yesterday said net income, before an extraordinary
item, set a quarterly record at Dollars 221m, or 83 cents a share. The
result compares with Dollars 186m, or 70 cents, in the corresponding period
of 1992.
In the three months to the end of October, the company took a one-time
charge of Dollars 36m, or 14 cents, to cover early retirement of debt, plus
a Dollars 14m provision to adjust deferred taxes.
With both items included, net income was Dollars 185m, or 69 cents.
The improvement in earnings was struck on a 9.1 per cent advance in sales to
Dollars 4.76bn.
Sales in stores open for at least a year were 9 per cent ahead of last
year's level.
Penney continued to benefit from Sears' recent exit from the catalogue
business, as mail-order sales climbed 15.2 per cent.
By contrast, Dayton Hudson's third-quarter results underscored the group's
continuing difficulties in the discount sector.
The retailer said a poor performance by Mervyn's, an clothing chain with a
strong presence on the west coast, had contributed to a 24 per cent decline
in net income to Dollars 43m, or 53 a share, against Dollars 57m, or 70
cents, in the 1992 quarter.
Revenues showed a 7 per cent increase to Dollars 4.63bn. However, on a
same-store basis, a more reliable measure of retailing strength, sales were
up by only 1 per cent.
Mervyn's operating profits were down significantly, while same-store sales
dropped by 7 per cent.
Target stores, which offers general merchandise at discounted prices,
continued to be a bright spot, showing a 6 per cent gain in comparable-store
sales and higher operating profit.
At the department-store division, which includes the Dayton's, Hudson's and
Marshall Field's chains, earnings and sales were flat.

Europe

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL Cities/ABC, the US media group that owns the ABC television network,
is to make further inroads into Europe by taking a stake in a Scandinavian
commercial television operator.
It has agreed to buy 21 per cent of the shares in the Luxembourg-based
Scandinavian Broadcasting System for about Dollars 40m and will have the
right to increase its stake to 25 per cent by buying another 500,000 shares
on the open market.
SBS's shares, which are traded in the US on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars
1 7/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 .
SBS owns and operates four commercial television stations in Scandinavia.
They are TV Norge in Norway and TV5 in Sweden, both satellite-to-cable
television stations; Kanal 2 in Denmark, an over-the-air television station;
and TV Fynboen in Odense, serving Denmark's third largest city.
US broadcasters have been keen to expand their interests in Europe because
they see opportunities for growth in a fast-deregulating market.
Capital Cities/ABC has already bought stakes in several European media
companies, including Hamster, a French programme maker, Tesauro, a Spanish
producer, Molinaire, a UK production company, and Tele-Munchen, a German
producer.
Mr Herbert Granath, president of Capital Cities' newly-formed ABC Cable and
International Group, said the company's earlier experiences had given it
confidence in the future of ventures formed with knowledgeable local
managers in growing media markets.

MEDCO Containment Services, the US medical services group, is to buy the
45.8 per cent of Medical Marketing Group it does not already hold at Dollars
27.25 per share, Reuter reports. The transaction is valued at Dollars
156.6m.
Medical Marketing and Medco, joined in the announcement by Merck, the US
health care group, also said the proposal included an agreement with a
Medical Marketing shareholder group suing Medco in Delaware Chancery Court
after an initial bid of Dollars 25 per share for Medical Marketing stock,
made on October 13.
The understanding, the companies said, calls for plaintiffs to settle their
litigation 'based upon, among other things, the terms of the merger
agreement'.
The merger is subject to approval by shareholders and the Delaware court,
and is also contingent on completion of the Medco-Merck merger.

flotation

   By RICHARD WATERS

<TEXT>
THE PRUDENTIAL, the US insurer, plans to retain a majority stake in its
reinsurance arm in a partial flotation that would value the unit at more
than Dollars 1bn.
The company, which earlier this year pursued a private sale of the whole
unit, said it would sell 20m of Prudential Reinsurance's 50m shares in a
public offering, 4m of them outside the US. An over-allotment provision
allows for the sale of a further 3m shares.
The Prudential abandoned its pursuit of a private sale in August after it
was unable to raise the Dollars 1.2bn target sale price.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it
would sell the shares at a maximum of Dollars 21 each, putting proceeds from
the offering at Dollars 420mand the value of the unit at Dollars 1.05bn.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: French minister and Volvo chief
discuss Renault deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, yesterday held talks with
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, to discuss how to reassure Volvo
shareholders who are opposed to the planned merger between Renault and the
Swedish motor group.
Opposition from Volvo's shareholders, which has centred on the lack of a
clear timetable for the privatisation of the merged group and the French
government's plan to retain a golden share in the company after
privatisation, threatens the merger of the two groups' truck and car
activities.
Earlier this month, Volvo postponed until December 7 a shareholder vote on
the link-up with Renault.
Mr Gyll, who admitted last week that Volvo's shareholders were 'completely
against the deal', explained the concerns of Swedish investors but did not
ask for a renegotiation of the deal, according to French officials.
The French government continues to resist changes to the merger agreement
and insists that shareholder opposition can be overcome by clearer
explanation of the controversial points and emphasis on the industrial logic
of the deal.
Volvo shareholders are opposed to the golden share because it could be used
to reduce their voting rights from 35 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of
the dissolution of the merged group's holding company.
Mr Longuet stressed the proposed golden share would never be used against
Volvo and was necessary to defend the merged group from a hostile takeover.
Industry observers said verbal reassurances on the golden share and on the
French government's plans to privatise the merged company next year, were
unlikely to satisfy Swedish shareholders.
They speculated that opposition to the deal could be fuelled by the two
groups' results for the first nine months of the year which are due to be
released tomorrow.
Volvo is expected to show an improvement over the losses incurred in 1992,
while Renault is expected to announce a steep downturn in profits.
Renault announced yesterday that it would launch its new Laguna upper
mid-range passenger car in January.

REPSOL, the Spanish energy and chemicals group, yesterday reported a 27.5
per cent rise in operating profits to Pta112.6bn (Dollars 834m) for the
first nine months of 1993. Net income in the third quarter improved 8.2 per
cent to Pta59.7bn.
The chemical division finally returned to profit in the third quarter,
although its results over the nine months show a loss of Pta3.7bn.
The gas side, which now owns 45 per cent of the national domestic gas
distributor, raised its third-quarter profits by 63 per cent to Pta27bn
following higher volume and reflecting Repsol's increased equity in the
distribution company.
Repsol has invested Pta138bn so far this year - Pta70bn on building petrol
stations and on refining activities. A further Pta40bn has been allocated to
gas distribution and to finance the increased shareholding in Gas Natural.
Repsol is finalising the purchase of Enagas, Spain's monopoly industrial gas
supplier. The deal will create one of Europe's biggest natural gas
companies.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stet enters final round of
bidding for Matav
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STET, the Italian state telecommunications company, has emerged as an
unexpected, last-minute contender in the bidding for a 30 per cent stake in
Matav, the Hungarian state telecommunications group.
Stet International has teamed up with Bell Atlantic, the US regional
telephone company. Their consortium was one of four short-listed yesterday
by the Budapest authorities to go through to a final round of bids for Matav
in a two weeks' time.
Matav is eastern Europe's largest privatisation.
The Italian-led group is up against three consortia led by Deutsche Telekom,
France Telecom and Telefonica, respectively the German, French and Spanish
national operators.
Preliminary indicative bids for the 30 per cent stake in Matav which the
Hungarians are selling are understood to range around Dollars 500m. Rivals
believe Stet's offer is to be towards the higher end of the bidding range.
However, Mr Szabolcs Szekeres, chief executive of the AVRT state holding
company which controls Matav, yesterday moved to dampen expectations that
the price would go up in the next round of bidding.
Privatisation advisers stressed that the four preliminary bids were not
wholly comparable. Nor is a ranking in the first round a reliable guide to
the outcome of the final round.
One of the rivals admitted that Stet appeared to have established a
benchmark on price. The Italian company appears to have undermined the
assumption that Matav's privatisation was a straight fight between Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom.
Hungary's political and economic ties with Germany are believed to be
working to the advantage of Telekom which has attracted Cable &amp; Wireless of
the UK and Ameritech of the US as consortium partners.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ericsson retains its Swedish
style - But the group's background has drawbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ericsson, the telecommunications company, provides a reassuring picture for
Swedes worried by a swelling tide of foreign influence over the country's
industrial bastions.
Against examples such as the proposed merger of Volvo's cars and trucks with
France's Renault, and the takeover of Nobel Industries by Akzo of the
Netherlands, Ericsson stands out as a company that has flourished in a
highly competitive industry and which remains firmly under Swedish control.
Tomorrow Ericsson, a dominant force in world mobile telecommunications, will
announce nine-month results expected to show it well on the way to its
target of full-year profits of at least double last year's SKr1.3bn (Dollars
160m).
In revenue terms, it ranks sixth among the world's telecommunications
equipment suppliers, after Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany, AT&amp;T and
Motorola of the US and Canada's Northern Telecom.
Ericsson has seen its share price more than double this year, closing
yesterday at SKr408. Along with Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, it has
been a driving force in this year's bull market on the Stockholm stock
exchange.
True, 44 per cent of the company's capital is owned by foreign investors.
But its preferential share structure ensures that the joint control of the
powerful Wallenberg family and Svenska Handelsbanken is unshaken.
Yet Mr Lars Ramqvist, the chief executive, is less than euphoric about the
company's prospects in a business undergoing regulatory and technological
changes.
'Nothing is for free. I am very pleased with what we have achieved, but I am
also realistic. No-one is safe in this business,' Mr Ramqvist said.
His worries are multiple. A big concern is that Ericsson can continue to
grow fast enough to support the large commitments to research and
development required to keep up in the fast-changing telecommunications
world. The group spends 22 per cent of its Dollars 7bn annual turnover on
R&amp;D - compared to the 11 per cent spent by Alcatel, which has twice
Ericsson's turnover.
Even with that level of investment, Ericsson must stay on its toes to hold
its place in the face of developments such as the push to establish
communications super-highways and the emergence of network operator
powerhouses such as the Dollars 30bn merger in the US between Atlantic Bell
and TCI, the cable operator.
Ericsson must contend with newcomers to the equipment supply business, such
as computer companies which can challenge suppliers in areas such as systems
management.
On top of these challenges, Mr Ramqvist is concerned that Ericsson suffers
from its Swedish background.
It lacks the large home market enjoyed by its main rivals. It swallows about
60 per cent of Sweden's export credits, but still has access to only a
fraction of the support available to competitors. Sweden cannot muster the
political clout of the US or France, a factor that can be important in
winning big state contracts around the world.
However, Ericsson has carved out an impressive position in the fast-growing
area of mobile telecommunications. It now claims 40 per cent of the world's
20m-strong installed cellular telephone market. Ericsson has been quick to
develop digital systems.
It dominates the European GSM digital cellular standard and can supply to
all the leading different standards adopted by telecoms authorities around
the world. This flexibility and geographical spread has given Ericsson
competitive advantage and it expects to do well when new cellular
wavelengths are licenced in the US next year without a common standard being
applied.
If industry projections are right that cellular telephone subscribers
worldwide will grow in number to as many as 120m by 1998, Ericsson looks
well placed to benefit.
The company appears to face a tougher time in fixed telephony systems. But
it has been spending heavily on upgrading its transmission, switching and
network management systems and developing new broadband systems to keep up
with moves towards single line multi-media delivery of telephone, computer
and television services. And it has entered partnerships in different areas
with Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, General Electric and Toshiba to
ensure it is not outflanked by its rivals.
'We cannot relax and just collect the money,' said Mr Ramqvist. 'We have
just seen the beginning of competition. But we will not easily be knocked
down.'

ENICHEM, the chronically loss-making petrochemicals subsidiary of Italy's
Eni energy and chemicals group, expects this year's losses to reach about
L2,200bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
The company, which has seen a severe deterioration in its financial
performance in spite of cost-cutting efforts, lost L1,052bn in the first
half of this year against L721bn in the same period last year.
About L1,000bn of this year's losses will stem from financial charges on its
large net indebtedness, expected to be about L8,500bn by the year end.
The deterioration at EniChem means it will have to be recapitalised by Eni
under Italian law. However, Mr Marcello Colitti, EniChem's chairman, said
fresh capital would have to await further results of the group's
restructuring.
Mr Colitti noted that any injection of funds would have to convince the
European Commission in Brussels that it did not represent illegal state aid.
EniChem intends to dispose of non-core activities and slim down its business
to concentrate on ethylenes, polymers and elastomers.

FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Turnround continues at SCA

<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second largest pulp and paper group, rebounded to a SKr788m
(Dollars 97.2m) profit after financial items in the first nine months from a
SKr5m loss in the same 1992 period.
However, it warned that market conditions had worsened during the autumn,
and said full-year profits would now be at the bottom of the SKr1.1bn to
SKr1.3bn range it forecast in August.
'The market trend this autumn has been substantially weaker than expected,
with continued price declines for corrugated board and testliner, as well as
pulp and fine papers,' it stated. It stressed there was 'great uncertainty'
about the timing of any recovery.
The group, which has just raised SKr1.4bn from a rights issue, said
third-quarter profit amounted to SKr238m. This compares with a SKr99m loss
in the same 1992 period but is lower than profits of SKr271m and SKr279m in
the first two quarters of 1993.
SCA has relied on cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona, lower raw material
costs and volume growth within its Molnlycke hygiene division to offset
increasingly fierce competition in many of its main markets.
Molnlycke has helped SCA weather the pulp and paper recession better than
many of its competitors. It increased its sales to SKr11.2bn from SKr9.2bn
over the nine months, helping to lift group sales by 8 per cent to
SKr25.4bn.
The hygiene unit also accounted for more than half of group operating
profits of SKr1.53bn with a 28 per cent increase to SKr822m. A bigger
marketing effort and new product launches have helped it to hold prices and
lift market share, in spite of intense competition.

UNI Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance group, yesterday reported
nine-month profits of NKr3.84bn (Dollars 526m), against a loss of NKr3.59bn
in the same period last year.
It attributed the sharp turnround to a positive development in interest
rates and gains on securities.
After distribution of NKr2.73bn in life and pension insurance for life
insurance clients, the consolidated nine-month pre-tax profit reached
NKr1.11bn against a loss of NKr3.8bn in the same period last year, the
company said.
Group gross operating income rose to NKr18.19bn from NKr15.22bn last year as
net operating income advanced to NKr16.79bn from NKr13.79bn. During the
nine-month interim, the group achieved realised gains on securities of
NKr2.42bn, of which NKr1bn was made during the third quarter. Unrealised
gains reached NKr4.06bn.
Uni said its equity capital increased by NKr466m to NKr2.56bn while its
equity-to-debt ratio reached 7.81 per cent, compared with the legal
requirement of 4.25 per cent.

THE ELIMINATION of losses from discontinued businesses helped Kembrey, the

marked recovery at the interim stage.
Mr David Burnet, chairman, said the outcome for the six months to October 2
 -pre-tax profits of Pounds 29,000 compared with losses of Pounds 304,000 -
also reflected reduced borrowings and lower interest rates.
Interest payable dipped from Pounds 382,000 to Pounds 218,000; gearing at

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ICI warns of Pounds 30m in charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Industries yesterday warned it might incur a further
Pounds 30m in exceptional charges this year following difficulties in its
indirectly-owned Argentinian PVC manufacturer.
The shares edged down 7p to 682p as analysts reduced their forecasts for
ICI's annual results due out in February from about Pounds 258m to Pounds
228m. The market had already factored in restructuring provisions of between
Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m.
The latest charges arise from the decision to wind up Electroclor, one of
Argentina's leading quoted companies which has been hard hit by the
dismantling of trade barriers in 1991. Shares have fallen from a high of
Dollars 14 in recent years to 59 cents last night.
The company, which is 60 per cent held by the ICI subsidiary Duperial, has
incurred losses estimated at about Pounds 10m a year since 1991. Electroclor
has been hampered by high raw material costs and has been unable to compete
with cheaper PVC imports, mainly from the Gulf states.
ICI said yesterday that the directors of Electroclor had recommended that
shareholders consider a liquidation of the company. A meeting would be held
within the next 30 days.
Analysts in London welcomed the announcement as further evidence of ICI's
refocusing.

FIRM progress by the UK traffic and US semiconductor business enabled CML
Microsystems, the USM-traded specialist electronic products group, to record
a near-10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.65m for the half year
ended September 30.
Sales rose 35 per cent to Pounds 8.42m and operating profits by 25 per cent
to Pounds 1.25m. The pre-tax figure took account of a fall in interest
income to Pounds 398,000 (Pounds 503,000).
Earnings per share showed an increase from 5.36p to 5.74p.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Second-hand endowment trust launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW investment trust which will invest in second hand endowment policies
is being launched by Exeter Asset Management and Teather &amp; Greenwood, the
broker.
There is a growing market in with-profits endowment policies, with
policyholders finding it more rewarding to sell their policies rather than
to surrender them to the insurance company. Investors are attracted to these
second hand policies by their relatively steady returns.
The Exeter Geared Endowment Policy Trust will have an unusual structure. It
will have gearing, via a zero coupon debenture stock. Although this will not
pay interest, the capital roll-up on the debenture will be an allowable
expense for tax purposes.
As well as endowment policies, the trust will buy income shares of split
capital investment trusts. It will be able to offset tax on this income
against the roll-up on the zero, enabling it to receive the dividends gross.
This income can then be used to fund the continuing premium payments on the
endowment policies.
The fund managers expect a return of about 10.85 per cent per year over the
trust's 15 year life. Further details will be available when the prospectus
is published next week.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: CI shares tumble on trading setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF CI Group, the steel and engineering combine, yesterday fell 7p to
14p on news of the planned sale of Societe Metallurgique de Brevilly, its
French-based steel rolling mill subsidiary, and a trading update.
The decision to dispose of SMB was taken in the light of the current
downturn in demand in the European automotive industry. Some 70 per cent of
SMB's output is directed to that market and for several years the offshoot
has incurred losses. The sale will result in a balance sheet write-down of
some Pounds 2.3m.
Group trading in the second half had recently shown a 'marked downturn',
directors said. Demand and margins for the group's products sold into the
late-cycle construction industry had fallen in both the UK and continental
Europe.
In order to reduce overheads a programme of redundancies had been
implemented at a cost of Pounds 250,000. In addition increases in raw
material prices had put further pressure on margins across the group.
Overall, the directors expected continuing operations to remain in profit
for the year to end-January.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK food industry margins narrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING PROFIT margins of British food and drink manufacturers have
narrowed in the past year from 6.7 per cent to an average of 6.3 per cent,
the lowest level since 1987, according to a survey.
The survey, by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, part of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, also found that the industry's return on capital fell from 19.5 per
cent to 17.9 per cent, the lowest since 1985.
OC&amp;C said these declines followed a period of 'remarkable resilience' during
the recession, when operating margins in the industry held steady at 7.1 per
cent on average for three years.
However, the overall figures masked wide variations. Companies with annual
turnover of less than Pounds 100m fared worse than bigger companies in
1992-93, achieving lower margins and return on capital and slower sales
growth. About 40 per cent of bigger companies increased their margins.
That marked a reversal of the pattern in the mid-1980s, when small food and
drink companies performed more strongly than large ones.
Nonetheless, several leading branded food companies performed poorly in the
past year. Cadbury Schweppes' profit grew by less than 2 per cent, after
rising 15 per cent annually in the two previous years.
The British subsidiary of Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food
manufacturer, suffered a 6 per cent fall in profit, while fierce competition
from cheaper brands cut the profit of Heinz UK by 28 per cent.
By contrast, profit margins increased from 25 per cent to 28 per cent at
Walkers, the leading UK potato crisp brand. It was the most profitable UK
food company, followed by Kellogg UK, with a 16 per cent margin.
The industry's continental European sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 3.7bn,
more than a fifth of which was accounted for by Tate &amp; Lyle.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Noble raises further Pounds 32m for Lloyd's
insurance market

<TEXT>
NOBLE &amp; CO, the Edinburgh-based finance house, yesterday completed the
placing of shares in its split capital Lloyd's investment trust, Premium
Trust and Premium Underwriting, raising a further Pounds 32.3m in funds for
the Lloyd's insurance market.
Some 25 per cent of the issue is available to the public on a clawback basis
via an offer for subscription.
Martin Currie Investment Management will manage the investment portfolio,
while Wellington Members' Agency has negotiated capacity on 45 syndicates
listed in the prospectus.
Noble last week increased the size of the offer to accommodate investor
interest and Mr Tim Noble, chief executive, said he was 'delighted' with the
response from institut-ions.
PT will receive Pounds 19.8m of the issue and PU Pounds 13.2m. After
deducting issue costs and a reserve for initial expenses, PU will lend
Pounds 12.2m to PT interest free for 10 years in return for an undertaking
by PT to pledge a total of Pounds 31m to Lloyd's. This in turn will permit
PU to support Lloyd's syndicates underwriting up to Pounds 62m in 1994.
Shareholders of PU will receive all underwriting profits for seven years,
while PT will operate within the guidelines of an investment trust for tax
purposes. Shareholders of PT will receive all the income and capital gains
for 10 years on an initial portfolio of some Pounds 31m.
Shares will be offered as a unit at Pounds 10 apiece and capital raised on a
60/40 basis between PT and PU respectively. The minimum application will be
for 300 units, or Pounds 3,000.

undertakings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield Insulations Group's subsidiary, Sheffield Insulations, has given
undertakings in the restrictive practices court not to give effect to
certain agreements which related to the supply of insulation products in
1986.
These agreements were alleged by the Office of Fair Trading to have been in
existence for only a fairly short time at the end of that year and were said
to have attempted to fix maximum discounts for the supply of certain
insulation materials.
Sheffield Insulations consistently denied that it had been party to such
agreement, but accepted that there had been an agreement to continue the
long-standing and accepted practice of quoting prices on the basis of
variable discounts from list prices.
The company said this was not effective to limit in any way the prices paid
by the customer and it was on this basis that it gave undertakings to the
court.

VTR, which provides post production facilities for television commercials,
more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 434,024 to Pounds 884,144 for
the year to August 31. The result included a Pounds 110,915 profit from the
sale of an outdated original edit suite.
Earnings per share grew from 3.5p to 7.7p and a recommended final dividend
of 2.55p makes a total of 3.75p, against 3.4p.
A noticeable upturn in business for all group companies from the beginning
of 1993 had continued - and strengthened - in the second half, with profits
up from Pounds 158,000 to Pounds 682,000.
Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman of the USM-traded grouo, said the current year
had started well and further progress was expected. Cash flow remained
strong, but continued spending meant that gearing edged up to 76 per cent
(72 per cent).

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick up to Pounds 63.6m - Strong dollar
brings substantial benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK GROUP, the insurance broker, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
63.6m for the first nine months of 1993, compared with Pounds 55.8m for the
same period of 1992. Earnings per share for the period were 8.5p, compared
with a restated 7.8p.
Brokerage and fee income and expenses both increased by 4 per cent,
reflecting an improved underlying trend for the third quarter. Profits also
benefited substantially from the strength of the dollar compared to 1992.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, pointed to a positive performance in the US
where brokerage and fee income rose by 5 per cent 'in spite of difficult
market conditions'.
On the other hand, conditions in the London market 'remain difficult,
shortage of capacity being the main feature,' added Mr Riley.
Brokerage and fee income rose to Pounds 551.2m (Pounds 465.3m). A fall in
investment income to Pounds 33.2m (Pounds 37.8m) was partially offset by a
reduction in interest payable to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 11.5m). Expenses rose
to Pounds 509.7m (Pounds 435.7m).
Operating profit increased to Pounds 74.7m (Pounds 67.4m). Share of
associates' losses increased to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 700,000). Insurance
underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 200,000, compared with profits of
Pounds 600,000.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH WESTERN Electricity yesterday announced plans to build a fibre-optic
telecommunications network at a cost of at least Pounds 10m.
The regional network, to be erected on the company's electricity pylons,
will be leased to other telecoms suppliers.
SWEB is the third of the 12 privatised regional electricity distribution
companies in England and Wales to make a significant investment in the
telecoms sector.
Since the end of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, many new operators have
entered the UK market.
The privatised utilities, keen to diversify and with regional
infrastructures in place, are showing particular interest.
SWEB's plans to have a 250km cable from Bristol to Plymouth installed by
next year. Energis, the National Grid's telecoms subsidiary to be launched
next year, will be a customer. The initial investment will be Pounds 1.5m.
Mr John Seed, SWEB chief executive, said: 'We think we can make money out of
it, and are in a position to offer services not just to Energis, but to the
cable TV companies and BT and Mercury.'
Since it lacks a public telecommunications operator licence, SWEB cannot
offer services directly, but only through an operator with a licence.
Last month South Wales Electricity launched a Pounds 200m joint venture with
International CableTel of the US to build a cable TV and telephone network
covering most of urban South Wales.
Yorkshire Electricity is engaged in a Pounds 40m joint venture with Kingston
Communications, the independent operator in Hull, to provide a regional
service. Yorkshire is also a shareholder in Ionica, the independent company
planning to launch a national, radio-based telecoms network in 1995.
Separately, Yorkshire Water has taken a stake in a joint venture to build a
cable network for Yorkshire in partnership with Singapore Telecom and
Generale des Eaux, the French diversified services group.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marshalls rises 59% to top Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group,
jumped by more than 8 per cent to 118p yesterday, after the company
announced better than expected half year profits.
Pre-tax profits during the six months to the end of September rose by 59 per
cent from Pounds 6.41m to Pounds 10.2m. Analysts forecasts had ranged from
Pounds 7m to Pounds 9.5m.
The rise in the share price was helped by optimistic comments from Mr Andrew
Marshall, chairman, about the trading outlook for building material sales.
He said the latest 'results had been achieved within an economic climate
that was gradually improving, particularly in housing.' This had been
partially counterbalanced by a further decline in commercial construction.'
The improvement in the housing market had enabled the company to raise
prices for some of its bricks and concrete products. Group turnover in the
first half rose by 10 per cent from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds 102.2m.
The profits rise was also assisted by a reduction in interest charges from
Pounds 1.67m to Pounds 1.09m. Earnings per share grew to 3.87p (1.85p)
leaving an unchanged interim dividend of 1.25p, covered more than three
times.
The number of bricks sold by the group in the first half rose from 77m to
87m. This was due, said Mr Marshall, to the housing market improvement as
well as the elimination of the surplus capacity in the brick industry.
Prices of specialist engineering bricks had risen by about a fifth. The fall
in the price of facing bricks had been stemmed and in one or two cases had
even seen a small increase, he said. Operating profits in the brick division
had risen from Pounds 515,000 to Pounds 1.3m.
The concrete products division increased profits by 17.5 per cent from
Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8.9m. Prices for concrete products had become a little
firmer over the summer, while volume sales had increased, particularly for
concrete block paving which was winning market share from rival building
materials.
Costs across the group had also been reduced to improve profitability, said
Mr Marshall.
Analysts said yesterday that they were expecting pre-tax profits for the
full year to rise to about Pounds 16m compared with Pounds 12.4m the
previous year.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Biotrace International valued at Pounds 40m
after placing at 130p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Biotrace International, the South Wales-based biotechnology group
which is being floated on the Stock Exchange, were yesterday placed firm at
130p, valuing the company at Pounds 40m.
Allied Provincial Securities placed 7.15m shares, representing 23.2 per cent
of the enlarged share capital, including some 4.6m shares placed on behalf
of the com-pany.
Biotrace was founded five years ago by Mr Ian Johnson, a former Welsh Water
microbiologist, and Mr Colin Griffiths, an accountant.
The group manufactures a range of rapid testing instruments and chemical
reagents to monitor hygiene levels and detect microbiological contaminants
in the food and drink and other sectors.
Uni-Lite, the group's briefcase-housed portable product, provides a quick
electronic test to check food industry hygiene on the production line -
necessary to meet increasingly tough legislation and protect brand names and
reputations.
Like the group's other products it uses luciferase - a natural phenomenon
based on the enzyme which makes fire flies glow - which emits light when it
comes into contact with a substance called Adenosine Triphosphate which is
present in all living cells including bacteria.
An electronic instrument called a luminometer is then used to measure the
light.
The group's rapid hygiene and microbial testing systems are mainly supplied
to the international food and drinks industry although it has a growing
number of customers in other sectors including cosmetics and pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
After spending Pounds 299,000 on research and development, Biotrace incurred
a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 113,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.71m in the 12
months to July 31.
Mr Griffiths, the finance director, expects the group to report a pre-tax
profit in the current year.
Biotrace is raising Pounds 5.6m net of expenses through the placing which
will mainly be used to increase marketing resources in overseas markets and
in particular, to accelerate international market penetration of Uni-Lite.
Dealings in the shares are expected to begin on November 25.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: PowerGen moves into oil and gas production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, yesterday made its first move into oil
and gas production when it bought a 3.9 per cent stake in exploration blocks
covering Liverpool Bay from Monument Oil and Gas.
Mr Simon Williams, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the
investment made sense and should not worry shareholders concerned about
diversification.
PowerGen knows the field well because it is contracted to buy the gas for
its Connah's Quay generating plant, he said. 'It is a toe in the water which
involves limited risk.'
Monument is reducing its stake to 20 per cent in the Liverpool Bay blocks,
110/13 and 110/15, through the sale.
The consideration is Pounds 45.5m at July 1 plus interest payments and up to
Pounds 3m more over the next two years depending on exploration results.
Monument said the sale would release cash for investment and reduce future
debt, without materially reducing exposure to Liverpool Bay.
PowerGen said the purchase, subject to government consent, would be funded
from the company's own resources.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the company was cash positive and would
move only slightly into a negative cash position towards the end of the
year.
The company's interest in Liverpool Bay began when it contracted with
Monument and Hamilton Oil, operator and joint developer of the fields in the
blocks, and others to buy gas for Connah's Quay in North Wales.
'We have said many times we want to move upstream,' said Mr Wallis.
'Hamilton was the first company to get gas out of the North Sea. We are in
safe hands.'
Mr Wallis said Liverpool Bay and Connah's Quay would start to contribute to
earnings in 1995 with the full benefit of both being seen from 1996 onwards.
'At this time PowerGen will be the largest single consumer of gas in the UK,
one of the largest gas markets in Europe,' said Mr Wallis.
PowerGen expects to contribute about Pounds 40m to development costs of the
Liverpool Bay field in the next year.
National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, already has upstream
assets through its 24 per cent stake in Seafield Resources and 10 per cent
share of the Victor gas field.
PowerGen's other interests in the gas market include its Kinetica joint
venture with Conoco which is the second largest distributer of gas in the UK
with a claimed 25 per cent of the available market.
It also has a combined heat and power subsidiary which recently signed a
contract with Grovehurst Energy for the supply from a gas fired plant of
80MW of electricity and 200MW of steam to three Kent paper factories.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bryanston creditors can expect 40p in the
Pounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS to Bryanston, the insurance company in provisional liquidation,
can expect to receive to receive up to 40p in the pound, according to
proposals circulated yesterday.
Accounts for the year to December 31 1992 show that there are assets of
Pounds 86m against liabilities estimated at Pounds 216m. The provisional
liquidators at accountants Price Waterhouse suggest this will lead to a pay
out of 30p to 40p.
The details appear in documents distributed to creditors as part of a
proposed scheme of arrangement under English insolvency law.
Bryanston, and its sister company Trinity, entered provisional liquidation
in March last year. A scheme of arrangement for Trinity was proposed earlier
this year.
Actuarial estimates put gross reserves - allowing for substantial future
liabilities including legal claims in the US courts on pollution and
asbestosis - at Pounds 194m.
The document has been circulated to nearly 10,000 creditors identified by
the liquidators. They will vote on the proposals in January.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tepnel expects first product next June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEPNEL Diagnostics, which was floated on the USM almost 13 months ago,
reported a maiden loss of Pounds 1.38m for the period from June 11 last year
to this September. In the flotation prospectus, losses were forecast to be
Pounds 1.28m.
Turnover was Pounds 31,000 and the loss included Pounds 931,000 of research
and development expenditure.
Losses per share were 6p.
Sir David Trippier, who became executive chairman a month after the float,
said that the first product using Tepnel's Daras technology for the
screening of DNA patterns of specific diseases would appear in June within
the life science/clinical research market.
Thereafter two other products using the technology would be launched into
the infectious disease and cancer test market, and then by the end of 1995
Tepnel would introduce a product into the blood analysis market, which
includes the Blood Transfusion Service.
Sir David said that Tepnel's competitors' technology was 'behind ours for
speed of testing and for quality, with no false negatives or positives'. He
said that contracts had been signed with Strato Consulting of London and
Pathway Laboratory Services at Leicester University to make the kits.
The Faras (Food antibiotic residue analysis system) test range was behind
schedule, as Sir David had announced at the interim stage, but was also
forecast to be launched in June.
At the float, Tepnel said the milk industry would be the first market to be
addressed because of the expected EU directive on milk testing. That
legislation has now been delayed until next year, so the Faras delay has had
little detrimental effect.
Sir David said the market was excited about Tepnel's 'technology sharing'
agreement with Drug Screening Systems Inc, because of its drug of abuse
screening product, especially in the light of home secretary Mr Michael
Howard's pledge to screen prisoners for drugs.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: All-round increases help FKI rise to Pounds
22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED performances from all five divisions helped FKI, the electrical
engineering group, to a 41 per cent rise to Pounds 22.1m in pre-tax profits
for the six months to end-September.
Mr Jeff Whalley, chairman, said yesterday the figures showed the
management's ability to deliver improved results 'even in difficult
conditions.'
The profits improvement, up from last time's Pounds 15.6m, was achieved on
turnover ahead some Pounds 62m at Pounds 394m. Exchange rate movements
accounted for Pounds 1.8m of the profits increase and most of the increase
in turnover.
Earnings per share rose from 2.56p to 3.52p and the interim dividend is
raised from 1.2p to 1.5p. The shares closed up 5 1/2 p yesterday at 183 1/2
p.
Mr Whalley said the group had continued with its strategy of raising margins
while turnover was expected to remain steady. The average margin rose to 6.5
per cent in the half from a previous 5.5 per cent, and he expected to hit
the target of 10 per cent in 1995.
A further Pounds 3m was spent on restructuring in the half, and another
Pounds 3m would be spent in the second half. By the end of the year the
number of people employed by the group would be below 11,000, compared with
13,500 three years ago.
The group operates through five divisions - hardware, materials handling,
automotive, engineering and process control.
The first three operate primarily in the US, which accounted for 53.6 per
cent of group profits in the half, against 39.5 per cent last time.
The materials handling division boosted operating profits by 83 per cent
from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 8.2m on turnover of Pounds 98.3m (Pounds 82m).
The group attributed the rise to aggressive cost cutting, the
discontinuation of unprofitable lines and productivity gains.
The decline in orders from British Coal had hit orders in the UK, but this
had been anticipated and the group had won an order to China.
The automotive division lifted operating profits from Pounds 125,000 to
Pounds 1.7m following a rationalisation programme in North America.
Difficult market conditions in Europe had been offset by North American
demand.
Operating profits in the hardware division rose to Pounds 7.9m (Pounds
6.7m). On November 5 the group completed the Pounds 66.5m cash acquisition
of Truth, the US manufacturer of hinges, operating and locking mechanisms
for windows and doors. Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, described the
acquisition as 'very exciting', and predicted a strong contribution to
profits next year.
Gearing at the end of the half was 20 per cent (24 per cent). The Truth buy
lifted it to 58 per cent, but 50 per cent was expected by the year end.
COMMENT
FKI is delivering exactly what it set out to do when the new management team
took over last year - to boost the group's profitability on flat turnover.
This has been achieved through increased prices, production improvements and
well focused capital expenditure. The business is now generating a lot of
cash. Margins continue to improve, and while a target of 10 per cent by 1995
looks a shade optimistic, no-one would now be surprised if the target was
hit. The acquisition of Truth could add as much as 1p to earnings per share
next year. An earnings forecast of 8p per share for the year gives the
company a p/e of 22.5. This might look justified now, but the group will
need to tread carefully along the acquisition path.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON FARRELL, former chief sub-editor of the Financial Times UK Companies
Desk, died at the weekend after a short illness.
Don, aged 60, joined the FT in 1960 after working for Exchange Telegraph,
the general and financial news agency.
He had to relinquish his position as chief sub after a heart attack in the
early eighties and in the following years developed another important role
on the paper. He became a mentor to many young journalists, being an expert
on the nuts and bolts of profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. This
knowledge he would freely impart in a patient and kind way, with time for
everybody.
In his later years, Don became an inveterate traveller, going to America and
Australia, with a renewed zest for life. He was an ardent sports fan,
following Arsenal for football and Middlesex for cricket, and his interest
in the pleasure aspects of life were wide-ranging, including a keen interest
in motoring.
Don was a private man and an FT institution in his own right. He was due to
retire at the end of the year and was looking forward to spending more time
with his family. He will be sorely missed by us all.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BAe sells data processing operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is selling its data processing operations to Computer
Sciences Corporation, a US computing services company.
The contract, Europe's largest data processing outsourcing deal, is expected
to be worth a minium of Pounds 900m over 10 years to the US company.
BAe said its costs savings would be 'substantial' but declined to give exact
figures.
Outsourcing, where an outside organisation takes over a company's computers
and data processing staff and provides an agreed level of service against an
agreed fee, is growing in popularity as companies increasingly concentrate
on core activities.
BAe said it would retain responsibility for its information technology
strategy together with 'sensitive' computer systems.
CSC would take control of the data centres, networks, applications software
and distributed computing systems used by its business units including
Military Aircraft, Royal Ordnance, British Aerospace Systems and Equipment,
the headquarters organisation and the Sowerby Research Centre.
It is understood that the final short list for the contract included EDS of
the US, a subsidiary of General Motors, and IBM. Last week EDS won the first
of the government's 'market testing' outsourcing contracts from CSC with the
purchase of Dvoit, the data processing arm of the Driver and Vehicle
Licencing Centre.
The BAe agreement dwarfs CSC's deal earlier this year with BHS, worth Pounds
100m over 10 years, but it is still smaller than its deal last year with
General Dynamics of the US which is worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn).
Mr Ron Mackintosh, chief executive of CSC Europe, said he believed that the
company's expertise in the aerospace business had been the key factor in
winning the deal. CSC would carry out three months of due diligence with
BAe; the contract was expected to be signed in the spring of 1994.
It will involve the sale of BAe's data processing assets to CSC for about
Pounds 75m. Some 1,250 staff will be transferred to CSC together with IBM,
ICL and Digital Equipment computers from a variety of sites through the UK.
MSF, the technician's union, said BAe staff were 'bitterly disappointed' by
the deal which would be a real threat to the security of the business.
Mr Ron Ralph, BAe officer for the north-west, said BAe had put short term
financial considerations in front of long term security. MSF was concerned
for the future of the staff who would be transferred and would be seeking
early meetings with BAe and CSC.
BAe said yesterday it had 'placed the highest priority on protecting the
interests of the employees who will be transferred to CSC', and had
emphasised the need to maintain equivalent terms and conditions together
with comparable training and development programmes and career
opportunities.
Mr Mackintosh said redundancies would be 'minimal'. No decisions would be
taken until the completion of due diligence.
CSC is a leading computing services company employing some 26,000 people
with revenues of Dollars 2.5bn. It has been making assiduous efforts to grow
in Europe through acquisition.
The BAe deal means it will expand from 750 people in the UK to over 2,000.
It will have more than 3,000 staff in Europe. It expects revenues of about
Dollars 150m from the first year of the BAe contract, giving it total
revenues in Europe of over Dollars 400m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: DTI distances itself from RICS' stance on
QMH probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday distanced itself from a
decision by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to suspend its
inquiry into the widely divergent valuations on the assets of Queens Moat
Houses, writes Andrew Jack.
The DTI said: '(RICS') activities are entirely a matter for them.'
The Institution decided on Friday that it would stop examining the
circumstances behind valuations which differed by nearly Pounds 500m
provided by Jones Lang Wootton and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith.
QMH has said the valuations - which were delivered within five months of
each other - had been commissioned using the same information and prepared
on the same valuation basis.
The Institution's action followed legal advice and was prompted by the DTI
announcement at the end of last week that it was launching an inquiry into
QMH.
Its decision came in spite of assurances that it would seek urgently to
assess the valuations and make a statement 'in a matter of days'.
The three members of the assets valuation standards committee, convened to
consider whether there was a disciplinary case to answer, were informed
after the decision had been taken.
Mr Richard Wright, a partner with lawyers Dibb Lupton Broomhead, said
professional bodies typically did suspend inquiries once a DTI investigation
had begun, but there was no legal reason to do so.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bluebird shares soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Bluebird Toys hit a new high for the year yesterday after the
company said that pre-tax profits were likely to be 'substantially higher'
than current City forecasts of just over Pounds 5m.
The shares, which hit a low of 26p in December 1990, closed at 570p, up 90p
on the day.
In September, the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.99m (Pounds
234,000) for the six months to June. At that time Mr Torquil Norman,
chairman, said he expected continued growth in the second half as well as a
good result for 1993 as a whole.
Yesterday he said: 'Now that the majority of our Christmas orders have come
in, it is clear that the level of business, both in the overseas markets and
the home market, will be such that the company's pre-tax profits are likely
to be substantially higher than the current City expectations of just over
Pounds 5m.'
He said that sales of the company's miniature play sets, marketed around the
Polly Pocket and Mighty Max characters, were particularly strong. He added:
'This is not a bubble.' The company has a new range planned for 1995.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Brownsword in cards merger with Hallmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRATULATIONS to Andrew Brownsword, thought to be one of the highest paid
men in the UK, who is moving house.
Mr Brownsword, who started designing and publishing greetings cards from his
kitchen table more than 20 years ago, has agreed to merge his group of
companies with the UK - Ireland operations of Hallmark Cards, the world's
largest greetings card publisher with annual sales of more than Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2bn).
In its last published accounts for the 13 months to January 1991 the
Brownsword company, which owns the quintessentially English Gordon Fraser
and Forever Friends, reported turnover of nearly Pounds 45m and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 19.7m.
Hallmark Cards is one of the biggest privately owned companies in the US. It
is based in Kansas City, Missouri, where founder Joyce Hall started selling
postcards in 1910.
Mr Hall, who was named after a bishop and constantly received mail addressed
to Miss Hall, died aged 91 in 1982, handing the business on to his son,
Donald J Hall.
The company employs 700 artists and offers cards for every occasion - from
birth to death, taking in all stages of modern American courtship, including
a request for information on a partner's HIV status.
In the UK, Hallmark has 140 retail outlets known as Hall of Cards, where it
offers its collection of brands including the Snoopy range. Mr Brownsword,
46, will assume overall responsibility for the combined group's operations
in the UK and Ireland.
Neither Mr Brownsword or Mr Don Read, Hallmark UK/Ireland's group managing
director, were available for comment yesterday.
But Mr Read said in a press statement that the merger 'brings together two
of the leading names in the greetings cards business and offers exciting
growth prospects for the industry as a whole.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Currency gains and strong demand help De La
Rue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for bank-notes and currency gains helped De La Rue, the
security printer and cash-handling machine group, increase pre-tax profits
by 44 per cent to Pounds 66.1m in the six months to September 30.
De La Rue's shares rose by 18p to 772p after the group said it would pay a
higher proportion of its dividend at the interim stage and lifted the
payment by 56 per cent to 6p (3.85p).
Although the second half was unlikely to benefit from a similar move in
exchange rates, the group said it was confident that profits before
exceptional items would be not less than in the same period last year.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said: 'The improved profitability of
our security printing operations, the resilience of our payment systems
sector - despite the slowdown in Germany - and the strong result from our
associated companies have all contributed to this excellent result.'
The group said security printing continued to benefit from strong demand for
their products, with banknote production at record levels. Operating profits
rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 25.9m. The substantial improvement in
margins on continuing operations from 17.8 per cent in the first half of
last year to 24.8 per cent this year arose from an increase in the
proportion of more profitable banknote business.
The company expected margins for the full year would exceed those of last
year, but were unlikely to be maintained at the level achieved in the first
half. Order books remained strong, and in the key businesses extended well
into the next financial year.
Payment systems increased operating profits from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds
17.7m. The group said order books were also strong, although trading
conditions in Germany remained difficult. Group turnover was flat at Pounds
273.4m. Cashflow from operations of Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 37m) helped
increase net cash to Pounds 201m, up from Pounds 171m at the year-end.
Mr Les Cullen, finance director, said De La Rue was less well placed to hand
back cash to shareholders than Reuters, the international business
information group, which had considerable unrelieved advance corporation
tax. However, gross funds could still benefit from an ACT credit on any cash
distribution and if this were to be time-limited by the budget, the group
would examine the position.
Under FRS 3, which includes gains from the sale of discontinued operations,
earnings per share rose by 46 per cent to 24.8p (17p). Using the definition
of earnings suggested by the Institute of Investment Management and
Research, which strips out certain non-recurring items, earnings grew by 30
per cent to 21p (16.2p).

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GA at Pounds 206m but shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Accident, the Perth-based composite insurance company, provoked a
negative response from the markets yesterday, despite reporting pre-tax
profits of Pounds 206.1m for the first nine months of 1993.
The result, which compared with losses of Pounds 35.1m at the same stage
last year, disappointed some expectations and the shares closed 33p lower at
658p.
'People have got used to forecasts being regularly beaten by GA. This is the
first set of figures to disappoint,' said Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith
New Court, the securities house.
The fall was mainly due to market perceptions, added Mr Bird, pointing out
that GA has been trading with the biggest premium to net asset value of any
company in the insurance sector.
Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive, said GA was 'pretty pleased with the
result. The market will have to make up its own mind.'
The dominant feature of the result was a turnround in the UK where
underwriting profits of Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 133.1m loss) were achieved by a
combination of higher premiums and more selective underwriting.
Premiums have stopped increasing in motor and household insurance, but
continue to rise by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in commercial lines
business.
Underwriting profits of Pounds 24m were recorded on personal lines business
in the third quarter when GA posted an operating ratio (claims plus expenses
as a percentage of premiums) of only 72.27 per cent on its homeowners'
business.
Overseas, results in Canada were adversely affected by losses of Pounds 10m
from rainstorms affecting Winnipeg and Manitoba in August.
Worldwide general business premium income amounted to Pounds 3.12bn (Pounds
2.86bn). Income from long-term business amounted to Pounds 607m (Pounds
555.4m). Investment income less interest on loans amounted to Pounds 354.1m
(Pounds 329m). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 173.3m (Pounds 374.4m),
long-term business profits rose to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 22.4m) and estate
agency losses fell to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 12.1m).
GA has transferred ownership of its life company from General Accident Fire
and Life Assurance Corporation, the group's principle non-life insurance
subsidiary, to the parent company.
The transfer will increase the reported current solvency margin worldwide by
about eight percentage points.
Before the change solvency amounted to 52.7 per cent.

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ascot cuts deficit to Pounds 0.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASCOT HOLDINGS, the debt-laden property, brewing and leisure company
formerly known as Control Securities, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 68.5m
to Pounds 555,0000 in the six months to September 30.
Profits in the comparative period were struck after a Pounds 51.8m
write-down of assets.
The company finalised a financial restructuring in June in the wake of
difficulties which began in 1991 when the Serious Fraud Office investigation
into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International led to charges against Mr
Nazmu Virani, who subsequently resigned as chairman and chief executive of
Control Securities.
The shares were suspended and a review of asset valuations caused the
company to breach borrowing covenants after substantial property
write-downs.
Net borrowings at the half way stage stood at Pounds 197.5m (Pounds 234.3m)
following 30 property disposals and the conversion of about a quarter of the
company's Pounds 75m worth of Eurobonds into preference shares. The balance
sheet shows a negative net worth of Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 31.8m).
The shares, which resumed trading on June 30, yesterday closed up  1/2 p at
5 1/4 p.
The year-end results were qualified. A review report on the interim figures
by Parnell Kerr Forster, the auditors, noted that continued trading required
the support of the company's bankers and other creditors.
As part of the financial restructuring the company's bankers have agreed,
under their standstill agreement, to continue existing facilities to the
company for a year to June 16 1994.
Turnover rose to Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 47.8m). Operating profits of Pounds
10m (Pounds 3.25m) reflected lower exchange losses of Pounds 3.45m (Pounds
12.6m) on the Swiss Franc bonds, improvements in the hotel and brewing
operations and a decline in pubs and property.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 11m (Pounds 17.3m). Losses per share were
0.6p (16.7p).

FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: European Motor hits Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Motor Holdings, the fast-growing motor retail group, yesterday
reported sharply higher interim profits partly reflecting earlier
acquisitions.
For the six months to September 30 they improved from Pounds 861,000 to
Pounds 2.64m pre-tax.
Earnings per share grew to 4.9p (1.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted
from 1.5p to 1.725p.
The acquisition of Wilcomatic, a leading UK supplier of automated vehicle
washing machines in May last year, and the Mill Garages motor dealership
group which was acquired in July 1992, helped boost turnover to Pounds 81.5m
(Pounds 50.3m).
Mr Richard Palmer, chief executive, said the group had continued to
consolidate the acquisitions made last year.
'We expected substantial progress from the businesses and I am pleased that
our objectives have been achieved,' he said.
The group ended September with net borrowings of Pounds 5.73m, little
changed from the Pounds 5.56m in net borrowings at the end of March,
representing gearing of 32 per cent.

FT  17 NOV 93 / BOC shares fall on flat payout note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday disappointed the
City by saying it would not increase its dividend this year. The company
announces its dividend in advance.
Its shares fell 30p to 596p on heavy turnover.
Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said: 'We've paid a handsome dividend during
recession. We don't know what the future holds in terms of inflation and
industrial growth, so the board decided to wait before dividend growth was
resumed.' The dividend for the year to September 1994 would be 23.2p, the
same as 1992-93.
He added that improvement in the world's industrial gases industry 'will lag
a more general economic revival. The outlook for business investment looks
sluggish in leading markets.'
BOC reported a 56 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 215m to
Pounds 337m for the year to September 30. But this was flattered by the
absence of exceptional charges - goodwill write-offs on disposals amounted
to Pounds 117.1m in the previous year. Turnover increased by 13 per cent to
Pounds 3.23bn, against Pounds 2.86bn, while operating profits rose from
Pounds 412m to Pounds 420m.
The results benefited from currency movements, in particular the strength of
the US dollar. The changes added 10 per cent to turnover and 6 per cent to
operating profit.
Mr Rich said the UK upturn had not reached the industrial sector.
Engineering output was down between 12 and 15 per cent since 1990. The US
was recovering slowly, although there had been some recent acceleration.
Japan was drifting, Germany static, Australia deteriorating and South Africa
unsettled.
The gases division increased turnover by 16 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn, while
operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 304m. Sales of liquefied gases
grew in most markets, but demand for compressed gases for cutting and
welding remained sluggish.
Healthcare operations were hit by the expiry of the US patents on Forane, an
anaesthetic. Turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 576m. Operating profits fell
13 per cent to Pounds 86m. Forane has lost 50 per cent of its US market
share to generic competition in the nine months since its patents expired.
The results were also affected by the high cost of launching Forane's
successor, Suprane. So far it had won about 15 per cent of the Forane
market.
The vacuum and distribution services division generated operating profits of
Pounds 33m, up from Pounds 19.4m, on turnover of Pounds 363m.
Earnings per share (before the goodwill write-off) slipped from 44.15p to
42.97p.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Italy adds another dimension to debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prolonged bull market in international bonds has generated many curious
phenomena, not the least of them being yesterday's 2 trillion lire (Dollars
1.2bn) issue of 30-year Italian government bonds.
Any rudimentary credit-scoring test of Italy would give poor results indeed.
Existing commitments? More than 100 per cent of GDP - fail. Budget
shortfall? Almost 10 per cent of GDP - fail. Stability of domestic
arrangements? Only recently changed prime minister, tricky election coming
up next spring, serious medium-term risk of national break-up - fail.
Perhaps somebody, somewhere, believes that the Italian government, or its
several successors, will repay the loan in the year 2023 with money that
will then buy more than a cup of espresso coffee. Most do not, but then they
do not seriously expect to be holding the bonds in 2023, only during the
next few months.
The point about ultra-long bonds is that they are volatile instruments which
offer new opportunities to players in the financial markets.
In a bull market investors have made money and have built the confidence to
step up their level of risk. Given that the average length of the Italian
government's debt is about three years, 30-year bonds introduce a new
dimension for sophisticated speculators.
Italian bonds have enjoyed a spectacular run. A year ago the 10-year
government bond yield hit nearly 14 per cent, now it is down to 9.4 per
cent. The total return so far in 1993 has been close to 30 per cent.
Politically and economically the country has come back from the brink (but
is still viewed suspiciously by the credit rating agencies).
The short average maturity of the massive Dollars 1,000bn debt would
normally be regarded as a disadvantage, but with interest rates tumbling it
has actually proved a blessing in disguise.
Through refinancing, the cost of servicing the debt is coming down fast, so
that although the primary budget deficit is worsening, the overall deficit
(including the enormous, but declining, amounts of debt interest) is
improving.
Why, therefore, start to lengthen the debt now? Logically because the scope
for further falls in interest rates is seen as slight. Certainly, rates are
low by past standards: curiously, Italy's 10-year bond yields have tumbled
lower outside the European exchange rate mechanism than they were while the
country was supposedly converging towards German-style inflation rates.
Temporarily, inflation at 4 per cent is no higher than in Germany, but
inflation as low as this makes the decision to issue 30-year debt at 9.87
per cent look very strange. The implied real interest rate is well over 5
per cent (albeit reduced for foreign investors who pay a 12 1/2 per cent
withholding tax) and an overborrowed nation cannot travel down such a
financial path for long: if the real interest rate is greater than the
economic growth rate, arithmetic dictates that the burden of debt will go on
increasing.
Governments that truly believe in low inflation will never issue long-dated
fixed interest bonds with high coupons. The British government has been more
logical in this respect, having been reluctant to issue gilts in recent
months with longer than a 15-year maturity. Inflation-linked bonds would be
a more logical alternative for the Italians, but only if they could be
issued on real yields of between 2 and 3 per cent.
Of course, in the context of the formidable total of Italian government debt
a mere Dollars 1.2bn (little more than a thousandth of the total) does not
count for much: a billion here and a billion there does not, after all, add
up to real money. Perhaps we should regard it as a marker or a status
symbol, or just a minor instrument for the global bond desks to play with.
The 30-year bond therefore looks like a diversion. Surely the real question
is how the Italian national debt will eventually be restructured; the
country's creditors should bear in mind the uncomfortable thought that by
ceasing to pay interest the Italians would put their budget more or less
back into balance (something that is far from true for the UK, for
instance).
We can be sure that there will be action long before 2023.

FT  17 NOV 93 / BAA rises thanks to retailing strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILING has become the largest single source of income for BAA, the
privatised British Airports Authority, which yesterday reported an 8.7 per
cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 237m, from Pounds 218m.
Apart from a 10 per cent increase in retail income, the higher earnings
reflected healthy growth in air travel, especially in the UK, and the
company's continuing drive to control costs.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the company was seeking to expand its
international airport activities in the US, Europe and Asia through
consultancy contracts, joint ventures and equity stakes. With a 70 per cent
share of the UK airport business already, BAA was not interested in
investing in new British ventures following the government's proposals to
privatise local authority airports.
Sir John confirmed that BAA was interested in proposals to privatise Rome's
Fumicino airport, adding that the company had been approached by numerous
authorities involving 20-30 airports to discuss co-operation and partnership
ventures. 'Many foreign governments are interested in bringing private
capital in their airports systems and they are looking at our successful
example,' he said.
He has been the architect of BAA's drive into retailing which accounted for
Pounds 250m of the company's total first-half revenues of Pounds 627m, up
16.5 per cent.
The contribution from retailing was higher than the Pounds 244m income
earned from aircraft landing charges. In spite of a 4.6 per cent increase in
passenger numbers, income from aircraft landing charges fell 0.7 per cent
because of the current regulatory pricing formula.
Sir John said BAA had added nearly 50 new airport shops in the past six
months bringing the total at its UK airports to just over 400.
BAA's latest traffic forecasts for its seven UK airports saw growth at a
rate of 3.8 per cent a year to the end of the century. The seven were
expected to handle 86m passengers by 1995 and 104m passengers by 2000
compared with 77m last year.
The interim dividend goes up 8 per cent to 6.75p. Earnings per share were
5.9 per cent higher at 34.2p, reflecting a higher tax charge.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Tiphook dives on disposal fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, plunged
40p to 58p yesterday as fears grew that a disposal of assets by bankers will
leave little or nothing for ordinary shareholders.
Tiphook said on Monday that its bankers were in talks about the possible
sale of its container division, the largest part of the group.
A US bonds analyst said: 'It looks like the banks are giving up and going
for an orderly disposal of the group's assets. Shareholders will be
completely wiped out. It's a very sad story.'
A UK transport analyst said: 'Bondholders are particularly afraid that that
they will be left holding a baby they don't really want - the trailers
business.'
Analysts suggested Tiphook's fleet of 495,608 containers might fetch Pounds
800 each, producing roughly Pounds 400m. Tiphook has 17 per cent of the
world's container rental fleet, second only to Genstar, a division of
General Electric Corporation of the US. Tiphook's 25,065 truck trailers, the
biggest fleet in Europe, could fetch more than Pounds 250m.
Tiphook's debts exceed Pounds 1bn. Disposals proceeds would be more than
enough to pay off the total secured debt of Pounds 480m owed to the group's
banks, led by National Westminster and Commerzbank of Germany.
However, unsecured US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m
(Pounds 470m) in the past year, might only receive 45 to 60 cents in the
dollar. The US bonds were yesterday trading at more than a 30 per cent
discount to face value.
Bond market experts said Tiphook was likely to be deluged by litigation from
bondholders, claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions about
the company's prospects. Tiphook's debt was downgraded to so-called
junk-bond status within months of issue.
Tiphook said on Monday that the group and some directors were the subject of
four shareholder class actions in the US, which they would defend.
Analysts were concerned at the short-term nature of the Pounds 32.3m which
Tiphook has been granted by its principal banks. One said: 'It looks as
though they are just drip-feeding it with enough cash to allow a disposal of
the assets.'
Tiphook's market value has collapsed from Pounds 636m in 1991 to Pounds 64m
at last night's close.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Honda cuts full-year forecast after 60% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE a buoyant market for motorcycles in Asia, Honda Motor suffered a
decline of about 60 per cent in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993.
Honda said that depressed demand in Japan and Europe, a slower than expected
recovery in its US business and the adverse impact of a high yen had all
contributed to the deterioration in performance.
Parent company pre-tax profits fell 62 per cent to Y11.1bn (Pounds 70m),
from Y29.2bn, on sales down 6 per cent to Y1,256bn. On a consolidated basis,
pre-tax profits dropped 60 per cent to Y22.5bn, while sales were 12.6 per
cent down at Y1,874bn.
The outlook remains grim and Honda has revised down its forecasts for the
full year. Consolidated sales are now expected to total Y3,744bn rather than
the Y4,000bn forecast in May.
Net profits are expected to be Y17.3bn compared with an earlier estimate of
Y23bn.
While the weakness of the economy was an important factor behind the
downturn in sales of motorcycles and cars, Honda also suffered from a poor
product mix. Earlier in the year its high-selling Accord met consumer
resistance before an autumn model change.
Honda was also late to introduce a line-up of recreational vehicles in Japan
and was so unable to capitalise fully on the boom in this market.
In the US, Honda's largest car market, the group was hit by the sharp rise
of the yen. Unit sales fell 6 per cent because of greater competition from
the Big Three US carmakers and the slow pace of recovery.
The half-year performance was helped by strong demand for motorcycles in
Asia, including China, where Honda expects to increase local production of
motorcycles from 380,000 units in 1992 to 580,000 this year.
Production of motorcycles in Asia (excluding Japan) is expected to total
2.73m units this year, or 64 per cent of Honda's worldwide motorcycle
production.
In the Asean countries, exports of cars rose 35 per cent between January and
October.
Honda is limiting capital expenditure to Y145bn, compared with a projected
Y180bn, cutting development costs and keeping a tight lid on recruitment.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Hosokawa victory on reforms: Japanese vote for political
change ends days of party wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S coalition government last night won the first round of a
parliamentary showdown with the opposition Liberal Democratic party, paving
the way for wholesale reforms to the corrupt political system.
A parliamentary committee voted in favour of the plans, ending days of
bitter wrangling between the seven-party coalition and a divided LDP.
The Tokyo stock exchange's Nikkei average recovered from Monday's 2.3 per
cent fall although investors remained cautious ahead of prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to the US at the end of the week.
The committee vote means the four reform bills are now likely to gain
majority approval from what is set to be a stormy debate in the lower house
tomorrow. That is the biggest hurdle they face.
The bills will replace the present multi-seat constituency system, a
Japanese peculiarity blamed for encouraging politicians to use money and
influence to gain votes, with a mixture of single-seat constituencies and
proportional representation.
Lower house seats would be reduced from 511 to 500, of which 274 would come
from single-seat districts and 226 from proportional representation. The
reforms would also ban donations to individual politicians and parties would
have to disclose donations exceeding Y50,000 (Pounds 314) a year.
Yesterday's vote has opened a rift between younger LDP members eager for
reform and able to accept the compromises offered by Mr Hosokawa and older
parliamentarians who have spent years and millions of yen building power
bases and who fear losing their seats under the new system.
Several young LDP parliamentarians promised to vote for the government's
proposal tomorrow, heralding another wave of defections. Officials predicted
that between 20 and 30 LDP parliamentarians might defect to one of the
coalition reform groups.
Yesterday's vote follows an early morning breakdown in negotiations between
the government and an LDP paralysed by its internal divisions. An attempt to
reopen talks later yesterday morning got nowhere, leaving the LDP
outmanoeuvred by Mr Hosokawa's success. Tempers frayed as Mr Yohei Kono, the
LDP chairman, likened Mr Hosokawa to a 'banana salesman', an unusually
pungent insult by Japanese parliamentary standards.
If the reform bills clear the lower house by the end of the week, as is
likely, they should have enough time to pass through the upper house, the
final stage, by Mr Hosokawa's December 15 deadline. He had indicated he
would resign if political reform failed to get through parliament by the end
of the year. Unless the LDP employs delaying tactics in the upper house, it
does not look as if he will have to make that sacrifice.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Many insolvency practitioners may breach rules, report shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE QUARTER of insolvency practitioners may be failing to meet their
obligations under the law, according to an inspection carried out over the
past few months by the government's Insolvency Service.
In monitoring visits to 147 of the UK's nearly 2,000 practitioners, 18 had
'significant compliance problems' which have triggered investigations by
their self-regulatory bodies.
A further 18 are believed to have exhibited less serious defaults which also
breach regulations.
The details are revealed in the 1992-93 annual report of the Insolvency
Service, an executive agency within the Department of Trade and Industry,
which was published yesterday.
They will intensify calls to strengthen regulation within the insolvency
profession, which has been subject to growing criticism over the past few
months.
Since the 1986 Insolvency Act, practitioners have been required to pass
exams and join a self-regulatory organisation, but little effort has been
made to screen those already practising.
The problems described by the Insolvency Service include failure to maintain
proper time records for their billings, misusing bank accounts and failure
to keep adequate financial and administrative records. A senior insolvency
service official said: 'The regulatory bodies still have some work to do to
meet the requirements in legislation.'
The report also shows that 11 insolvency practitioners and one manager were
under investigation at the end of the year, and that two practitioners and
two managers were convicted of criminal offences in the previous 12 months.
During the year, the service recommended withdrawal of the right to practise
from three of the insolvency practitioners which it regulates directly.
Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse and president of the Society of
Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading trade body, said: 'Regrettably the
profession has a small number of black sheep but it has accomplished a lot
to clean up its act.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Financial watchdog blames Brussels for wasted funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMBINATION of weak management, poor financial controls and fraud in
member states cost European Union taxpayers at least Ecu115m (Pounds 87.6m)
in 1992, according to a report published by the Court of Auditors yesterday.
The EU's financial watchdog criticises the European Commission for wasting
money in fisheries policy, aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, training programmes in east Germany and a multi-million pound
Euro-promotion exercise at the 1992 Olympic Games.
The UK and Germany, which are waging a campaign for tighter financial
controls on the EU budget, are likely to find plenty of ammunition in the
Court's 404-page report.
Waste, fraud and inefficiency continues to plague the Ecu36bn Common
Agricultural Policy which represents just over half of Brussels' annual
expenditure. The report identifies numerous areas where mismanagement and
inefficiency is endemic:
The cost of public storage of agricultural stocks such as cereals and milk
products was Ecu4.5bn in 1992. But the Commission was unable to produce any
records on how cereal prices were estimated.
High subsidies for milled rice exporters to the island of Reunion in the
Indian Ocean have cost taxpayers up to Ecu50m over the past five years, even
though supply has often outstripped demand on the French colony.
The EU spent Ecu232.7m on subsidising milk and dairy products for
schoolchildren, but only 11 per cent of the population under 19 benefit from
the measure.
The Court criticises 'unnecessary and inappropriate' humanitarian aid to
Russia, including the dispatch of 20,500 tonnes of rapeseed to Moscow and St
Petersburg when there was no demand for it.
Specific criticism is levelled at the Commission's decision to spend
Ecu12.5m to promote the idea of the EC as host of the 1992 Olympic Games at
Albertville and Barcelona. It also found irregularities in the way the
contract had been awarded to an advertising agency involved.
The report says the Commission paid a third of the costs of the opening
ceremony at Albertville and a half at Barcelona. But 'the idea of dual
loyalty on the part of athletes and of using the Community flag when medals
were being awarded came to nothing when some of the national Olympic
committees refused to participate'.

10m flood loss in Canada aside - prompted similar treatment. Having
out-performed the sector by 10 per cent over the past six months, and run up
to a 30 per cent premium to net assets, GA was heading for a fall. Such
volatility is the mark of a sector which has all the good news in the price.

<TEXT>
BAA has not quite perfected the art of the free lunch but the ability to
touch 80m captive airline passengers for a few quid each year and a lax
pricing regime for airport charges represents the next best thing. Though
regulated, BAA's return on capital must make many a utility company
director's eyes water. Yet the official price cap on BAA will ease further
over the next three years before a new regime is negotiated for 1997. BAA
will doubtless continue to plead for leniency given the need to spend some
Pounds 1bn on Heathrow's fifth terminal.
But even if the regulator grows aggressive, BAA could still emerge smiling,
since lower fees would only enhance Heathrow's appeal as an international
hub. Regulated activities also represent an ever diminishing proportion of
revenue, as the company continues its thrust into retailing. By 2000,
airport charges may account for as little as 20 per cent of income.
With UK passenger traffic growing by 4 per cent a year and expansion
opportunities emerging at overseas airports, BAA will remain one of the few
genuine growth stocks in the FT-SE 100 index. But regarded as a utility BAA
also has defensive appeal, which not even its curious pretensions to develop
factory outlet retailing malls can damage significantly.

De La Rue's impressive cash generation is not confined to the money spinning
from its printing presses. Circumstances have conspired to make the last
half particularly favourable. Yet the underlying rate of cash inflow is such
that the decision to tap shareholders for Pounds 160m two years ago looks
even odder now than it did at the time. The acquisitions which were to
follow Inter Innovation have yet to materialise, and idle talk of share
buy-backs only emphasises the embarrassment of riches which the company's
Pounds 200m cash pile has become. Still, the management's impressive track
record deserves some patience and negotiations to buy privately owned
businesses can be protracted. It would make little sense to return money to
shareholders now, only to ask for it back in two years' time.
There are two obvious areas for expansion. Privatisation of banknote
production in Europe could bring in useful extra revenue. Given the lukewarm
attitude of the Treasury and the Bank of England to market-testing their own
services, however, progress may well be slow. In any event, with banknote
production only growing slowly, such contracts would not solve the problem.
Currency-handling machinery is the longer term hope. Expansion there will
depend on how long it will be before the banks get fed up with paying clerks
large amounts to count money.

After such a gloomy report from Germany's five wise men, it is natural to
look for signs that the Bundesbank is taking more account of the domestic
economy when setting interest rates. In marking the D-Mark down yesterday,
the exchange market thought it had found one in the nine basis-point cut in
the central bank's money market repurchase rate. It may be jumping to
conclusions.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer has been fortunate in that inflation pressures have
lessened somewhat since he assumed the presidency and money supply growth is
within reach of this year's target. But that does not necessarily mean that
he is a softer touch than his predecessor or that inflation is no longer the
bank's chief concern. On average, the repurchase rate has fallen just four
basis points in each of the past three weeks. That is hardly throwing
caution to the winds.
The Bundesbank has, though, given other European countries leeway to cut
their own rates. Given the relative strength of consumer demand, UK rate
prospects probably still depend on the extent of budget tax increases, but
Denmark and Holland have cut rates this week. France may follow soon. The
question is whether the D-Mark recovers once other rates have adjusted. A
weakening currency would give the Bundesbank little incentive to lead the
way.

FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BOC under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC has become a victim of its own largesse. Its policy of announcing
dividends in advance seemed sensible during the 1980s, but low growth and
low inflation have caught the company on the hop. The pay-out has been
rising faster than trading performance justified. While that helped the
shares outperform through recession, the price was paid yesterday. An
unexpected break in BOC's 20-year record of dividend growth - the company
said next year's dividend will be unchanged - prompted another 5 per cent
fall in its already sickly shares. Perhaps announcing dividends in advance
is not such a good policy for the uncertain 1990s.
Yet dividend cover of 1.9 times should not cause boardroom headaches at the
bottom of a normal cycle. The dividend decision thus adds a further note of
caution to the profits warning of the summer. Despite its reputation as an
industrial bellwether, BOC has problems entirely its own. The collapse of
Forane, its main anaesthetic, has been severe since US patent protection
expired. Delays in introducing Suprane, the next generation anaesthetic,
have added to the pain. BOC is understandably worried that more generic
competitors could enter the fray. The big prize remains an upturn in
industrial gases, which account for 70 per cent of sales. But gases do not
rise early in the economic cycle. Other than slightly higher volumes in the
US, the outlook remains unclear. While BOC's prodigious cash generation
should limit the downside, it is difficult to discern the upside through the
fog.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Steel aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CRISIS in the European steel industry is coming to a head. Tomorrow the
European Union's Council of Ministers meets to decide whether to approve
hand-outs to state-owned steel companies in Italy, Germany and Spain. Today
the European Commission is due to agree its line for the meeting.
Both the Commission and governments from liberal states such as the UK,
Holland and Denmark should hang tough. State aid is distorting the steel
market by giving inefficient government-owned companies an unfair advantage
over efficient private-sector groups which are already suffering from a
severe recession. Moreover if subsidies are waved through without tight
conditions in this case, there is a danger of a knock-on effect in other
sectors, such as airlines, with the result that the whole single market
programme could be brought into disrepute.
The wrangle over steel subsidies has dragged on for almost a year. Over that
period, Mr Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, has sought to
cajole recalcitrant governments into scaling back their hand-outs and
closing loss-making mills. So far, he has reached deals with the Spanish and
German governments. This has involved compromises on both sides. The
Commission has provisionally approved more aid than competition purists
would have liked; the governments have had to face the unpopularity of
shutting factories.
But Mr Van Miert has been unable to cut a deal with Italy. The government
has said it will reduce the capacity of Ilva, its steel group, but not to
the equivalent extent agreed with Spain and Germany. Mr Paolo Savona, the
country's industry minister, has even threatened to go ahead without
Commission approval and fight the issue in the European Court of Justice.
The Commission must not slacken its resolve. Not only could further
concessions to Ilva undermine the deals with Germany and Spain. Liberal
countries, unhappy that the Commission has already compromised too much,
could veto the whole package.
If Italy can be brought into line without further concessions, the liberal
states should go along with the restructuring plan. Though far from ideal,
it would open the way for private sector steel groups to make matching
capacity cuts and so help restore the industry's health. But if more
compromises are made or Italy fails to reach agreement, other governments
should have no qualms about voting the package down.
Such toughness, of course, could mean there is no deal tomorrow. But no deal
would be better than a bad deal. It is also possible that Italy, faced with
the prospect of isolation, would draw back from the brink. If it does not, a
postponement of the council until next month might be necessary. Thereafter,
the Commission might have to use sanctions to resolve the deadlock.

he let slip last week to the Guardian, especially for saying that if
sterling were left out of a single European currency it might end up as
worthless as Ukrainian coupons, he acknowledged it was no use blaming the
press. 'They are mostly feckless, ill-informed and otherwise unemployable
people. One or two are parentally challenged. But you know all that before
you talk to them, so you get what you deserve.'
In this case, he conceded, the newspapers had actually been right. 'One of
my remarks reported at the end of last week, on the question of a single
currency, did upset government. So I would like to take this opportunity to
apologise to the Ukrainians for the unjustified slur I cast on the value of
their coupons.'

Just when staff at Coutts, NatWest's posh private bank, thought they had
heard their last ghost story along come reports that one Mr Angerstein has
been sighted flitting through Coutts' branch in the Lloyd's insurance
building.
Surely it could not be John Julius Angerstein, the father of Lloyd's and its
chairman between 1790 and 1796? But this time Coutts did not need to call in
the spook-busters for further inquiries revealed that the gentleman who had
been spotted was 31-year-old Joachim Angerstein, the great, great, great,
great nephew of John Julius. He works for the Essen branch of Dresdner Bank
and is taking part in a regular secondment programme arranged for high
flyers from the big German banks.
Which is all jolly convenient for NatWest Markets, whose temerity in
christening a new corporate capital vehicle the Angerstein Underwriting
Trust had not gone unnoticed.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Observer: Chile factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, may be one of the
cabinet's Eurosceptics. But no one can accuse him of being parochial. Take
the latest bee in his bonnet, about how Britain can learn a lot from Chile's
private sector pension arrangements.
Portillo was in Chile in July and seems to have been mightily impressed by
the state's encouragement of private sector pension schemes. Not only have
the funds ballooned in value, to more than Dollars 12.6bn, but they have
taught the Chilean people to take an interest in privatisation and financial
markets. Portillo was especially intrigued by the transparency of the
operations - the funds publish the value of their portfolios each day - and
the low cost of their operations.
However, Chile may not provide all the answers to Portillo's quest to limit
the future pension calls on Britain's welfare state. For a start, the funds
have yet to start paying out pensions on a significant scale, and Portillo
the politician might also have noted that Chile's pension reforms have not
done anything for the presidential chances of their ambitious architect -
Jose Pinera - currently trailing hopelessly in the opinion polls.

At the last moment the spelling mistake was spotted but not in time to order

At the town hall - now inhabited by BAC, a fringe theatre group - it was
decided that the show must go on, presumably in the hope that the PM would
not notice and the error could be corrected later.
Such spelling slackness might be permissible in a supposedly loony left

FT  17 NOV 93 / Personal View: Nafta a launch pad for Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERT ROSENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world truly has turned upside down. Thirty years ago, Latin American
governments were sternly admonished by their Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development counterparts to open their economies to world
trade and let the market work its wonders. The Latin Americans obstinately
stayed the course of import substitution, often behind excessively high
barriers of protection blended with state interventionism.
Today, the Latin American countries are the ones that are unilaterally
following trade liberalisation policies, combined with a greater respect for
the 'right prices', while many OECD countries indulge in various forms of
protectionism and maintain artificial prices for numerous agricultural
products.
Thirty years ago, the conventional wisdom was that developing countries
could not compete with the superior economies of scale and the technological
and organisational capacity of companies in the industrialised world. To
penetrate markets in developed economies, those countries demanded
non-reciprocal preferential treatment as the only way to diversify exports
away from basic commodities (agricultural and mineral): the General System
of Preferences was hailed in Latin America as a big breakthrough in the
rules that govern the international trading system.
Today, most Latin American countries have joined the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, and those that have not are in the process of doing so.
Demands for non-reciprocal preferential treatment are no longer in fashion,
since unilateral liberalisation has, in fact, imposed on the region's
companies the imperative of competing in the world market. Today, rather, we
hear voices in highly developed countries claiming that their own companies
cannot compete with low-cost labour and standards or permissive
environmental rules, or even alleged or real comparative advantages which
they attribute to developing countries. Never mind that developed countries
lead the way in the comparative advantages that really matter in world trade
today - capacity to innovate, to adapt and to organise. The opponents of a
more open international trading system seem to fear the comparative
advantages that weigh less and less in world trade, primarily the cost of
labour.
The North American Free Trade Agreement is, among other things, a testing
ground for this profound change in north-south perceptions regarding
competitiveness and trade policies.
Neither Mexican nor US nor Canadian authorities view the arrangement as a
substitute or stumbling block for the international trading system sought in
the Uruguay Round, but rather as a complement or a building block. For that
reason, the agenda and the procedures of Nafta closely parallel those of the
multilateral trade negotiations.
The distance covered by Mexico, from resisting even the suggestion in the
early 1980s that it join Gatt to forming part of a free trade zone with the
US and Canada in 1993, is nothing short of mind-boggling.
Contrary to what could reasonably be expected, Mexican companies' opposition
first to unilateral trade liberalisation and then to joining Nafta has been
mild. In contrast, North Americans have been alerted to the 'giant sucking
sound' of Mexico's comparative advantages drawing productive activities away
from their northern neighbours, and important constituencies have been
mobilised in opposition to Nafta. Rationality dictates that, while there
will be winners and losers on both sides of the border, in the end all
parties will be better off, thanks to the improved allocation of resources
and enhanced growth promoted by freer trade. Opponents of the agreement
score points by focusing only on the losers and on the short term.
What is at stake from the Latin American perspective is enormous. Numerous
Latin American countries are standing in the wings, waiting to join what
they perceive as an important building block for a more open international
trading system. Failure to ratify the treaty would mean not only a missed
opportunity for greater prosperity in Canada, the US and Mexico -
admittedly, at the cost of short-term disruptions for all concerned - but
would also signal an unwillingness on the part of the electorate of the
world's most important economic player to move closer to the international
trading system envisaged in the original objectives of the Uruguay Round.
That would be a sad day not only for Mexico, and even all of Latin America,
but also for the global community of nations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW SMALL is a minimum nuclear deterrent? After months pondering the
appropriate level of armament for its new Trident submarines, the British
government has come up with an enigmatic formula. Its decision to keep the
total explosive power in line with that deployed on its ageing Polaris
submarines is meant to deliver a political message, without revealing
anything about either system in terms of actual warhead numbers or
megatonnage of destructive force.
As a gesture, the self-limitation policy is logical and timely. To have
pressed ahead with anything like the full potential of Trident, ordered
during the cold war, would have left the UK out on a limb with China as the
only recognised nuclear powers actively strengthening their arsenals while
the US and Russia embark on deep cuts in their nuclear stockpiles.
Good faith by the nuclear powers in curbing their armouries will be crucial
for hopes of securing renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty - perhaps the
most important of all arms control pacts - in 1995. A complete ban on
nuclear testing, which the UK has come around to supporting, could also have
considerable symbolic effect.
Sound arguments can still be made for keeping nuclear weapons. They are
integral to the Nato security structure, part of the Nato bargain being that
the US does not bear the nuclear burden alone. Britain and France may also
have good reasons for keeping forces as a hedge against future upsets - a
return of east-west confrontation or a direct threat from a new nuclear
state.
But clarity is needed. Do nuclear weapons have a purpose other than as a
counter to a would-be nuclear aggressor? Their wider role as preventers of
war - one which they can be held to have performed in Europe for over 40
years - is untested and questionable outside the context of the bipolar
east-west stand-off. They do not seem to deter Galtieris or Saddams. It is
doubtful whether nuclear arms can effectively deter the use of chemical or
biological weapons. Would an aggressor really believe he was risking nuclear
reprisal? Nor does the existence of nuclear arms stop countries such as
North Korea from seeking their own nuclear weapons, or - in the case of
Ukraine with the leftover Soviet weaponry on its territory - from holding on
to them.
The nuclear priority must now be just that - to stop proliferation. There
needs to be a shift in the balance between long-held defence doctrines and
the foreign policy objective of widening and strengthening the
non-proliferation regime. Existing nuclear forces should be reduced as far
as prudently possible, made as safe as possible and kept at lower states of
readiness: and transparency should be increased. It is difficult to insist
that other countries open themselves to inspection while refusing to be more
open about one's own weapons.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: The people need persuading - Russia's
election campaign is off to a good start with a wide range of political
views on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian election campaign resembles a contest between ardent suitors for
the hand of virgin voters. Both sides are new to the game of wooing. The
battle is turning into an impressive display of debate and argument, as
people size up how far the candidates can fulfill their hopes and
calculations.
This does not come naturally. A people long told that only unanimity was
acceptable has more than a few tremors about political division, while the
discrediting of party politics, common to all post-communist societies,
makes candidates defensive about their ambitions and vague about their
programmes.
But it is, raucously, under way. Some 13 parties, covering the left-right
spectrum much more fully than in more settled democracies, are now
registered and their chosen runners and supporters are on the stump. The
only notable political absence is that of a hardline nationalist party: Mr
Sergei Baburin's Russian National Union was disqualified for non-compliance
with the registration requirements (though he wants to be selected as a
candidate in his home town of Omsk). But since all the other parties -
especially the Communist party of Russia - stress the need for nationalist
revival, it cannot be said that the idea itself lacks expression.
Some parts of the written press are lively and varied. Izvestiya, the most
prestigious of the post-Soviet papers, is firmly pro-Yeltsin and for the
liberal Russia's Choice bloc of Mr Yegor Gaidar; others are as vociferously
against. Pravda, back on the news-stands, is solidly anti-Yeltsin and still
claims national coverage; papers such as Trud and Selskaya Zhizn, serving
union members and farm-workers respectively, are at best sceptical of the
authorities; and of the new upmarket papers, Nezavisimaya Gazeta is
increasingly sharply critical.
Television, the dominant medium, does not show such diversity of opinion. Mr
Vyacheslav Bragin, chairman of the main state channel, Ostankino, is a
candidate for Russia's Choice and is wholly a Yeltsin man. Mr Oleg Poptsov
of Russian TV, the other main state-owned channel, is less so, but says he
is under constant pressure to conform to the government line.
A bulletin on Russian TV last week, chosen as a random example, illustrates
the problem. It began with a piece on the new constitution, the text of
which had been published that day. The accompanying voice told the story of
a document replete with citizens' rights and advantages, while under the
commentary, a gentle musical theme swelled. It could have been a commercial.
The danger is only in part an overweening political establishment which has
placemen at the top of television. This control rests upon a profession
which has insufficient regard for itself as a separate estate. TV still gets
little of its support from advertising and most papers (including Pravda)
depend on subsidies. Further, the psychology of journalists over 30 was
formed in Soviet times, when freedom had a very low ceiling - even the best
editors are grateful to a president who has brought them out of servitude.
As a result, the themes of the campaign remain insufficiently clarified.
Grand statements and allegations surface like spouting whales, then submerge
unchallenged.
But the themes, and the personalities around which they are entwined, are
clear enough. The party which is the nearest to being the governing party -
Russia's Choice - campaigns on a continuation of reforms as essential both
for a fight against inflation, now at about 20 per cent a month, and, as Mr
Gaidar put it recently, to close the widening gap between rich and poor.
Every other party, including those which proclaim themselves as pro-market,
argue that it is precisely the policies pursued by Mr Gaidar which create
inflation and the gap between rich and poor.
Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, a leader of the group Civic Union for Stability,
Fairness and Progress, said that his group - backed by Russia's industrial
lobby - stood for 'therapy without the shock': he has not been the first nor
the only politician to use the phrase. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the
Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin group, says that 'it is useless to try for tight
money policies while property is not widely dispersed and the economy is
dominated by monopolies'. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord, led by
deputy premier Sergei Shakhrai, tempers its support for further market
reforms with a promise to develop 'an active industrial policy, directed to
the support of branches and enterprises able to become the locomotives of
economic growth'.
Where Yeltsin/Gaidar policies have been blamed for weakening the sinews of
the state, all the opposition parties in different ways pledge their
commitment to strengthening these again. Some, especially the Civic Union
and the Communists, cast more than a glance at the former Soviet Union and
pledge an active policy of reforging the links between the republics. Where
Yeltsin/Gaidar are seen to have weakened Russian power by an overharsh dose
of market reform, the other parties propose a strengthening of the state -
consonant, of course, with the widest development of civil rights.
The publication of the constitution, and Mr Yeltsin's ambiguous withdrawal
of his promise to stand in elections for president on June 12 next year, are
gifts for the opposition. Mr Yavlinsky, himself a declared candidate for the
presidency, is particularly scathing about Mr Yeltsin's apparent decision to
serve his full term to 1996. The Communist party, ably led by Mr Gennady
Zyuganov, has accused Mr Yeltsin of giving himself more powers than 'tsars
or pharaohs' - a deliberate if breathtakingly impudent attempt to tar Mr
Yeltsin with the brush of reaction.
Polls reveal a country confused and as yet far from convinced by anyone.
Russia's Choice routinely scores the highest approval rating: but in a
recent Moscow poll it received 37 per cent of the vote and the Communist
Party 26 per cent. Mr Zyuganov said last week that he aimed to 'unite the
patriotic forces' - a bid for the supporters of Mr Baburin's banned Russian
National Union, many of whom would naturally tend towards the Communists.
Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and himself a broadly pro-Yeltsin
candidate in the Movement for Democratic Reform, said that 'the likelihood
is for a parliamentary mosaic of parties, none of which dominate, which
turns out like the first Polish parliament where they couldn't agree on
electing a prime minister'.
Mr Genady Burbulis, a founder-candidate of Russia's Choice and a former
first deputy premier, sees a similar danger - with the
Communists-nationalists making a strong showing. An internal government
paper, published by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, produced figures of 30-33 per cent
for Russia's Choice, 33-36 per cent for the centrist parties like those of
Mr Yavlinsky, Mr Shakhrai, Mr Sobchak and Civic Union; and 15-20 per cent
for the hardline opposition, led by the Communists.
There is no doubt that Mr Gaidar faces real opposition. Unable to canvass
properly because of his government duties he carries the load of past
unpopular policies. Temperamentally unable to put on a populist act, Mr
Gaidar and his colleagues have considerable disadvantages to set against
their undoubted advantages in the media and among the elite.
If Russia's Choice does well, however, he can claim the premiership: if not,
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the present prime minister, a man whose stature has
grown in the country, will probably be asked to continue. Shrewdly, he chose
to declare himself as merely an honest public servant above all politics and
is not standing for election.
Three weeks from Sunday, Russia will make her choice for a free parliament,
the first time the country has been able to exercise such a right in more
than three-quarters of a century. The political atmosphere is still fragile
and tense - it is, after all, only six weeks since tanks were shelling the
last parliament. But the signs are good.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Leading Article: All change for Italian banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER MORE THAN a year of delay, the strategy behind Italy's banking
privatisations is now clear. Disposals of state shares in the country's
banks are starting with the sale of the state holding company's 67 per cent
stake in Credito Italiano. Once liberated from state control, Italian banks
will be able to play a much more effective role as traders and shareholders
in stocks of other companies to be privatised later.
If the exercise goes according to plan, it should provide an important force
for change in a banking industry which has been long shielded from
competition. It will produce a welcome increase in overall Italian equity
capitalisation. And it will bring in much-needed receipts for the
administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who is struggling to maintain
ambitious deficit-cutting policies in the face of a recession-induced fall
in tax revenue.
With every week that passes, government regrets must be increasing that
privatisation did not start sooner. After a sharp fall in the Milan stock
market since August, the sales are starting at an unpropitious moment. Both
Credito and Banca Commerciale Italiana, scheduled for sell-off next spring,
claim their profitability has increased this year. But after trebling in the
four months after Italy's ERM exit in September 1992, Credito's share price
has fallen by one-third this year. Financial market uncertainties are likely
to increase as the countdown gets under way to new elections, probably next
spring, which are intended to find replacements for a political class
discredited by scandals.
In view of the Italian authorities' overwhelming determination to make the
Credito launch a success, and the bank's heavy exposure to the troubled
Ferruzzi group, the shares are certain to be sold at a heavy discount. After
the failure of initial efforts to sell Credito to a domestic or foreign
institution, the government is trying to encourage interest from retail
investors through a vigorously-marketed public offering. Although individual
shareholders' stakes are being limited to 3 per cent, some institutions may
form alliances to build a collective controlling stake. This would increase
the likelihood of secure placement. But it would also run counter to Mr
Ciampi's sensible objective of wider share owner-ship.
Even after the Credito sale, longer-term prospects for the banking industry
will remain cloudy. New, non-political leaders will be needed. Relatively
high profitability will fall as competition increases. Consolidation of
Italy's large number of regional banks, coupled with the relaxation of
traditionally tight controls on branch opening, will lead to a smaller
number of institutions with a wider spread of activities. During the next
decade, the banks will play a crucial role in dismantling the apparatus of
public sector corporatism of which they hitherto formed a part. The
sell-offs under preparation are the first stage in a long journey.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Alternative to pensions privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID MILIBAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Stephens is right to point out that the privatisation of
pensions, floated by Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
raises as many questions as it answers ('The National Insurance fiction',
November 11). Not least of these is the problem of one generation (probably
mine) being asked to pay twice - for our parents and for ourselves. He does
not, however, mention that reform is necessary now to prevent contributory
benefits withering away.
Today, only three out of every 10 jobless people actually receive
unemployment benefit. A similar proportion of women receive the full
national insurance pension on the basis of their own contributions.
As the first in a series of 'issue papers' published by the Commission on
Social Justice pointed out last week, the rigid structure of national
insurance - based on a fiction about bread-winning fathers and caring
mothers - is at odds with our flexible labour market and variegated family
structure.
The status quo is not an option. But privatisation is not the only
alternative. Radical reform of National Insurance to preserve its ideals -
security, universality, fairness - is possible, but only if we match the
system more closely to the realities of economic and social life today.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Beggar your neighbour: The big chill faces those who depend
on state welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB TYRRELL and CHARLOTTE CORNISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of the welfare state in advanced economies over the past 40 years
has reflected the social and political priorities of the post-war period.
Increased welfare provision was seen as a grand egalitarian gesture after
the privations of the second world war, part of creating a more just
society. But by mitigating the human cost of economic change, it was also a
form of social investment in building successful and stable economies.
That vision has been blurred, however, by changes in the social and
political environment which have come with intensified global competition
and the growing problems of national economies. Today, the welfare state
sits beleaguered - increasingly shunned by those who can afford private
provision and resented by those who have no choice but to use its services.
Support for the welfare state has been undermined by two factors. The first
is the gradual increase in affluence, which has changed the balance between
those whose interests are served by collectivism and those whose interests
are served by private solutions. The second is the increasing cost of social
security benefits as economic growth has faltered and unemployment has
risen. In many western economies, this cost has been further amplified by
the erosion of family and community forms of social support.
The loss of support for collectivism can be traced in popular resistance to
paying higher taxes which developed in the 1970s, initially in the US, and
spread through the advanced economies. This resistance developed into
'scrounger phobia' in the early 1980s, with attacks on a culture of
dependency supposedly encouraged by the nanny state.
As income tax regimes have become less progressive, the rhetoric of politics
has altered. The Christian ethic and socialist idealism behind the modern
welfare state proclaimed an inclusive vision of society, a belief in the
possibility of redemption for everyone. Now, talk of winners and losers as
the natural state of affairs is more common. In the harsher economic climate
of the 1990s, the idea of irredeemably evil people has been resurrected,
with the invention of new categories of 'deviants', such as irresponsible
single parents, who ought to be excluded from welfare support.
At the same time, people have become less secure about their financial
position, as the two charts show. Until as recently as five years ago,
Europeans typically expected their income and expenditure to vary over their
lives in the smooth and predictable pattern shown in the first chart. The
much more volatile pattern of income and expenditure in the second chart is
likely to be perceived as the norm today.
This loss of economic security and confidence has undermined public support
for collectivist welfare policies. The Planning for Social Change survey
produced by the Henley Centre, a marketing and strategic planning
consultancy, reveals a dramatic change in views on the most effective way of
improving the quality of life in Britain. Those polled are asked to choose
between two options:
'Looking after our own interests, which ultimately raises standards for
everyone'.
'Looking after the community's interests rather than your own'.
There has been a steady move away from the first 'Thatcherite' answer
towards the second collectivist option between 1986 and 1991. But, as the
recession continued and unemployment increased, support moved back to
putting the individual's interests first, and this had become the majority
choice by 1993.
This move away from collectivism has been described by Stewart Lansley
(After the Goldrush, forthcoming from Century) as 'competitive
individualism'. It holds that people cannot afford to be other than
self-interested. Taxpayers increasingly feel that they cannot afford to pay
higher taxes because they need the income to keep themselves out of the
unacceptably low-quality public services such as health, transport,
education, or to maintain their security from crime. This corrodes support
for the welfare state.
The rise of competitive individualism also undermines the ability of other
bodies to assume some burdens of the welfare state. Even the family, where
co-operation was the norm, has been touched by greater individualism.
One symptom of this is the increase in divorce and rise in numbers of
lone-parent families across the western world. In the UK, with one of the
highest divorce rates in Europe, one in three first marriages ends in
divorce and one in five families is headed by a lone parent. While this may
have many causes, it is arguable that the increase in lone-parent families
reflects a decline in individuals' willingness to subordinate their
interests even to the collective unit of the nuclear family.
Another symptom is changing consumption patterns. The duplication of
consumer durables such as TVs and cars within households allows greater
freedom from the uniformities that might otherwise be imposed by family
decisions. The most recent generation of durables, such as the video
recorder and the microwave oven, seem almost to have been designed to appeal
to the family that no longer plays together.
Even with more mundane products such as shampoo, butter and breakfast
cereals, individual family members seem to prefer to make their own choices.
The household product that all the family uses is becoming a rarity.
Economic and social changes such as these make it harder for societies to
cope with demographic change expected over the next generation. People are
less willing to contribute towards rising welfare spending resulting from
the ageing of the population. Yet there are fewer alternatives to state
support for the old and other disadvantaged groups.
In many countries concern over exploding pensioner populations has cast a
cloud over expectations of an idyllic 'third age' for the next generation of
senior citizens. In Germany it began in 1989, when actuarial reports to the
government rang alarm bells about the costs of supporting rising pensioner
populations in the next 20 years. Employees' social insurance contributions
were increased, the retirement age was raised and the level of pensions was
reduced.
Elsewhere, particularly where pension systems are based on state
pay-as-you-go schemes, concerns are now mounting. In France, a recent report
estimated that the state pension fund would be in deficit to the tune of
FFr300bn (Pounds 34.3bn) by 2010 compared to FFr20bn today. Similar analyses
in Spain, Greece and Italy have come to the same conclusion: more of the
costs of tomorrow's elderly populations must be paid for today whilst their
expectations of universal and rising benefits must be moderated.
Underlying this conclusion is the assumption that social and economic change
have made it impossible for the state to assume increasing responsibilities
in the way that seemed natural until quite recently.
At the same time, the ability of other bodies, such as the family, to take
these on is hardly reassuring. New responses may well emerge from the
family, or new institutional forms may fill the gap.
For those with the skills to qualify as core employees, the extension of
corporate welfare may offer a lifeline. The US communitarian movement has
advocated new community organisations to provide local support.
But for those who must rely on the welfare state, the world is becoming a
colder, harsher place in the social and political conditions of the 1990s.

a senior analyst.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sick pay a tax on employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G W BURNDRED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am appalled to read the biased reporting in your article 'Treasury
set to force severe cuts in sick pay subsidy' (November 12). You write
blandly of the 'subsidy' given to employers and the possibility of that
'subsidy' being reduced from 80 per cent to 60 per cent.
May I remind your readers that statutory sick pay was a burden placed upon
employers a few years ago and that, initially, employers were recompensed by
the government for the administration costs of making what amounts to social
security payments on their behalf.
Statutory sick pay is now a tax on employers.
Perhaps with a more factual approach to such reports, your newspaper might
avoid preparing such an easy path for the government to impose yet further
taxation on industry.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: IMF to fund Russia on performance,
not promises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN ODLING-SMEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jeffrey Sachs asserts ('IMF 'is missing its big chance' ', November 11)
that the International Monetary Fund 'was told this year to spend USDollars
13bn on Russian reform'. As an adviser to the Russian government, Sachs
should know that the IMF was not 'told' to do anything of the sort. The main
industrial countries said publicly this year that if economic reform and
stabilisation in Russia proceeded in line with agreed targets, the IMF could
make available Dollars 13bn to Russia. But Russia did not implement its
stabilisation plans - for example, inflation continues to run at an annual
rate of more than 1,000 per cent.
The disbursement of IMF funds must be linked to actual performance and not
merely, as Sachs seems to imply, to hopes and promises.
Sachs complains that the IMF is not 'now negotiating with the Russians'. In
fact, the IMF staff have been, and continue to be, in close contact with
senior Russian officials in Moscow, and are discussing in detail the
measures needed to achieve financial stabilisation and reform.
As in the past, we stand ready to agree on the further use of IMF resources
as soon as the Russian authorities as a whole are in a position to commit
themselves to and implement, on a sustained basis, a strong adjustment
programme.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: European unemployment crisis and
monetary policy inseparable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAN-PETER OLTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Saying that the ''real issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing
unemployment' is - as far as I can see it - virtually unchallenged ('Pohl
sees jobs crisis as main European task', November 11). I do not see the
European unemployment crisis as separate from a common and co-ordinated
European monetary policy. The argument is two-fold.
First, a monetary union has never been a goal per se. It has been decided
upon as an instrument to reduce exchange rate risks and foster trade.
Increased trade, in turn, will help to create additional jobs.
Second, the options that governments have to reduce unemployment are very
limited, almost non-existent: a traditional Keynesian-style fiscal stimulus
programme might, faced with high public debts and deficits, be an
ill-advised policy or simply impossible. The same argument basically applies
to tax-reduction proposals. Expansive monetary policy, as undertaken in
North America, stops in Frankfurt. Labour market deregulating policies, at
least as long as they translate into an erosion of real wages, will
constrain aggregate demand even further.
So, why not exploit the few remaining options Europe still has? Analysing
the common-currency debate in light of the European unemployment crisis
leads to the recommendation to speed up the process to Emu rather than to
slow it down. A common monetary policy should remain the main priority.

Sir, How much noise Bill Cash (Letters, November 13/14) and his parish pump

defending the best interests of the people of the UK. It is high time that
people making the wealth turned and told them that they do no such thing.
The truth is that our economic and political future lies within Europe.
Millions are toiling to make jobs and wealth in a large but keenly
competitive market. They see the opportunities and work hard to turn them
into profit. But people like Mr Cash seek to cripple us and suppress our
commercial urges. Any fool but he realises that the European Union makes our
job easier. The only sovereignty he seeks to protect is the right to sit in
a parliament which grants itself extravagantly self-indulgent pay rises and
makes no-hoper MPs feel important. He is a pest, he is wrong and he should
be told in plain Anglo-Saxon terms to shut up or go away.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Peace role in pieces: Peacekeeping and military intervention
have become indistinguishable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago, we all thought we knew what 'peacekeeping' meant. If two
warring parties agreed to a ceasefire, a peacekeeping force was sent in,
usually by the UN, to help them observe it.
This happened in the third world. Peacekeeping was not required in Europe
unless you count Cyprus. Peace in Europe was kept by the mutual deterrence
of two heavily armed alliances, each dominated by a nuclear superpower.
Peacekeeping was an instrument the superpowers used to contain conflicts on
the periphery of their spheres of influence, so as to lessen the risk that
they themselves would become directly involved. Consequently they did not
contribute troops of their own.
All in all, peacekeeping was rather small beer. In 1987 the UN had only five
peacekeeping missions on foot, deploying a total of 10,000 personnel at a
cost of Dollars 233m. It was not something a serious military organisation
such as Nato would bother with.
How times have changed. Today peacekeeping is all the rage, especially in
Europe. Both the US and Russia have contributed troops to UN peacekeeping
forces. And Nato is very much interested, seeing peacekeeping as one
activity which can occupy its formidable staff of military planners, and
indeed justify its continued existence, now that its original raison d'etre
has gone.
But no one knows any longer what peacekeeping is. Most of the 13 current UN
peacekeeping missions, on which 75,000 troops are now deployed at a cost of
Dollars 3bn, involve tasks well beyond those of 'classic' peacekeeping, such
as monitoring or organising elections, aid to refugees and disaster victims,
demobilisation of forces, collection of weapons, and disarmament of
paramilitary or irregular units.
In an excellent survey of the subject published last month* Mats Berdal, a
research associate at the International Institute of Strategic Studies,
points out that peacekeeping forces now have to operate in much less
'permissive' environments than in the past. Instead of states with effective
control of their territory and armed forces, peacekeeping forces find
themselves confronting 'myriad paramilitary groups, militias and
'uncontrolled' elements', which frequently ignore ceasefires negotiated by
their nominal superiors. Thus although in theory peacekeeping, as distinct
from armed intervention, still requires the consent of the warring parties,
in practice 'only partial or sporadic consent obtains'.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, was aware of this problem
last year when he drafted his 'agenda for peace'. He described peacekeeping
as a 'technique' which could contribute both to preventing conflict and to
peacemaking, and defined it as 'the deployment of a UN presence in the
field, hitherto with the consent of all the parties concerned'.
Similarly, Nato has now produced a 'draft doctrine for peace support
operations', of which peacekeeping 'narrowly defined' is only one member.
And even in that narrow definition, 'consent of the parties' has
disappeared. Peacekeeping, according to Nato, 'is the containment,
moderation and/or termination of hostilities between or within states,
through the medium of an impartial third party intervention, organised and
directed internationally, using military forces, and civilians to complement
the political process of conflict resolution and to restore and maintain
peace'.
Nato uses the phrase 'conflict prevention' for activities under Chapter VI
of the UN Charter, which deals with 'pacific settlement of disputes'. It
uses the word 'peacemaking' for diplomatic actions, up to and including
sanctions, which are 'conducted after the commencement of conflict, with the
aim of establishing a peaceful settlement'; whereas 'peace enforcement', in
Nato's vocabulary, involves using military means to restore peace, as
provided for in Article 43 of the UN Charter.
This is confusing, because Mr Boutros-Ghali, who coined the phrase 'peace
enforcement', had distinguished it from use of force under Article 43. His
proposed 'peace enforcement units' would be sent, as a 'provisional measure'
under Article 40, to 'restore and maintain' a ceasefire which had been
'agreed to but not complied with'.
To make matters even more confusing, Mr Boutros-Ghali included both types of
enforcement under the heading of 'peacemaking', even though he defined this
as 'action to bring hostile parties to agreement, essentially through such
peaceful means as those foreseen in Chapter VI'.
Clearly the key difference between peacekeeping and enforcement is that the
former is supposed to be impartial, whereas the latter involves taking
sides. But the distinction is getting blurred.
In Bosnia the UN 'protection force' is still trying to behave impartially,
in spite of UN sanctions against Serbia, and has therefore failed to act on
Security Council resolutions authorising it to use force to get supplies
through to suffering civilians. In Somalia, by contrast, the mandate of the
UN force referred specifically to Chapter VII of the charter, and the UN
force found itself involved in clashes with one of the Somali factions. It
is probably inaccurate to call it a peacekeeping force at all.
The result of all this confusion is that UN soldiers anywhere are becoming
less and less credible either as impartial peacekeepers or as enforcers of
Security Council decisions. The matter should be clarified without delay.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: The trouble with Berkoff . . . - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steven Berkoff is one great rampant ego. His energy is terrific, and every
scrap of it is ploughed into showing off. Both in motion and in speech, he
draws maximum attention to his own method of performance. Yet the more you
attend to the way he performs, the harder it becomes to take in what he is
performing. His current solo show, One Man - which has just opened (after
its Edinburgh Festival Fringe outing) at the Garrick - consists of three
different 'acts'. In none of them, however, has his style any depth. All is
flashy, over-elaborate surface.
Berkoff's art is one of cartoon-like over-emphasis. The point of his
sketches, like Monty Python's, is that they go into overkill. But no Python
performer was ever so self-regarding or relentlessly cynical as this. One of
this evening's three sketches is The Actor, in which, like a failed actor
keeping fit, he jogs into a whirlpool: a non-stop downward spiral of going
to auditions, ringing his agent, losing his wife, visiting his parents,
meeting fellow-actors and bitching about those in employment behind their
backs. Parts of the audience are amused by this far from original vision of
an actor's life as an endless round of malice, hypocrisy, envy, and panic.
The dominant impression, however, is of the non-stop jogging-on-the-spot
many-voiced virtuosity that Berkoff expends on it. His combination of
technical bravura and spite is loathsome.
Worse is the version of Edgar Allen Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart which forms
the evening's opening half. Here Berkoff embroiders Poe's narration of
furtive but gruesome murder and paranoia with an endless array of
actorliness. He changes voice and accent several times in mid-sentence; he
repeats the word 'stealthily' seven times while (a) diminishing it into
silence (b) exaggerating the oral gesture of saying it; he demonstrates 20
different ways of laughing (in series); and so forth. When a police siren is
heard outside the theatre, he incorporates that too into his act - with such
relish, and in such a studied way, that you realise he welcomes such
intrusions as a way of showing off further.
Dog, with which Berkoff closes this programme, is the least irritating. Here
he is a lager lout and his killer mastiff; and here at last his cartoon-type
method has some comic success - mainly in the throttled rage with which he
invests the dog. As long as he is busy alternating between personae, Dog
keeps Berkoff out of his usual love of excess. But here too there are
passages when Berkoff paints the lily, then gilds it, and finally then
shoves knobs on it. These occur when Berkoff cannot suppress his naturally
adolescent love of gruesomeness - as when he mimes vomiting until he mimes
swimming through his own vomit; or (in Tell-Tale Heart) when he mimes
hacking through each different fibre of the corpse. All that energy, and all
of it pumping into a form of self-display both decadent (in its love of
excess) and immature.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Series in search of cult status - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Still they come, the new series for the autumn season; not just fresh series
of old titles, but genuinely new series: Wild Palms, The Great Depression,
The Talking Show, Blood And Belonging and If You See God, Tell Him.
Remembering the long doldrums of the summer, does this really seem like a
sensible arrangement? The broadcasters tell us that they save all their best
(well, newest and most expensive) series for the autumn and winter because
we watch so much less in the summer. But what do they expect if they save up
all the rubbish and show it in the summer: of course we watch less.
Wild Palms which began on BBC2 on Monday, comes to us described as 'a second
Twin Peaks' which will seem ominous to anybody who found the David Lynch
series too long and in the end too clever by half. Furthermore, having seen
Wild Palms do rather badly in the US, its producers - who include Oliver
Stone - are looking to the British to give it at least a succes d'estime.
This is becoming something of a habit. Series such as Cheers have acquired
'cult status' in Britain after a poor start in America, and the British
reputation has then been used in the US to justify the production of further
series.
Perhaps that will happen with Wild Palms, but I doubt it. What we have here
is a slickly directed series, full of the atmosphere of menace, the
anachronistic costumes (stand-up collars and collar studs in the year 2007 -
does it seem likely to you?) and the bizarre non sequiturs which have always
characterised fantasy series on television. Patrick McGoohan showed the way
26 years ago with The Prisoner which was shot in Portmeirion where a man who
drove a classic sports car was held against his will by a mysterious
organisation that called people by numbers and sent out a huge opaque globe
to chase escapers. Years earlier, in The Avengers, we had seen how classic
sports cars and old fashioned clothes could be combined with a sense of
threat to produce the feeling of a lopsided alternative universe.
In Wild Palms there is a rhinoceros in the empty swimming pool, sure enough
the hero drives a classic sports car, and there is that familiar feeling of
a sinister force behind the story of a television company which is moving
into inter-active virtual reality. The trouble is that, as with The
Prisoner, the drama does not really seem to have anything significant to
tell us, about the past or the future or, come to that, the present.
Moreover, it is so busy being mystifying and studiously weird that the story
is almost impossible to follow. That leaves you with little more than a
sense of style, and strong though it is, it is not enough to sustain
interest on its own.
Much the most impressive new American offering is The Great Depression, a
classic documentary series of a sort which, five years ago, we might have
thought would never again be made in the US. Then came The Civil War, a
superb piece of work which rightly won awards all over the world. Now (on
BBC2 on Saturday evenings immediately before the admirable 'Performance'
studio dramas which this week gave us the first performance of The Maitlands
in 60 years; not a great play but one well worth seeing) here is a series
which brings a strikingly graphic quality to the events of the slump.
This week's programme with its accounts of bank robber Charles 'Pretty Boy'
Floyd, and the 'bonus marchers' - veterans of the first world war demanding
promised bonus payments from the government - and the manner in which the
demonstrators were eventually evicted from Washington, proved again what the
BBC's recent Thatcher series showed: that no book can match the movie camera
for vividness in reporting modern history. True, this programme was
particularly striking because so much of the footage, instead of being grey
and rainy, looked as though it had been shot last week, albeit in black and
white, but it is not solely a matter of technical quality. To see MacArthur,
Patton and Eisenhower as young army officers, and in particular to watch
MacArthur's body language as they drove the starving men out of the city,
was eye opening.
On the other hand The Talking Show is a series which, however good it may
have seemed at the discussion stage, should never have been allowed to reach
the screen. No doubt the producers said 'We've never had a television series
about the human voice - you know, accents, public speaking, conversation,
everything', but perhaps there are good reasons. Sandy Toksvig, the
presenter, is an excellent comedian, but that is scarcely what is needed
here, and the idea of trying to distract us from the programme's
shortcomings by laying disco beat over most of the soundtrack is a disaster.
It might have worked better as a radio series, though even then it would
have needed radical re-thinking.
On Blood And Belonging we shall have to wait before reaching a firm
conclusion. The idea of having Michael Ignatieff investigate the resurgence
of nationalism by globe-trotting through some of the worst affected areas
seems sensible enough. He has proved himself an excellent conductor of
studio discussions, admirably free of the urge suffered by so many
television journalists to go tabloid and talk down to the viewers. Given his
background (born in Canada of Russian parents with a childhood in Yugoslavia
and recent years in the UK with its Northern Ireland problem) he would seem
ideally suited to such a series.
Yet the opening episode was rather less than enlightening. We watched
Ignatieff's profile as he drove down a road perforated with borders musing
'Is it ever going to be possible for Serbs and Croats to live together
again? I don't know . . . It's so difficult to understand . . .' He asked a
couple of Croats 'What do you feel when you look out that way and you see
Serbs on Croatian territory?' and was told 'It hurts, it hurts'. He picked
over the detritus of a smashed concentration camp museum and wandered
through other ruins. It all looked awfully like the places where Martin Bell
has been filming since the whole ghastly business began. We can hardly blame
Ignatieff if the honest conclusion is that it is all depressing and
virtually hopeless, but if we wanted astute analysis of the roots and sprigs
of nationalism we might have done better to keep him behind a studio table.
The most entertaining of the week's new programmes was clearly the BBC1
comedy If You See God Tell Him which lasted 45 minutes instead of 30, had no
laughter track, and starred Richard Briers and Imelda Staunton. This is one
of those comedies that rest on a single idea: in this instance, Briers
(Godfrey Spry, hence God) is hit on the head by a load of builders' rubble
and as a consequence becomes entirely credulous, believing every word of
every advertising campaign. He test drives cars along clifftops at sunset,
crunches crisps all through his wife's funeral, and visits his bank manager
convinced that he will be allowed to borrow a million pounds. Briers is
splendid in the role, and the running gag held up strongly throughout the
opening episode; the only question is whether it can sustain three more.
Since producer/director Marcus Mortimer is having a wonderful time making
marvellously accurate spoof television commercials, the answer may well be
yes.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Too much buzz about Wasps - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers are people who help you get what is coming to them. They have long
been satirised, and nowhere better than in Aristophanes' Wasps, now at The
Place Theatre. The production makes a gloriously energetic and confused hash
of the original, but manages in parts to be so enjoyable that it matters
little that the
catch-all satire fails to catch very much.
The action centres on Procleon, an old juror devoted to the Athenian system
of civil courts. In this litigious society where the
greatest power is the power of the attorney, he basks in his position as
civil arbiter, 'it makes mere wealth pale by comparison.' His son,
Anticleon, is convinced of the corruption in the system, and tries to
distract him from the courts first by urging him to try cases at home, and
then by luring him out to society dinners.
Fifth-century Athens and its legal system is so remote that the action
sometimes seems baffling. There is, however, a universal and rooted dislike
of lawyers. Perhaps the
world of Wasps is more like that of the Think Tanks on Capitol
Hill or the non-executive directorships in the City: 'It's
an achievement,' admits Anticleon, 'not to be held accountable.' And if
Athenian law was reason free
from passion, Aristophanes is
quick to turn the event into more of a competency hearing than a
trial.
The company, Aquila Productions, has tackled Clouds and Frogs and has
performed Off Broadway and at Delphi, so it should know how to create the
best Aristophanic
chaos and match it to the venue. At The Place Theatre, the actors roam
throughout the audience, and a middle seat is no hedge against enforced
participation.
There is an incomprehensibly sung jazz and blues score delivered by two
musicians at the back of the open stage. The show's best touches are also
American: a revivalist preacher comes to give the play's message, wandering
amongst the audience crying 'Lemme hear ya say Shame '; and the home trial
of two dogs brings on 'Butch' from Tom and Jerry growling 'Dat's ma boy]'
The six actors, and some of the audience, race around at breakneck speed, so
I hope theatre is insured against liability suits from
distressed theatregoers. Still,
theatre is cheaper than court. The show runs for 90 minutes; take the cost
of the ticket from the cost of 90 minutes with Counsel and have a week end
in New York on the difference.

Yet again BBC1 offers its viewers a night of kick, spit and writhe as the
lads get out there on the park and do what's got to be done ..or not. Do you
believe they can beat San Marino by seven goals? Do fish wear spats? The
whole ghastly business is covered in Sportsnight Special (6.50) which takes
up 2 hrs 25 mins. Then, to make doubly sure that no BBC1 viewer goes to bed
happy, Sportsnight (10.40) spends another 70 minutes on World Cup Football.
Between the two comes the first in a five-part documentary series, States Of
Terror (9.45), each of which looks at an example of terrorism during the
past 20 years. It starts with Silke Maier-Witt, who was a member of what the
BBC calls the 'Red Army Faction', which I was taught in the 1970s should
rightly be called the Red Army Fraction. Still, nobody denies its members
set out to terrorise West German society.
One of the most original and varied series on television, Bookmark (BBC2,
8.10), offers 'a film set in the fictional world of Shena Mackay' starring
Susan Fleetwood and Harriet Walter and featuring the writer herself.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Glasgow 'Flute' in London - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Covent Garden Zauberflote is on loan from Scottish Opera. It was
first given in Glasgow a year ago, hugely enjoyed and widely praised (by,
among others, Richard Fairman on this page), and then snapped up to fill a
hole in the Royal Opera's planning schedule.
This, alas, is where the problems start. The transfer of an opera-staging
from one company to another, more common than ever in the economically
straitened 1990s, is fraught with danger - these are fragile plants,
organically grown, and all too often fail to blossom, or even survive, in
alien soil. As seen and heard at Covent Garden on Monday, this Flute is not
exactly withered, just rather etiolated; disappointingly, its success in
reproducing those qualities originally so much admired is considerably
qualified.
Martin Duncan's sparky production, in the chic, up-to-the-minute designs of
Ken Lee, has both a saucy freshness and a keenly intelligent command of the
original text (a great deal more of the opera's symbolic arcana is taken on
board, or at least hinted at, than in most current Flute productions).
Bright poster-paint colours - yellow and violet are the show's trademark -
do not render impossible the opera's acts of ritual but do exclude unwanted
portentousness. The costumes, which make sly reference to children's book
illustrations, high fashion, 1950s film musicals, and also longstanding
Mozart tradition, are a particular delight.
But it all fails to fill out the Royal Opera space; and so what was
doubtless a triumph of imaginative modern opera-design in the Glasgow
Theatre Royal starts to look insubstantial in the wrong way on the broader,
deeper Covent Garden stage. The cunningly economical use of drop-screens and
trollies does not disguise the sense of inapt foreshortening that here takes
hold. After a while Duncan's habit of moving his characters in group dance
sequence in time to the music begins to irritate. Details remain witty. The
larger whole, not always accurately lit, lacks resonance.
Other reasons for the shortfall suggest themselves. In Glasgow the
production had the benefit of Jeremy Sams's frisky translation - just what
it needs. In London, the original language, though generally more punchily
spoken and sung than it sometimes is in this theatre (by Kurt Streit's
Tamino and Robert Lloyd's Sarastro especially), sits oddly on an almost
entirely anglophone ensemble and an English-speaking audience; as ever in
operatic comedy, the surtitles simply cannot make up the difference. The
cast, of decent standard, seems slotted into the staging, not essential to
the germination of its theatricality - this is a familiar by-product of
production-loans.
But to my mind easily the most powerful reason is the choice of Andrew
Parrott as conductor. Parrott is a pioneering concert-hall exponent of Early
Music and 'period' practice; his theatre experience is limited, and his
command of Die Zauberflote even more so, as he reveals in almost every bar
of the score. The concern to produce a quasi-'period' orchestral balance
with the ROH's modern-instrument band leads in practice to acres of dry,
flat, unluminous texture; the obsession with style-conscious fast tempos to
a hectic, short-breathed rattling-along which serves the singers badly and
the growth of dramatic momentum very little.
So the musical pleasures, such as they are, are momentary, not regular, and
confined to the most experienced and confidently communicative members of
the cast. This means above all Mr Streit's boyishly athletic, vocally expert
hero, equally good in phrases of reverie and decision, Lloyd's admirable
leader-priest (an interestingly disturbing figure), and Sumi Jo's
matchlessly pure, pearly-voiced Queen. Gordon Hawkins's Speaker makes a
notably warm yet muscular impression; the Three Ladies (Lynda Russell,
Leah-Marian Jones, Catherine Wyn-Rogers) are well matched, the three Boys
(young girls, actually) likewise.
Amanda Roocroft continues to develop her Pamina: she is now much surer on
stage than when last encountered in this theatre, and spins out long lines
with touchingly true musicianship. I wish I liked the actual sound of her
lower and middle registers more.
Papageno - make-or-break factor of any Flute - seems to me miscast: Peter
Coleman-Wright, the ENO's aquiline Giovanni, noble Billy Budd and sinisterly
handsome Tarquin, works hard at the production's birdman routines but looks
and sounds temperamentally and physically ill-suited to distilling from them
the authentic, house-warming vocal and personal charm.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Management: Take care when rewarding the high-flyers -
Performance-related pay has been adopted enthusiastically by the CAA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance-related pay is not for everyone, as Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority demonstrated last year.
In negotiations over its new pay scheme the CAA, a government body that
regulates air traffic, said the priority for 3,000 well-paid employees such
as air traffic controllers and aircraft inspectors was to follow set
procedures and routines rather than showing their individual mettle.
'The prime concern is safety and we therefore did not want to encourage
people to behave exceptionally,' says Terry Moseley, director of
remuneration and staff relations at the CAA.
'Rather, we want a performance-related pay scheme (PRP) in areas where we
could reasonably acknowledge better than expected performance.' But Moseley
warns: 'A PRP scheme is not a substitute for managers encouraging and
motivating their staff. It is a reinforcement agent.'
The CAA is an enthusiast for PRP - along with others which include John
Lewis Partnership, the retailer, and ICL, the computer company. A hallmark
of all of them is that they have integrated their PRP into well-developed
schemes which involve regular assessments of employees' work and offer the
means to improve performance.
Vicky Wright, director of remuneration consulting at Hay Management
Consultants, says: 'Just offering PRP in itself is generally not good
enough. Employers have to define what a job is, communicate that to the
employee and devise processes which enable people to improve their
performance and then design a PRP system which reflects that.'
The CAA's current scheme, introduced after protracted and robust
negotiations with the CPSA, NUCPS and IPMS civil service unions, replaced an
existing Civil Service PRP scheme. Moseley says it was a 'dreadful
mechanistic system' which, for example, allowed a standard performer who got
three annual 'satisfactories' at the annual appraisal an automatic bonus.
The performance-related pay review in the new scheme is separated from the
annual appraisal by around six months so that a discussion of strengths and
weaknesses can take place when pay is not directly an issue. While PRP is
influenced by the annual appraisal, it is not determined by it.
Moseley says that since the old scheme was linked directly to the annual
appraisal it distracted people from properly discussing their
jobs.
Negotiations with the unions over abandoning the old PRP system in 1990-91
were lengthy and a new deal was won only after it was agreed to lift the
company's pay scales by 17 per cent over two years.
The new scheme, which could be substantially modified in the next few years
when the CAA moves towards devolved pay bargaining, incorporates some 2,500
junior and middle management and clerical and administrative staff.
A further 1,200 engineers were to have been included this year, but they are
covered by two pay scales and making the necessary adjustments could not be
accommodated within the government's 1.5 per cent pay ceiling.
There are three components to the pay system: These are:
An annual negotiated increase for everybody.
Movement through the pay scales. The pay structure consists of salary bands
with only two fixed points, a start rate and a job rate. The start rates for
bands one to four, which cover junior and clerical staff, is 90 per cent of
the job rate and for bands five to 12, which covers middle managers, is 85
per cent of the job rate. Movement through salary bands is determined by
performance.
In addition, performance-related, non-consolidated lump sum bonuses, not
normally exceeding 5 per cent of the individual's job rate, may be awarded
to those whose overall performance is much better than the standard
performance level.
Moseley says it is not easy to define precisely what managers are looking
for. 'It is an assessment by a manager. We have issued guidelines that we
believe should be used and then left it to the managers.'
In its first year the scheme is 'generally satisfactory' he says, with 890
out of the 2,500 eligible for merit awards receiving either a lump sum or a
faster progression through the pay scale for their efforts during 1992. The
average award was Pounds 330.
The size of the pot, he says, is important. 'If the budget were too large
the managers would not have to think so hard about who receives awards: the
largesse could be spread wider and thicker and the concept of what
constitutes better than expected performance would be diminished,' he says.
At present the amount available is 1 per cent of the salary bill.
Moseley says: 'We do not expect an award to change a person's standard of
living because, after all, it is a bonus and may not be repeated. For those
who do not receive bonuses we do not want awards to be of such magnitude
that they become disgruntled.
'We defeat the object of the scheme if rivalry is engendered because we rely
heavily on teamwork and co-operation to be effective.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Management: Are you a vine, an egg or a train? - Lucy
Kellaway meets an aspiring management guru with a 'creative' way of
challenging accepted theories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is your boss a hammer, an owl, a loaf of bread, a knife, a sheep or a power
drill? Are you an iceberg, a vine, a train or an egg? Let your mind
free-associate and come up with some images. Invite your friends and
colleagues to do the same for you - maybe they see you as a kitchen blender,
as Robin Hood or as an ant.
Welcome to 'imaginization' as conceived by Gareth Morgan, an up-and-coming
management guru. Morgan is the hippy of the management world. He is for
creativity and against strategic planning and bureaucracy of any sort. He
has coined this six-syllable word to describe a process which he believes is
the future of all management thinking, and the key to changing the behaviour
of both the individual and the organisation.
Morgan has just come to Britain from Canada to promote his new book,
Imaginization*, and to explain to the British Academy of Management how it
works. According to the book's jacket, imaginization is a new way of
thinking. It is a new way of organising. It is a key managerial skill. It
provides a way of helping people understand and develop their creative
potential. It offers a means of finding innovative solutions to difficult
problems.
But what actually is it? 'Imaginization is about challenging mental models
and creating dialogue,' he tells me. I start to look sceptical, but get put
in my place. 'Cynicism,' he says, 'is dismissive and locks in. If you tap
into the negative side too early, you don't get a chance to see the positive
in it.' I try to tap in to some imaginization and play with the image of a
hedgehog. Yet if by hedgehog, all I mean is prickly, then why not say
prickly directly? Surely the image just confuses matters?
On the contrary, he says, images allow us to look at things in a creative
way. He suggests that whereas it would not be possible to tell your boss he
is prickly, in the context of 'this crazy game' you might be able to get the
same message across by describing him as a hedgehog.
In any case, most images are more complicated and therefore more telling
than that of a hedgehog. For instance, if your colleagues think you are a
kitchen blender, they may regard you as powerful, but with a tendency to
turn everything into a single ingredient. It could jolt you into changing
your ways, if you know that that is how they see you.
Most management ideas are hard to get a firm hold on, but Morgan's are more
than most because they are not prescriptive - they contain no solutions.
Instead, they are about a new way of looking at things. 'We are sold the
notion that management is a set of rules, we get locked in,' he says.
Is his new approach a bit like lateral thinking? He shakes his head:
'Lateral thinking is connected to a technique. My approach is less
structured. I don't ever describe the technique, but illustrate it.'
He gives an example of a manager whose problems at work were resolved simply
by changing the way she looked at her job. When Morgan first met this
manager, she felt that despite the superhuman efforts she was making at
work, she was getting nowhere. He showed her a cartoon of a jockey in the
Grand National standing in front of a fence and trying to pull the horse
over it by the reins. He showed her another of a termite, eating away at
something, and building something large, bit by bit.
'This manager overnight was able to develop a new way of doing things. She
realised she was blocking herself. She was able to see that she had been
trying to pull horses over the fence, when what she should have been doing
was putting her energy where she could make a difference.'
Morgan's ideas are equally applicable to whole organisations dealing with
change. Managers and workers need only to sit down together and start trying
to look at themselves, their relationships and their tasks in a fresh way.
'You've got to find a way of creating new space. The idea is to create the
opportunity to decouple from where you are now.'
Morgan is critical of most attempts at bringing about change within
organisations, which have replaced one set of rigidities with another. He
argues that companies may have abandoned layers of managers, but they have
not managed to get rid of their bureaucratic structure. 'Re-engineering]' -
he pronounces the name of the latest management panacea dismissively. 'It is
locking the world into a new era. In two or three years those very companies
will need to break free again.'
One helpful image for a new shape of organisation is that of the spider
plant. This has a parent plant and a lot of babies joined to it by umbilical
cords. Morgan says he is using this model with the education authorities in
Canada, which are looking at ways of passing more autonomy to the schools.
'The spider plant creates organic growth in a local environment,' he says.
'It is a crazy image, but is powerful. We started with the plant, and then
as we talked and explored the image, we introduced the idea of electronic
umbilical cords, and of bumble bees who would be managers roving from school
to school identifying common problems.
Morgan talks constantly about the need to 'flip into a new frame'. He is not
talking about the slow grind of changing habits. Indeed, he talks of what
sounds like miracle conversions to a new mind set, with the result that work
patterns are changed overnight.
In Morgan's permissive world, everything goes except inflexible ways of
doing things. Morgan knows something about those, having spent his formative
youth as an accountant. He then went to the opposite extreme and became
obsessed with behavioural science. He left accountancy and now, as an
academic, a writer and a consultant, has embarked on 'a quest to explain why
traditional systems run into problems'. Perhaps that makes him a homeopathic
doctor, an impressionist artist, or a gardener sowing seeds of
imaginization.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Driving force behind a tale of
two cities - David Lascelles visits Freiburg and Oxford which have both
adopted different solutions to the problems of heavy traffic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford in England and Freiburg in Germany have much in common. Both are
important university cities with some industry attached. Both have a unique
heritage of architecture and culture and in both places the environment
poses big issues, particularly where traffic is concerned.
But there, the similarities end. Walk through Freiburg's historic city
centre and there is not a car in sight. The entire old city has been
pedestrianised. Access is allowed only to trams which glide noiselessly down
the cobbled streets and to bicycles. The place is orderly and unblemished,
almost like Disneyland.
Walk down Oxford High Street and the place is a mayhem of buses, exhaust and
noise. Vehicles and pedestrians jostle at the crossings; the place throbs
with life.
Why is it so different? The answers provide a revealing object lesson not
just about well-known features of the British and German character, but also
the very different ways they organise their communities.
By coincidence, Freiburg and Oxford both started to address their traffic
problems seriously in the same year, 1973. That was when Freiburg
pedestrianised the first section of the old city and Oxford launched a
park-and-ride scheme to reduce city centre traffic.
Freiburg, in south-west Germany, was fortunate to have space alongside the
old city wall to build an inner ring road, making pedestrianisation much
easier. Oxford did not, and its attempt to create one across Christ Church
Meadow sparked a national controversy.
Freiburg voted in a 'green' city council which took aggressive steps to deal
with traffic. The objective was to remove all cars and lorries from the
centre. This was complemented by heavy investment in the public
transportation system and in a network of bicycle lanes. Today, few
Freiburgers live more than a few minutes' walk from a bus or a tram stop and
there are more than 400km of bicycle lanes, many of them away from the road.
The driving force behind Freiburg's traffic plan is Peter Heller, a youthful
deputy mayor who carries the title of environmental mayor. For him, the
battle against the car is not merely a transport issue, but part of a wider
environmental campaign for more sensible use of resources. He is trying to
encourage new housing developments which do away with the need for transport
 -everything would be to hand.
Oxford, by contrast, has been unable to pedestrianise the city centre for a
number of reasons, partly political. The highway authority for the city is
the county council which has been deadlocked between Tory-led, out-of-town
opponents of traffic schemes and supporters of the Labour-led city council's
desire to banish the car. But there were also practical problems. There was
no inner ring road, so closing the city centre would only push traffic into
suburban residential streets.
Most of Oxford's effort, therefore, has gone into the park-and-ride scheme
which is already the largest in the country and will be expanded to a
capacity of more than 3,600 cars by the end of this year.
Although people grumble about it, use of the scheme is growing by 10 per
cent a year, which has made a noticeable impact on car numbers. The level of
traffic in Oxford has remained almost constant for 15 years.
Some effort has been put into bicycle lanes as well and recently the city
launched an experimental electric bus service in co-operation with Southern
Electricity, the local utility.
However, the political balance on the county council shifted in the last
elections. The anti-city component was weakened, leaving the city council in
a stronger position to tackle the traffic problem in a more fundamental way.
The county commissioned a study from Colin Buchanan, the leading traffic
consultant, and this now forms the basis of a Pounds 17m-Pounds 18m plan to
ease congestion over a period of five years.
The plan will involve investing more in public transport and bicycle lanes,
reducing city-centre parking spaces by up to 10 per cent, closing the high
street and making a variety of environmental improvements.
The plan won support from 70 per cent of the people of Oxford in a recent
survey. But it needs government approval for the spending and that is far
from certain.
As this tale of two cities shows, the points of contrast are stark. First,
Freiburg managed to achieve the political consensus to take action much more
quickly than Oxford. Although Freiburg city council is evenly divided
between three parties, the right-wing CDU, the socialist SPD and the Greens,
they support a common objective in this area.
Oxford was hobbled not just by inter-party rivalry but also by city-county
conflict, although that may now be changing. Eva Barnes, Labour environment
spokesperson on the county council, says: 'It's been a travesty for a
heritage city. But I think there's support from all four parties to pursue
most of these measures now.' John Tanner, chairman of the city's highways
and traffic committee, agrees. 'There's been a sea change in attitudes right
across the parties,' he says.
Nor did Oxford have someone in Heller's position to push through an
environmental master plan, though it does now have a city centre manager,
Martin Wright, on a two-year secondment from Marks and Spencer. When Oxford
applied to Whitehall for the traffic scheme grant it prepared the required
cost and benefit analysis. But for the first time, this measured the
benefits in terms of the non-car user rather than the motorist. For once, a
traffic scheme was intended to benefit the pedestrian, the tourist and the
atmosphere.
Second, Freiburg had the money to finance the heavy investment in public
transport which is essential to replace the car. This year, the city will
pour a subsidy of DM30m (Pounds 12m) into transport. It can afford to do
this because it owns the local gas and electricity utilities from whom it
creams off profits for cross-subsidisation. Thus Freiburgers pay more than
necessary for their home heating in order to have a good tram service (which
has the additional beneficial effect of encouraging them to heat their homes
more efficiently).
Oxford will this year spend a mere Pounds 300,000 to subsidise city
transport. And its ability to finance the Buchanan plan in full depends
largely on central government approval because it has few other sources of
funds. On the other hand, the bus services on the park-and-ride scheme are
close to making a profit, although the more successful they become, the more
the council loses city centre parking revenue, one of its few extra sources
of income.
Third, Freiburg owns the public transport system in the region and can
therefore make it do exactly what it wants. In Oxford, the bus system was
privatised in 1986. This initially led to a chaotic growth in bus numbers.
It has now settled down, but the various bus companies are reluctant to
co-operate. In Freiburg, people can buy a single, heavily subsidised 'green'
ticket which entitles them to use the whole regional transportation system.
In Oxford there is no cross-ticketing and, according to city officials,
unlikely to be in the foreseeable future.
All this suggests that Freiburg is much better organised than Oxford, which
it evidently is. But is there more to it than meets the eye?
Interestingly, the traffic profiles of the two cities are not as different
as might be expected. In both, the proportion of people-journeys made by
motor vehicles is exactly the same: 47 per cent. And in Oxford, public
transport's share is much higher than Freiburg's (40 per cent versus 26 per
cent). Oxford only falls behind with the bicycle (12 per cent versus 27 per
cent). One reason why Oxford does well is that it has a relatively low level
of car ownership.
Ernst von Weizsacker, an environmental specialist at the Wuppertal Institute
for Climate, Environment and Energy, also says Freiburg's high standards are
being achieved to some extent at the expense of the surrounding region;
traffic is being pushed elsewhere and the city's high costs are burdening
the poorer rural communities nearby. 'They are cherry-picking,' he says.
Oxford, by contrast, might be said to have paid the price for leaving the
centre accessible to motorists from outside the city.
Nor is there much awareness among the people of Freiburg about the level of
cross-subsidisation. 'Most of them don't even know about it,' says Uli
Hohmann, the editor of the local public radio. However, he doubts that there
would be opposition to the arrangement, even if it was more widely debated.
Freiburgers would support an even tougher environmental policy, for example
in energy efficiency, he says.
However, it is clear that Freiburg's standards depend on a level of
co-operation that would be inconceivable in the UK: between political
parties, between council and utilities, and within the transportation
system. Oxford might achieve greater political coherence if it became a
unitary authority under proposed local government reforms. But the
privatisation of bus and utility services means it will never have control
of key municipal levers like Freiburg.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Spotlight on UK plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biodiversity is one of the great rallying cries of the green movement.
Everyone feels intuitively that it is important to preserve as many types of
plant and animal as possible - but there has been little direct evidence so
far to show how the loss of species would harm the environment.
Now, however, ecologists at Imperial College's Centre for Population Biology
at Silwood Park, Berkshire, are beginning to fill the experimental gap.
John Lawton, director of the centre, says it is already clear that the
variety of species in a biological community has a big impact on the way it
functions. 'We can no longer ignore serious threats to key ecological
processes, posed by the loss of biodiversity.'
The work is taking place in the Ecotron, a Pounds 1m research laboratory
containing 16 separate climate-controlled chambers. Each is a two-metre cube
with its own community, set up to model British grassland. There are wild
plants (varying from two to 16 species per chamber), insects and soil
organisms.
'What we did was mimic the loss of species currently being caused by human
impacts on ecosystems, but under controlled conditions,' Lawton says.
Preliminary results show that biodiversity has a big impact on plant growth,
absorption of carbon dioxide, soil chemistry, water cycle and microclimate.
The Ecotron - funded by the Natural Environment Research Council with a
Pounds 250,000 annual grant - provides climate control over light,
temperature, humidity and rainfall. It enables scientists to mimic
ecosystems while carrying out controlled experiments that would be
impractical in field studies.
Although it is far smaller than the Biosphere II in Arizona, the Ecotron is
a more powerful research tool because its separate chambers allow
experiments to be replicated and the results verified by statistical
analysis.

FT  17 NOV 93 / People: Maitland steers private course
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Angus Maitland, vice chairman of Burson-Marsteller, one of the world's
largest public relations consultancies, is leaving at the end of the year to
set up his own business.
Maitland has managed to strike an agreement with his erstwhile employer,
allowing him to take along a number of B-M clients.
Maitland, 47, who will have been at B-M three years and was the first
non-American on its main board, says he has had enough of the meetings and
other restrictions a big organisation imposes.
Instead, Maitland wants to devote himself full-time to what he calls
'high-level strategic consultancy'.
A graduate of Glasgow University, who kicked off his career as an economic
analyst in industry, Maitland joined Charles Barker in the early 1970s where
he met Reg Valin.
When Valin and Richard Pollen formed Valin Pollen, Maitland joined shortly
afterwards.
But the group ran into difficulties in the late 1980s following an American
acquisition. It fell to Maitland, made chairman of communications group VPI
when Valin quit, to try and pick up some of the pieces.
Maitland says he will not be in direct competition with former Valin Pollen
colleagues now working at other agencies across London, such as those at
Gavin Anderson and Fishburn Hedges.
However, he has in recent months been doing some work for Invesco, the fund
management group which Richard Pollen, also in business on his own, had
previously advised.

FT  17 NOV 93 / People: Lankester replaces Holland at education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Geoffrey Holland, permanent secretary at the Department for Education,
has announced that he is to leave the job only ten months after moving to
the department.
The department is currently in the throes of a review by the consultants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, aimed, according to Whitehall sources, at 'rooting out
the left-wing educational establishment', from the department. Right-wing
think-tanks believe the department deliberately sabotaged the government's
national curriculum reforms.
However, Sir Geoffrey's move seems more to save commuting time than to
escape hot water. He has lived for the last six years in West Cornwall and
commuted weekly to London. His new job, as vice-chancellor of Exeter
university, which he will start next April, means he will no longer need to
be so familiar with Paddington station.
Sir Geoffrey is still only 53, and moved to the education department after
five years as permanent secretary at employment.
His successor at education, Tim Lankester, perhaps significantly, is also
being drafted from outside the department.
Lankester is a former banker and economist who started his civil service
career in the treasury, followed by a stint working as Margaret Thatcher's
private secretary. Aged 51, his current post is second permanent secretary
at the Overseas Development Administration.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (10): Damage limitation in
a death zone - Bronwen Maddox reports from Chernobyl on the awesome results
of the world's worst nuclear accident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GHOST towns are scattered across the fields and marshes around the Chernobyl
nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident. A
wire fence, 10 kilometres in radius, stops anyone but the plant's operators
and a few scientists and visitors from entering this silent, poisoned zone.
The explosion at Chernobyl in April 1986 is the shadow that hangs over the
world's nuclear industry. It left thousands of acres of farmland in Belarus,
Ukraine and Russia contaminated beyond recovery, and thousands of people
exposed to radiation - the consequences for their health are still unknown.
Yet last month the Ukrainian government reversed its earlier decision to
close down the remaining three reactors at Chernobyl by the end of the year
because of the cost of buying oil and gas from Russia. Instead, work is
underway to repair the second of the three reactors, which has been out of
operation for two years following a fire.
That decision illustrates the problem facing a handful of the world's poorer
countries: they have few alternatives to nuclear power, but lack the cash,
technicians and management to run them safely. It presents richer countries
with a challenge of how best to deploy assistance and funds to solve what is
clearly an international threat: radioactive dust from Chernobyl reached
much of western Europe.
The public hostility to nuclear power provoked by Chernobyl also raised the
question of how high richer countries' nuclear standards should be.
Safety measures in Western Europe, Japan and North America - pushed steadily
higher by powerful 'green' pressure groups and public opinion - are
responsible for a large proportion of the costs of nuclear power, though one
that is hard to quantify.
Recent Western efforts to improve the safety of the 58 Soviet-designed
reactors in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have focused on the
25 worst. In particular, they have targeted Kozloduy in Bulgaria and
Ignalina in Lithuania.
Two years ago, Kozloduy was condemned as the world's most dangerous nuclear
plant by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the
Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, which found that it lacked even the emergency
cooling system standard in western reactors.
Since then, Western European nuclear experts have been training the
operators and ordering pipes and valves to be strengthened, as part of a
programme run by the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organisation
set up three years after Chernobyl to promote high standards of nuclear
management.
In June this year, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development also
approved a 24m Ecu grant to improve fire protection, cooling systems and
valves.
At Ignalina, an IAEA report in February cited a long list of safety concerns
including inadequate systems to relieve steam pressure. Efforts to upgrade
the plant are being led by Sweden, the first country outside Ukraine to
detect the Chernobyl explosion, and just across the Baltic Sea from
Ignalina.
So far, the Swedish government has paid SKr70m (Pounds 5.7m), with another
SKr53.2m due next year to upgrade equipment and improve management.
But funds have so far fallen short of the problem: estimates have put the
cost of thorough improvements at between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn.
Moreover, progress has been handicapped by western companies' concerns about
sharing in liability for the plants. Some have told the IAEA that they are
worried that if there are accidents at the plants, they could be held to
blame because their name is on some of the equipment.
Awareness of the urgent problems at the eastern reactors has also heightened
public pressures in richer countries for close scrutiny of nuclear
standards. Mr Simon Roberts, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the
environmental pressure group, has attacked western governments for paying
too little to improve the 'rickety reactors' of eastern Europe or for
developing alternatives to nuclear power at home.
The UK's Health and Safety Executive, which licenses nuclear installations,
in a detailed and thoughtful report last year, pointed out that assessing
the risk of disaster in nuclear plants is extremely difficult, as it
consists of the judging the probabilities of failure in many interconnected
pieces of equipment. Some of the factors, such as human error, which was
responsible for the accidents at Chernobyl and at Three Mile Island in the
US, are 'of their nature very hard to estimate,' it comments.
It observes, too, that people will tolerate much higher levels of risk in
events they can control, such as riding motorcycles, than they will in
others such as nuclear power or water quality. They have a particular fear
of radiation, frequently out of proportion to the risks of exposure: many
seem to rate death by radiation as worse than a death in a traffic accident,
the HSE comments.
Its conclusion is that safety standards in any future nuclear plants -
although the government has not yet decided whether to lift a moratorium on
building new plants - should be set so that the risk to the public is at
least 10 times less than that of a traffic accident. This is a much higher
standard that that for non-nuclear plants, it points out.
The result of these pressures is an uncomfortable future for nuclear
operators in richer countries. They face pressure at home for tighter and
more expensive safety standards at a point when many governments are
scrutinising the economics of nuclear power closely.
But they know, too, that much of the world's nuclear industry is run on much
lower standards, a problem which international organisations have not yet
successfully addressed. The risk they face, which they cannot control, is
that another Chernobyl will irrevocably turn public opinion against nuclear
power. It is in the nuclear industry's interest that the eastern problems
are tackled soon.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (11): It's all about image
 -Profile: Roger Hayes of the British Nuclear Industry Forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADITIONAL route to the top in UK nuclear organisations has been long
years of work, usually technical, in the industry. Outsiders have found it
difficult to penetrate a secretive and inward looking world.
But the introspective culture has been slowly changing following the
appointment in recent years of Mr Bob Hawley and Mr James Hann, both
outsiders recruited from the private sector, as chief executive of Nuclear
Electric and chairman of Scottish Nuclear respectively.
The latest outsider is Roger Hayes who has been chosen for the job of
director general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, an umbrella for some
72 nuclear-related companies including Rolls-Royce and GEC. It is reflective
of the industry's desire to break out of its egg-headed, closeted image that
his background is in public relations. There is plenty of scope for him to
make use of his skills.
The next six months or so could be crucial to the future of nuclear power in
the UK. Following the decision not to privatise Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear in 1989, when the rest of the electricity supply industry
was sold off to the private sector, the British government is due to start a
nuclear review by the end of next month.
Although the review is unlikely to rule out construction of more nuclear
power stations it will have a decisive influence on the speed of
development. There could also be a greater role for the private sector and
Nuclear Electric is pressing hard that it be privatised.
Rarely has the UK nuclear industry needed an effective spokesman more
strongly. Mr Hayes, 48, has experience both in corporate and political
lobbying. After a spell as Reuter economics correspondent in Paris in the
late 1960s and early 1970s he joined Burston Marsteller to specialise in
corporate affairs for multinationals and governments.
In a decade with BM he was involved both with British politics through the
'Britain in Europe' campaign and as a founder of the Tory Reform Group. In
the 1980s he had spells with Thorn EMI as corporate communications director
and developing his own consultancy before moving to Ford of Europe in 1991
as vice president of public and government affairs.
His tenure at Ford ended this year after the appointment of Mr Jacques
Nasser as head of Ford of Europe. Hayes puts it down to strategic
differences but admits that it was difficult for an outsider at Ford, a
company which like the nuclear industry normally expects senior executives
to be products of the motor sector.
'The average Ford employee has about 23 years with the company. I did not
know the industry well and it was quite difficult to gain credibility.' Part
of the difficulty was lack of time, says Hayes. He was at Ford for two years
but expects to spend longer at BNIF.
His aim is to 'bring the forum and the industry more into the centre of
events' partly by playing a bigger role internationally and partly by making
it more active.
'Like many other people I think the industry has been timid and defensive.
We must answer the views of our critics in Greenpeace and other
organisations but we should not get too bogged down in that. We also need to
stake out some territory of our own.
'We must certainly put the business case for nuclear power and demonstrate
the industry's role to reduce global warming. It is also important for the
big companies to sing the same song. Maybe I will need to knock some heads
together.'
That may prove difficult. Although the nuclear industry is at one on some
obvious issues, such as pressing for expansion, there are significant
differences between Nuclear Electric and British Nuclear Fuels over contract
prices and between Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear over privatisation.
Privatisation will be a crucial element of the nuclear review if Nuclear
Electric has its way but Scottish Nuclear is much less convinced about
whether it is the right way ahead if the industry wants to expand.
Mr Hayes says the role of the forum should be to reconcile and balance
interests. 'There are some issues where it will not be possible to have a
forum view. There may be others where we have a view but do not want to
communicate it.'
Generally, however, Mr Hayes will preach the communications gospel. 'Any
industry that fails to communicate suffers but particularly one, like ours,
that is sensitive to public opinion.'
He promises a broad brush approach that will include seminars and literature
but also wants to investigate the targeting of specific audiences such as
members of the CBI and women.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (8): Models for the next
century - Clive Cookson identifies the world's main reactors and discusses
future design trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX different reactor types are generating electricity commercially around
the world but one, the pressurised water reactor originally developed in the
US, dominates the international nuclear industry. PWRs are operating in 20
countries and generate more than 60 per cent of the world's nuclear
electricity.
The PWR uses ordinary water as both coolant and moderator. (The coolant
carries heat from the reactor core to the generator; the moderator slows
down the neutrons produced in nuclear fission sufficiently to give them a
good chance of hitting another uranium atom in the fuel, so carrying on the
chain reaction.)
In the PWR, the hot water is pumped under high pressure (to prevent boiling)
to the generator, which raises steam in a separate circuit. This
distinguishes the PWR from its closest cousin, the boiling water reactor. In
the BWR (boiling water reactor) the water is allowed to boil in the reactor
circuit and raise steam directly without the need for a heat exchanger. But
the advantage of a simpler circuit design is offset by the requirement for
additional shielding of the generating system.
The third type of water cooled and moderated reactor is the Canadian CANDU
design. It uses heavy water (DO) instead of the light water (HO) in the PWR
and BWR. Because heavy water is a more efficient moderator, the CANDU can
run on unenriched uranium dioxide, while the PWR and BWR require enriched
fuel. On the other hand, it depends on a reliable cheap supply of heavy
water.
In contrast, the reactor types developed and built in the UK - until a PWR
was chosen for Sizewell B - are cooled by carbon dioxide gas and moderated
by graphite. The first generation, known as MAGNOX reactors after the
magnesium alloy used to encase the uranium fuel, were built between 1956 and
1971.
Their successors, the advanced gas-cooled reactors, were designed to operate
at higher temperature and pressure, in order to achieve better thermal
efficiency and power density. The intention was to reduce capital and
running costs, but the more complex design was plagued with engineering
problems which delayed construction and commissioning of AGRs.
The sixth reactor type is the Soviet water-cooled graphite-moderated RBMK,
of which the most notorious example is Chernobyl. Western experts believe
the RBMK is inherently unsafe because the reactor design is unstable at low
power. This feature, combined with human stupidity, led to the 1986
Chernobyl incident.
In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island (1979) and Chernobyl accidents,
the nuclear industry talked a lot about designing a new generation of
'inherently safe' reactors which would shut themselves down safely if
anything went seriously wrong, without relying on human operators or added
mechanical devices. Examples of such designs include Sweden's PIUS (Process
Inherent Ultimately Safe) and the UK's SIR (Safe Integral Reactor).
However, as the Institution of Electrical Engineers points out in an
excellent new booklet on nuclear power published this month*, the industry
has recently stopped using the term 'inherently safe' for its next
generation of reactors 'on the grounds that it is misleading'. The words
suggest a revolutionary approach, whereas the industry's designs are based
on PWRs and BWRs operating today.
The industry prefers instead to talk about building 'advanced' reactors for
the beginning of the next century. Although no orders are forthcoming yet
from the world's utilities, the manufacturers have prepared a dozen designs
to tempt them.
These have several common features, intended to reduce costs and increase
safety. For example the power density of the core is reduced and the reactor
is larger than earlier designs with the same output. And the new designs are
simpler, more rugged and more forgiving of operator error and mechanical
failure.
But their enriched uranium fuel will be very similar to that in current
reactors. The new designs do nothing to answer the anti-nuclear critics who
say the greatest hazard of atomic power is not the tiny risk of a
catastrophic reactor accident but the certainty of more radioactive waste
arising from the nuclear fuel cycle.
The US is developing four advanced reactor designs with joint funding from
the federal government and industry. There is a pair of large 1350MW designs
(System 80+ from ABB Combustion Engineering and the Advanced BWR from
General Electric) and a pair of smaller 600MW designs (AP600 from
Westinghouse and the Simplified BWR from GE).
There is little immediate prospect of new business from the US electricity
supply industry, which has not ordered a nuclear plant since 1978. But the
two larger US designs stand a reasonable chance of winning export orders in
Asia.
Europe's leading design candidate is the 1450MW European PWR (EPR) from the
Nuclear Power International partnership of France's Framatome and Germany's
Siemens. It is very much an evolution of operating French and German PWRs.
NPI hopes the EFR will be ready for ordering in 1997.
All the designs discussed so far are 'thermal' reactors; their water or
graphite moderator produces 'slow' neutrons to sustain the fission chain
reaction. But the founders of the nuclear industry 40 years ago had imagined
that the world would have moved on by now to 'fast reactors' with no
moderator.
The fast reactor is also known as a 'breeder', because surplus neutrons
escape from the core and convert a surrounding blanket of unenriched or
depleted uranium into new nuclear fuel in the form of plutonium. Prototype
fast reactors have operated for many years in several countries (the UK
example is at Dounreay on the north coast of Scotland) but they are more
expensive to build than thermal reactors. With conventional nuclear fuel
expected to remain cheap for decades to come, the economics of the industry
do not currently favour them.
A still more distant prospect is the fusion reactor, whose energy comes from
the joining of two light atoms into a heavier one; this is the exact
opposite of the fission process in thermal and fast reactors. Fusion energy
powers the sun and stars - and the hydrogen bomb - but has not yet been
tamed for use in a nuclear power station. Fusion experiments such as the
Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire have shown promise but commercial
fusion reactors will not enter service before the year 2040.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (9): Away from the fast
lane - Japan's expansion plan is proving too ambitious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN rarely misses its economic and industrial targets, but it may fall
well short of its objective of adding 40,000MW of nuclear capacity between
now and 2010.
The target, announced by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry at
the start of the 1990s, was remarkably bold, but also ominous because of
concern over placing so much nuclear capacity in an island nation only a
little larger than the British Isles but twice as crowded.
Japan's electricity industry, dominated by 10 private regional utilities,
has so far towed the MITI line, although many executives now admit that the
plan is too ambitious.
Equipment exporters, such as General Electric and Westinghouse of the US,
which control the licensing for much of the turbine technology used by the
Japanese nuclear industry, welcome the potential bonanza, but also expect it
to be scaled back over the next two decades.
Nevertheless, MITI, and its partner organisation, the Agency for Natural
Resources and Energy, is sticking to its guns. Japan's nuclear emphasis
dates from the Middle East oil prices crises of the 1970s, and its power
stations' very high dependence on imported oil, coal and liquefied natural
gas.
Along with some hydroelectric and pumped storage, the nuclear option would
insure against any further upheavals among its chief fuel suppliers.
At present, Japan has more than 42 nuclear power stations, with a combined
capacity of 35,000MW. Output is 212 terawatt hours (twh), which means that
nuclear supplies nearly 30 per cent of all Japan's electricity.
Japan is third on a world scale behind the US, with 110 plants, 105,000MW,
generating 612 twh; and France whose 54 plants with a capacity of 57,600MW
produce 314 twh.
The MITI plan calls for 50,000MW by 2000 and 72,500MW by 2010. A certain
degree of reality is making itself felt, and the country's utilities now
expect a target of 45,000MW by 2000 to be more realistic.
A total of 10 nuclear power stations are being built or awaiting
construction. Given Japan's fairly fast installation deadline of five years
per unit, this means that the modified target looks reachable. Beyond that,
however, authorities admit to having much difficulty in establishing sites
for new nuclear units.
All reactors are at coastal sites - some utilities, such as Tokyo Electric
Power Co, Japan's largest with more than a third of all electricity capacity
 -operate several nuclear units outside their own service area. In addition,
Japan's anti-nuclear lobby has become more effective in sounding alarms
against the dangers of too much nuclear.
Given the recent change of government, say Japanese energy officials, the
anti-nuclear arguments will be more strongly felt, and this will stall
clearance of new sites.
On top of this, the outcome of the Gulf conflict and the recent
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord are seen as having a long-term stabilising
effect on Middle East oil prices.
While Japan's nuclear programme is likely to fall behind schedule, it is
pressing ahead with a long-term partner scheme to develop a full nuclear
fuel cycle to give Japan a capacity to undertake nuclear power production
with minimal recourse to overseas suppliers, either in terms of equipment or
uranium.
The first sign of this is the Rokkasho Mura uranium enrichment facility, the
first phase of which opened in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan in March
1992. A nuclear fuel reprocessing facility is to start operating by 2000,
according to plans.
In line with this, Japan is developing new types of 'breeder' reactors, now
at an experimental stage, which would save on uranium imports. The first
demonstration Monju fast breeder reactor (FBR) is expected to start
operating by 2000. An advanced thermal demonstration reactor (ATR) will be
constructed in Ohma-cho, Aomori Prefecture, and will start operating in
2002.
It is doubtful that any type of commercial version of the FBR-ATR reactor
will be generating electricity before 2010, after the current expansion
timetable has passed. Japan's expressed determination to press ahead with
its multi-faceted nuclear programme has sparked wide controversy, not least
because of the world glut of uranium. This surplus, like that of oil, could
slow down Japan's nuclear expansion.

Green - Profile: Joschka Fischer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOSCHKA FISCHER is a cheerful, rotund and expansive figure, with tousled
hair, and a T-shirt worn under an open collar: articulate, self-confident,
and laid-back. He is the archetypal child of the 1960s in middle age.
He is also the man who is holding Germany's powerful nuclear energy industry
to ransom. His hostage is the DM1bn nuclear fuel-element plant being built
at Hanau in the state of Hesse by Siemens, the country's foremost nuclear
power station contractor.
Mr Fischer is a former world revolutionary and Frankfurt taxi driver who is
now the environment minister of Hesse. He is deputy premier of the state in
a coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and his own Green
Party.
The German nuclear power generators, led by the Big Three electricity
utilities, Bayernwerk, RWE and Veba's PreussenElektra, are required by
German law to re-use their nuclear waste to the maximum possible extent, via
re-processing. And Hanau is the critical element - and the weak link - in
that recycling process.
As environment minister, Mr Fischer has simply prevented the plant receiving
the necessary planning permission to come into operation. The nuclear waste
produced by Germany's 20 atomic power stations is being turned into
plutonium in France and Britain, and then has nowhere to go. It is rapidly
becoming a severe embarrassment.
'What we are doing has nothing to do with abandoning nuclear energy,' Mr
Fischer says with a disarming smile. 'It must be a factory which is safe,
and corresponds to the law. Just like a car, it needs to be licensed.'
Mr Fischer is undoubtedly being disingenuous. He is completely committed to
the goal of getting Germany to abandon nuclear power generation, as soon as
may reasonably be achieved.
He also knows that nuclear waste disposal is the weak link in the nuclear
chain. 'Everyone must understand that things have changed here in Germany,'
he says. 'Since the 1970s and 1980s, things have been moving. Abandoning
nuclear power is now inevitable. It is no longer a question of if, but
merely of when and how we get out.'
Mr Fischer led the Green Party delegation in the ill-fated attempt over the
past year to negotiate a cross-party 'energy consensus' over the future of
both the nuclear industry, and the German coal mines. And he led his party
out of the talks in the summer, when it became apparent that the government
and the power generators were determined to keep the nuclear option open.
'The result we almost had .. (promoted by Mr Gerhard Schroder, the prime
minister of Lower Saxony) was very bad,' he says. 'It would have been a
capitulation.' It would have meant allowing the present generation of atomic
power stations to have an operating life of around 40 years, far longer than
the Greens are prepared to accept. It would also have meant allowing a new
generation reactor to be built.
'It is a mystery to me why this was a compromise,' he says. 'After 2010 or
2015, this new generation would then have been brought in. There would have
been no abandonment of nuclear power.'
Instead, the collapse of the talks at the end of October has left Germany
with a de facto moratorium on the future of nuclear energy. And the next
decisive event will be the October 1994 elections for the new Bundestag,
with Mr Fischer's party firmly aiming for a share in a SPED-led coalition.
'There would be no government participation (by the Greens) with a
continuation of nuclear energy,' Mr Fischer says bluntly. 'What is
negotiable is only how and when we get out.'
His ambitions are certainly not out of the question. The Greens are doing
better from the current mood of disenchantment in Germany with all
established politicians and parties than anyone else - including the
much-feared splinter groups of the far right. They won almost 14 per cent of
the vote in the most recent Hamburg city elections. If they can do that
across the country, they must have a very good chance of forming a red-green
coalition with the SPD.
As far as the German nuclear power industry is concerned, Mr Fischer's
skirmish over the Hanau fuel plant is merely a foretaste of the full-scale
war to come if he emerges as a king-maker in the next Bonn coalition.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (4): Ashes without a
phoenix - Western Europe (except France) is at an impasse
</HEADLINE>

THE nuclear industry in OECD Europe, outside France, is fighting to survive
past the early decades of the next century. For with France excluded, there
are no definite plans for any more nuclear capacity on line before the end
of the century.
Only in Britain, where Nuclear Electric has asked to build Sizewell C after
completing Sizewell B, and in Finland, where Parliament has just voted down
a plan to build a fifth reactor, are there signs of potential activity.
Elsewhere, construction is at a standstill.
In Belgium there has been a moratorium since 1989 and new demand is being
met by gas-fired stations. In Spain, the 1984 moratorium, which left five
stations unfinished, continues until 2000. A policy of no new construction
has applied in the Netherlands since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In
Germany, an extremely complex legal situation has kept a completed reactor
at Mulheim-Karlich off-line since 1988, although its owners - RWE -
successfully sued the local government for damages.
In Switzerland, the 320MW BKW Muhleberg reactor is to be expanded to 352MW
by 2000, but this hardly constitutes much of an advance. In Sweden, official
policy still insists on the 1983 referendum decision to phase out nuclear,
although the policy had been modified to ensure that functioning reactors
would not be shut until there were alternative sources of power.
The result is that OECD Europe will only see much advance on its 118.8GW of
existing nuclear capacity through continuing French expansion. Here, four
new 1,400MW reactors are under construction and will come on line between
1995 and 1998. Four further sites are now being chosen.
Yet the French programme has not been without its problems. Steam generators
have had to be replaced in phases in the 900MW series of reactors, while a
generic design fault has been found in the 1,300MW series.
Equally, Electricite de France's 1,140MW commercial scale fast breeder
reactor - Superphenix - has been off-line since 1990. It may now be
restarted at 50 per cent of its nominal capacity, primarily as a nuclear
waste incinerator.
All this takes place against a general assumption that 21st century Europe
will need more nuclear capacity to meet the challenges of carbon dioxide
output. Such an assumption has been much discussed recently because in the
absence of further orders the industry will slowly wither away. Equally, it
is difficult to attract young engineers.
The dilemma is illustrated by the situation in Nuclear Electric in the UK.
Compared with the nuclear section of the old Central Electricity Generating
Board in pre-privatisation days, Nuclear Electric has been doing
astonishingly well. It is finishing its first PWR reactor at Sizewell B
eight months ahead of schedule and on budget and the new reactor should be
on-line far earlier than the target of February 1995.
Yet as important has been the improvement in performance of its AGR
reactors. In 1989-90, these produced 21.7 terawatt hours and were widely
held in contempt. However by 1992-93, the output had improved to 34.6 twh.
The key here has been improved load factor, the amount of time these high
capital cost reactors are on-line. While critics may say that its
competitive position is unfair due to the non-fossil-fuel levy, or wonder
why the situation was so bad under the old CEGB, the fact remains that the
UK's nuclear power sector is a good deal better run now than it was four
years ago.
Yet there are many problems ahead. Of Nuclear Electric's 9,029MW capacity,
excluding Sizewell B, 3,349MW consists of elderly Magnox reactors. These are
approaching the end of their design life. While assuming successful safety
inspections, many of these could continue running for some time, the
expenditure involved as a result of safety reviews tends to increase the
cost of operating them.
Sizewell B, at 1,200MW, consequently does not compensate for the impending,
if phased, closure of the Magnox capacity. Even with a continuing
improvement in the efficiency of its AGRs, Nuclear Electric is still left
with a fall in its capacity, and thus of market share, towards 2000. Unless,
of course, it builds Sizewell C.
The arguments about Sizewell C encapsulate many of the problems facing the
Western European nuclear industry. The success of the French nuclear
programme basically lay in the French government's decision to go nuclear as
a result of perceived energy shortages. The French built their plant in
series. The same design and construction teams built similar plant all over
the country. One technical argument for Sizewell C is that the same design
and construction people will do the job. If a decision is postponed, or
avoided, that newly acquired expertise will inevitably disperse.
Yet Nuclear Electric's ability to continue its new PWR series depends on
raising the necessary finance. Being in the public sector, constrained
government finances make it unlikely that funding will be made available. To
build Sizewell C necessarily requires Nuclear Electric to be privatised or
at least allowed to appeal for private funds. But even if this eventually
happens, the company may have difficulty persuading a reluctant City to take
on the necessary liabilities. It was these liabilities that prevented the
nuclear industry from being privatised in the first place.
There are frequent exhortations from government ministers, both in the UK
and elsewhere, that the proportion of nuclear should rise, or at minimum
stay level, for strategic reasons. Yet the intellectual tide, in a period of
relatively low energy prices, is against nuclear. State involvement is
frequently necessary to ease the entry of private capital. Capital costs are
high and the nuclear time horizon is long.
The market, by contrast, is opening out to competition all over Europe, with
the thrust towards 'third party access' to national and international
electricity grids. Contractual insecurity is growing as a result. It was no
accident that in Britain's 'dash for gas' the power technology chosen was
gas-fired because these stations could be built very rapidly and at low
capital cost.
Strategic energy planners for the 21st century can make as many prophecies
as they like about the necessity of a growing role for nuclear. The problem
is that the longer the European moratorium lasts, the more the French alone
will dominate its revival, if it can be revived at all.
Equally, the nuclear generating industry is still tied into the idea,
prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, that very cheap electricity could be
attained by closing the nuclear fuel cycle. This meant reprocessing with all
its attendant public hostility, rather than final disposal of spent fuel.
Yet reprocessing fuel is essentially irrelevant to generating electricity
from nuclear power in fission reactors. The industry supports reprocessing
at Sellafield and Cap La Hague because it has marched too far down the
reprocessing path and it has become impossible to retrieve its spent fuel
rods from the storage ponds at Sellafield.
But if the industry is to survive and grow in Western Europe, the nettle of
long term waste disposal must be grasped.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (6): Reluctant heirs to the
Soviet legacy - Russia and Ukraine make the best of their plants despite
doubts on safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LESLIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD alarm over the safety of Soviet-designed reactors in eastern
Europe has not prevented a resumption of expansion plans by post-Soviet
Russia and the Ukraine.
In the Ukraine a recent parliamentary vote not only facilitated the
resumption of construction at three sites, but also permitted continued
operation at Chernobyl, site of the 1986 disaster.
Ukraine's decision is is understandable. It imports half its primary energy
requirements, mostly from Russia. Since it gained its independence, the cost
of that energy has escalated because Russia is no longer prepared to sell
gas and oil at subsidised prices, given its own desperation for hard
currency earnings. Ukraine now owes Rbs600bn for gas, which is used
extensively in power generation, with the prospect of paying full world
prices from January 1994.
Ukraine is therefore forced to increase its dependence on nuclear because it
cannot afford to buy alternative sources, such as the plentiful Russian gas.
Current generation is dominated by thermal plants (66 per cent) while
nuclear accounts for 27 per cent of generation.
The Ukraine's decision to continue operating units at Chernobyl aroused
particular dismay because the reactors are the RBMK type, considered the
most unsafe. However, the parliament also voted to complete the partly built
1,000MW third generation WWER units at the Khmelnitski, Rovno and Zaporozhe
plants. The Ukrainians still have to decide what to do with their waste as
Russia seems no longer willing to handle it on a long-term basis.
The WWER units are generally recognised as being much safer although they
have often been tarred with the same brush as the RBMK, mainly because of
the state of the Kozloduy plant in Bulgaria. While western technology can
greatly improve the safety of the plants concerned, there is little evidence
that the Ukrainians or the Russians are looking for new western reactors.
This was compounded when an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) panel
reported there was no reason for the closure of RBMKs at five sites in
Russia and Lithuania, provided earlier IAEA safety recommendations were
implemented.
Such statements reinforce Russia's decision to press on with its own nuclear
programme, placed on hold after Chernobyl, and to rely almost entirely on
home grown reactors. Russia intends to increase nuclear's share of
generation from 11.8 per cent to 30 per cent by the year 2030.
A main motive for the Russians is their need to maximise oil and gas exports
for urgently required hard currency earnings.
Given the danger that because of Russia's declining oil sector it may change
to a net importer of crude from a major exporter, the emphasis on gas
exports is growing. As gas is also used extensively for electricity
generation, the Russians are likely to prefer growth in nuclear generation
rather than gas-fired plant in order to maximise hard currency exports.
The Russian programme envisages the completion and operation of three new
units at Kalinin, Kursk and Balakovo by 1997 as well as two new units at
Balakovo by 2005 and a further 20 reactors by 2010. The programme is based
largely on development of various new medium-sized reactor designs.
The Russians are also persisting with fast breeder reactors, developing a
larger version of the reactors now operating at Beloyarsk and at Shevchenko
in Kazakhstan.
Although the main expansion programmes in the region are intending to
utilise domestic technology, there is still plenty of work for western
utilities in enhancing safety and efficiency at existing plant. This is
particularly the case as more funds seem to be flowing in the region's
direction.
One key step was the establishment of the G-7 multilateral fund to improve
safety at plants in eastern Europe, which is being administered by the EBRD.
The fund is also only designed for the 32 reactors deemed safe enough for
upgrading, and excludes the 26 RBMK reactors currently operating in the
region, as well as equipment designed to prolong the operating life of a
plant. A timetable for closure has to be therefore agreed before a grant is
made - a difficult business for a country such as Bulgaria which relies on
its sole nuclear plant at Kozloduy for 40 per cent of its electricity. In
order to obtain a grant of Ecu24m from the fund the Bulgarians had to agree
to close down two of the older units at the plant.
Another important breakthrough came in the summer when the EC announced that
for the first time teams of western experts were to carry out long-term
safety work at six Russian and Ukrainian sites. The agreement was reached
because the Russians and Ukrainians offered suitable legal indemnity in the
event of accidents. The agreement is expected to add a further Ecu62m to the
Ecu20m the EC has spent on nuclear safety in Russia and Ukraine so far under
the TACIS programme. Companies across the Community, including EdF, Scottish
Nuclear, Tractebel, Nuclear Electric and RWE have obtained contracts under
the programme.
Elsewhere in the region, Western operators have had some joy in the Czech
Republic and Slovakia. Both countries currently operate one nuclear plant
each but, after much indecision, the Czechs announced in March that they
would complete two units on the country's second plant at Temelin.
Westinghouse was employed as the principal contractor for safety and control
equipment.
The decision comes in spite of a significant decline in demand for power in
recent years and assumes, despite evidence to the contrary, that demand will
grow by 2 per cent a year from 1995. Westinghouse hopes that its
modernisation of the WWER 1,000MW reactors at Temelin will give it prime
position when other countries embark on similar schemes.
Meanwhile, the Czech Republic's former partner Slovakia has embarked upon an
even more controversial course. The Slovaks estimate that it will cost
Dollars 780m to complete two units at the partially constructed Mochovce
plant and have held negotiations with western companies over the formation
of a joint venture to complete the plant which is being lined up for
privatisation. Extensive talks have been held with Bayernwerk and EdF and
the EBRD is said to have been approached over funding.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (5): At a strategic
crossroads - UK wrestles with the waste dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE question of how to dispose of accumulating nuclear waste is confronting
UK politicians as they prepare to debate the future of nuclear power.
The UK has not resolved the issues of how to treat the waste from its
nuclear power stations, or where to put the scrapped stations when they come
to the end of their lives.
The uncertainties about the costs - and about who will pay - scuppered plans
to privatise the nuclear industry three years ago. They will haunt also the
government's forthcoming review of nuclear power.
At the heart of the question are some of the thorniest environmental
decisions facing the government. Countries who are signatories to the
international London Dumping Convention voted last week to ban permanently
dumping of radioactive waste at sea. The UK has 100 days to decide whether
to opt out and incur international criticism.
The UK has already agreed to a 15-year temporary ban under a separate
treaty, the Paris and Oslo convention, but reserved the right to start
dumping again at that point. However, if it abides by the LDC vote, it must
look more urgently at disposal routes on land. But there too it faces tough
decisions.
Ministers are due to announce soon whether they will give the go-ahead to
the Pounds 2.89bn Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, which
will treat used or 'spent' fuel. In the next few years they must also decide
whether to build a long term storage dump in the rocks under Sellafield.
To environmentalists, the problems of disposing of nuclear waste are one of
the most powerful arguments against nuclear power. Mr Simon Roberts, energy
campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the 'green' pressure group, says: 'what
right have we to leave this contamination for future generations?'
Greenpeace, one of the UK's largest environmental pressure groups, has also
challenged the government in court on its support for Thorp.
Nuclear waste is normally divided into three categories by the intensity of
the emitted radiation. Low-level waste - more than 90 per cent of waste in
the UK - includes operators' protective clothing, packaging and other
material which has been exposed to low doses of radiation. Intermediate
level waste typically includes metal scraps, sludges and resins; high-level
waste mainly consists of used fuel rods from reactors.
Much of the UK's waste has been generated by the military side of the
nuclear industry, from development of submarines and missiles. But within 15
years it will have to begin handling the waste from decommissioning the
ageing Magnox reactors. Some of the waste is bulky, particularly the large
steam generators or boilers from these plants, and eventually the concrete
structures themselves, one reason behind Britain's preference for sea
dumping.
At the moment, the UK's low-level waste is stored at ground-level at Drigg,
in Cumbria, and intermediate level waste is stored around the country at the
sites where it has been produced. High-level waste is sent to the
government-owned British Nuclear Fuels' plant at Sellafield where it is
reprocessed and stored.
However Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive, which has been established to provide long-term storage, is
investigating whether a permanent repository for low and medium level waste
could be carved out of the rocks below Sellafield.
This summer, the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory
Committee voiced reservations about the choice of site. Part of its concern
is that preliminary tests showed upward pressure in the underground water
table at that point, suggesting a risk that radioactivity could enter the
water courses.
RWMAC also warned that because of the need for further geological tests, it
was unlikely that the repository would be ready before 2010, three years
behind schedule, even if all concerns were adequately answered. Nirex is due
soon to apply for planning permission for a small underground laboratory to
begin answering these questions.
Meanwhile, the government must decide about Thorp, after weighing up
responses to the recent public consultation, the second in the plant's
history. Thorp, which also has orders from Japanese and German utilities, is
designed to separate reusable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel,
leaving a smaller amount of true waste. BNFL, which has spent more than 10
years building the plant, says that all questions were answered by the 1977
Windscale inquiry which gave the go-ahead for Thorp's construction.
However, the plant's critics, notably Greenpeace, argue that Thorp's
operation will increase the amount of plutonium in the world and so
contribute to the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons. They add that
dry storage - temporary storage of unseparated spent fuel for several
decades - is emerging as a cheaper alternative.
Scottish Nuclear, the nuclear generator, has already announced that it is
opting for dry storage for some of its spent fuel, although it adds that it
believes the nuclear industry would suffer if Thorp did not go ahead.
Many of these choices depend on comparison of the costs of the different
options. Some of those costs are not yet clear - as in Nirex's case. Others
depend greatly on policy decisions, such as the method and timing of the
Magnox decommissioning.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (3): In the thick of a
battle for a Taiwan order - Interview: Raymond Sero of Westinghouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG with many executives in the nuclear power plant industry, Mr Raymond
Sero is feverishly putting the finishing touches to complex proposals to
supply equipment for Taiwan's fourth pair of nuclear power stations.
The hotly-contested Lungmen project has been shelved and revived several
times in recent years, and in April suffered a further delay when Taipower
changed the terms at the 11th hour. Now a new deadline for bids, December 8,
is looming.
Mr Sero, Westinghouse Electric's general manager for international nuclear
business, explains why the Taiwan project is generating such activity at the
US company and its rival nuclear plant suppliers in the US, Europe and
Japan: 'It's the only big new nuclear plant project that's imminent.'
However, in spite of the paucity of new nuclear plant work worldwide, and
the long delays and obstacles to be surmounted in winning orders, Mr Sero
says he is 'cautiously optimistic' about prospects for Westinghouse's
nuclear business, the world's largest with overall annual sales of Dollars
1bn.
This confidence is underpinned by Westinghouse's long history in the nuclear
industry. The company pioneered the commercial nuclear power industry more
than 30 years ago. It has supplied 51 of the 110 nuclear plants operating in
the US, and more than 170 of the world's 410 light water reactors (LWRs,
which include pressurised water reactors and boiling water reactors) have
either been supplied by Westinghouse or based on its technology.
Helped by having such a big installed base, Westinghouse is also the world's
largest supplier of nuclear fuel and services. In fuel, it continues to make
design changes to keep ahead of the competition, says Mr Sero, while in the
instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) business it claims the only fully digital
system for nuclear plants.
Recent contracts illustrate how Westinghouse is using its strengths at a
time when new nuclear plants are off the near-term political agenda in two
formerly crucial markets, the US and virtually all western Europe.
In the UK, Westinghouse is on schedule to complete the I&amp;C contract ready
for next year's start-up of the Sizewell B plant in Suffolk - having taken
over from a French supplier whose contract was cancelled in 1991. In Korea,
it is supplying nuclear fuel rods after a decision to give the business to a
rival supplier was reversed.
In the Czech Republic, Westinghouse is hard at work on important contracts
to supply the I&amp;C system and nuclear fuel for the partially-completed
Temelin nuclear station. The contracts, finally clinched in May, were the
largest yet awarded for safety and performance-related upgrades of
Soviet-designed reactors.
Mr Sero says he is confident that, with more Temelin-type contracts being
awarded and new plant activity in Asia, Westinghouse will be able to
announce some significant new contracts in the next two to three years.
In Asia, there are potential opportunities over the next two to three years
in Korea, Japan, Indonesia - and also China where Westinghouse is
participating with partners from Spain and Italy on preparing proposals for
new plants. And there are further opportunities in Taiwan.
But Mr Sero stresses that Westinghouse has not abandoned hope of winning new
plant orders in the US and Europe, even if there is no immediate business. A
key development here could be Westinghouse's participation in a
US-government supported project to spend Dollars 158m over the next five
years on detailed design of the AP600, a standardised, simplified 600MW PWR.
The involvement of the Department of Energy and of 16 leading US utilities
in the project is a clear vote of confidence for nuclear power and for
Westinghouse. But Mr Sero also reveals that the company has had several
discussions with European utilities about the AP600 programme.
In the I&amp;C business, Mr Sero sees opportunities developing from decisions
such as that made recently by Ukraine, which is lifting a moratorium on its
three most nearly complete nuclear plants.
In services, he believes Westinghouse has to maintain its market share in
existing business but look to grow its presence elsewhere.
Because it is predominantly a PWR supplier, PWR stations tend to form the
core of its service work. But competition is tough in this sector of the
service business, so Westinghouse wants to expand in other technologies
where it can.
Mr Sero says opportunities include the UK, where Nuclear Electric wants to
subcontract 'outage' work on its Magnox and advanced gas cooled reactors,
and servicing for boiling water reactors where it has done well in the US
through a subsidiary and could expand into Taiwan and Europe.
Hardly surprisingly, Mr Sero is concerned by the anti-nuclear lobby. The
fact that entire countries can take an anti-nuclear stance, thus influencing
neighbouring countries, 'bothers us,' he says.
But, along with many in the industry, he believes suppliers have to continue
to educate countries and address people's fears and concerns.
Two key factors stand in nuclear power's favour, he says: first, concerns
over the effects on the environment of burning fossil fuels for power
generation will enhance nuclear's standing because it is emission-free.
Secondly, he believes that, in the US the Government is recognising the need
to address the issue of nuclear waste, and how it should be stored,
controlled and handled. This, he says, would give confidence to people in
the US, for whom nuclear waste remains a concern even if polls suggest a
majority believe nuclear power should have a role in power generation.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (2): China, Korea lead the
pack - Developing Asia is the world's only growth area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA, South Korea and Indonesia are starting to emerge as the countries in
Asia which will depend most on electricity from nuclear power stations.
Taiwan, which also has strong leanings to nuclear power, may become bogged
down in political and environmental wrangles.
SOUTH KOREA still qualifies technically as a developing country under World
Bank and Asian Development Bank criteria, but this is fast changing as its
economy starts to mirror that of Japan and as its electricity supply
programme approaches Europe's typical capacity level of one kilowatt per
head of population.
The state-controlled Korea Electric Power Company, with its near monopoly,
plans to add 27,805MW in new capacity between now and 2001, says Kepco. The
national plan calls for another 10,000MW between 2001 and 2006. This means
37,000MW of new power over the next 13 years on top of the present 24,120MW.
The nuclear programme has advanced rapidly, largely because of Korea's
dependence on imported fossil fuel to power its grid and its industries.
Like Japan and Taiwan, it took the Middle East oil price crisis to boost the
nuclear programme, led initially by US Westinghouse and General Electric
technology and, more recently, Framatome of France, GEC of the UK and Atomic
Energy of Canada.
At the end of 1992, Korea's nuclear capacity stood at 36 per cent of the
national mix; 17.5 per cent was coal; 22.7 per cent oil; 12.1 per cent
liquefied natural gas; and 5,969MW (10.2 per cent) consisted of hydro and
pumped storage.
The anticipated power plant construction bill between now and 2006 is
estimated at Dollars 36bn. Oil, the dominant fuel in 1970 - at 76 per cent -
will have been almost eliminated.
CHINA last year commissioned its first nuclear power station, a 300MW
pressurised water reactor at Qinshan, southwest of Shanghai. This autumn,
the first of two 950MW pwr units, built at Daya Bay north of Hong Kong by
the Anglo-French consortium of Framatome and GEC Alsthom, began generating
electricity, 70 per cent of which will be distributed by Hong Kong's private
sector utility China Light &amp; Power. The second unit starts up next year.
The project is significant as the largest joint-venture of any type carried
out with China, being 75 per cent owned by the Chinese government and 25 per
cent by the CLP. The plant is operated by the Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint
Venture Company.
China's nuclear authorities, grouped mainly under the China Nuclear Electric
Energy Industry Company, say they plan a further 11 power stations by 2003.
Two are earmarked for the Daya Bay region, though no firm negotiations have
yet taken place.
Four 1,000MW reactors are planned for Dongping. Given their proposed size,
they will be western-supplied. Two 1,000MW reactors, possibly
Russian-suppled, are being considered for Liaoning. The Qinshan complex will
see two new domestically supplied reactors, each of 600MW, reflecting
China's determination to develop its own nuclear technology.
These proposals point to a Chinese nuclear power capability of 11,312MW by
the second half of the first decade of the next century. This will be a
small but significant proportion of its overall capacity, now 180,000MW, of
which 70 per cent is coal-fired and the rest mostly hydroelectric. China's
overall plans are to add 15,000MW of capacity a year through the end of the
century.
INDONESIA has only 30MW of experimental nuclear capacity at Serpong, Java.
But the government wants to build a commercial capability of 7,000MW,
starting with several 600MW reactors to be built on the Muria Peninsula. The
country has scarcely 10,000MW of conventional capacity, and with oil
reserves running down it is diversifying quickly into coal, natural gas and
nuclear.
An evaluation by the New Japan Engineering Consultants group should be
completed by the end of this year, with the first nuclear projects going to
tender by 1995. The tendering will take several years and, say Energy
Ministry officials, first power could be produced by 2005 if the programme
were maintained.
Indonesia's PLN state utility, the National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN) and
the energy ministry are examing designs from General Electric, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries/ Westinghouse/Atomic Energy of Canada and Nuclear Power
International/Framatome. No decision has been made on the choice of reactor
type.
Elsewhere in developing Asia the picture is less certain.
TAIWAN hopes to double capacity to 30,000MW by 2000. Nuclear capacity at
present is about 30 per cent of total capacity and is located at three sites
around the island. Plans to add at least 2,000MW at a proposed fourth site
are going too slowly, say impatient officials.
Bids are due in early December, but it is feared that the anti-nuclear lobby
may hold sway with the project being shelved again, as happened in the late
1980s. This will disappoint Nuclear Electric of the UK which is partnered
with Westinghouse of the US to offer a duplicate of its Sizewell B pwr.
THAILAND'S Electricity Generating Authority this month was pressed by the
World Bank to abandon its nuclear plans as too costly. Thailand was urged to
increase its efforts on natural gas, and to consider nuclear only as a last
option. Like many other countries, the Authority is facing demand pressures,
and plans to boost capacity to 20,000MW from its present 11,000MW. Its
present nuclear plans are at an early stage.
INDIA'S and PAKISTAN'S plans remain more problematical given that neither
country has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty of the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Chinese engineers plan to build a 300MW reactor in Pakistan,
which would be that country's second, after an old 130MW Canadian General
Electric reactor in Karachi, for which parts are no longer available through
conventional sources.
India, with 1,700MW of nuclear, most of it home grown, still plans to boost
this to 10,000MW, but development is at a low ebb, given western refusal to
supply technology and equipment.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (1): Need for a crystal
ball - The future of nuclear electricity is shrouded in deepening
uncertainty. It is still favoured by developing nations in Asia and the
Pacific. But in most western countries, it is bogged down by fears over
safety and worries about costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS possible, some argue likely, that the nuclear power industry will grow
significantly from the base it has established as provider of about 17 per
cent of the world's electricity. But even the optimists acknowledge that it
is a long term prospect which may take more than half a century to fulfil.
In the next 10 to 20 years the industry will have to content itself with
small annual growths in total capacity and a stable perhaps declining
proportion of a faster growing world electricity market.
Before the year 2000, at least, most of the growth will be accounted for by
a handful of Asian and east European countries and France.
In most of the rest of the world, nuclear power companies and the companies
which build their power stations will struggle to consolidate the gains of
the last 40 years in the face of widespread public cynicism about the
industry's costs and safety.
The legacy of the Three Mile Island accident in the US in 1979 and the much
worse Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is that the nuclear industry will have to
spend increasing sums of money to make both its existing plants and new
stations far safer than would be expected of a unit fired by other fuels.
Nor, in the face of growing pressure on government finances throughout the
world, will it be easy for power utilities to gain access to the funds
necessary to build nuclear stations, as Nuclear Electric of the UK is likely
to find in the next two to three years, as it looks for capital to build a
second pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk.
Capital markets are extremely wary of committing money to nuclear stations
which are far more expensive, and take perhaps twice the time, to build than
gas, oil or coal-fired stations.
The markets are concerned about rates of return needed to recover the
capital costs and remain sceptical that utilities make enough provision for
future decommissioning and reprocessing costs when making estimates about
the costs of nuclear power.
The undoubted economic advantage of nuclear stations is that uranium, the
raw material needed to fuel them, is cheaper than inputs for virtually all
other forms of power and this advantage will grow as resources of coal, oil
and gas become scarcer and more expensive.
It was partly for this reason that the World Energy Council, a
non-government organisation representing more than 100 countries, predicted
in a recent report, Energy For Tomorrow's World, that nuclear power is one
of two energy sources most likely to meet electricity demand in the second
half of the next century, the other being coal.
However the council's prediction is based on the assumption that world gas
and oil will begin to dry up within 50 years.
That is by no means certain. The energy industry's critics believe that oil
and gas companies consistently under-estimate reserves as part of an effort
to keep prices high.
Gordon MacKerron, of Sussex University's Science Policy and Research Unit,
is among those who believes reserves may last longer. 'We are discovering
gas four times faster than annual consumption and have done for at least a
decade,' he points out.
If the long term prospects for nuclear power are debatable, controversy also
surrounds the short term outlook. Latest figures from the International
Atomic Energy Authority are that there are 72 nuclear units under
construction against an existing world total of about 424 units.
But some forecasters and academics argue that this is over-optimistic
because some of the plants will not be completed. In addition some of the
new plant will replace stations which are being retired.
Prospects around the world vary considerably.
ASIA: Japan has the world's largest expansion programme, having set a target
of increasing the proportion of nuclear power in electricity generation from
under 30 per cent to 40 per cent, but there are doubts about whether it can
achieve it.
Japan's enthusiasm for nuclear power stems from its lack of natural fuel
resources and its experiences from oil price rises. If the plans were met,
the current capacity of 35,000 megawatts, supplied by 42 stations, would
increase to 75,000MW.
Utilities are acutely conscious, however, of the growing power of the
environmental lobby and believe the lack of potential sites for building new
plants and the stabilisation of Middle East politics will dampen the
government's enthusiasm.
Korea, like Japan, is also anxious to diversify from other forms of fuel and
is constructing three stations to add to the nine providing 7000MW which are
already in operation. Among non-nuclear power countries, the most likely new
entrant is Indonesia, but it is unlikely to make a decision before 2002.
China and India provide perhaps the best hope for the industry in the medium
to long term, with the construction of nine plants between them already
under way, and more likely to follow.
AMERICA. Since the Three Mile Island accident there have been no new orders
in the US and several projects have been cancelled.
However, US companies are at the forefront of technological advances by
developing a new generation of safer reactors and the government is in talks
with the industry to ease complications surrounding site licensing.
There are hopes of new orders within the next few years. Previous enthusiasm
in south America for nuclear power has been dampened by debt problems and is
unlikely to revive in the medium term.
WEST EUROPE. With the exception of France, and just possibly the UK,
prospects are uniformly bleak. France has eight reactors under construction
or planned and the UK's Nuclear Electric has requested planning permission
for Sizewell C in Suffolk.
However, even if Nuclear Electric can gain permission, it faces a far more
difficult task in getting finance for a project expected to cost up to
Pounds 3.5bn. It also has to steer a successful course through the
government's nuclear review, planned to start later this year, and likely to
consider whether further nuclear power stations are necessary.
Most of the rest of western Europe has imposed moratoria on nuclear power.
Optimists place their hopes of revival in Finland - even though its
parliament recently turned down plans for a fifth reactor - and in Italy
which closed its nuclear stations after Chernobyl but may consider new
stations if safety improves.
There are also grounds for hope that Sweden may not end up being as
anti-nuclear as it has planned. Sweden has a policy of phasing out nuclear
energy but nearly half of its electricity come from nuclear power and
efforts to replace this are progressing slowly.
German prospects look poor amid difficulties of reaching a consensus on
nuclear power.
The environmental lobby is powerful, one reason why none of the nuclear
reactors in the former East Germany are in operation.
EAST EUROPE. Russia has revived plans for significant expansion, aiming to
increase nuclear's share from 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the electricity
generation by 2030. Although it has plentiful supplies of oil and gas it
needs to export these for hard currency.
But the same lack of resources may force a severe scaling down of the plans
which involve the construction of more than 20 reactors. At the very least
Russia is likely to need World Bank help if it is to proceed.
In the Ukraine, unable and unwilling to buy Russian gas, the parliament
recently voted to resume construction of three nuclear plants where work had
stopped and the continued operation of Chernobyl.
That worries the rest of the world nuclear industry which fears that another
accident like 1986, whether at Chernobyl or anywhere else, will put plans
for increasing expansion off for years and possibly for ever.
The need to reduce the likelihood of a further disaster prompted the
industry in 1989 to form the World Association of Nuclear Operators.
Since then the association has helped facilitate a series of exchanges
between eastern and western nuclear scientists.
Mr Remy Carle, chairman of the WANO governing board and deputy general
manager of Electricite de France, told the Uranium Institute annual
symposium in London recently that avoidance of accidents was one of four
lines of attack the industry should pursue to help bring about a revival.
The other three were resolving problems over waste, developing 'even safer'
power stations and fuel designs, and trying to make nuclear power accepted
as a 'perfectly normal energy resource'. Providing these problems are
tackled, he says, the industry is set for recovery. 'The nuclear industry
will take off again when there is a strong need for it.'
That implies what many other people in the industry believe: that conditions
for growth depend on the world economy, supplies of other fuels and other
factors over which the nuclear industry has little control.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Papers continue to lose sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH OFFICIAL newspaper circulation figures showing a pattern of continued
decline, the consultancy group Henley Centre warned yesterday that the
imposition of value added tax on newspapers and magazines could have a
'devastating' impact.
In the six months from May to October total sales of national dailies fell
by 1.69 per cent to just over 14m while the Sundays fell by 2.65 per cent to
15.8m.
Only three daily newspapers - The Sun, The Times and Today - increased sales
in the period.
The biggest loser was The Independent, which fell by 10.95 per cent to
333,647. Apart from Sunday Sport, which fell by 17.2 per cent, the worst
loser of the Sundays was The Independent on Sunday, which fell by 8 per cent
to 368,246. Only The Sunday Times and the Sunday Telegraph showed gains.
The Henley Centre argues that because newspaper circulations are already in
long-term decline 'VAT could send national newspapers into an inescapable
downward spiral'.
It believes the average price of dailies would rise from 30p to 34p and the
price of Sundays would rise from 62p to 70p. It says VAT at 17.5 per cent
would lead to a 6 per cent circulation loss for national dailies and 12 per
cent for Sunday titles.
'This is an overnight loss equivalent to that experienced by the industry
over the 1989-1992 recession,' says Henley, which based its forecasts on
econometric modelling work.
Henley believes publishers are likely to try to absorb some of the increased
costs but the effects would still be considerable. It forecasts a spiral of
declining circulations, higher prices and falling quality.
The relationship between price rises and circulation decreases has in the
past tended to show that a price rise of 10 per cent reduces sales by 6 per
cent.
The Treasury has estimated that VAT at 17.5 per cent on national newspapers
would yield Pounds 375m a year. Henley says this would be less than Pounds
250m because of price absorption.
The centre asks: 'Would the political fallout of VAT on national newspapers
be worth it for 0.5 per cent contribution to a public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 50bn?'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Rover 'committed serious breach' of EC rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, committed 'a
serious breach' of European competition regulations by limiting its dealers'
ability to offer discounts, the European Commission said yesterday.
Rover made arrangements with its UK dealers that sought to limit discounts
offered by the dealers on its Rover 200, 400 and 800 car ranges and on sales
of Land Rover products.
The arrangements, which were in breach of Treaty of Rome competition rules,
were in place between about May 1986 and October 1990.
The commission said yesterday that the dealer agreements were terminated
when they came to the notice of Rover's senior management. The carmaker had
voluntarily notified the Office of Fair Trading and subsequently the
commission.
Rover said that it believed that the restrictive practices had little
commercial effect, but it had taken several steps to remedy the position
including the provision of finance to start an impartial direct advice
service for car buyers.
It has agreed to implement an anti-trust compliance programme, is donating
Pounds 1m to fund the two projects to benefit UK car buyers, has made a full
and voluntary disclosure of the arrangements to the competition authorities
and has agreed to reimburse dealers for any discounts which were withheld.
It has also written to its dealers saying that it 'will not and cannot
legally' discriminate against any dealer that 'has discounted list prices or
has discounted them beyond any particular level'.
Rover said yesterday it had agreed to fund two projects to be run by the
Association for Consumer Research, the parent body of the Consumers'
Association, and by the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, an allied
organisation.
In the first project a database will be created to help consumers get better
value for money, incorporating the latest information on dealer margins -
and hence the potential for gaining discounts - EC car price comparisons and
insurance and other running costs. The second project will provide new car
assessments for people with special needs, in particular the elderly and
those with disabilities.
Rover is voluntarily funding these two schemes because it has been unable to
identify either individual consumers who may have suffered financial loss as
a result of its price discounting practices or to quantify the level of such
a loss.
Individual customers can still claim compensation against Rover or any Rover
dealer, however, and it is still open to the UK competition authorities to
take legal action against Rover. The commission has decided not to take
legal action, however, because of the voluntary steps already taken by the
company.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Christmas tree demand 'strong'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS TREE growers are struggling to meet demand, the British Christmas
Tree Growers' Association said yesterday.
The association estimated demand at about 5m this year, but said the
strength of demand meant that some trees might not be of a high standard.
Growers report that forward buying is encouraging. 'They have not found it
easy to meet the demand,' the association said.
It added: 'The trees have grown well and there will be some very good
quality fresh Christmas trees, but inevitably because of the demand there
will be some trees which will not be up to the standard we would like.'
The association said about 1m trees would be imported this year, mainly from
Denmark and Belgium, which was slightly less than the number imported last
year.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Minister broadens contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday added the management of vehicle fleets and
on-street parking to its programme of local authority contracting-out.
Mr Tony Baldry, the local government minister, said at a London conference
on market testing that the government was proposing that compulsory
competitive tendering for these areas should come in on April 1 1995. The
same would apply to security work six months later.
The additions mark the first broadening of competitive tendering for local
author-ities for more than a year.
The government plans to introduce the changes ahead of starting competitive
tendering in the Pounds 5bn white-collar services area, which will include
housing management, information technology and finance.
Tendering on some of these will start next summer but contracts will not
start until mid-1995.
Mr Baldry said compulsion should be the last resort in competitive
tendering. 'Local authorities should want to ensure that they get the best
value for local residents for the services they deliver without being
required to do so,' he added.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Builders fear more spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOW LEVEL of British investment in new construction compared with the
country's main European rivals was 'truly alarming', Sir Brian Hill,
president of the Building Employers Confederation, said yesterday.
He appealed to ministers not to cut public spending on construction in the
Budget, saying that this would only worsen the competitive position of the
country's construction industry.
Sir Brian, speaking at a conference in London, said that Britain accounted
for only 10 per cent of all European construction output. Germany accounted
for 23 per cent, France 15 per cent and Italy 16 per cent.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, speaking at the same conference,
warned the UK industry that no reasonable chancellor could ignore the
country's 'over-borrowing'. He said: 'It is not possible to imagine one
could overcome these difficulties in a way in which anyone could expect to
get out of it scot-free.'
Mr Gummer appealed to the industry to boost its profitability by improving
the quality of its performance and by reducing waste to make it more
competitive in world markets. He said that of the 400m tonnes of material
used each year by the building industry, about a tenth was wasted 'in one
way or another'.
Sir Brian told the minister that UK spending on construction in proportion
to the population was lower than that of Switzerland, Germany, France,
Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Austria.
He said: 'Failure to invest in new buildings and the nation's infrastructure
must in due course impede or handicap the country's ability to compete both
in European and world markets.'
Sir Brian warned that any further erosion of the domestic construction
market due to public spending cuts would cause further job losses and
company failures.
The permanent loss of UK capacity would force customers to buy from abroad
when the industry recovered.
Sir Brian said: 'Industry at large and construction in particular will only
achieve sustained recovery if the chancellor underlines the government's
commitment to growth by taking such measures necessary to restore and
sustain confidence, to invest both at a personal and corporate level.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Disposals by quango praised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Audit Office, the watchdog on public expenditure, bestows a
rare accolade today in its report on the sale of the property portfolio of
English Estates.
The audit office says the sale of 266 factories, offices and workshops
between April 1990 and March 1993 realised Pounds 158m, a figure generally
in line with pre-sale valuations.
English Estates is a quango whose main role is to manage business premises
in England's assisted areas.
Yields compared favourably with regional averages in spite of the
unattractive location of some of the property and the depressed state of
industrial and commercial property.
Sales to sitting tenants were the most successful, the audit office finds,
achieving prices significantly higher than with other types of sale.
Open-market sales appeared more successful when property was marketed
selectively, a process which gave bidders improved prospects of success.
No provisions to take back profits on resale were imposed since this was
thought likely to reduce the proceeds of the sale. The audit office found no
evidence of significant reselling of property, although one of two onward
sales did achieve a significantly higher price.
The procedures adopted by English Estates were 'prudent and generally in
accordance with best practice', the office says. It warns against flooding
the market with such property, however, particularly when other public
bodies are disposing of land and buildings.
Although the property portfolio was to have been sold by April this year,
the state of the property market has meant that less than half was disposed
of then.
The Department of Trade and Industry has now set a deadline of April 1996
for the sale of the remaining 204 properties worth Pounds 208m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Engineering throughput is reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING companies in South Yorkshire and the north Midlands are working
at an average of only 72 per cent capacity, an informal survey for the
Department of Trade and Industry shows.
The Sheffield Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation, which
covers the area, was asked by the DTI to help assess what was happening
among manufacturers.
Nearly half of the 71 members who responded reported they had reduced
capacity during the recession, mainly by stopping night shifts and
downsizing factories. Although 11 per cent said they were at full capacity,
the rest ranged from 25 per cent to 93 per cent, with 72 per cent the
average.
Lack of demand was the main reason given for plant not being used.
Mr Nicholas Kemp, director of the Sheffield Association, said yesterday:
'There is so much spare capacity that even if there is a significant
pick-up, at least 60 per cent have more than enough to cope.'
Mr Kemp said that some companies had already invested in more efficient
equipment, which was a priority for future competitiveness.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Derbyshire force fails audit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERBYSHIRE police force has become the first to be refused a certificate
of efficiency for the second consecutive year.
Mr Geoffrey Dear, HM Inspector of Constabulary, said in a report released
yesterday that progress had been made, but without adequate resources
problems would continue to grow against a backdrop of rising crime.
Derbyshire is the only one of 43 forces in England and Wales to be refused
the certificate. Refusal is likely to have no effect in practice - although
the home secretary has power to refuse to release funds to the force or send
in a commissioner to run it.
Mr John Newing, chief constable of Derbyshire, said: 'The crucial issue is
one of a shortage of funds, a problem familiar to many police forces.' To
stay within budget, he said, the force had to keep 40 police officer posts
vacant and 26 civilian jobs had not been filled. He called on Mr Dear to
tell the Derbyshire Constabulary exactly what it needed to do to regain the
certificate.
Mr Dear said people had complained of long police response times, outbreaks
of burglary in residential streets and lack of visible patrolling in rural
areas. Last year crime in Derbyshire rose by 16 per cent, the second highest
rise of any force in the country.
Lord Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the force would be allocated an
extra Pounds 2m for measures such as additional vehicles and equipment. It
had also been given a set of measurable targets.

FT  17 NOV 93 / OFT revokes alarm companies' licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE COMPANIES selling burglar alarms lost their consumer credit licences
yesterday after complaints about high-pressure selling and customers being
frightened into buying. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said some
of the business practices used by the companies were 'abhorrent'.
The Office of Fair Trading said Advanced Security Systems (which previously
traded as Property Watch UK), as well as Vector Security and Vector
Homelinked Security, were not fit to hold the licences. The three companies
are all run from the same office in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, and
have overlapping directors.
The two Vector companies, which turn over a total of about Pounds 3.5m a
year, are to appeal. They continue to operate through newspaper
advertisements, mail order and for cash.
Advanced Security Systems, the only one of the three companies to employ
salespeople, closed voluntarily six months ago after the OFT had
investigated evidence from Trafford Borough Council's trading standards
department following complaints.
The OFT said former employees had testified that some sales presentations
had been conducted in an atmosphere of fear. It said salespeople would tell
potential customers that burglars put chip pans or kettles on the stove to
be able to throw boiling fat or water over anyone who disturbed them.
It added that newspaper cuttings and photographs of assaulted elderly people
and children and vandalised homes were used in selling.
Some salespeople were found to have offered householders a security survey
which was then used to persuade them to install alarms, the OFT added. Some
presentations were dragged out - in one case for more than nine hours - to
wear down sales resistance.
Mr Alan O'Brien, co-owner and manager of the companies, said yesterday there
had been only 26 complaints in more than 11,000 sales over four years.
Advanced Security Systems had employed salespeople on a basic wage, plus
car, with the bulk of earnings coming from commission.
People wanting credit were passed on to an independent and reputable finance
company. He had been 'horrified' to hear of 'sales misdemeanours', which he
said were confined to 'five or six salesmen only' operating in Greater
Manchester. Sales training had never included the methods described by the
OFT.
The group employed about 100 people at peak but the two Vector operations
now have about 25, including installation engineers.
No credit is now offered. Mr O'Brien said the companies would appeal
'because although we don't need to sell on credit, we would like the dignity
of getting our licences back'.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Error puts school in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS can shoot to the top of the league tables if someone at the
Department for Education makes a typing error.
Yesterday Chapel-en-le-Frith school in Stockport, Cheshire, enjoyed a
fleeting moment of fame in the nation's newsrooms. According to the league
tables it had only one pupil in the sixth form, but he or she was the new
Einstein - amassing 54 A-level points, equivalent to four grade As, one B
and one C.
The school's headmaster had an even better story - the education department
had given the accolade of top A-level performer to a school which did not
even have a sixth form.
Officials said external contractors had made a computer error, which will be
corrected when booklets of the results are distributed to schools.
Five other schools briefly benefited from high-performing, but non-existent,
A-level candidates.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Insolvency service fails to speed up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's insolvency service failed to meet its performance targets
for timely action against the directors of failed companies, its annual
report said yesterday.
It submitted just 33.9 per cent of disqualification reports against
directors within 15 months, against a planned target of 80 per cent.
It also submitted only 57.1 per cent of prosecution reports within 10 months
against companies and 74.1 per cent for bankruptcies, against targets of 80
per cent in both cases.
The service, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and
Industry, was heavily criticised last month by the National Audit Office for
failing to deal with adequate numbers of disqualification orders against the
directors of failed companies.
But its low performance came in a year in which 42,692 insolvencies were
handled. Just 36,000 were expected.
The service reported to creditors on assets and liabilities within nine
weeks in 72.1 per cent of cases, against a target of 75 per cent.
But it reduced the average unit cost of the initial stages of cases by
substantially more than its target figure. It also outperformed its plan in
dealing with certain outstanding payments.
In the year to March 31 1993 the service generated fee income of Pounds
23.9m from its Insolvency Services Account, compared with Pounds 19.6m last
year. Costs were up to Pounds 63.5m from Pounds 56.9m in the previous year.
Mr Peter Joyce, inspector general and chief executive, said the rising
number of personal and corporate failures had placed pressures on the
organisation.
He said the service had reviewed its policies to give greater priority to
prosecutions and disqualifications that had caused most public interest and
creditor concern.

FT  17 NOV 93 / When raw results are not enough: Dearing leads quest for
added value; Boys catch up with girls after 16
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY DO some schools perform better than others?
'Raw' examination results in themselves are not enough to show how well a
school is performing.
Sir Ron Dearing, who heads the quango in charge of the national curriculum
and testing, has been asked to examine methods of measuring 'value added' -
the extent to which pupils have improved when they leave a school, compared
with when they started.
All the experimental 'value-added' projects so far carried out show much
more narrow differences between school performance than the 'raw' league
tables.
Some schools also shift position substantially. But all reveal that a
school's management and teaching can significantly affect its standing.
Several factors determine performance in the main league tables:
Selectivity
Grammar schools, whose pupils have had to pass an exam at the age of 11 or
12 to gain entrance, ought to perform better in league tables than
comprehensives - otherwise the 11-plus exams would have been disastrous.
Some comprehensive school catchment areas also tend to have more
academically able children than others - for example, Cherwell school in
north Oxford, a top performer at A-level, teaches the children of many
university lecturers.
Gender
This is controversial, but girls develop at a different rate from boys, and
educational evidence suggests that they are more intellectually mature at
the age of 16, when GCSEs are taken. Boys then catch up, and the differences
between the genders is much less marked at the point when A-levels are
taken.
This year 55 per cent of girls' school pupils passed five GCSEs at O-level
grades, compared with only 48 per cent of boys at boys' schools. A study of
London schools by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities found that
girls scored 2.6 more GCSE points on average than boys - equivalent to a C
rather than an F in one exam.
Family backgrounds and social conditions
As the table on the opposite page shows, the correlation between social
deprivation and academic performance at the level of local education
authorities is so close that the problem of academic underperformance might
almost be labelled a social one. School management
This is variable which schools can do most about. And it makes a difference.
Professor John Howson, professor of education at Oxford Brookes University,
pointed to the sometimes marked disparity between boys' and girls' grammar
schools at A-level, when gender is a negligible issue. Their social
catchment areas are identical and selection is determined for them by local
authorities.
Most such schools perform similarly. But this year's government survey shows
repeated differences - for example in Tunbridge Wells, Kent the girls'
grammar averaged 18.2 A-level points this year (20.1 last year), compared
with 12.4 at the boys' grammar (13.1 last year).
In Bournemouth, Dorset, however, the boys' school averaged 22 points
compared with 15.4 at the girls' school.
Dr Howson said these disparities could be explained only by differences in
the schools' management. He said: 'It doesn't matter whether a school's
management is very democratic, or quite autocratic, as long as everyone is
working together.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / IBM offshoot with a future to look after: In Hampshire, no
one thinks they are prolonging the death agonies of a hopeless case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
UNDER THE bonnet of Aston Martin's new DB7 sports car, which enters
production in April next year, is evidence of IBM Havant's determination to
prove that it can make its own way in the world.
The electronic engine management system, key to the car's performance, has
been designed by Zytek Automotive but it will be manufactured in volumes of
up to 700 a year by the Hampshire-based manufacturing and development
division of International Business Machines - the world's largest computer
maker.
The manufacturing deal is one of about a dozen that Havant has struck in the
past six months with customers outside IBM and which seem likely to
guarantee Havant's survival, with the jobs of the 1,500 people it employs.
Havant was earlier this year redesignated as an 'industrial business
centre', owned by IBM but controlled by local management and with its own
profit and loss responsibility.
It was one of four European plants that the troubled computer giant had
deemed 'surplus to requirements' and which had to make a satisfactory profit
on their own or face closure.
IBM has been losing money heavily in the past two years, hit globally by
recession and price wars in the computer business. It has been restructuring
on a grand scale.
In retrospect it seems the threat to Havant was more apparent than real. The
facility's main role is the manufacture of hard disk drives and controllers
for IBM's small computer systems.
This year it will make nearly 1m hard disk drives for IBM. Next year, with
volumes boosted by a contract from the US disk drive manufacturer Western
Digital, the total is likely to be 2m.
For some components Havant is IBM's only source worldwide. This year, for
example, it will turn out more than 1m flexible electronic circuits,
essential technical wizardry for tiny, portable electronic gadgets. It will
also make about 4,000 memory sub-systems for IBM's mid-range computers.
Its senior executives see themselves managing a vigorous business rather
than prolonging the death agonies of a hopeless case. Mr Ken Wilkie, chief
executive, was in charge of logistical support for IBM UK's manufacturing
operations while Ms Catherine Marsden, head of marketing, worked directly
with Mr Nick Temple, IBM UK chief executive, on his plans to restructure the
British subsidiary.
This year, Mr Wilkie said, turnover would amount to about Pounds 500,000, of
which 15 per cent would be derived from work undertaken for companies
outside IBM.
Havant has established its own business brand - 'Xyratex' - to distinguish
its engineering work for outside customers.
Offerings will include design, manufacturing and full support services
including logistics, quality assurance and laboratory facilities. A key
selling point, Mr Wilkie believes, is its ability to control the product
manufacturing process from design and development to delivery and service.
The Xyratex name was created by the style consultancy Interbrand.
There is a lighter side to Xyratex's work. Among its creations is the 'Note
Station', a system it developed for the Music Writer company, which prints
on demand the complete score of a musical work - transposing it into any key
the customer wants along the way. It also makes Winners All, a gambling
machine.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Closer tutoring's edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE PERSONAL attention seems to be one of the keys to higher exam results.
That is certainly the finding at Charters School in Berkshire, the
third-placed local authority-maintained comprehensive at A-level according
to a recent FT survey.
This year 61 per cent of its pupils managed five GCSEs or more at grades A
to C - comfortably ahead of the national average.
But the school's head, Mr Barrie Mitchell, remains deeply sceptical of
league tables and has concentrated instead on introducing the National
Record of Achievement.
This presents pupils with folders in which all their achievements in both
extra-curricular as well as academic fields can be assessed.
Keeping the folders up to date requires teachers meeting pupils individually
and regularly. It also helps ensure that pupils are kept on track.
St Paul's school in Barnes, west London, the top A-level school in the FT
survey, has a similar approach to ensuring that every pupil is known very
well by at least one tutor. Tutor groups include equal numbers from each
year of the school.
Every boy at the school will keep the same tutor throughout his career. With
that kind of attention, St Paul's says, its teachers can build an almost
unerring ability to spot boys that have the most potential, and those that
need the most help.
A study looking at generally more deprived schools in inner London boroughs,
produced for the Association of Metropolitan Authorities by London's
Institute of Education made a similar finding, suggests that factors such as
these must make a difference.
Once factors such as background, school selection policy and gender had been
taken into account, a variation between the best and worst pupils from an
average 51.6 GCSE points to 12.4 points (where an A is seven points and a G
is worth one) was transformed into a variation of from 9.8 points above
average to 8.2 points below.
The improvement shows the importance of social factors, but also suggests
that some schools were able to deliver the equivalent of two more GCSE grade
As for their pupils than others, even when other factors were held equal.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Independents remain at top in A-levels and GCSEs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT schools re-main firmly at the top of the league tables for GCSE
and A-level performance.
Of the top 200 schools ranked by GCSE, with A-levels used to break any ties,
only 58 come from the state sector.
At A-level, a more important factor in the minds of parents when shopping
for independent schools, the dominance is greater with only 23 state schools
appearing in the top 200, according to the FT - 1,000 survey, which uses
more detailed A-level figures than the government and was published last
month.
Yet both figures represent a big improvement by the state sector and show
that non-fee-paying schools present a more viable alternative than many
realise. But the government's league tables have done little to resolve the
debate over whether independent schools are worth the money. In some ways
they obscure the issue.
The Independent Schools Information Service objects to the way the
government's tables have been drawn up because they take account only of
those pupils taking GCSEs who were 15 at the start of the school year and
not of those who were - as is often the case in the most academic
independent schools - younger.
Most bizarrely affected is St Paul's Girls' School in west London, where
according to ISIS, 87.4 per cent of all GCSEs taken were passed with a grade
A this year, and 99.6 per cent passed at grade C or better.
On A-levels it is the most consistent girls' school in the country over the
past five years, the FT's survey shows.
However, the government's stress on age-groups placed the school 247th, with
94 per cent of its 15-year-olds passing the equivalent of five GCSEs at
grade C or above. The remaining pupils had probably taken their exams
already.
As with the state sector the most successful independent schools are those
which are most selective - big city day schools with large catchment areas -
such as this year's top school, King Edward's in Birmingham. According to
ISIS enrolment at independent girls' day schools increased slightly last
year in spite of the recession. But the number of boarders fell 6 per cent
as parents decided that the schools, with average annual fees of Pounds
9,400, had priced themselves out of the market.
School fees inflation is declining, but still registered an 8 per cent rise
for boarders last year.
Falling applications reduced the degree to which boarding schools could
select, and has therefore made their academic performance look worse.
Boys' schools, in particular, are done no favours by GCSE performance - for
example Repton finished 468th, Rugby 469th and Haileybury 470th, all with 85
per cent gaining five or more passes at grades A to C.
The league tables, flawed though they are, show that the state sector puts
up a better challenge than many think. But parents living in inner-city
areas are still likely to find them strong evidence for looking at the
independent sector.

FT  17 NOV 93 / More pass in vocational courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUPILS taking vocational qualifications, which assess practical skills such
as dressmaking and photography, obtained superior results to those taking
academic subjects, the government's league tables show.
At Marshalls Park School in Romford, Essex, for example, all 232 of the
school's 15-year-olds were entered for GCSE examinations and the City &amp;
Guilds Diploma of Vocational Education (Foundation). Twenty eight per cent
achieved five or more grades at GCSE while 93 per cent achieved their
vocational qualification.
Mr Cedrick Hendricks, headmaster of the comprehensive school, said: 'It is
not that vocational qualifications are easier than academic ones. They are
just different.
'The vocational qualification, which is an umbrella qualification, is made
up of several units in subjects like law, technology and administration.
'Some of these units can be achieved after six or seven-week courses. It can
be easier to motivate students on these shorter courses, which may, for
example, include visits to the law courts. In addition it is easier for
teachers to make sure that pupils are on target.'
Vocational qualifications, which assess a person's practical competence to
do a task, have been offered in a small number of schools for some years.
They have long been regarded by parents and employers, however, as a poor
relation to academic qualifications. This is a perception which the
government is seeking to change. For example, General National Vocational
Qualifications (GNVQs) are being offered to students older than 16 in
England and Wales as a vocational equivalent to A-levels. National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) are available for people in work.
Both parents and employers have expressed anxiety about the new
qualifications. Mr Hendricks said when two years ago his school decided to
offer vocational qualifications there was resistance from parents.
Mr Hendricks said parents were starting to see their validity. 'They see
that there is a certificate of achievement and that it can contribute
towards a further qualification.'
Less than 10 per cent of the 5,200 schools in England and Wales offered
vocational qualifications in 1993 - with numbers varying from all the pupils
in a school to just one or two.
The schools with most entrants were Marshalls Park School, Knutsford High
School in Cheshire, Thomas Bennett Community College in Tilgate, West
Sussex, and Moseley School, West Midlands.
The two awarding bodies for pre-16-year-olds are BTEC and City &amp; Guilds. The
organisations have different origins and are technically in competition with
each other. BTEC is newer than City &amp; Guilds, which has its origins in the
livery companies that provided training for artisans and craftsmen.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Manchester council attacks truancy figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUANCY figures released today shed fresh light on the extent of the
problem, but there is still controversy about their accuracy.
The figures have been fiercely contested by some local authorities.
Labour-controlled Manchester is home to the 'worst' school for truancy on
education department figures, with more than one in five pupils absent
without leave at any one time.
But the authority rejected the government's figures, which showed that it
suffered the worst truancy in the country with pupils skipping 6.4 per cent
of lessons on aver-age.
Describing the figures as 'spurious', the authority said Manchester had
24,450 pupils, while the education department's figures implied that it had
only 13,333. Criteria could vary between authorities and even from school to
school.
For example, much parentally condoned absence might be truancy by any
reason-able definition, but might still be regarded as authorised absences
by some schools.
Education department plans to publish figures for authorised absences next
year might only emphasise areas badly hit by influenza epidemics.
The worst records at primary school level were suffered by the London
authorities of Lambeth, Newham, Kensington and Chelsea, and Tower Hamlets,
all of which saw 40 per cent or more of pupils play truant at least once.
Nationally, pupils who have played truant at some time amount to 12 per
cent.
Truancy and deprivation correlate closely, as the main table for local
education authorities shows.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has said truancy is 'a contributory
factor in juvenile crime'.
He pointed to Cambridge University research which showed that 48 per cent of
young offenders were truants.
But a government-funded study by the University of North London showed no
definite link with crime, although it suggested that the scale of the
problem was even greater than the government's figures showed, with 30.5 per
cent of children playing truant at least once in their last two years of
compulsory schooling.
The North London survey found that the greatest cause was dissatisfaction
with lessons, cited by two-thirds of truants.
One in five did so played truant to avoid particular lessons, with physical
education, games, French, maths and English the most unpopular subjects.
Disapproval of parents and teachers was the most powerful control on
truants, suggesting that 'school ethos is the critical variable'.

<TEXT>
MORE PUPILS in Wales achieved five or more GCSE passes with A to C grades
this year than in 1992, with the proportion rising from a third to 37 per
cent.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday described this performance as a
'marked improvement'. He said there had also been an increase in the
proportion of 15-year-olds entering an examination at the GCSE or CoE level,
with the numbers rising to more than 19 in 20. Of these pupils 94 per cent,
a rise of 1 percentage point, passed at least one examination.
The examination results for Wales, which are published today, show that the
proportion of pupils attaining five or more GCSE passes with A to C grades
was lowest in Mid Glamorgan. The county, which includes the towns of Merthyr
Tydfil and Bridgend, scored only 29 per cent compared with the highest score
of 44 per cent in the south-western rural county of Dyfed. The second
highest score, of 40 per cent, was returned by another rural county, Powys.
At A and AS level, Mid Glamorgan was also bottom on a new measure of
achievement converting grades into points, while Powys came top of this
category.
Overall, 14 per cent of Welsh pupils achieved points equivalent to gaining A
level passes with A to C grades, and 6 per cent achieved the equivalent of
at least three grade A results. Students at all Wales' further education and
sixth form colleges achieved no more points on average than the schools in
Mid Glamorgan.
Among independent schools, pupils at St Michael's School in Dyfed scored 100
per cent in achieving at least five GCSE passes with A to C grades, but only
26 pupils at the school entered. In the principality as a whole the most
successful independent schools at this level included Howell's School in
South Glamorgan (95 per cent from a total of 79 pupils) and Monmouth School
in Gwent (95 per cent, 93 pupils).
The most successful state schools at GCSE level were Cardiff High School (72
per cent, 160 pupils); Gyfun Bro Hyrddin at Carmarthen (71 per cent, 83
pupils); and Bishopston Comprehensive, Swansea (67 per cent, 184 pupils).
At A level the average points score for all Welsh schools was 14. Among
independent schools results were highly variable. The highest point scores
were achieved by Haberdashers Monmouth School for Girls, Gwent (23); St
Michael's School, Dyfed (22); and St Gerards School Trust, Gwynedd (22). The
grant-maintained Stanwell Comprehensive School in South Glamorgan scored 21.
Among state schools at A level the most successful were Caereinion High
School at Llanfair Caereinion, Powys (22); Denbigh High School in Clwyd
(20); and Croesyceiliog Comprehensive at Cwmbran (19).
Of colleges, the best A level results on the points basis were scored by
Gorseinon College in West Glamorgan, with 306 students achieving an average
score of 16 points.

Charters School in Berkshire (above), the third-placed local

close attention is the key to results. The school, sceptical of league
tables, concentrates on the National Record of Achievement. This presents

FT  17 NOV 93 / League tables boost exam performance: Scores up 8% this
year; Strong results from single-sex schools; Only 58 of top 200 performers
from state sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
A YEAR after publication of the first league tables there can be no doubt
that the publication of exam results has changed the performance of
Britain's schools. But it is not clear whether the quality of education has
been improved.
This year's tables demonstrate that with the publication of exam scores
schools are forced to focus more closely on improving results. More
precisely, it focuses them on achieving the targets which are set by the
league table compilers.
Last year 38.1 per cent of the 15-16-year-olds in England gained five GCSE
passes at grades A to C, the equivalent of the old O-level pass. This year
the figure has risen to 41.1 per cent - an 8 per cent increase.
The number of children achieving five passes at grades A to G, the
equivalent of an old CSE pass, has also risen this year, from 82.0 per cent
to 84.3 per cent. Even the number passing just one GCSE at these grades has
risen from 91.3 per cent to 93 per cent.
Last year's headlines on the league tables dwelt at length on the disparity
of performance between different local education authorities. That disparity
is no less this year. More than half the pupils in Kingston-upon-Thames, the
leafy borough in south-west London, scored five or more GCSEs at grades A to
C. In the Merseyside borough of Knowsley, just one in six pupils achieved
this target.
But there are even bigger disparities between state schools in the same
authorities. In Oxfordshire, for example, 44.7 per cent of pupils scored
five or more GCSEs at grades A to C this year. The scores in the county's 35
comprehensive schools vary from 65 per cent at Wheatley Park School, Holtham
to 18 per cent at Oxford School in Oxford.
Analysis of the results by the FT shows significant variations between
different types of schools and between the sexes.
Grant-maintained schools, which have opted out of local authority control,
perform significantly better than average with 47.1 per cent achieving
five-plus GCSEs at grades A to C. This may, however, reflect nothing more
than the disproportionate share of selective schools which have opted out.
The strong performance of single sex schools - already noted in the FT 1,000
A-level league tables - is also demonstrated by this year's results. In
mixed schools 35 per cent of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at grades A to
C, compared with 48 per cent in boys' schools and 55 per cent in girls'
schools.
Such figures are bound to increase the pressure from parents for single-sex
education for girls which led Shenfield High School in Essex to announce
that from next year boys and girls would be separated for classes.
There remains a strong link between the performance of LEAs and their social
environment. The Department of the Environment uses its 'Additional
Educational Needs' index as a measure of social deprivation when
distributing grant to local authorities. This reflects three factors:
The percentage of children whose parents claim social security benefits
The percentage of children from lone-parent families
The proportion of children born outside the UK.
Six of the 10 worst performing education authorities are also in the bottom
10 in terms of this social deprivation index. Four of the top 10 performers
are the four least deprived authorities on the government's index.
This year for the first time the league tables show information on truancy
rates. Although the value of the measure is under dispute it shows the
reassuringly low level of 1 per cent of sessions missed through unauthorised
absence from school. Just less than one in eight pupils has missed one or
more half days.
However, there is again considerable variation between schools, with up to a
fifth of school days missed in the schools with the worst truancy rates.
Has anyone acted on the tables. Governors, even more than parents, seem to
be doing so. One boarding school headmaster was presented with a copy of the
FT's last survey of A-levels by a governor over breakfast and told he would
have to do better. A grammar school head is facing a move for his dismissal
from a governor after his school fell about a dozen places.
Some local education authorities, such as Hertfordshire, have announced and
advertised their own league tables ahead of the government. Others have
opposed the tables or produced their own 'value-added' analyses which show
how schools have improved children's performances.
Those which see their performance slip may have some explaining to do. The
London Borough of Harrow finds itself in that uncomfortable position this
year, having fallen to 16th place from second last year. The percentage of
pupils with five or more GCSEs at A to C has fallen from 49.7 to 44.5.
A spokesman for the borough yesterday chose to highlight an increase in the
numbers achieving at least one grade A to C pass. The fall in scores on A to
C grades in five or more subjects was blamed on the poor performance of an
opted-out school.
The spokesman said: 'If you take account of the grant-maintained school, we
were exactly the same as last year. There's very little variation in the
percentages in other schools.'
The Centre for the Study of Comprehensive Schools at the University of
Leicester is more critical of league tables. It summarised the reaction of
league table high flyers as 'nothing to worry about', while those at the
bottom typically pointed towards poor resources.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Davies plays down CBI rift with Tories on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talking heads: there are no differences between the government and the
Confederation of British Industry on Europe, CBI director-general Mr Howard
Davies (left with Mr David Hunt, employment secretary) said yesterday. He
also renewed his calls to the European Commission not to destroy jobs
through excessive regulation, Tony Jackson writes.
Mr Davies told the CBI that early coverage had focused on supposed conflicts
over Europe. 'But there is in fact no substantial point at issue between the
CBI and the British government on current policies towards the European
Community in general, or economic and monetary union in particular.'
Mr Davies said the argument over wage levels and social costs in Europe had
become unduly polarised. 'There are those who argue that our salvation lies
in tight cost control, in wage discipline, flexible labour markets and
reduced social and regulatory burdens on business,' he said. Opposed to that
were those who believed that Europe could not be the lowest-cost producer,
so had to concentrate on training, investment and innovation. In fact, he
said, Europe had to pursue both objectives at once.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, backed the second
objective in a speech to the conference. However, Mr Davies said, the speech
had contained for the first time an admission by Mr Delors that high
non-wage costs caused unemployment.
Mr Davies repeated his appeal to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who
addressed the conference on Monday, not to raise taxes sharply in the
forthcoming Budget.
'The chancellor, I hope, left with a very clear idea of what we want and
don't want,' he said. 'We don't want large tax increases to brake the
recovery. We want tight spending control and some encouragement for
investment, particularly by small firms.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Top ministers back us on Europe, says CBI: Hunt grilled on
burden of social costs; Delors urged not to destroy jobs; Davies calls for
tight spending control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday claimed the support of the
government's three main economic ministers for its campaign for European
economic integration.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI, spoke out after Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, aligned himself firmly with the pro-European views
expressed on Monday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Sir Michael said the three ministers' speeches to the CBI conference in
Harrogate showed that 'their views on Europe are in parallel with ours'. CBI
leaders have been increasingly critical of the government's 'negative'
approach to Europe, which some believe has damaged British economic
prospects.
Mr Hunt told the CBI conference in Harrogate that his speech to last month's
Conservative party conference in Blackpool had been wrongly interpreted as
an attack on European integration. 'My personal commitment to this country's
place at the heart of Europe is central to my own personal political
philosophy,' he said.
Mr Hunt told delegates: 'Although we hear what you say about a single or
common currency for Europe, we are focusing on the practical objectives of
promoting economic recovery and economic convergence among the countries of
Europe.'
He said a single currency 'is not merely an economic policy - it would be an
undertaking of enormous political significance as well'.
Mr Hunt was careful to echo the vision of a decentralised, free-market and
free-trading European Union set out by the prime minister at last month's
European summit in Brussels.
He said later, however, that he remained committed to 'the ultimate
objective' of a single European currency. In spite of the consensus on
Europe, Mr Hunt faced trenchant criticism from CBI leaders of the burden of
social costs on industry.
Mr Bryan Rigby, chairman of the CBI's employment committee, said employers
were worried about reports that more of the cost of maternity and sick pay
was to be shifted to business.
'We don't expect to find this government putting extra burdens upon us
whilst criticising others for doing the same,' he said.
Tax reliefs which expire at the end of the year when the Business Expansion
Scheme winds up should be transferred into new reliefs for private
investment in private companies, the CBI said yesterday.
Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI Small Business Council, said:
'Unless we change the way we do some things in this country, smaller
businesses cannot deliver, cannot be the engine of recovery'.
The demand for tax relief for people investing in growing business is part
of a search for funding diversity. The CBI is concerned that small companies
are too reliant on overdrafts.
Mr Richard Head, chief manager of National Westminster Bank, said this was
why banks offered small businesses term loans for up to 20 years. The
clearing banks, he added, had Pounds 43bn of loans outstanding to companies
with annual turnovers of less than Pounds 1m.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Smith is given more applause than Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, leader of the Opposition, won more applause at the conference
than any of the cabinet ministers who preceded him to the speakers' podium.
Short of some party political knockabout and a defence of Labour attitudes
to the European Union's social chapter, the speech could have been written
inside the CBI itself or at the Engineering Employers Federation.
But CBI delegates were not convinced that the applause signalled
approbation, in spite of the unity of approach. Rather, said one informally,
it was a gesture of courtesy to Mr Smith for walking into the lion's den.
Still, just as the cabinet ministers had been, he was solid on Europe. As Mr
Edward Heath, the chairman of Heath Springs, the Midlands components maker,
said: 'That's where the opportunities are.'
Attitudes to Europe were a recurrent conference theme. What delegates heard
pleased Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity. 'It's clarified
the issues outstanding,' he said. Referring to Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, Mr Townsend, who is chairman of the CBI regional council, added
that 'his definition of European Union coincides with the views we get from
our members in the West Midlands'.
The greater degree of confidence in the conference hall spread into the
corridors. Partly this came from what delegates heard from the government -
and indeed from Mr Smith - about the importance of manufacturing. The
industrialists feel wanted.
This feeling of relative harmony with the government extended to the other
clear theme of the conference, the pace of economic recovery.
There was even a degree of good cheer. Mr Jeremy Woolridge, chairman of BE
Wedge Holdings, the Black Country engineering company, said: 'It's more
cheerful than a year ago. The big thing that is encouraging is Kenneth
Clarke's recognition of the fragile recovery, that we get a Budget which is
not unfriendly.'
Mr Townsend agreed. 'I'm more confident now we won't get a Budget which is
hostile to industry.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Insurers to crack down on fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS yesterday launched a computerised register of claims as part of a
crackdown on fraud which is estimated to cost the industry Pounds 400m a
year.
The Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, known as Clue, will contain
details of all individual claims. Insurers will be able to check details of
proposal forms and claims against the data.
Mr Bob Scott, an insurance executive who will chair Insurance Database
Services, the company being established to oversee the project, said: 'Clue
will deliver the knockout blow to fraudsters.
'I issue a warning now to all fraudsters and potential fraudsters - you will
be caught and insurers will encourage prosecutions and insist on restitution
of any payments made.'
Seventy insurance companies, whose annual premium income amounts to Pounds
13bn, have agreed to support the first register. It will collect household
insurance claims and will come into operation next year. The 70 include the
biggest UK composite companies.
The registers will contain information from the past three years and will
have an immediate impact, Mr Scott said. The system will help insurers to
clamp down on so-called 'multiple claims', when people claim for a single
loss on policies held with different companies.
Most insurance companies are expected to back the project, which is based on
a similar service in the US. Equifax, a leading supplier of risk assessment
and database systems, will provide technical specifications for the
database.
An opinion poll commissioned by the Association of British Insurers in the
past three days has confirmed widespread public suspicion of insurance
fraud. According to the survey, carried out by BMRB, the public believes 35
out of every 100 insurance claims are 'completely false and untrue'.

FEWER CUSTOMERS are having water supplies cut off for non-payment of bills,
according to figures released yesterday by the Office of Water Services, the
industry's watchdog in England and Wales.
Between April and September there were 5,924 domestic disconnections in
England and Wales, compared to 8,272 in the same period last year.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said the number was less than a tenth
of 1 per cent of all customers.
Last year Ofwat expressed concern about the number of disconnections.

THE GOVERNMENT is to carry out further research into the sort of information

de-regulation outside London.
The government also proposed clarifying the guidelines given to traffic

It also wants to halve the registration period required for changes in bus
routes to 21 days and increase the threshold from Pounds 8,000 to Pounds
10,000 under which authorities may award bus routes without tendering.

that the bidding process to determine the lottery's running should be open.
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, is insisting on

The office of the National Lottery has stated that it will award a single

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISABLED PEOPLE will today protest against changes in government programmes
that assist them in employment, Lisa Wood writes.
They will lobby Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who is at a two-day
conference on how Training and Enterprise Councils - which deliver
government training programmes in England and Wales - can best assist people
with special needs.
From next April, the Access to Work scheme will replace the six existing
programmes, costing Pounds 14m a year, that help the disabled.
The scheme will seek to help more people, but employers will be asked to
contribute towards assistance for disabled employees. At present, they
receive full government grants to adapt their premises. The government is
also proposing to limit the amount of help any individual can receive.
The Royal National Institute for the Blind said yesterday it welcomed new
flexibilities in Access for Work, but it was concerned that charges being
imposed on employers would be a disincentive to the employment of disabled
people.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Sky TV opens broadside to sink decoder pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKY TELEVISION is believed to have adopted anti-piracy measures early
yesterday in an attempt to disable unauthorised decoder cards.
The satellite broadcaster altered the stream of data from its satellite
system to its subscribers in trying to prevent the use of pirate cards.
Yesterday Mr Chris McKenzie, general manager at Sky, said he had no comment.
Last month Sky, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake,
made it clear that it intended to take every legal and technical action it
could against the pirates.
Mr David Lyons, whose company Satellite Decoding Systems imported illicit
decoder cards from the Republic of Ireland to the UK, said that his cards
had not been affected by Sky's latest action.
Mr Lyons has given legal undertakings that he will neither advertise nor
sell pirate cards in the UK.
He has returned to Ireland where he concentrates on selling Sky cards to
continental Europe.
Mr Lyons said yesterday that he was offering, or was about to offer, pirate
cards for French satellite service Canal Plus, Belgian channel FilmNet and
Scandinavian channels TV3 and TV1000.
Recently the Scandinavian channels have taken action against Mr Chris Cary
and Hi-Tech Innovation of Camberley who had been supplying pirate cards.
TV3 obtained an injunction against Mr Cary and notified the police.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Food industry split on VAT lobbying aims - Guy
de Jonquieres picks through a menu of nutritional anomalies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK subsidiary of Nestle, the world's biggest food manufacturer, made an
embarrassing discovery this week. It found it was lobbying the Treasury to
adopt two contradictory policies in the Budget.
With one hand Nestle was supporting industry efforts to ward off any
increase in value added tax on about 80 per cent of food products which are
zero-rated. With the other it was backing a campaign - from which it has
withdrawn - to abolish zero-rating on all but fresh food.
Nestle is not alone in its confusion about Britain's complicated system of
taxing food and drink, the complexities of which have split the industry -
and many companies - down the middle.
Most types of food are classified as necessities and carry a zero rate of
VAT. All other food and drink products carry VAT at the standard 17.5 per
cent rate. The categories are a relic of purchase tax, abolished in 1973,
which discriminated against 'luxury' consumer products and services.
Food manufacturers complain that two-tier VAT is riddled with anomalies.
Gingerbread men dipped in chocolate carry VAT at 17.5 per cent, while
gingerbread women dipped in caramel are zero-rated. Chocolate-coated
biscuits and shelled nuts are taxed at the standard rate, but
chocolate-filled biscuits and unshelled nuts go VAT-free.
Rapid product innovation has aggravated the discrepancies. When the tax
rules were first devised the only snacks were potato-based or produced by
'swelling' cereals. These still carry standard VAT. Newer products, however,
such as tortilla chips which are not made from potato or swollen cereals,
are zero-rated.
Manufacturers say such inequities - exaggerated by the rise in the standard
VAT rate from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in the past 20 years  - distort
the market.
Efforts by Customs and Excise to tinker - usually by challenging products'
zero-rated status - have stirred up legal and political opposition and have
sometimes failed.
After struggling last year to standardise VAT on snacks Customs abandoned
the attempt as hopeless and its move to slap standard-rate VAT on Jaffa
cakes was defeated in the courts. More recently, the ending of zero-rating
on freshly-squeezed orange juice was criticised by MPs.
Many food manufacturers believe the system is absurd but they cannot agree
on what should replace it. Most dare not press too hard for reform, for fear
that reform would involve ending zero-rating.
This view has shaped pre-Budget lobbying by the Food and Drink Federation,
the umbrella organisation of the main industry associations. The federation
has told the Treasury that the end of zero-rating would lead to higher
inflation, job losses and lower industry profits.
This stance has been broadly supported by the industry, but it has been
criticised by some manufacturers of products such as snacks, confectionery,
soft drinks and ice cream, on which 17.5 per cent VAT is charged.
Mr Keith Nightingale, director-general of the Snacks, Nuts and Crisps
Manufacturers Association, said: 'The federation seems to be putting all its
effort into preserving the status quo and doing nothing for all of us who
pay the standard VAT rate.'
Several confectionery manufacturers belonging to the Biscuit, Cake,
Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance have broken ranks and launched a
campaign to have VAT extended to all processed foods at a rate of 8 per
cent. That, they say, would end discrimination without reducing the Pounds
1.6bn a year the exchequer receives from VAT on food.
Companies backing the campaign include Cadbury, Mars and - until this week -
Nestle. Although their proposals suit Rowntree, Nestle's confectionery
subsidiary, many of the group's other businesses such as instant coffee,
yoghurts and frozen food would be penalised.
Similar conflicts of interest beset other industry associations. Some ice
cream manufacturers want a lower VAT rate but Unilever, the industry leader,
is keen to avoid endangering the zero rate on its other products.
One option would be to zero-rate all food. As well as costing the Treasury
revenue, however, that would require a special exemption from European
Community rules, which Brussels would be reluctant to grant.
Under EU rules Britain could charge as little as 5 per cent VAT on food. But
this would also cut Treasury revenue unless it was applied to some or all of
the food products which are currently zero-rated.
Any extension of VAT, even at a relatively low rate, on food would, however,
be politically unpopular.
Given the unpalatable alternatives, the betting must be that the present
system, for all its faults, will survive the Budget largely intact.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Police may be forced to co-operate on Nadir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRUSTEE in bankruptcy to Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, is
considering using court orders against senior police officials who, he
claims, have failed to co-operate in his efforts to trace assets.
The proposed action by Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson
Rhodes, came after refusals by the police to answer allegations that they
were aware of the location of some of Mr Nadir's assets.
Meanwhile, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that it had decided
not to bring a case against Mr Nadir in connection with allegations that he
had attempted to bribe a senior judge.
It said it had concluded that there was 'no credible evidence' to support
suggestions that Mr Nadir had attempted to pay Pounds 3.5m to Mr Justice
Tucker, who was scheduled to hear his fraud trial last month.
The CPS said it had decided not to continue the action following receipt of
a report from the Metropolitan Police last Friday at the end of a 'lengthy
investigation'.
The CPS added that Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher, who are believed
to be in northern Cyprus, had made the original allegations of a conspiracy
involving Mr Tucker, Mr Nadir, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, who is Mr Nadir's
lawyer, and Mr Wyn Jones, suspended assistant commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police.
Ms Welsher admitted a year ago to have held a painting valued at Pounds
400,000 which is claimed by Mr Nadir's trustees and is now believed to have
been removed from the UK.
The police had contacted Ms Welsher but Mr Cooper said that they refused to
provide him with any information on her or the painting's whereabouts during
the past year.
Under section 366 of the 1986 Insolvency Act, the police could be forced to
answer questions.
Those covered by the court orders could include Detective Chief
Superintendent Tom Glendinning and Mr George Staple, head of the Serious
Fraud Office.
Mr Nadir was due to face trial last month on 13 charges of theft and false
accounting involving Pounds 34m, but he broke his bail conditions and fled
to northern Cyprus in May this year.
Mr Nadir yesterday accused the British authorities of perverting the course
of justice and said he intended to sue the SFO, the director of public
prosecutions, Scotland Yard and others.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Third of companies 'register pre-tax losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT ONE THIRD of British companies registered a pre-tax loss in 1992,
casting doubts on government claims that UK industry had survived the
recession with profits at a high level, according to a report from two City
institutions.
Robert Fleming Securities, a stockbroker, and Risk &amp; Opportunity
Intelligence (ROI), an independent corporate analyst, said official figures
highlighting robust real rates of return on capital employed and strong
non-North Sea gross trading profits 'seriously misrepresent the traumas of
the corporate sector during the past four years'.
Drawing on figures provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information
group, Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming and Mr Niall Fraser of ROI said
that 'healthy profits are the preserve of a few thousand firms, while tens
of thousands have battled for survival'.
Taking 1991 data on 113,600 companies, they said the top 250 UK companies
contributed more than 30 per cent and the top 1,600 some 70 per cent of the
pre-tax profits earned by British business that year. In an analysis of 16
UK industrial sectors, Messrs Warburton and Fleming said a 'staggering' 37.6
per cent of all companies registered a pre-tax loss in their 1991 accounts.
A further 27.9 per cent reported 'trivial' profits of less than Pounds
50,000. On the strength of provisional data, the researchers estimated that
at least 33 per cent of British companies reported a pre-tax loss last year.
Messrs Warburton and Fraser said that large companies, with annual sales of
more than Pounds 50m, had emerged from the recession in a much stronger
position and with much greater credit-worthiness than small companies. They
said their sectoral analysis showed that manufacturing companies had the
highest average credit standing.
The intermediate and capital goods industries contained the highest
proportion of low risk companies, followed by financial services and holding
companies and wholesalers of non-durable goods.
During the recession property companies supplanted those providing hotel,
accommodation and leisure services at the bottom of the credit quality
league with the greatest proportion of companies considered to be risky
trading partners.
Mr Warburton took issue with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of
England, who recently warned companies not to boost their margins
excessively. The quest for high margins was an 'essential process in the
rehabilitation of the corporate sector', he said.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Government borrowing rises sharply again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER BIG rise in government borrowing last month left public sector
finances still heading for their biggest annual shortfall on record.
Official figures showed yesterday that the government borrowed Pounds 2.7bn
in October, taking the public sector deficit since the start of the
financial year to Pounds 26.9bn from Pounds 20bn in the same period last
year.
The latest figure, slightly higher than forecasts, suggests that the public
sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94 will be slightly lower than the
last Treasury forecast of Pounds 50bn.
It will impress on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the need to bring down
borrowing as he prepares for the November 30 Budget. The Treasury said the
figure was in line with forecasts.
Last month's shortfall disappointed expectations mainly because tax
receipts, particularly of corporation tax, were particularly low. In the
first half of the financial year corporation tax receipts, which are usually
volatile, were 0.6 per cent up on the previous year, but the October figure
was about 15 per cent lower.
Excluding the proceeds from privatisation, the cumulative PSBR in the first
seven months of the financial year was Pounds 30.4bn. There were no
privatisation proceeds in October.
Although much of the deficit is cyclical, arising from higher social
security payments as a result of the recession, part of the deterioration in
public sector finances reflects a structural shortfall.
According to economists at UBS, the Swiss bank, the PSBR excluding
privatisation proceeds as a proportion of gross domestic product is expected
to be about 5 percentage points higher this year than it was at a similar
stage in the last business cycle.
Speaking yesterday at a lunch on the Budget given by Arthur Andersen, the
accountancy firm, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, urged Mr Clarke to
raise taxes at the earliest possible opportunity, pointing out that the
interest the government will have to pay on the national debt next year will
be about Pounds 7bn more than it was two years ago.
He said: 'Any increase in taxation should be imposed at the earliest
opportunity and not dragged out over a period of years.'
The notion that tax increases would damage the recovery showed 'no
understanding of the hard evidence of the 1980s' and wildly exaggerated the
extent to which fiscal policy could affect the economy in the short term, he
said.
Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said
lower-than-expected tax receipts in October suggested that the recovery was
not strong enough to make significant inroads into the deficit. 'Cutting
spending or raising taxes on ordinary people in the Budget will not ensure a
sustainable reduction in the deficit, and will merely exacerbate the
short-term and medium-term weaknesses in the economy,' she said.
Confidence in the housing market dipped slightly in October in the light of
fears that the government will abolish mortgage tax relief, according to a
survey by Gallup, the market research company.
It also revealed that half of all existing homeowners under 35 in the survey
claimed to have zero or negative equity in their property.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Bidders for BR to be given a dry run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL bidders for privatised British Rail routes will be invited to take
part in 'shadow negotiations' with the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising
early next year.
The office has been set up by the government to handle the franchising of
BR's routes and to monitor the performance of franchisees.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said yesterday that the purpose of
the negotiations was to explain to the bidding teams how the franchising
system works and to allow the office to refine its own proposals.
One of the main aims of the franchising office is to establish agreements
which provide commercial incentives for companies involved in the new system
and which minimise the scope for legal disputes.
Mr Salmon said: 'We have devised a 'no-fault' incentive system which keeps
the lawyers in their place.'
Franchisees will be paid according to the quality and reliability of the
train service, while Railtrack, the company set up to own the track and
signalling, will be able to charge more for providing a high quality of
service to the operator.
Mr Salmon, a former corporate financier with NM Rothschild, the merchant
bank, is to spend the next few weeks explaining the details of the
franchising system at a series of conferences and presentations.
'There is a lot of the detail which is important,' he said. 'Only when we
get that into the public domain will the big players sit up and get
talking.'
Invitations to tender are expected to go out next October and the first
private operators will take over in the spring of 1995. About 50 private
companies and 30 teams of British Rail managers have expressed an interest.
The capital needed to take over rail operations is not large because
equipment will be leased or rented. But bidders will be required to provide
bonds to reimburse season ticket holders in the event of the company
folding. They may also have to provide guarantees of 'good behaviour'.
Mr Salmon described the move to franchising as 'the biggest change in the
railway system, including nationalisation' but said he did not expect
large-scale changes in the physical shape of the network. Companies taking
over franchises to run British Rail routes will pay more to use the track at
peak times, Railtrack, the company set up to manage British Rail track and
signalling, said yesterday.
Charges will depend in part on the type and the number of trains run, wear
and tear on the track and the cost of any improvements and investment in the
line.
Details of how Railtrack will charge for its services were unveiled at the
formal launch of the company in London.
Railtrack will spend the next few months devising access agreements for its
future customers; acquiring formal ownership of 10,000 miles of track, 2,500
stations and 90,000 bridges; and taking on responsibility for the 22,000
tenants in British Rail property.
It will also investigate ways of involving private sector finance to help
fund modernisation of track and signalling.
Safety will be monitored by a safety directorate which will be part of
Railtrack but which, Railtrack said, would be kept, 'as far as possible',
separate from its commercial arm.
When Railtrack formally takes over control of BR's infrastructure on April 1
it will have 12,000 staff ranging from signalmen to business controllers.
Track and signals will be grouped in 10 geographical zones.

FT  17 NOV 93 / CBI urges tax relief transfer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX RELIEFS which expire at the end of the year, when the Business Expansion
Scheme ends, should be transferred into new reliefs for private investment
in private companies, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
'Unless we change the way we do some things in this country, smaller
businesses cannot deliver, cannot be the engine of recovery,' Mr Richard
Brucciani, chairman of both PAL International and the CBI's small-business
council told the CBI's annual conference in Harrogate.
The demand for tax relief for individual investors is part of a search for
funding diversity. The CBI is concerned that small companies are too reliant
on overdrafts and short-term bank finance.

FT  17 NOV 93 / RSPB calls for law to safeguard forests after privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT must have powers to buy back forests if they are not managed
to high environmental standards after privatisation, according to Europe's
largest wildlife charity.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds also wants Forestry Commission
properties to be excluded from privatisation if their sale would jeopardise
the wood-processing industry, local jobs and communities, public access and
recreation, or wildlife conservation, research and education. These are the
principal components of the government's current policy of 'multi-purpose'
forestry.
The RSPB, which has 870,000 members including at least 40 in the Commons and
Lords, is proposing a private member's bill as part of a campaign to
highlight what it sees as the difficulties of safeguarding environmental
values in the event of a sale of Britain's forests. It will be lobbying MPs
who come top of the private members' ballot on November 25.
The charity, which itself manages an estate of about 190,000 acres, has been
successful in getting two previous private member's bills on to the statute
books, in 1991 and 1992. If its latest bill were to succeed it would upset
any privatisation plans by making purchases less attractive, particularly
for buyers interested only in timber exploitation.
A review group of civil servants, due to report to ministers early next
year, is considering options for the privatisation of all or part of the
2.8m-acre Forestry Commission estate. Although privatisation is favoured by
some Tory MPs, it is opposed by the majority of interested parties from wood
processors to environmental groups.
The bill would enable the government to buy back land after five years if it
was not being managed to the environmental standards currently laid down by
the Forestry Commission. It would also require all privatised land to be
subject to a management plan. If the new owners failed to implement the plan
the government would be able to do so.
Mr Roger Turner, the RSPB's forestry policy officer, said Forest Enterprise,
which manages the Forestry Commission's land, follows government policy of
ensuring there is a variety of old and young trees and dense and open
woodland of the kind required by different species of birds and plants. For
conservation purposes it fells some trees earlier or later than it would if
it were seeking the maximum return from the timber.
He said: 'We're concerned that in virtually all the options for transferring
ownership, if the forest goes into the hands of individuals or organisations
who wish to pursue a single purpose, like making money from the timber, then
these requirements will not be met.'
The RSPB estimates that it would cost the government an additional Pounds
51.55m a year in grants and administration to maintain current conservation
standards on Forestry Commission land and develop its environmental
potential in the event of a wholesale transfer to the private sector. This
would compare with a book value of Pounds 1.7bn for the estate and
predictions that it could fetch as little as Pounds 500m on the market. 'It
would be a short-term gain for a long-term cost,' said Mr Turner.
Last week three former executives of the Forestry Commission said additional
expenditure would amount to Pounds 44m a year in 2000, while the government
would be losing Pounds 20m a year in timber sales.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Municipal Mutual plans provide for insolvency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the local authority-owned insurance company which stopped
writing new business last year, yesterday published details of an
arrangement which will come into effect if the company becomes insolvent.
MMI transferred most of its continuing local authority business to Zurich
Insurance in March 1993 and 17 other subsidiaries have been sold off.
The company is continuing to meet claims on policies which remain in force,
however, and believes it will have net assets of Pounds 907,000 following
the 'run-off' of all insurance liabilities.
Creditors, mainly local authorities, will be asked to approve the scheme at
a meeting in January before it is submitted to the courts for final
approval.
Mr Maurice Stonefrost, chairman of MMI, said the directors of MMI believed
that a solvent run-off could be achieved, although this would take many
years.
He added: 'The directors have put forward this scheme to ensure that
creditors' interests are not disadvantaged by a period of uncertainty if a
solvent run-off becomes unlikely.'
The scheme has a provision which will enable portions of claims paid to
scheme creditors after September 30 this year to be clawed back if the main
provisions of the scheme are triggered, which should allow faster claim
payment.
The scheme does not affect the business of Municipal General Insurance, an
MMI subsidiary which underwrote commercial business.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Pit closure plans are speeded up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday accelerated its contraction programme, saying that it
wants talks with unions about the Littleton colliery in Staffordshire, the
first of the so-called 19 'core pits' to be threatened with closure.
The naming of Littleton with Silverdale, also in Staffordshire, means that
six pits have been mentioned this month as candidates for closure or
contraction.
A seventh, probably Wearmouth in county Durham, is likely to emerge next
week when management in north-east England is due to meet unions. British
Coal operates 30 pits but is producing far more coal than it can sell.
It is expected to close at least 15 of them before privatisation, most in
the next four months. The decision by British Coal to seek further talks
with unions on Littleton next Monday emphasises the problems in finding
markets.
Until recently Littleton was considered one of the safest pits. It was given
a future even in October last year, when the government announced plans -
scaled back after a public outcry - to close 31 others. It was also thought
to have been protected because it sells about 40 per cent of its coal to
non-power station markets.
British Coal told unions yesterday, however, that since April Littleton had
lost Pounds 2.9m. UK power station consumption of coal had fallen by 20 per
cent this year, even more than had been expected.
Silverdale, which employs 398 miners, has lost Pounds 5.6m. Management will
meet leaders there on Friday.
The naming of Silverdale and Littleton for further talks does not
necessarily mean they will close. The other, less likely, possibility is
significant redundancies.
The three pits where British Coal has already held pithead reviews in this
final pre-privatisation round have been told of closure plans.
They are Frickley and Bentley in Yorkshire and Calverton in Nottinghamshire.
Miners at the other named pit, Hatfield in South Yorkshire, will be told of
its prospects on Friday.
Miners at most of the pits are being offered up to Pounds 44,000 to accept
redundancy but both the National Union of Mineworkers and the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers are urging members to fight closures.
The closure programme can take up to nine months if miners decide to appeal,
but such long delays are unusual.
A test of miners' resolve will be provided tomorrow when pit workers at
Calverton, where the UDM is the majority union, vote on a closures plan.

FT  17 NOV 93 / OFT blocks alarm companies' licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE COMPANIES selling burglar alarms lost their consumer credit licences
yesterday after complaints about high-pressure selling and customers being
frightened into buying. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said some
of their business practices were 'abhorrent'.
The Office of Fair Trading said Advanced Security Systems - which previously
traded as Property Watch UK - as well as Vector Security and Vector
Homelinked Security, were not fit to hold the licences. The three companies
are all run from the same office in Manchester, and have overlapping
directors.
The two Vector companies are to appeal.
Advanced Security Systems, the only one of the three companies to employ
salespeople, closed voluntarily six months ago after the OFT had
investigated evidence from the local trading standards department following
complaints.
The OFT said salespeople would tell potential customers that burglars would
throw boiling fat or water over anyone who disturbed them.
Some salespeople were found to have offered householders a security survey
which was then used to persuade them to install alarms, the OFT added. Some
presentations were dragged out - in one case for more than nine hours - to
wear down resistance.
Mr Alan O'Brien, co-owner and manager of the companies, said yesterday there
had been only 26 complaints in more than 11,000 sales over four years.
Advanced Security Systems had employed salespeople on a basic wage, plus
car, with the bulk of earnings coming from commission.
He had been 'horrified' to hear of 'sales misdemeanours', which he said were
confined to 'five or six salesmen only'. Sales training had never included
the methods described by the OFT.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Third of companies 'register pre-tax loss'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT ONE-THIRD of British companies registered a pre-tax loss in 1992,
casting doubts on government claims that UK industry had survived the
recession with profits at a high level, according to a report from two City
institutions.
Robert Fleming Securities, a stockbroker, and Risk &amp; Opportunity
Intelligence (ROI), an independent corporate analyst, said official figures
highlighting robust real rates of return on capital employed and strong
non-North Sea gross trading profits 'seriously misrepresent the traumas of .
. . the past four years'.
Drawing on figures from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, Mr
Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming and Mr Niall Fraser of ROI said that
'healthy profits are the preserve of a few thousand firms, while tens of
thousands have battled for survival'.
Taking 1991 data on 113,600 companies, they said the top 250 UK companies
contributed more than 30 per cent and the top 1,600 about 70 per cent of the
pre-tax profits earned by British business that year. In an analysis of 16
UK industrial sectors Messrs Warburton and Fleming said 37.6 per cent of all
companies registered a pre-tax loss in their 1991 accounts. A further 27.9
per cent reported 'trivial' profits of less than Pounds 50,000. On the
strength of provisional data the researchers estimated that at least 33 per
cent of British companies reported a pre-tax loss last year.
They said that large companies, with annual sales of more than Pounds 50m,
had emerged from the recession in a much stronger position.
Mr Warburton took issue with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of
England, who recently warned companies not to boost their margins
excessively. The quest for high margins was an 'essential process in the
rehabilitation of the corporate sector', he said.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Italy to lease spare RAF jets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence is expected to earn Pounds 110m by leasing spare RAF
Tornado jets to the Italian air force.
Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italian defence minister, said in London yesterday that the
Tornado F3 air defence fighter had been chosen in preference to similar
licensing proposals involving two US aircraft, the Grumman F-14 and the
McDonnell Douglas F-15.
He added that Italy wanted to use the deal to launch closer defence
collaboration between the two countries.
The MoD confirmed that a leasing arrangement had been discussed but said no
agreement had been signed.
In addition to the payment to Britain, the plan also involves some L430bn
(Pounds 176m) worth of work for Italian industry including provision of
spares and support.
Italy wants the jets to replace its ageing F-104 Starfighters before
delivery of the new four-nation Eurofighter 2000.

FT  17 NOV 93 / ScottishPower in British Coal deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER is to be supplied with more than 2m tonnes of coal a year for
the next five years under an agreement with British Coal signed yesterday,
James Buxton writes.
This secures the Longannet deep mine in Fife and will cut ScottishPower's
fuel costs by Pounds 10m in its first year.
The agreement, worth about Pounds 400m, replaces the five-year deal due to
expire in March 1995 under which ScottishPower has to take 2m tonnes of coal
a year from Longannet. Although it means greater security and higher sales
volume for British Coal, it has had to accept a lower price and further
reductions over the life of the contract.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Rifkind outlines curb on Trident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, defence secretary, yesterday confirmed plans to limit
the firepower of Trident strategic missile submarines but refused to give
details of planned armament levels.
Trident's total explosive power would be 'not much changed' from Polaris, he
said. He set a ceiling of 96 nuclear warheads per submarine, however, twice
the maximum number on Polaris boats.
In a keynote speech on nuclear policy in London he said the actual number
deployed could be 'significantly fewer' than 96. Previously the maximum was
set at 128 warheads per submarine - eight for each of 16 Trident missiles.
The new policy 'should lay to rest comments and speculation about Trident
representing a major growth in the size of the UK's nuclear armoury,' Mr
Rifkind added.
When Trident was fully in service the UK's nuclear stockpile would be 25 per
cent lower than in 1990, he said.
He denied that financial considerations influenced the decision and said
savings would be 'very modest indeed' compared with the Pounds 10bn overall
cost of the Trident programme. He did not believe the change would directly
affect jobs among the 6,700 employees of the Aldermaston-based Atomic
Weapons Establishment. But the recent abandonment of plans to develop a new
air-launched missile would bring 'a change of focus' there.
Mr Rifkind also made the clearest statement to date of government support
for a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests. The UK was ready 'to
participate fully and constructively' in negotiations to secure a ban, he
said.
The proposed ban, regarded by some scientists as threatening the UK's
capacity to design nuclear weapons, is seen as an important gesture by the
nuclear powers in their effort to secure renewal of the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995.
Mr Rifkind said Britain would press for an indefinite extension of the
treaty, designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Although complete disarmament was 'a desirable ultimate goal', Mr Rifkind
said it was essential for Britain to keep full-scale strategic nuclear arms
and less potent sub-strategic weapons. Trident would be adapted to fulfil
both both functions.
Mr Rifkind, who emphasised growing nuclear co-operation with France, said
Nato should not abandon the right to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis.

FT  17 NOV 93 / BAT confident on insurance inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries said yesterday it was confident that its US Farmers Insurance
subsidiary would pass with flying colours a review into its procedures
launched by Mr John Garamendi, California's in-surance commissioner,
agencies report.
The review follows a court award of Dollars 57.8m (Pounds 38.7m) in punitive
damages last month against one of Farmers' insurance exchanges in a suit
launched by a client.
Farmers intends to contest the judgment, which would not hit profits,
because of the way its business is structured, it said.
But the uncertainty, plus profit-taking, meant BAT shares slipped 13p to
503p in London trading yesterday.
The case goes back to 1989, when Surgin Surgical was sued by a competitor
for patent infringement.
When Surgin sought to have Farmers' subsidiary Truck Insurance pay for its
defence it was denied coverage. After Surgin filed suit against Truck for
bad faith, the insurer allegedly destroyed documents that would have been
used in the discovery stage of the case, Mr Garamendi said.
Mr Garamendi noted in launching his inquiry that the case judge had referred
to Truck Insurance's behaviour as 'despicable, vile, malici-ous, fraudulent
and oppressive.'
However, a BAT Industries spokesman said yesterday: 'Farmers' customer
service ranks among the best in the insurance industry. The company is
confident the review of its procedures by the state department of insurance
will affirm this.'
He added that the award had not yet been formally entered into court, but
when it was, Farmers would appeal on the grounds that the judge exceeded his
powers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S privatisation programme has been suspended this week until after
a new president is elected on December 5.
The move, ordered by President Ramon J. Velasquez, is a serious blow to the
government's highly regarded privatisation team and means that bidding on
state assets will be delayed, perhaps until after a new government takes
office in February of next year.
Mr Julian Villalba, head of the privatisation programme, said the suspension
was a 'political decision' taken as a courtesy to the next chief executive.
The leading candidate in Venezuela's current presidential campaign, Mr
Rafael Caldera, has expressed reservations about the privatisation
programme.
As a result of the delay the Venezuelan treasury will not receive at least
Dollars 700m from sales of assets planned over the next few months, he
added. The cash-strapped government will also have to continue financing
money-losing concerns due for privatisation.
Several large state-owned assets were scheduled to be sold through
international bidding in November and December. They include three electric
power companies; Aerpostal, an airline with domestic and international
routes; and the Caracas Raceway.
Venezuelan and international companies had expressed interest in these and
other assets.

A US Federal Trade Commission official yesterday confirmed the agency was

stall market entries by competitors, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Mark Witner, the FTC's acting deputy director, bureau of competition,
told the Senate Ageing Committee the commission had recently conducted
investigations of horizontal and vertical mergers in the drug industry.
'Some of these investigations continue,' he said.
The commission is also investigating alleged price discrimination in
prescription drug distribution, he added. 'We are also examining in another
investigation, the possibility that an incumbent firm has abused regulatory
processes in order to defeat or retard market entry by a competitor.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Cold war polemic in Honduras: A look at 'communist' and
'fascist' insults between presidential candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rhetoric of the cold war is over in most parts of the world, but not
apparently in Honduras, where presidential, parliamentary and municipal
elections are being held on November 28.
The presidential campaign has been marked by the trading of vitriolic cold
war era insults by the two leading candidates. 'The campaign is not
addressing the issues; it has become a cold war polemic,' said Mr Guillermo
Molina, a political analyst in Tegucigalpa, the capital.
The candidate for the right-wing National party of the current president, Mr
Rafael Callejas, is Mr Oswaldo Ramos, a former rector of the National
University of Honduras. He has led an emotive campaign calling on voters to
chose between 'communism and the fatherland'.
He has accused his main rival Carlos Roberto Reina of the centrist Liberal
party of having communist sympathies, saying that he and his brother Jorge
Arturo are friendly with Cuban President Fidel Castro and former Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega.
As evidence, Mr Ramos has been running advertisements on television and in
newspapers showing a 1960 photograph of Jorge Arturo in Havana, beside the
late Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, a hero of the Cuban revolution.
Mr Reina, a former president of the San Jose-based Inter- American Court of
Human Rights, has called Mr Ramos a liar, a fascist, and a danger to
democracy.
Opponents of Mr Ramos have alluded to his past membership of the Alliance
for Progress of Honduras, an extreme-right wing organisation linked to the
Unification Church. The Alliance was founded in 1983 by Gen Gustavo Alvarez
Martinez, then head of the armed forces, who is accused by human rights
groups of organising the 'disappearance' of several student leaders and
union members.
Mr Ramos, who comes from the more conservative wing of the National party
than President Callejas, is known to have strong links with the powerful
Honduran military.
Most opinion polls have put Mr Reina at least six points ahead, but 30 per
cent of voters are still undecided.
Dissatisfaction with the traditional parties may lead to a better showing
for the small Christian Democrat party and the Social Democrat Party of
Innovation and Unity which between them won 3 per cent of the vote in 1989,
say analysts.
Mr Ramos has had the advantage of the support on the campaign trail of the
personally popular and charismatic President Callejas, who is
constitutionally prohibited from re-election.
Since 1990 Mr Callejas has implemented a structural adjustment programme
under the aegis of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which
has brought economic stability and projected growth of 5 per cent this year.
But there has been an increase in poverty, according to the School of
Honduran Economists.
When not insulting his opponent, Mr Reina has criticised the orthodoxy of
the plan which he says he will renegotiate. 'What Reina represents is the
critique to this model and its social consequences,' says Mr Molina.
Some 2.7m Hondurans have been registered to vote in elections. The
Organisation of American States finished revision of the electoral roll for
the elections on Wednesday and has added 350,000 voters to the 1989
register.

FT  17 NOV 93 / US court boost for gays in military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MILITARY opposition to the admission of homosexuals was dealt a further
heavy blow yesterday when a federal appeals court ordered the Naval Academy
to graduate a student it had expelled six years ago when he admitted to
being gay.
The case in question pre-dates separate legal challenges to the Clinton
administration's current 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, under which the
military no longer asks about a potential recruit's sexual orientation but
retains the right to dismiss anyone who is openly homosexual.
But the language of the appeals court's unanimous judgment in reversing a
lower court ruling was sufficiently sweeping to call into immediate question
the chances of overturning the current policy.
Chief Judge Abner Mikva wrote that it was 'inherently unreasonable' that the
military should justify a ban on gays on the presumption that 'a certain
class of persons will break the law or the rules solely because of their
thoughts and desires.'
The ruling also rejected the contention that service in the armed forces
removed some of the constitutional protections afforded private citizens.
'There is no 'military exception' to the constitution,' it said. 'Indeed,
even when the Supreme Court has deferred to military judgment, it has been
careful to do so only within the confines of ordinary constitutional
analysis.'
'When the military fails to accord individuals the equal protection of the
laws, it treads upon an area of expertise that has long been conceded to the
courts,' the judgment declared. 'America's hallmark has been to judge people
by what they do and not by who they are.'
The court's logic is very similar to that advanced by President Bill Clinton
whose controversial insistence on ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals has
been rooted in the argument that only conduct in uniform should be the
determining factor in a person's fitness to serve.
The case concerned Mr Joseph Steffan, expelled from the Naval Academy in
1987, just before he was due to graduate, after a navy investigation had
confirmed that he had told a fellow cadet he was homosexual. His initial
appeal against expulsion was dismissed by a lower court.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan threat to delay Gatt offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S minister of agriculture, Mr Eijiro Hata, yesterday indicated Tokyo
may not submit its list of market access offers on agriculture to Gatt by
the end of the week due to a lack of progress in negotiations, notably on
the controversial rice issue.
Member countries are expected to table their offers by the end of this week
to meet the Uruguay Round trade talks deadline of December 15.
Japan does not want to be seen as being responsible for obstructing the
successful conclusion of the Round, but it has continued to maintain an
inflexible stance on the opening of the country's rice market.
During meetings with Sir Leon Brittan on Monday, Japanese politicians kept
up their show of resistance to tariffication of rice, maintaining rice was
too sensitive a domestic political issue.
Japan is offering to reduce tariffs on manufactured goods by 60 per cent.
However, outside the agriculture ministry officials say various initiatives
are being taken to seek a solution to the rice issue. There is a growing
recognition that Japan cannot expect rice to be made an exception and it
would be better to take the initiative in negotiating as favourable a deal
as possible. 'We must not allow the Uruguay Round to fail as a result of
Japan's rice problem,' one official said.
'Japan finds it difficult to accept tariffication as presented in the Dunkel
text,' a trade official close to the Uruguay Round talks said. 'We are
negotiating ways to modify this scheme.'
One possibility would be to accept minimum access to a certain percentage of
the rice market without subjecting the remainder to tariffication, though
this is unlikely to be acceptable to exporting countries.
Another possibility would be to introduce tariffication but on a more
gradual timescale than the six years called for in the Dunkel text in order
to minimise the impact.
It is also conceivable that Japan might agree to tariffication after a
certain grace period - the deal widely reported as being agreed with the US.
Japan has been warned, however, that modification of the Dunkel text will be
very difficult.
The four-strong team of Commonwealth ministers who have just completed a
world tour of political capitals yesterday said they were 'more optimistic'
of a successful conclusion to the Gatt trade talks than they were at the
mission's outset, reports Rachel Johnson.
But there were still 'pitfalls and difficulties' to overcome. Key officials
in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and Geneva were still failing to
communicate, the team said.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Hosokawa on a tightrope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, will step on to a diplomatic
tightrope when he goes to Seattle on Friday for the first summit meeting of
the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
The Tokyo government aims to strike a balance between the conflicting
ambitions of its US and Asian allies in a region which includes some of the
world's fastest growing but most diverse economies.
This requires sensitive handling by Japan. Most of Apec's Asian partners -
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - prefer to keep Apec vague and
informal.
That way, it can contain members of a region far more economically and
politically diverse than Europe ever was, they argue.
Some are also wary over what they see as attempts by non-Asian members led
by the US to exert economic dominance through Apec.
Officially, Japan stands somewhere in between the Asian and US camps. It
hopes to gain regional influence by upsetting neither of them, even if it
has no strong ideas of its own on how Apec should develop.
It cannot afford to offend its traditional military protector and biggest
trading partner, the US, with which it shares free-market policies, despite
perennial rows over each other's alleged protectionism.
Yet it is also keener than ever to develop Asian ties. The region is a
growing destination for Japanese foreign investment and of increasing
diplomatic importance as Japan takes a more pragmatic view of its US
partnership after the end of the cold war.
'The US seems insensitive to Asians' feeling that Apec should not be a
negotiating forum,' says a senior Foreign Ministry official.
Japanese officials live in horror of further offending the touchy Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, who is suspicious of so-called
white countries' Asian economic ambitions and has refused to turn up.
Sensitive to concerns such as these, Mr Hosokawa will reject suggestions in
the report that Apec should take part in negotiations on international trade
liberalisation, say officials. He will call on partners to respect the
political, social and cultural variety of Asian nations.
At the same time, Mr Hosokawa will make one gentle step to pushing Apec
forward by proposing a conference on cultural exchange.
This could capitalise on the improvement in Japan-Asian relations achieved
through apologies offered by Mr Hosokawa over the past few months for
Japan's wartime aggression - the most explicit ever made by a Japanese
leader.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: China signs Dollars 700m order for six
A340s

CHINA yesterday signed a contract to buy six Airbus A340 long-range
airliners worth about Dollars 700m.
The deal, signed between the European aircraft consortium and the China
Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC), is a breakthrough for Airbus in the
fast growing Chinese aviation market.
Airbus expects Chinese airlines to buy about 620 aircraft between now and
2011 to replace older aircraft and provide capacity for growth currently
averaging about 30 per cent a year.
China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest in Xian and China Northern in
Shenyang, are already Airbus customers and operators.
China Eastern has already ordered the new A340 aircraft, while two Chinese
manufacturers - the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and the Xian Aircraft
Company - are supplying parts for Airbus aircraft.
The four-engine A340s ordered by China are powered by CFM56 engines jointly
manufactured by General Electric of the US and Snecma of France.
However, Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, which also makes engines for
the Airbus, yesterday won business worth about Pounds 70m to supply engines,
spares and maintenance support for nine Fokker twin engine regional jets
ordered by British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled service
airline.
The deal is part of a four-year Pounds 275m fleet acquisition plan announced
by British Midland.
The UK airline is acquiring on lease arrangements 17 jets including five
Fokker 70s, five Fokker 100s, and eight Boeing 737-500s to replace 13 older
McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and four Boeing 737-300s.
Rolls-Royce also won a Dollars 140m order for engines when United Parcel
Services (UPS), the US freighter airline, decided to buy ten additional 757
cargo aircraft worth Dollars 600m.
The new order will bring to 65 the number of 757s operated by UPS.

ROLLS-ROYCE and National Power of Britain yesterday announced plans to
invest in two power stations in India. The moves suggest foreign groups are
beginning to overcome the regulatory and other hurdles restricting entry
into the Indian power industry.
The announcements were the highlight of the opening day of a week of British
business events in Bombay which included meetings between businessmen, and
between Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister and Mr Douglas Hurd,
the British foreign secretary.
National Power, the generating group, together with Ashok Leyland, the
Indian operating company of the London-based Hinduja business family, plans
to take a 51 per cent stake in a Rs32bn (Pounds 684m) project for a 1,000MW
coal-fired plant at Visakhapatnam in the central Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh.
The power purchase agreement is the first of its kind for a big power
station. The government has been encouraging private companies, including
foreign groups, to invest in power to alleviate chronic shortages, but the
terms of power purchase agreements and of government guarantees have proved
a stumbling block in many of the 40-plus projects under discussion. Indian
officials hope the National Power agreement will now encourage other
investors to press ahead with their negotiations.
Rolls-Royce plans to invest in a Rs20bn station in partnership with the R P
Goenka group, a Calcutta-based business combine. The 500MW plant is to be
built at Chandil in the eastern state of Bihar. The partners propose to
share a 40 per cent stake with the rest of the equity coming from a public
issue, topped up with bank loans. Rolls-Royce is to have a Pounds 275m
turnkey contract to supply equipment, much of it from the UK.

FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Vietnam contract for Laing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JOHN LAING, the British construction group, has won a contract to design,
construct and operate a new Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) international
passenger terminal at the Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, subject to a feasibility
study which should be completed this year.
John Laing International is the first British company to win a licence for
construction since the late 1980s. The terminal will be built in conjunction
with the Northern Airports Region of Vietnam.
The terminal, which would be ready in two years, could handle 2.5m
international passengers, against a current traffic of 500,000.
It will apparently be based on Birmingham International Airport's Eurohub
terminal, built by Laing Midlands.
The contract was initialled last summer following a visit to Britain of Mr
Vo Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister.
Mr Bruce Boys, managing director of John Laing International, said: 'We are
obviously pleased to be one of the first British companies to be involved in
Vietnam's expansion. We feel there will be huge investment in Vietnam in the
next few years.'

<TEXT>
GERMAN industrialists accompanying Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a visit to
China yesterday signed some 20 contracts and letters of intent worth
approximately DM3bn (Pounds 1.1bn), David Waller reports from Frankfurt.
The contracts, signed in Beijing in the presence of Mr Kohl and Mr Li Peng,
Chinese premier (pictured above), are the fruits of intensive efforts by
German industry and government to cultivate China as the growth market of
the future for exports of capital goods.
Among the deals signed yesterday was China's purchase of six A340 airbuses
worth DM1.2bn. In addition, a consortium consisting of Siemens and AEG
signed a DM628m letter of intent to build a new 18km stretch of underground
railway in Guangzhou in the southern province of Canton, which is due to
start running at the end of 1998.
German companies will also build three power stations and German shipyards
will supply eight ships, contracts worth DM450m and DM500m respectively.
Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, will be
building telecommunications satellites.
Deutsche Waggonbau, a state-owned company in the east of Germany, signed a
contract to supply DM165m of railway wagons for the Chinese railway system.
Other contracts were for the building of a fork-lift truck factory, and
potash and machine-tool deliveries.
Mr Kohl is accompanied on his week-long tour of China by 40 of Germany's
most senior industrialists, including Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of
Daimler-Benz, Mr Heinrich von Pierer of Siemens and Mr Ferdinand Piech of
Volkswagen, an indication of the importance that Germany places on China's
market.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: White House deal makers harvest support for
Nafta
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPPORT for the North American Free Trade Agreement mounted yesterday as
the White House began to deliver written promises to various interest
groups, particularly on agriculture, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Opposition leaders tried to blunt momentum with harsh criticism of the
Administration's deal-making. Ms Lori Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader,
announced the formation of the 'Nafta Pork Patrol' to document and make
public the deal-making surrounding the Nafta vote.
From five to eight pro-Nafta votes were gained by an Administration promise
to order an investigation into Canadian wheat imports if a dispute over
alleged Canadian subsidies is not resolved in 60 days. The investigation
could result in tariffs and quotas, although there is no guarantee that it
will.
Mr Jeff Lundberg, president of the National Association of Wheat Farmers,
said Canadian wheat exports to the US soared from 10.5m bushes in 1988-89 to
47.8m bushels in 1992-93 with the help of subsidies and predatory pricing
methods. However, some farm analysts believe Canada only made headway for
its exports after the US used subsidies to sell its wheat abroad, causing
supply shortfalls and raising prices.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, took
to the House floor to defend the White House. 'This Administration has
repaired the weaknesses of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the Bush
Administration's Nafta. The Nafta is now a good deal for wheat and sugar
farmers,' he said.
Representatives of citrus growers, who yesterday were preparing to announce
support for Nafta, said they had 'a honey of a deal.' The Administration
promised not to agree to a Uruguay Round deal which would cut US citrus
tariffs any more than 15 per cent. Also promised was a temporary rise in
tariffs on Mexican citrus if prices fall below a certain level.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: What is Nafta?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American Free Trade Agreement would gradually eliminate almost all
trade and investment restrictions between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15
years. Side agreements, concluded in August, require the enforcement of
environmental and some labour laws, under penalty of fines or sanctions.
The US and Canada entered a free trade agreement in 1989, and the pact would
thus mainly affect trade and investment with Mexico. Nafta is intended to
come into effect on January 1, although a delay is allowed for.
The Canadian Parliament has already approved the agreement. The US House of
Representatives is scheduled to vote on it today and the US Senate some time
after. The Mexican Senate, dominated by the country's governing party, will
vote on Nafta after the vote in the US House of Representatives.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Tariffs reduced over 15 years, depending on sector.
Investment restrictions lifted in most sectors, with exception of oil in
Mexico, culture in Canada, and airline and radio communications in the US.
Immigration excluded, except some movement of white collar workers to be
eased.
Any country can leave the treaty with six months' notice.
Treaty allows for the inclusion of any additional country.
Government procurement opened up over 10 years, mainly affecting Mexico,
which reserves some contracts for Mexican companies.
Dispute resolution panels of independent arbitrators to resolve
disagreements arising out of treaty.
Some snap-back tariffs if surge of imports hurts a domestic industry.
INDUSTRIES
Agriculture: Most tariffs between US and Mexico removed immediately. Tariffs
on 6 per cent of products - corn, sugar, and some fruits and vegetables -
fully eliminated only after 15 years. For Canada, existing agreement with
the US applies.
Cars:Tariffs removed over 10 years; Mexico's quotas on imports lifted over
the same period; cars eventually to meet 62.5 per cent local content rule to
be free of tariffs.
Energy: Mexican ban on private sector exploration continues, but procurement
by state oil company opened up to US and Canada.
Financial Services: Mexico gradually opens financial sector to US and
Canadian investment, eliminating barriers by 2007.
Textiles: Treaty eliminates Mexican, US and Canadian tariffs over 10 years.
Clothes eligible for tariff breaks to be sewn with fabric woven in North
America.
Trucking: North American trucks could drive anywhere in the three countries
by the year 2000.
SIDE AGREEMENTS
Environment: The three countries liable to fines, and Mexico and the US
sanctions, if a panel finds repeated pattern of not enforcing environment
laws.
Labour. Countries liable for penalties for non-enforcement of child, minimum
wage and health and safety laws.
OTHER DEALS
The US and Mexico to set up a North American Development Bank to help
finance clean-up of the US border
The US to spend about Dollars 90m in the first 18 months retraining workers
losing their jobs because of treaty.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Congress gears up for vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDESPREAD assumption is that if the North American Free Trade Agreement
is defeated in the House of Representatives tonight the cause of liberalised
world trade is in deep trouble.
There is little doubt, for example, that an even bigger cloud will promptly
gather over the head of the Uruguay Round, itself due to be completed by the
congressionally mandated deadline of December 15.
Yet there is one element in this equation which may not stand up to scrutiny
 -that a defeat for Nafta denotes such a depth of protectionism in Congress
that even if the Round is concluded it, too, would face certain rejection on
Capitol Hill.
The pro-Nafta forces, led with exceptional intensity as the vote approaches
by President Bill Clinton, understandably prefer to confine public
connections between the two to warnings of the fearful consequences for the
wider agreement and for the damage a Nafta defeat would inflict on US
leadership as it pursues a more open global trading regime.
In private, however, Nafta's supporters, and even some of its opponents,
will even go so far as to argue that a cathartic rejection of the
hemispheric pact would, if anything, reinforce prospects of the Uruguay
Round getting through. But to admit this openly would, for the
administration, have the effect of lowering the stakes and thus raising
chances of Nafta's rejection.
Everything, of course, initially depends on there being a Gatt agreement at
all, the hopes for which will certainly not be improved if Nafta goes down.
But US diplomats are quite encouraged by signals from Europe that French
resistance to agricultural concessions may be softening and that it will not
use a defeat for Nafta as a cover for its own refusal to reach agreement in
the Uruguay Round.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, is understood to have been particularly
impressed by last week's OECD report which concluded that a Gatt agreement
could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn by 2002, the highest
independent estimate yet of the potential accrued benefits.
But the key to the more optimistic US private scenario is the sense that it
will be hard to duplicate in Congress the sort of opposition to the Uruguay
Round that, win or lose, has characterised the Nafta debate.
Some elements of the anti-Nafta coalition, which includes the far right and
the progressive left, will remain dead set against the Uruguay Round. Mr
Ralph Nader's populist consumer movement, for example, sees it as yet
another plot by multinational corporations to extend their hegemony over the
international economy.
The 'America First' lobby, associated with Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative
ideologue-politician, is inherently suspicious of international
entanglements. Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential
candidate, is also making threatening noises against the Round. But the
clout of the populists in Congress still does not even remotely approximate
that of organised labour.
And the trade union movement, which has made Nafta into such an immediate
life-or-death jobs issue that it has entered into unholy alliances with the
populists of the right, has no record of entrenched opposition to global
trading accords as a matter of first principle.
Indeed, since President Kennedy secured passage in 1962 of his Trade
Expansion Act, no global bill has faced a tough fight in Congress. This is
essentially because congressmen, including those on the left of the
Democratic Party, do not like being labelled protectionist. Vice president
Al Gore knows this full well from his years in Congress.
Gatt agreements, often imperfectly understood on Capitol Hill, rarely can be
construed to pose particular threats to the constituencies of individual
members. As one lobbyist observed this week, 'It is hard to get people in
Evanston, Illinois, excited about competition from Malaysia.'
Nafta, on the other hand, deals with two neighbours, Canada and Mexico, the
second of whom is demonstrably different from the US politically, socially,
and in its economic development. It is a very particular US policy
initiative, with no exact antecedents.
Any consolation that believers in free trade may take from the above
argument does not reduce the importance of tonight's vote. Even allowing for
the hyperboles being thrown by both sides, the US political bottom line is
that the authority of the president is at stake, as may be the political
future of this incumbent, Bill Clinton. This, in turn, has imponderable
international ramifications on issues way beyond free trade.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S plan to expand trading relations with Europe, Latin America and
Asia if the North American Free Trade Agreement is rejected by the US
Congress today faces the problem that many non-Americans are less likely to
invest in Mexico without it.
In an effort to lessen its dependence on the Nafta, Mexico has already
signed a free trade agreement with Chile, and plans to sign new accords with
Venezuela and Colombia by the end of this year.
The government hopes to become a full member of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development by next spring, and is actively
looking for bilateral investment agreements with Europe and Asia.
Its threat to diversify trade away from the US has been used by President
Bill Clinton as an argument in favour of signing Nafta. If Nafta was
rejected, he said, Mexico might sign trade agreements with Japan or the
European Union. 'That could change the purchasing habits of 90m Mexicans and
hundreds of millions of people in Latin America,' he warned.
However officials in Mexico City from the European Union and Japan say there
is no interest in signing a special trade agreement with Mexico. Such an
accord would be contrary to their policies of seeking multilateral trade
agreements and would upset strategically more important countries, they say.
Even if there were such agreements, the economic effect would be slight,
given the small role their countries play in Mexico's economy, the officials
say.
'Mexico has 70 per cent of its trade with the US, and will never have that
with Europe and Japan,' says Mr Jacques Lecomte, the representative of the
EU in Mexico City.
From 1989 to August this year Mexico received more than 65 per cent of its
foreign investment from the US, 18.7 per cent from the EU and 2.2 per cent
from Japan. And the proportion of new investment from the US is growing.
Businessmen and diplomats from the EC and Japan say a rejection of Nafta
would probably have a negative impact on their trade and investment with
Mexico. While Nafta discriminates against European and Asian companies in
investment rules and tariffs, the treaty gives Mexico guaranteed access to
the US market, and would increase growth, making the country more attractive
to outside investors.
'Without the treaty in place it will be difficult to continue investing in
Mexico,' says Mr Ryuhei Kato, the head of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce
in Mexico City. 'It will change the whole perspective of the Japanese
presence in Mexico.'
Mr Masasumi Yamamoto, Japan's commercial attache in Mexico City concurs.
'Some Japanese companies are considering investing in Mexico to export to
the US. In this sense the failure of Nafta would lessen interest in the
country and affect investment negatively,' he says.

<TEXT>
OPTIMISM has grown this week among trade negotiators in Geneva that a trade
liberalising Uruguay Round accord can be completed successfully by the
deadline of December 15, despite concern over the potentially damaging
impact of rejection by the US Congress of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
'You can see it coming together,' a top US negotiator noted: 'It's hard to
believe that any of the issues remaining will hang the agreement.'
Although negotiators failed to meet the November 15 deadline for completion
of a tariff-cutting market access package, confidence has been buoyed by
successful completion of draft texts on a proposed Multilateral Trade
Organisation to succeed Gatt and improved disputes settlement.
EU negotiators are also due to table proposals for trade in audio-visual
services, while the US is urging reform of dumping rules.
The slippage in the market access talks largely reflects the inability of
the US and EU to resolve their outstanding differences. Next week's meeting
in Washington between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey
Kantor, his US counterpart, is critical in breaking the logjam between the
two.
The EU says it will lower fish tariffs and will cut duties on electronics
and non-ferrous metals if the US cuts very high textiles tariffs. Washington
is due to table a revised tariff offer in Geneva this week.
US negotiators made light yesterday of the effect on the Uruguay Round talks
of Congressional rejection of Nafta. 'A lot in Congress who voted against
Nafta would go out of their way to say they are not going protectionist,'
said one.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: US textiles caucus urges tougher stance in
trade talks
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Clinton is being pressed by members of the House textiles caucus
to harden the US stand in textile negotiations in the Uruguay Round to win
votes for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ten congressmen from textile and apparel producing states last week told the
president that commitments on a number of issues - including the Uruguay
Round - 'would help decide our vote on Nafta and could influence the vote of
other Members with textile and apparel constituencies.'
The Clinton Administration is engaged in a frantic last minute effort to eke
out 218 votes in favour of Nafta. Most of the members, who signed the
letter, are undecided or planning to vote against Nafta, but they are less
worried about Nafta than the Uruguay Round. However, in Geneva the US is
being pressed to make further concessions by lowering its highest tariffs.
'The US has already made significant concessions in the Uruguay Round,' they
said in a letter to the President. 'If you want support for Nafta from
members from textile constituencies, extend the phase-out of the Multifibre
Arrangement from 10 to 15 years.'
This would also be supported by the Caribbean countries, who 'realise that
it will be hard for them to compete in the US market against lower-wage
nations like China once trade-allocation by quotas is eliminated.'
The congressmen said the staging of tariff reductions and quota phase-outs
should be gradually implemented over a 15 years. For quotas, the US should
not agree to lift restrictions on products for which foreign market
penetration exceeds 20 per cent until the last possible stage.
The US industry and their European counterparts are close to agreement on
tariff reductions, they added. 'Our government should make no offer beyond
the levels European and American industry have discussed.'

THE National party early today picked up the crucial Waitaki seat from
Labour in the official recount of New Zealand's election, giving it a
slender majority in the new parliament.
The win gave the party, headed by prime minister Jim Bolger, 50 seats in the
99-seat single-chamber parliament and Labour 45, with two minor parties, the
Alliance and New Zealand First, having two seats each.
But opposition parties were expected to demand that Mr Bolger's government
provide a Speaker, who may have to use his casting vote to support the
government on crucial matters.
There were two marginal seats left to be declared, but political analysts
thought they were unlikely to cause an upset.
Labour's narrow loss of Waitaki was the first change since the official
recount began in the cliffhanger election, held on November 6. But a number
of seats are held with tiny majorities and some defeated candidates say they
will seek judicial reviews or electoral petitions, which could mean that the
final outcome may not be known till January.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Palestinians want own central bank

PALESTINIANS negotiating future economic relations with Israel yesterday
insisted on their own central bank with the power to issue a separate
currency and wide-ranging powers of independent decision-making in trade and
taxation policy.
In the first set of Palestinian-Israeli economic talks, which concluded in
Paris last night, Palestinian delegates stressed they were seeking real
economic sovereignty in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of
Jericho and wanted independent economic decision-making to lay the basis for
statehood. Israel is due to start a four-month military withdrawal from
Gaza-Jericho next month.
Despite public statements by heads of both delegations about the good
atmosphere at the talks, deep divisions are apparent. On the critical issue
of Israel's proposal for a customs union, Palestinian delegates said they
would not accept Israeli imposition of a uniform customs and tax regime;
they wanted all customs revenues on Palestinian imports to accrue to an
independent Palestinian treasury and would insist on free trade with Jordan.
They also object to the word 'union' which they believe carries unacceptable
political implications negating their claims to sovereignty.
'We don't reject a customs union but we want to have our own economic
decisions about customs, taxation and investment policy,' said Mr Mohamed
Abu-Koash, PLO director for international economic affairs. 'But after 27
years of occupation we want to decide how best to develop our economic
interests and sectors and encourage the right investments and we cannot
begin with the same taxes as Israel.'
Mr David Brodet, Israel's director of the state budget, was more optimistic.
'Both sides agree on the need for the free movement of goods, services and
labour between Israel and the Palestinian economy. There will be some
exceptions and maybe a phased exposure but the principle is agreed and
everything else can be negotiated.'
In money and banking the Palestinians made it clear for the first time they
want an independent central bank with full powers to issue a Palestinian
currency, control, license and hold the reserves of commercial banks and to
direct monetary policy. 'We are talking about the economic sovereignty of
the Palestinian nation,' Mr Abu-Koash said. 'We are not going to let anyone
else exercise the rights over our monetary policy. We will have a purely
Palestinian institution.'
Israel is unhappy about the imminent prospect of a Palestinian central bank
and prefers a gradual handover of monetary policy beginning with a
Palestinian currency board. Palestinians also said they wanted Israel to
remove barriers to Palestinian and Arab investment.
The two sides agreed to establish three sub-committees to meet in Paris next
week to bridge the differences of opinion on economic relations. They will
focus on the main policy issues: trade and labour; money and banking; and
fiscal policy. A joint statement said economic co-operation would be based
on 'reciprocity, equity and fair economic relations as well as the
enhancement of the role of the private sector in promoting economic growth'.

COCOM, the western organisation set up in 1950 to block the export of
sensitive goods to Communist countries, is to be replaced by April 1994 with
a new scheme open to a broad range of new members, including Russia and
other former east bloc countries.
Officials from the 17 Cocom countries, meeting yesterday in The Hague, said
discussions with Russia would begin in a matter of days. Other potential new
members include Efta countries such as Sweden and Austria, but also Ireland,
New Zealand and Hong Kong.
'We would also encourage China to participate in our organisation as early
as possible, but that means we have to come to a common understanding,' Mr
Frans Engering, director-general of foreign economic relations at the Dutch
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said. The focus will be on export of sensitive
military and dual-use industrial goods.

the constitutional protections afforded private citizens. 'There is no
'military exception' to the constitution,' it said. 'Indeed, even when the
Supreme Court has deferred to military judgment, it has been careful to do
so only within the confines of ordinary constitutional analysis.'
'When the military fails to accord individuals the equal protection of the
laws, it treads upon an area of expertise that has long been conceded to the
courts,' the judgment declared. 'America's hallmark has been to judge people
by what they do and not by who they are.'
The court's logic is very similar to that advanced by President Bill Clinton
whose controversial insistence on ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals has
been rooted in the argument that only conduct in uniform should be the
determining factor in a person's fitness to serve.
The case concerned Mr Joseph Steffan, expelled from the Naval Academy in
1987, just before he was due to graduate, after a navy investigation had
confirmed that he had told a fellow cadet he was homosexual. His initial
appeal against expulsion was dismissed by a lower court.

AFRICA WATCH, the human rights group, yesterday warned that ethnic conflict
in Kenya could degenerate into civil war unless President Daniel arap Moi's
government took immediate steps to end the violence, Leslie Crawford writes
from Nairobi.
In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating
tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands
have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system
in 1991.
'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this
ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to
prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says.
'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President
Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere
conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.'
The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the
Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are
distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority
tribes.
The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet
donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid.

FT  17 NOV 93 / S Africa deal close on power sharing

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government and the African National Congress last night
struck a deal to placate the white right wing, agreeing to guarantee the
white minority a substantial share of power in local government.
The deal takes the form of joint proposals from the two sides for
incorporation in the new constitution due to be agreed later today. It
represents an important victory for the ruling National party, which has
made considerable concessions in recent days over the issue of power sharing
in central government, and devolution of power to regions, but held out on
the sensitive issue of local government power-sharing.
If the proposals are finalised in the constitution, local government
elections will be held within two years and will guarantee whites at least a
30 per cent share of local councils, and in some cases one third or more of
the council. The deal is aimed at rural towns in the ultra-conservative
Orange Free State and Transvaal, where whites are heavily outnumbered by
blacks and fear that the merging of white and black local councils will
prove a serious drain on the budgets of white towns.
Local council budgets will require a two-thirds majority to pass, a figure
which will give whites an effective veto in this area, under most
circumstances.
Tension between black and white is most acute at local government level,
because residential areas remain almost totally segregated, and the gap in
the level of development between white and black areas remains huge. The
white right-wing has been effective at mobilising opposition to the new
constitution at local level, and negotiators from both sides were clearly
keen to defuse this threat.
Councils elected at the first local government polls, which are likely to
take place late next year or early in 1995, will remain in office for three
years. After that, a new electoral system will be agreed.
Last night Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, and President F W de Klerk, were
due to meet to approve the whole package of deals on which the new
constitution will be based.

ISRAEL yesterday accused Syria of fomenting a worsening of hostilities in
southern Lebanon, during which 12 members of a pro-Israeli militia were
captured by Hizbollah gunmen.
Yesterday's violence was the worst since Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation signed their peace accords in Washington two months ago.
Israeli ministers claimed Syria had ordered the Hizbollah attacks, out of
frustration at Israel's refusal to meet Damascus' peace demands by
withdrawing from the Golan Heights.
Lebanon's Defence Minister Mohsen Dalloul claimed Israel was heightening
tension to undermine 'positive moves towards a just peace'.
During the fighting, between Hizbollah, and Israeli troops and their South
Lebanon Army militia allies, two Israeli soldiers were wounded by rockets
landing metres from the Israeli border. Hizbollah launched grenades against
six villages inside Israel's self-proclaimed south Lebanon 'security zone'.

FT  17 NOV 93 / WHO sets out HIV strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Health Organisation yesterday launched a new Aids research
strategy which it says 'could revolutionise' efforts to prevent the disease.
The WHO, the United Nations health agency, will co-ordinate a campaign by
the world's pharmaceutical industry to develop a safe antiviral agent
capable of killing or inactivating HIV, the virus that causes Aids. It would
probably take the form of a gel or foam which a woman could administer to
her vagina before having sex.
Dr Michael Merson, head of the WHO Aids programme, said a vaginal virucide
'would make a real difference to the future course of this epidemic'.
The male condom remained the primary means of preventing HIV transmission,
he said. 'However, faced with the prospect of at least 1m women being
infected with HIV every year, it is clear that we need a new method to
enable women to protect themselves from HIV infection.'
Sperm-killing contraceptives, including the widely used nonoxynol-9, kill
HIV in test-tube tests but there is no evidence that they prevent viral
transmission in practice. Indeed some clinical studies suggest that their
long-term use may increase the risk of infection by damaging the vaginal
lining.
The new strategy follows a meeting at WHO headquarters in Geneva, at which
representatives of 21 drug companies (including Glaxo and Wellcome of the
UK) agreed to a co-ordinated R&amp;D effort.
Dr Merson said an existing compound might turn out to work in clinical
trials; if so, it could be used in Aids prevention within two or three
years. 'A new product may take longer to develop but this meeting has
demonstrated a commitment from all sectors to a concentrated research
effort.'

HUNDREDS of Iraqi intruders planted the Iraqi flag on Kuwaiti territory
yesterday to protest against a border security trench being dug by the
emirate, the United Nations said, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
About 250 Iraqis threw stones to chase away workers digging the trench which
they said had been built on Iraqi farms without warning.
It was the second border confrontation in a month between Kuwait and its
former occupier. It came two days before the UN Security Council holds a
regular 60-day review of economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its
August 1990 conquest of the emirate.
'The Iraqi liaison officer to Unikom. . . stated (to Unikom) this was a
peaceful demonstration by the Iraqi farmers angry about the digging
operations through their farms without any warning, a Unikom statement said.
'He added that they had been led to understand that the trench would only be
dug through their farms once compensation had been resolved by the UN
headquarters in New York.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Politicians all at sea as violence racks Algeria: A look at
the breakdown of law and order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 3,000 people have been killed in Algeria since the suspension of the
elections 22 months ago that the radical Islamic Salvation Front was poised
to win.
The violence has taken on new forms, notably the torching of factories,
schools and forests. Armed bands roam large parts of the country. Some have
become de facto no-go areas where army units hunt armed members of radical
Islamic groups, the most notorious of which is the Movement Islamiste Arme.
Many of the 350 foreign companies in Algeria have repatriated the wives and
children of employees - the number of children attending the French lycee in
Algiers has dropped by a third.
Racketeering and anonymous threats are rife. It is not advised to travel by
Land Rover, a much prized vehicle not only for terrorists but also the
thousands of Algerians who make their living in the black market.
Extortion is practised by local gangs - young Algerians whose despair at the
bleakness of their future is matched by contempt for their leaders whom they
dismiss as houkoumat mikky (Mickey Mouse government).
The politicians they loathe, meanwhile, continue to talk. A Commission of
National Reconciliation (CRN), which includes five civilian and three
military members, meets regularly in the increasingly desperate hope of
finding common ground among 'reformers', under which label a rich mixture is
to be found.
The now banned FIS is not officially party to these talks though there are
persistent rumours that secret contacts have been established between the
CRN and more moderate members of the FIS, either in Algeria or abroad.
The fundamentalists for their part are apparently as fragmented as their lay
brothers. But those who operate in Algeria have made clear that the Islamic
leaders in exile do not speak for them. 'We are preparing a larger battle
which will only come to an end when this godless regime is destroyed and the
last foreigner has left Algerian soil,' one MIA leaflet said.
The army, the key fount of power in Algeria since independence, remains in
the background.
The key challenge confronting Algeria is succession. Those who hold power
and have run the affairs of state since 1962 still claim their legitimacy
rests on their fight against France between 1954 and 1962. That cuts little
ice either with younger Algerians - 70 per cent of whom are under 30 and
mostly unemployed - or with many professionals who are voting with their
feet. Hundreds of thousands are already abroad.
The statistics are alarming: factories are functioning, at best, at 50 per
cent capacity; 84 per cent of Algerians between the ages of 15 and 30 are
without a job; 102,000 jobs were created annually between 1967 and 1990 when
234,000 were needed; farming yields are the lowest in the Mediterranean; the
country imports Dollars 2bn worth of food every year, which amounts to more
than two thirds of its needs.
The government led, since last August, by Mr Redha Malek is committed to
bold economic reform and negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
and Algeria's leading creditors. The object is to loosen the noose of
foreign debt which this year will absorb 83 per cent of the country's
foreign income, 97 per cent of which derives from the sale of hydrocarbons.
Massive injections of cash into state companies which remained unreformed
have pushed up the budget deficit from 7 per cent of GDP in 1992 to 17 per
cent this year. Inflation has increased officially by half to 30 per cent
and the black market rate of the dinar slipped by about 30 per cent.
An IMF programme, probably implemented over a three-year period, is seen as
a key to future western confidence. Much depends on Algeria's capacity to
implement an agreement, if one is possible. One example of gross
mismanagement in the implementation of the June 1991 IMF standby deal was
the way money set aside to protect the poorest Algerians against the effects
of rising prices was distributed. The then prime minister, Mr Sid Ahmed
Ghozali, left the local authorities, then mostly controlled by the FIS, to
do the job. They put 7m people on the list, distributed a miserly 140 dinars
to each and told them it was a gift from Allah.
Meanwhile the Moslem faith remains, as across the Islamic world, a powerful
weapon in the hands of the wretched of the earth. Many Algerians complain
that western Europe harbours radical Islamic leaders, that if France,
Germany and Britain do not help them 'eradicate terrorism' they will come to
regret an 'Islamic victory' not just in neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia,
but right across the southern shores of the Mediterranean.

THE Indian army lifted its month-long siege of Kashmir's holiest shrine
early yesterday after armed separatists 'surrendered' to the state police,
following a negotiated settlement.
Officials said 65 people, including an unspecified number of militants, left
the marble buildings of Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine in two groups between
1am and 2.30 am.
Brigadier S P S Kanwar said the government had instructed the army not to
interrogate the people who left the marble buildings of the shrine.
'We noted down their names but we did not screen them nor have we
interrogated them as per the agreement,' Brig Kanwar said.
The militants' demand to be interrogated by local police rather than the
army had been a considerable obstacle to ending the standoff, Kashmiri
politicians close to the guerrillas say.
Brig Kanwar's remarks were at variance with Indian Prime Minister P V
Narasimha Rao, who said earlier there had been no compromise with the
militants.
The siege has exacerbated a four-year-old uprising against Indian rule in
the Himayalan state, the only Moslem-majority region in mainly Hindu India.
However, life in Srinagar and many parts of the valley remained disrupted
yesterday, as militants refused to call off a strike imposed two weeks ago
to protest against the siege of Hazratbal.
Hundreds of men, women and children tried to break the army cordon to enter
the shrine, considered sacred because it houses a holy relic believed to be
a hair of the Prophet Mohammed's beard.
Leaders of the all-party Huriyat Conference, a powerful organisation
representing militant groups, held an emergency meeting last night, and said
that members of the Moslem clergy had been called in to verify the
authenticity of the relic.
In 1963 when the hair disappeared for almost two weeks, thousands of
Kashmiris marched through Srinagar.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Japan's trade surplus grows more slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S TRADE surplus widened to Dollars 11.09bn (Pounds 7.4bn) last month,
showing for the third month running a slower growth rate, or even a decline
if measured in yen.
The trend continued by yesterday's figure augurs well for Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa's meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Seattle on
Friday, at which the Japanese government expects Washington to seek evidence
of how it plans to narrow the politically troublesome trade gap.
The October dollar surplus rose by 1.7 per cent from the same month last
year, the 34th monthly increase running, but a far slower rate of increase
than the 3.8 per cent year-on-year rise in September, said the finance
ministry.
Japan's bilateral surplus with the US was Dollars 5.2bn last month, up from
Dollars 4.94bn in the same month last year. Japanese exports to the US rose
by 3 per cent, while imports rose by a mere 0.2 per cent.
In yen terms, Japan's overall trade gap shrank by 11.2 per cent to Y1,156bn,
the same amount as in September. Imports declined by 11.8 per cent, because
of weakness of domestic consumption, while exports slipped in yen terms by
11.6 per cent.
Yesterday's trade figures intensified dissent from Japanese business groups
over the government's continued resistance to US calls for numerically
targeted reductions in the trade and current accounts surpluses.
'It would be easier for Japanese companies to adjust if they had a specific
target, such as a certain percentage of gross national product,' said Mr
Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation.
The government believes such targets are neither desirable nor possible in a
free market economy. However, industrialists believe a concession to the US
would help reduce the value of the yen, so reducing exchange rate losses and
restoring price competitiveness in export markets.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Six state polls prove gruelling test for Rao: If Congress
does badly, intra-party bickering could worsen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY a third of India's voters are going to the polls this month in six
state elections in the north of the country that are proving the most
important electoral test for Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime
minister, since he launched wide-ranging economic liberalisation in
mid-1991.
While myriad personal and local rivalries will colour the outcome in many of
the 1,123 constituencies, the results will be a significant test for the
ruling Congress (I) party and for the main opposition party, the right-wing
Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, which plunged Indian politics into turmoil a
year ago when its supporters tore down the Ayodhya mosque.
If Congress does well, the party could rally behind the prime minister and
the reforms. But if it fares badly, the intra-party bickering which has
plagued Mr Rao for the past year could get worse and undermine the
government's ability to handle pressing national problems, including the
Kashmir crisis, relations with Pakistan, and further economic reform. If
Congress does badly, the BJP has pledged to demand early general elections.
In the words of one expert: 'The state elections will set the political tone
for some time to come'.
Opinion polls suggest Congress is likely to do better than its leaders
expected earlier this year. Then, the party was reeling from a wave of
support for the BJP, compounded by the political impact of the riots which
followed the Ayodhya troubles and the bombings in Bombay.
The past six months have seen no surge of support for Congress but they seem
to have witnessed a modest ebbing in the BJP's popularity. BJP leaders badly
need electoral success to rekindle the enthusiasms created by their fight to
claim for Hindus the Ayodhya mosque site, but early indications are they may
not get it.
Congress fared so badly in the last state elections, when the BJP seized
control of four of the six states, that it seems certain this time to
improve its showing, however little. If it wins back control of even one
state, Mr Rao will be able to claim he is turning the BJP tide.
The polls' timing is the product of the Ayodhya crisis. The BJP-controlled
governments in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh
were dismissed mid-term last December by the central government for
allegedly encouraging the mosque's destruction. Mr Rao put off calling
elections immediately, for fear the BJP would benefit from the post-Ayodhya
turmoil.
He could not postpone the day of reckoning indefinitely, but the delay seems
to have worked in his favour. Largely for administrative reasons, polls are
also being held simultaneously in the city of Delhi and Mizoram, in India's
remote north-east.
Polling is spread throughout November: Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan
have already voted; Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh vote this week, Mizoram
next week. The ballot boxes from the early elections are being held under
lock and key until after the vote in Madhya Pradesh, to ensure results from
one state do not influence those in another.
Party leaders are enduring an exhausting cycle of public rallies held
hundreds of miles apart and separated by long journeys. For many candidates,
campaigning hinges on persuading a party leader to pay a visit, however
brief, and make some spectacular promise: a new school, a road, an
international airport.
The last example is not an invention, but a serious demand from
mango-growers in Uttar Pradesh who want to export their fragile fruit
without subjecting it to a 500-km lorry ride to Delhi.
Personal position matters more than party. Film stars and the children of
former maharajas do particularly well. So do the wives, sons and other
relatives of politicians. Money is needed for everything from securing a
party ticket to transporting voters on polling day and providing
refreshments. Violence is not uncommon; thousands have been placed under
preventive arrest, including some candidates.
National issues are obscured in the electoral fray but are not entirely
obliterated. Congress speakers do mention economic reform, albeit often in
passing. They prefer to discuss vague subjects such as the party's role in
building the Indian nation.
Life-size cut-out figures of Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the
assassinated former prime ministers, are displayed, usually more prominently
than those of Mr Rao.
The BJP's campaign centres on attacks on the Congress party's social
policies which it claims favour India's Moslem minority at the expense of
the Hindu majority. Ayodhya figures prominently, but less so than a year
ago. Speakers also berate the government for its handling of the month-long
siege in the troubled northern state of Kashmir where the security forces
have surrounded Moslem militants in a mosque. BJP leaders say Mr Rao should
have flushed the militants out long ago.
In most constituencies, the fight is mainly between Congress and the BJP.
But in Uttar Pradesh, two powerful alternative groupings are also in the
running, both left-of-centre and both strongly anti-BJP. One is Janata Dal,
led by Mr V P Singh, a former prime minister, and the other the Samajwadi
Janata Party, headed by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, a socialist popular with the
lower castes.
Since Uttar Pradesh is India's largest state and the historical crucible of
north Indian culture, its poll result will be especially significant. As one
local official says: 'When people vote here, Delhi cannot afford to ignore
them'.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Keating to push land rights bill: Legislation sparks bitter
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KEATING government yesterday introduced its native land rights bill into
the Australian parliament, and indicated that it hopes to have the
contentious and complex legislation on the statute book by Christmas.
Mr Kim Beazley, leader of the government's business in the House of
Representatives, declined to rule out use of a parliamentary guillotine,
saying that speedy passage was desirable to ensure certainty. Mr Paul
Keating, the prime minister, also said that 'most aspects of the bill' would
come into force by January 1, provided parliament approved the package.
However, any forcing of the pace is being resisted by the opposition
parties, and by the West Australian government, which is vehemently opposed
to the federal package and has introduced rival land rights legislation.
The legislation aims to protect native title where Aborigines can show a
continuous link to traditional lands. Aborigines will be empowered to
negotiate on land use but will not have the right to veto development.
Native title tribunals are to be set up to rule on land claims and set
compensation. Mining leases will be validated, but native title rights can
be exercised after a grant expires.
The issue has sparked a bitter debate in Australia, with business, mining
and conservative political leaders predicting dire economic consequences if
Aborigines gained rights to land taken from them by white settlers.
The bill also establishes a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Land Fund, which will help dispossessed Aborigines acquire and maintain
land.
Mr Keating gave no figures yesterday on the size of this fund, or on the
expected cost of compensation for the ending of native title claims. An
explanatory memorandum attached to the bill said that about ADollars 6m
(Pounds 2.6m) had been set aside to fund its initial implementation, but
added that it was impossible to identify any direct liability for
compensation that the Commonwealth might have to bear, although the sums
could be 'considerable'.
Both the opposition, which has yet to formulate a response to the land
rights issue, and the minority parties who hold the balance of power in the
Senate, were last night studying details of the bill before declaring their
positions.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Rift widens on Italian budget plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S treasury minister, Mr Piero Barucci, has added his name to that of
another senior minister threatening to resign if parliament fails to pass
the 1994 budget by the formal year-end deadline.
The threat springs from a growing rift between 'technocratic' ministers, who
hold some of the key portfolios in the government of Prime Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, and parliament.
Last month, Mr Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister, said he would step down
if the 1994 spending plans, for which his ministry is largely responsible,
were not passed in time.
Last Friday, the budget was approved by the Senate, the upper house of
parliament, after an unusually long examination. It is now before the lower
house, where opposition is likely to be even tougher.
Although ostensibly over spending cuts, the budget dispute has been
overshadowed by attempts by some politicians to prolong discussions in order
to postpone a general election, widely expected early next year. The
elections are forecast to register a sharp drop in support for the main
political parties. For many deputies under investigation for political
corruption, parliamentary immunity has been a lifeline against interrogation
and possible jail.
Mr Barucci, addressing foreign journalists in Milan, distinguished between a
brief delay in winning approval for the budget and a more serious hold-up.
'It would be a severe setback for the prime minister and the three ministers
responsible for the economy, especially the treasury', he said. Some
observers have already predicted Mr Ciampi would resign on principle if the
budget were not passed in time.
On privatisation, now moving into top gear, Mr Barucci said Italy had
reached a point of no return. No matter who came to power after the next
elections, privatisation was inevitable, he argued. The sell-offs, starting
with the Credito Italiano banking group next month, will accelerate in early
1994, with the disposal of two further financial institutions.
The biggest transactions will come later, with the flotation of the Ina
insurance group in June and the Enel electricity authority, possibly by
December. In 1995, the government expects to sell off shares in the Stet
telecommunications authority and the energy side of the Eni energy and
chemicals concern.
Mr Barucci regretted that new legislation to create private pension funds
had so far failed to produce a response. The attempt to foster a private
pensions industry, under discussion for more than a decade, was designed to
ease pressures on the overburdened state system and create a new pool of
institutional investment capital, partly to facilitate privatisations.
'In reality, the new law doesn't work,' Mr Barucci admitted. He said the
government would have to redraft the legislation to provide a more effective
stimulus.
Mr Barucci declined to say when bank creditors to Efim, the state holding
company put into liquidation in July 1992, might be reimbursed. While
regretting the government's failure to maintain earlier promises on
repayments, he ascribed the delays to constant revelations about alleged
irregularities in Efim's affairs.
'The money is ready,' he said. But 'very big problems' remained in paying it
out because of the legal actions being taken by Mr Alberto Predieri, the
special Efim administrator, against some former managers.

<TEXT>
THE FOUR Efta countries applying to join the European Union could lose their
chance of gaining membership if they do not complete accession negotiations
by the beginning of March next year, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish
foreign minister, warned yesterday.
He said any delay beyond that date of the negotiations with Austria,
Finland, Norway and Sweden could lead the EU to shelve their applications,
leaving the four, scheduled to join the community in 1995, to take their
chances 'the next time around' when expansion to include central and east
European countries was considered.
'That is why I say to them 'the time is now, the door is open. Don't
hesitate because you might not find the door being that open after March 1.'
Speed and determination in these negotiations I think are all important. I
would hate to see this opportunity being lost,' Mr Helveg Petersen told the
FT in an interview.
He said the beginning of March was the latest date that would allow time for
the present European parliament to ratify the four accession agreements
before new parliamentary elections in June. The community did not want the
negotiations 'dragging on' beyond then. 'Those less enthusiastic about
enlargement than others will ask 'when will this end, will it ever end?','
he said.
Denmark is worried about recent opinion polls in Sweden and Norway showing
majority opposition to EU membership.
However, Mr Helveg Petersen praised Norway's minority Labour government
which is facing strong hostility both within the party and from the main
opposition Centre party. The Norwegian government has previously been
accused of foot-dragging by EU officials. 'The reaction from the Norwegian
government has been heroic. There is no hesitation on their part. The
community realises the Norwegian government faces an uphill battle.'

FT  17 NOV 93 / Damages rejected against industrialist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MILAN court yesterday rejected an appeal for L81bn (Pounds 32.9m) in
damages against Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company by the
liquidators of Banco Ambrosiano, the Italian bank which collapsed in 1982,
writes Haig Simonian.
The finding concludes a long-running civil court battle brought by the
liquidators in relation to share dealings during Mr De Benedetti's two-month
stint as the bank's deputy chairman.
A separate criminal case against Mr De Benedetti, who was last year
sentenced to more than six years' imprisonment in connection with his role
at the bank, is still pending.
Although Mr De Benedetti's lawyers have launched an appeal, further hearings
remain blocked until the judges reveal the motivation for their sentence.
The delay in the case, which has now reached 20 months, is a record, even by
the slow-moving standards of Italian justice.
Yesterday's decision was 'a vote of confidence in what we've always
sustained,' said Mr De Benedetti.
Earlier this week, he said new evidence would soon come to light proving his
innocence in the Banco Ambrosiano affair.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Opel to reveal big cost-cutting measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADAM OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors, will tomorrow unveil
details of a far-reaching cost-saving plan designed to enhance productivity
at the group's German factories.
The agreement, due to be signed by the management and workforce at Opel's
Russelsheim headquarters tomorrow morning, follows Volkswagen's radical
proposal for a four-day week starting at the beginning of next year.
Opel's agreement, which will apply to its 50,000-strong workforce in western
Germany, is a response to the same cost and competition pressures faced by
its rival Volkswagen but adopts a different approach, preferring to modify
the terms of existing contracts with employees and reducing perks without
shortening the working week.
As such, it may evolve into a pattern for future settlements in German
industry as employers seek to find ways of reducing costs without embarking
on further rounds of redundancies.
'The purpose of the agreement will be to force through a linkage between
productivity and an improvement in cost structures with the payment of
benefits to employees,' a spokesman for Opel said yesterday. Opel was
reluctant to disclose details of the agreement ahead of the press conference
or to quantify the benefits of the proposed savings. But a report in a
regional German newspaper suggested yesterday that the agreement contains
three central measures. These are:
A differentiation of pay increase between basic pay and fringe benefits. The
latter accounts for a substantial proportion of German companies' wage costs
and usually increases at the same rate as for the basic income. In future
Opel fringe benefits will still increase, but at a lesser rate than the
basic wage.
The special Christmas bonus enjoyed by Opel workers will be paid in two
stages instead of in one tranche. The second tranche will be made
conditional on cost improvements and on a reduction in absenteeism and
sickness rates at the company's factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and
Kaiserslautern.
Benefits paid to employees who are on short-time working - that is not
working a full week - will be restructured.
In return, Opel is understood to have guaranteed to increase production in
German factories and reconsider plans to lay off manufacturing employees.
This could protect 3,700 jobs in the components sector which had been
threatened by possible Opel plans to buy equipment from external suppliers.
The agreement has been reached after tough negotiations between employees
and employers.
Mr Rudolf Muller, chairman of Adam Opel's Works' Council, yesterday said the
package would cover a four-year period from the start of 1994 and should
ensure the viability of the factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and
Kaiserslautern.

<TEXT>
WINTER storms yesterday gripped Bosnia as leaders of the three warring
parties agreed to attend a last-ditch meeting aimed at salvaging the
emergency relief effort in the republic.
Political and military leaders of the Moslem, Serb and Croat communities
will meet tomorrow in an attempt to secure access for convoys serving about
'3m people who are totally dependent on humanitarian aid for survival', said
Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
The onset of heavy snow has highlighted the importance of the one-day
meeting in Geneva, which coincides with growing calls within the UN
operation in former Yugoslavia to pull out of Bosnia rather than risk
further attacks on relief workers and UN soldiers escorting aid convoys. The
convoys are faced with constant blockades despite guarantees of free
movement from local military commanders, especially Serb leaders. The UN
last month suspended aid convoys destined for about 1.5m people in central
Bosnia after a Danish driver was shot dead.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and his Croat counterpart, Mr
Mate Boban, have reportedly agreed to attend the Geneva meeting. However,
the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, will reportedly send a
delegation in his place.
The freezing winter weather did not silence the guns in Bosnia yesterday.
Serb forces stepped up their offensive on Olovo, north-east of Sarajevo, and
some 8,000 Bosnian Serb soldiers massed east of the nearby town of Vares,
which fell to Bosnian Moslem forces earlier this month.

GERMAN net investments abroad continued to fall this year, dropping by 18
per cent to DM8.3bn (Pounds 3.3bn) for the first six months compared with
the same period last year, according to the Economics Ministry, writes
Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
Belgium continues to be the favourite foreign location for German companies,
which invested nearly DM2bn there for the period, down from DM2.3bn the year
before. The US and the Netherlands follow closely, with DM1.5bn and DM974m
respectively.
The sharpest decline was recorded in France where investments for the six
months dropped by more than 50 per cent to DM437m. In comparison, German
companies invested DM339m in the Czech republic, which leads as an eastern
European investment site.
The overall decline marks the third consecutive year of decreasing German
investments abroad after 10 years of nearly uninterrupted growth.
The fall reflects the general slowdown in the domestic economy.

<TEXT>
MR Rudolf Scharping, just five months in office as leader of Germany's
opposition Social Democrats, yesterday challenged his party to seize the
political middle ground, and prepare itself to become the future German
government.
In a keynote speech opening the four-day SPD party conference, Mr Scharping
warned that the surge in unemployment was leading to rising crime and growth
in support for parties of the extreme right. He called for a party policy
focused above all on job creation, through modernisation of the German
economy, a fair reform of the welfare state, and 'a more intelligent
organisation of labour'.
He urged delegates to end inner-party strife and to focus on a clear set of
practical alternative policies before next year's election.
Yet it was a message which met with a mixed reception from the delegates,
who are concerned about any hint of diluting the benefits of the welfare
state, or any suggestion of strictly linking wage increases to productivity.
Instead, they agreed the blame for unemployment - now forecast to top 10 per
cent, or more than 4m in the two halves of Germany next year - lay not with
high wages, but other factors: the tough monetary policy of the German
Bundesbank, the effective revaluation of the D-Mark, and the failure of both
government and industry to promote more research and innovation.
Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the party and spokesman on the
economy, launched a sharp attack on the Bundesbank for maintaining high
interest rates, and thereby driving up the D-Mark. 'An exporting nation
cannot behave like this with its monetary policy,' he said.
And speakers from the floor claimed that more jobs had been destroyed in
German industry because of the devaluation of sterling and the Italian lira
than by any wage deals by trade unions. There was also widespread support
for calls to reduce working hours as one way of tackling unemployment, by
sharing out more widely the shrinking workload.
Even before the conference began in the spa-town of Wiesbaden, the main
resolution on economic policy had been amended to drop any suggestion that
wages in east Germany must be linked to productivity, to protect jobs in
that part of the country.
Mr Scharping insisted it was not wages as such which were too high, but all
the extra costs of labour, such as pensions' and unemployment insurance. He
wants part of those costs shifted to direct taxation, above all to pay for
the emergency labour market programmes of job creation and retraining in
east Germany.
He supported calls for shorter working hours as part of the solution to
joblessness, but warned that workers must also accept wage cuts for less
work. The trade unions knew that was inevitable, he said.

DIRECT foreign investment in the Czech Republic has slowed this year with
only Dollars 455m (Pounds 305m) invested in the first nine months, compared
with Dollars 600m in the same period last year, according to the Czech
National Bank, Patrick Blum writes from Vienna.
The results confirm fears in Prague that the level of investment could fall
as a consequence of recession in the west and rising production costs in the
Czech Republic. The government is concerned that rapidly rising wages are
undermining the competitiveness of local companies and deterring investment.
Direct foreign investment since 1990 is estimated at between Dollars 1.6bn
and Dollars 2bn.
Mr Karel Dyba, economy minister, said yesterday he expected the gross
national product to grow by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent this year,
in spite of a decline in industrial production.

THE fall in Russia's gross national product is slowing, according to
government figures published yesterday. But industrial output, which is a
key issue in the Russian election campaign, will continue to decline at
around last year's rate.
The figures, published by the Interfax news agency, forecast a fall of 10.1
per cent in GNP this year, after a 19 per cent drop last year. Industrial
output is expected to fall by 16.4 per cent, compared with an 18.8 per cent
drop in 1992.
Prompted by the country's poor industrial performance, candidates from at
least three major parties yesterday promised more support for Russian
industry, and protection against foreign competition, at the annual
conference of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
The union is headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, who also heads the electoral list
of the separate Civic Union electoral alliance. Many of the industrialist
union's members will vote for Civic Union, and tell their employees to do
the same, but some remain undecided.
Mr Volsky criticised the radical ministers of Russia's Choice, the electoral
alliance headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who see financial
stabilisation as the necessary foundation for economic growth.
A former Gaidar ally, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister
responsible for foreign economic relations, addressed the industrialists on
behalf of the rival Russian Party for Unity and Accord, saying that it was
essential to deny foreign companies equal treatment to Russian companies for
a few years. This would give time to Russian companies to cope with market
economics while completing the legislation necessary to give adequate
protection to foreign investors.
Mr Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a millionaire eye-surgeon who owns several
businesses and is a candidate for another group, the Russian Democratic
Reform Movement, stressed the need to improve incentives for workers. 'At
the moment it is only profitable for them to rest.'
Promises of protection are also to be found in Russia's Choice.

FT  17 NOV 93 / EU 'must retain its welfare structures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS has come out against the downgrading of Europe's welfare structures
as a way of boosting competitiveness, in a policy document which is expected
to top the agenda at the December 10 European Union summit.
The conclusions come in the latest draft of the White Paper on
competitiveness, growth and employment, due to be submitted to EU finance
ministers on Monday, and a Green Paper on the future of EU social policy,
expected to be approved at the Commission's weekly meeting.
The papers argue that new jobs must come from a stable macroeconomic
framework and 'trading up' into better quality goods and services in higher
added value areas, rather than through downgrading social protection and
welfare provisions.
'Competition in terms of price through cost-cutting, in particular with
low-wage or cost-structure countries and in certain sectors, is hardly
possible without destruction of the European social structure,' a
confidential draft of the White Paper stresses.
The same theme informs the more consultative document on social policy,
which suggests changes in the balance of taxes and incentives so that
'acceptable and affordable' employment and health and safety standards can
be maintained. 'Social progress cannot be put on the back burner while we
look for solutions to our economic problems,' the Green Paper says.
The White Paper recommends decreasing the cost of taking on workers through
an annual reduction in taxes and social security charges on labour of
between 1 and 2 per cent of EU gross domestic product. This would be
compensated via taxes from the greater numbers who would be in work, it
argues.
Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner whose department prepared
the Green Paper and most of the crucial jobs section of the White Paper -
masterminded by Commission president Jacques Delors - disputed the
increasingly prevalent view that European welfare levels were the main
impediment to international competitiveness.
'I'm saying categorically that there is no empirical proof of that. What
there is is a problem of funding' of social protection, Mr Flynn said.
Other senior Commission officials said there was now an 'overwhelming
consensus' in Brussels that there were two separate problems to be dealt
with to achieve the White Paper's ambition to halve unemployment to 5 per
cent by 2000.
Ways needed to be found of tackling the problem of unemployment among the
low-skilled, possibly by adding income support to earned wages, one official
said. But, he added, the real challenge was to 'leap forward, not
backwards,' into advanced technology and high added value production.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Brussels gives guidelines on open telecom market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS groups in Europe will have to increase the cost of local
telephone calls and charge rival companies for access to the telephone
network to fund a basic minimum service for customers once the sector is
liberalised, the European Commission said yesterday.
But the Commission said it would be up to individual member states to decide
exactly how to fund a 'universal service' after January 1, 1998, the date
set for opening ordinary telephone services to full competition across the
European Union.
The options - which are already being considered by telecoms companies  -
are contained in Commission guidelines, published yesterday, aimed at
helping member states prepare for full competition.
In June, when EU telecoms ministers agreed on the 1998 deadline for
liberalisation, they made clear that the definition of a universal service
was essential to calm fears about the effects of competition.
At the moment, basic services - such as promising to connect all customers,
even those who live in remote areas - are partly funded by profits from
international and long distance calls, estimated at up to Ecu16bn (Pounds
12.2bn) a year. But increased competition is expected to cut those profits,
and without safeguards some member states and national operators fear that
rival companies will simply not carry out loss-making obligations.
The Commission has decided to draw a very broad definition of basic
services, based on legislation which has already been adopted on the
regulatory framework for liberalisation. For example, the Commission says
that basic customers rights in the EU should include: having a phone
connected; receiving services - such as installation or repairs - within
certain time-limits and according to certain standards; clear complaints
procedures; and access to new services such as itemised bills.
The Commission says that although basic services should still be
'affordable', the cost of such obligations will have to be met by charging
local subscribers more for ordinary phone calls and phone connections, and
levying fees on new operators wanting to use existing networks.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Rome heads for clash on steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY is heading for a confrontation with its European Union partners over
steel subsidies at tomorrow's meeting of industry ministers in Brussels.
The European Commission is today expected to back the hard line of Mr Karel
Van Miert, competition commissioner, on limiting subsidies to the EU's
state-owned steel industry and cutting capacity. That will set the scene for
what should be a stormy industry council tomorrow, with German, Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese ministers fighting corners for proposed restructuring
of state steelmakers.
Italy is unlikely to be isolated but Rome's restructuring plan for Ilva, the
loss-making state producer, will almost certainly be the only restructuring
plan not cleared by Brussels before the meeting. Political stakes are high
in Italy. Yesterday there were demonstrations by steelworkers in Taranto,
southern Italy, which is expected to bear the brunt of proposed closures.
Mr Van Miert is pressing for a 2m tonne reduction in capacity at Ilva as a
condition for allowing some Ecu2.58bn (Pounds 1.96bn) of state aid. But
negotiations between Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's industry minister, and Mr Van
Miert on Monday night, though cordial, broke up without agreement, and the
Commission said yesterday that it would not soften its line. 'It's up to
them to close furnaces; it's up to them how they do it,' said Mr Van Miert's
spokesman.
In the case involving east German steelmaker Ekostahl, the Commission last
night agreed an amended plan, including adjusted capacity cuts, with the
German authorities. But other member states, including Britain, believe
there may still be problems in agreeing even an amended Ekostahl plan,
because it involves building steelmaking capacity at a time when the EU
steel industry suffers from overcapacity.

EFFORTS to get Northern Ireland peace talks under way inched forward
yesterday as Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, signalled that it
would not reject outright the offer of a seat at the negotiating table in
return for an end to IRA violence.
But Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams declined to shed further light on his
claim on Monday night that Sinn Fein had been in 'protracted contact and
dialogue' with the British government. Mr Adams' claim was yesterday
emphatically denied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
as Ulster unionist MPs and Tory right-wingers warned the government to tread
carefully.
The offer by Mr John Major on Monday night was the first explicit move by
the British prime minister to negotiate with the IRA's political wing.
Sir Patrick said: 'No officials have been talking to Sinn Fein on behalf of
the British government. We have always made it perfectly clear that there is
going to be no negotiating with anybody who perpetrates or justifies the use
of violence. That has been our policy and we stick to it.'
The government has said the only contacts made with Sinn Fein have been
those permitted at local and constituency level.
Sinn Fein said privately last night that Mr Adams would not 'have said what
he said' if he could not prove it. There were reports in the province last
night that Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official, was involved in the
contacts Mr Adams claimed took place. Mr Adams said yesterday: 'Mr Major has
acknowledged the opportunity which exists. The onus remains on John Major to
deal honestly and directly with the core issues.'
He did not spell out what concessions the IRA was looking for, but added
that Sinn Fein remained 'firmly committed' to what he called the 'Irish
peace initiative'.
The impression of intense behind-the-scenes activity to get talks started
was reinforced when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted
that his government might have had indirect talks with Sinn Fein. Responding
to questions in the Dail (parliament), he said: 'No week passes that I do
not have people from both communities . . . keeping me informed as to their
views of the shift in opinion from various sectors.'
Northern Ireland's unionist politicians have been united in their hostility
to Mr Major's speech, however.
The Reverend Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said
his party's support for Mr Major would be called into question if there was
any sign that he was failing to govern Northern Ireland 'purposefully'.
But he added: 'If the IRA are prepared to put down their arms, then that may
create a new situation . . . I accept that is the harsh reality of
politics.'
The Democratic Unionist Party, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, was more
critical. 'The strength of feeling in this province is for the defeat of
IRA/Sinn Fein, not that a way should be made for them to get to the
negotiating table,' he said.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Late swing boosts Clinton's hopes of victory on Nafta
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST a dozen more members of the US Congress came out in favour of the
North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday, leading to speculation that
President Bill Clinton was within an ace of winning passage for the treaty
tonight.
Wall Street rose sharply to a new record on the news from Washington. Mr
Clinton declared 'I feel good, we're getting there,' but some Nafta
supporters tempered their enthusiasm by warning against over-confidence. The
chief congressional strategist against the agreement conceded he had lost
four votes but still predicted its defeat.
The 434 sitting members of the House of Representatives (258 Democrats, 175
Republicans and one independent) will make the final decision tonight after
eight scheduled hours of debate. A total of 218 votes will secure approval,
one less defeat, because the House has no provision to break ties.
The outcome is considered pivotal both for the authority of the president
and for a successful conclusion of the wider Uruguay Round of trade talks by
the appointed December 15 deadline.
It is possible that neither side will be able to claim victory before the
final tally begins. The administration, in particular, is counting on
promises from Democrats still uncommitted or even leaning against approval
but willing, in the crunch, to give a Democratic president his majority.
An Associated Press news agency tally last night found 206 definitely in
favour or so inclined and 199 likely to vote against, with 29 officially
undecided. This is the first time the AP count has had the pro-Nafta forces
ahead.
Reflecting this apparent momentum, Mr Clinton summoned 15 pro-Nafta
governors to a White House ceremony, while continuing to work the telephones
nonstop. Mr David Gergen, his close adviser, went on television to speak of
'conservative estimates that we're within about a dozen votes . . . possibly
closer than that'.
On Capitol Hill, some Nafta supporters were less cautious. An aide to
Congressman Esteban Torres , the California Democrat, said 208 votes were
now certain, with 15 promises in reserve. 'We've won,' he declared.
On the other side opponents claimed to have 223 sure votes. One anti-Nafta
lobbyist said the margin of defeat would be kept deliberately narrow 'so as
to save the president's face'.
Mr Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation,
accused Mr Clinton of 'abdicating party leadership' by offering support to
Republicans who voted in favour of Nafta. He threatened that labour
federations may withhold support in next year's elections from Democrats who
vote in favour.
Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, complained about Mr Clinton
'wining and dining people at taxpayers' expense' on behalf of the treaty and
objected to the plethora of special deals made with individual members to
secure their support. 'Win it on the merits, not the pork,' she said.
Most of the fresh support for Nafta yesterday came from members from wheat,
vegetable, citrus and sugar producing states, all of whom have been actively
courted by the White House with promises and separate agreements with
Mexico.
As the Washington debate raged, two opinion polls, in the Washington Post
and the New York Times, found the public evenly divided on Nafta's merits,
although with the suggestion that support for it has been growing.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Smith lays basis for closer Labour ties with industry:
Party's commitment to manufacturing given warm reception by CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday laid the foundations of a closer
relationship with the Confederation of British Industry by stressing the
opposition's commitment to manufacturing industry.
Mr Smith largely avoided controversial issues in a warmly received speech at
the organisation's conference in Harrogate designed to convince business
leaders they have nothing to fear from a Labour government.
Aides said his intention, as the first Labour leader to address the CBI, was
to prepare the ground for the launch of the party's industrial policy
document next year, which will set out detailed proposals for partnerships
between government departments and business.
Labour officials say business leaders have welcomed many of the party's
emerging proposals, although there is concern about plans for worker
directors being drawn up by Mr Robin Cook, the party's industry spokesman.
CBI members gave Mr Smith a sustained ovation, which observers contrasted
with the more restrained applause accorded cabinet ministers on Monday. 'The
message that came across was that he is passionately committed to
manufacturing industry,' one delegate said. Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, sought to undermine the impact of Mr Smith's appearance by
drawing attention to the omission from his speech of any reference to the
party's commitment to a 35-hour, four-day working week.
Mr Hunt said Mr Smith had failed to request an opt-out from the election
manifesto of the European socialist group, which contains the commitment.
However, delegates also responded warmly to Mr Smith's stress on Labour's
commitment to improvements in training, education and the potential for
partnerships between government departments and business.
Mr Smith sought to exploit divisions between some business leaders and the
government by endorsing criticism of the Conservative party's 'negative
approach' expressed by Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general. 'Such a
posture can seriously damage our interests. It is ironic that those who
promised to put Britain at the heart of Europe have caused us to be
marginalised in crucial areas of decision making,' he said.
Mr Smith warned delegates that British business would have to live with the
social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht treaty, in spite of the
government's decision to opt out.
He said the opt-out meant British ministers would 'leave the room' when
employment issues were discussed, leaving the other 11 countries to
determine policies 'which almost inexorably will come to be applied, not
just to British companies operating in Europe, but to all companies
operating in Britain'.
Mr Smith called for an early cut in interest rates to boost recovery, and
urged the government to avoid threatening the recovery by imposing tax
increases in the budget. He also called on ministers to drop plans to
increase the proportion of sick pay met by employers.
However, his main aim was to draw a sharp contrast between Labour's support
for manufacturing and the low level of investment in industry since the
Conservatives came to power in 1979.
'I have always believed passionately that Britain's prosperity depends upon
the creation of a dynamic and competitive economy, built on the bedrock of a
strong manufacturing sector,' he said.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said there was 'a lot in the speech which
we would agree with, and with which our members would agree', but wide
differences remained on public spending and the social chapter of the EU's
Maastricht treaty.

FT  17 NOV 93 / Schools achieve sharp rise in GCSE passes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAGUE TABLES of school performance in England, published today by the
Department of Education, show a sharp rise in exam successes, compared with
last year when results were first published.
In 1992, 38.1 per cent of the 15- to 16-year-olds in England gained five
GCSE passes at grades A to C, the equivalent of the old O-level pass. This
year, the figure has risen by 3 percentage points to 41.1 per cent.
Analysis by the FT using government statistics on extra-educational needs
reveals a strong link between inner city deprivation and underperformance.
Using Department of the Environment figures which rank authorities according
to the proportion of their children whose parents are benefit claimants, and
other related statistics, the Isles of Scilly, top authority for GCSE
performance, is also, according to the table, the least deprived in the
country.
The London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Lambeth, Islington, Tower Hamlets
and Southwark are in the top 10 both for underperformance at GCSE and for
deprivation. Only one of the authorities in the bottom 10 for GCSE results
last year managed to escape it this year.
Outperformance by girls' schools was marked. In mixed schools, 35 per cent
of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at grades A to C. That target was
attained in single-sex schools, a far higher proportion of which are
selective, by 48 per cent of boys and 55 per cent of girls. Independent
schools fared well, with 142 in the top 200 as judged by GCSE performance.
The greatest controversy surrounded truancy figures, published for the first
time, which appeared to show that nationally 12 per cent of pupils played
truant at some point last year.
The figures also appeared to correlate closely with deprivation, with
schools in Manchester and inner London the worst affected. However,
Manchester fiercely disputed the 'spurious' figures.
It claimed that the Education Department statistics were based on Manchester
having 13,333 pupils instead of 24,450. This prompted renewed attacks from
teachers' unions, while Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said
the figures should have been released with a government health warning.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Major offers talks with Sinn Fein if IRA lays down arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, acted to break the Northern Ireland
deadlock yesterday by issuing the first explicit offer to negotiate with
Sinn Fein if the IRA lays down its arms.
Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of London that 'there may
now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many
years'.
He ruled out secret deals with terrorists, and insisted that the government
would 'never' talk to organisations which declined to renounce violence.
'But if the IRA ends violence for good then, after a sufficient interval to
ensure the permanence of their intent - Sinn Fein can enter the political
arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead.'
In his most optimistic appraisal yet of the prospects for Northern Ireland,
Mr Major said there was a 'burning desire on each side of the community for
peace'.
He said the Irish government had shown 'a new understanding of the rights
and concerns of unionists,' and most of the constitutional parties in
Northern Ireland were 'purposefully' engaged in talks about a settlement.
All the parties accepted that flexibility was needed, and that 'cherished
positions' would have to be modified. 'These elements present the
opportunity we are determined to pursue,' he said.
Downing Street said the prime minister's words were intended as an
'explicit' demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the
peace process.
'Northern Ireland is something which the prime minister intends to keep on
the front burner,' a senior official said.
The speech also confirms that the UK government is prepared to press ahead
without the participation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, led by
the Rev Ian Paisley, which has said it will 'never' talk to Sinn Fein, even
after a cessation of IRA violence.
The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to
talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last
month by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister.
However, Downing Street said Mr Major's declaration last night clarified the
government's position. 'It has never been explicit, as it is here,' said a
senior official.
The government dismissed reports in Northern Ireland newspapers that the
government had held recent talks on a ceasefire with Sinn Fein or IRA
leaders.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Computer rubs out pencil in US exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trusty 'number two' pencil, the one common bond among applicants for US
higher education, took a step towards oblivion yesterday when the nation's
largest exams administrator said applicants for advanced degrees could take
their admission exams on computer.
Nearly 400,000 students a year take the Graduate Record Exam, which is
required for admission to most university graduate schools in the US, except
for business, medical and law courses.
Plans are also under way to computerise the Standardised Admissions Test
required for undergraduate admission for first degrees, but this is not
expected to be available on computer before the turn of the century. The
delay is because of the logistical problems involved in administering the
test to around 1.3m students who take it every year.
By 1997, when the GRE will be available only by computer, aspiring graduate
students will also be able to forgo the experience of sitting in a huge room
of stressed fellow students.
Instead, students will schedule appointments and take the exam in small
groups, according to Ms Charlotte Kuh of Educational Testing Service, the
private company that develops and administers both the GRE and the SAT.
The computer tests are adaptive, meaning that questions get increasingly
difficult as students answer them correctly. This will allow better students
to earn higher scores and move through the test quickly, skipping over easy
questions.
The adaptive tests will allow students to write a short essay or complete a
more difficult maths section in addition to the existing sections - verbal,
quantitative and analytical reasoning.
Ms Kuh said she hoped the new test would eliminate some of the advantages of
students able to pay for expensive preparation courses, but companies
providing such courses are rushing to develop new strategies.
As many as 26,000 students pay Dollars 695 each to take test preparation
courses at either Kaplan Educational Centers or the Princeton Review.
Mr Robert Cohen of the Princeton Review, with Dollars 40m in sales annually,
said it was ridiculous to think a new test could make his services obsolete.
He said his company already had a programme geared for the computer test.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Puerto Rico seeks to strengthen its US links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Miguel Hernandez Agosto, leader of Puerto Rico's opposition Popular
Democratic party, is to ask the US Congress to expand the island's
'commonwealth' link with the US, by increasing tax incentives for industry,
removing limits on food stamps and imposing tariffs to protect agriculture.
This follows Sunday's referendum in which Puerto Ricans indicated by a slim
margin that they favoured an enhancement of their current quasi-colonial
ties with the US, rather than becoming the 51st state of the union.
Political independence was soundly rejected.
Figures published yesterday by the State Elections Commission indicated that
the commonwealth option received 48.4 per cent of the 1.7m votes cast,
statehood was supported by 46.2 per cent and independence by 4.4 per cent.
The result was a setback for Mr Pedro Rossello, the island's governor, whose
incumbent New Progressive party advocated statehood.
'The people have spoken on status and I heed the result,' Mr Rossello said.
'It was my commitment to hold this plebiscite, and I assume full
responsibility for its results.' The governor said he would pursue his
government's programmes based on the mandate he received in last year's
election.
Mr Agosto said he would begin negotiations soon with congressional leaders
in Washington to extend and make permanent tax incentives which have brought
mainland manufacturing companies to the island, but which are subject to
frequent review and changes in Washington.
The PDP leaders will also seek a statement from President Bill Clinton
defining the 'uniqueness' of Puerto Rico's current status. Saying Puerto
Rico was a territory of the US, President George Bush rescinded an executive
order by President John F Kennedy which allowed special treatment for Puerto
Rico.
Puerto Rico is officially described as having a 'freely associated'
relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for
a president and do not pay federal income tax. The island's representation
in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence
legislation.
Mr Rossello claimed that the advocates of statehood had scored a victory in
the referendum, because they had 'brought the ideal nearer, closer to
becoming reality'. He said that in the 1952 referendum statehood was
supported by 12 per cent of Puerto Ricans, rising to 39 per cent in the 1967
vote, and had almost tied with votes for the commonwealth on Sunday.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA'S trade unions began an indefinite national strike yesterday to
protest against plans to eliminate thousands of government jobs, Reuter
reports from La Paz.
The Roman Catholic Church, acting as a mediator between the government and
unions, said after last-minute talks on Sunday night there was still a
chance of resolving the conflict. But the government told the unions to call
off the protest, saying it would not negotiate while the strike was on.
The strike is the worst conflict between workers and the government since
the centrist government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada took over in
August.
Union officials said miners, railway and health workers and teachers had
joined the strike, which began at midnight on Sunday. But transport in La
Paz, as well as shops, banks and private industries, were all working. Four
earlier protest strikes called by the union confederation, COB, failed to
paralyse the country.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy businessman who criticised the former
centre-right government of President Jaime Paz Zamora for economic drift and
corruption, has announced plans to fire 10,000 of the country's 220,000
state employees.
Another 70,000 state workers are due to be gradually removed from the
payroll over the next few years.
Union leaders were due to meet late yesterday to decide whether to continue
the strike.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Bandits and gunmen retake Mogadishu: The UN decision to
abandon its policing role leaves the streets to lawless clan fighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANDITS and gunmen are retaking control of Mogadishu as a result of the
United Nations' decision to abandon its policing role in the Somali capital,
UN officials said yesterday.
They said armed gunmen were walking the streets with impunity, while
'technicals' - jeeps with mounted guns - had made their first appearance
since US Marines banished them from the capital last December. Mogadishu's
Bakara market is reported to be doing a flourishing trade in weapons.
An American civilian working for the UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) was
shot dead on Saturday by robbers who stole his car. Two other UN workers
were wounded.
The British charity Care International says its Somali security chief was
killed by a stray bullet during a shoot-out outside its offices last week.
'Security in Mogadishu is deteriorating rapidly,' Mr George Somerwill of
Care International said. 'There is a real risk that the capital might slide
back into anarchy.'
UN policy in Somalia has been in disarray since 18 US troops were killed in
a battle with Gen Mohammed Farah Aideed's militias last month. Under
pressure from Washington, the UN military command has given up attempts to
disarm militias by force - abandoning, in effect, the first UN
peace-enforcing mandate authorised by the Security Council in May. Unosom
has also dropped its hunt for Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the slaying of
24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June.
A UN policy analyst, who requested anonymity, said the 14,000 UN troops in
Mogadishu were under orders to protect themselves and avoid further loss of
life. 'As a result,' he said, 'Somalia's warlords believe the UN will not
intervene in inter-clan fighting. If the UN maintains this passive military
role, it might as well leave Somalia altogether.'
Aid workers also report the UN's hands-off policy is emboldening bandits who
have not had a chance to engage in serious looting since the US launched its
humanitarian military intervention in December 1992. Food distribution and
food-for-work programmes have been much curtailed.
In addition to inter-clan warfare, UN military officials believe Islamic
fundamentalist groups are aiding Gen Aideed with money and arms.
Major David Stockwell, the UN military spokesman, said intelligence reports
indicated 'the presence in Mogadishu of an unspecified number of
individuals, possibly Hizbollah fundamentalists, with expertise in car
bombings'.
However, non-government organisations working in the capital believe these
reports are exaggerated. Somalia's battle-hardened militias are not thought
to need coaching in the handling of explosives. It is possible,
nevertheless, that Gen Aideed and his rivals are re-arming their militias
with the help of fundamentalist groups.
In the wake of the rising lawlessness in Mogadishu, Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday presented the Security
Council with three different options for the future of the troubled UN
operation in Somalia.
The alternatives range from maintaining the present mandate and force of
about 29,000 troops, to securing only ports and airports with a scaled-down
military presence. A review of Unosom has become imperative because the US
plans to withdraw its 7,500-strong contingent by the end of March, while
France, Belgium and Sweden have also announced their intention to pull out
of Somalia.
Mr Boutros-Ghali says he has written to 42 UN member states in an attempt to
fill the vacuum that will be left by the departing troops.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (18): A taste of the region - The
Hinterland / Not far outside Barcelona are a number of villages where the
region's excellent wines can be sampled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU can add a long weekend to a Barcelona trip, go to one of the select
spots on the Costa Brava or head up to the Pyrenees. But if time is at a
premium and your liver is in good shape, go to the Penedes wine-growing
district that lies a 40-minute motorway drive south-west of the city centre.
Save Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, the first of the district's two main towns, for
the return trip to Barcelona, and carry straight on to Vilafranca del
Penedes where the Museu del Vi, the wine museum, is housed in what was the
palace of the kings of Aragon during the 14th century. It is certainly the
best museum of its kind in Spain, and is arguably unrivalled in Europe.
All the wine harvesting tools and gigantic wooden presses that one could
wish for are on display, and there is a convivial tasting room for sampling
and purchases. But it is the collection of Roman amphoras that remains in
the mind.
A monograph, published by the Museu, on the area's wine production 2,000
years ago establishes that custom-built wine ships, with grooved planking to
secure the amphora's pointed base, regularly departed the Penedes for Italy,
bearing 6,000 of these earthenware jars aboard.
The problems of the EC's 'wine lake' clearly existed in the first century,
and Rome was forced to ban new vineyards in what was then the province of
Tarraconensis, in order to protect Italian producers. By that stage,
super-tankers that could transport 10,000 amphoras of Penedes wine had come
into service.
The vinification centre of the Torres winery in the village of Pacs, close
by Vilafranca, with its huge stainless steel tanks and state-of-the-art
bottling plant, brings the Penedes wine story up to the present. The centre
includes an oenological research laboratory where some 250 experiments into
new wine production methods, new grape varieties and grape mixes are
currently being conducted.
Torres has spearheaded both the improvement of the Penedes' native grapes -
the white Xarel-lo, Macabeo and Parellada and the red Carinena, Tempranillo
and Garnacha varieties - and also the successful adaptation of foreign
'noble' vines to the area's soil and climate. Cabernet Sauvignon and
Chardonnay are now widely grown in the Penedes, and Gewurztraminer and
Riesling do well in the area's cooler uplands.
Torres also grows limited quantities of Pinot Noir in the Penedes. If you
can get hold of it, buy Torres' Vina Magdala, which mixes 70 per cent Pinot
noir with 30 per cent native Tempranillo grape; or, better still, the 100
per cent Pinot noir Gran Vina Magdala.
Returning to Barcelona, stop at Sant Sadurni d'Anoia to visit the
headquarters of the Cordoniu, the biggest cava producer in the world, and to
eat some of the best local fare to be had in Catalonia.
Cordoniu's extravagant establishment has extensive water gardens, modernist
buildings designed by Gaudi's contemporary, Puig i Cadafalch, and 18 km of
underground cellars. The restaurant Canals y Munne, on Sant Sadurni's Placa
Pau Casals, is one of several unpretentious eating houses in the town that
stock a long list of Penedes wines and serve prodigious amounts of Catalan
specialities.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (19): Key facts for visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURRENCY:
The peseta remains in the EMS but has undergone a series of devaluations
which has resulted in a 20 per cent drop in its value against the D-Mark in
the past year and a half.
All the leading banks - found concentrated around Placa Catalunya and
Passeig de Gracia - operate 'cambios' for changing money, based on the
official rates of the Bank of Spain that day with varying commission
structures.
On Las Ramblas and around the cathedral independent cambios offer 'no
commission'. However their rates, except for extremely large amounts,
generally make it preferable to pay the commission at the banks.
Leading credit cards such as Visa, Access/Mastercard and American Express
are accepted at most shops, restaurants and hotels.
TELEPHONES:
The international dialing code for Barcelona is 343. To make an
international call dial 07 and wait for a high pitched tone before
continuing. To dial anywhere else in Spain you need to add a regional code
such as 91 for Madrid or 95 for Seville.
Public telephones operate both with coins and with cards, which can be
bought at newspaper kiosks which can be found on most streets in the centre.
International calls are much more expensive than in most EC countries, while
local calls within the city are extremely cheap.
TIME:
Spanish time is one hour ahead of Britain (Greenwich Mean Time) and six
hours ahead of New York, except in the four weeks in early autumn from late
September when the Spanish clocks go back at the end of summertime to the
same time as Britain.
HOTELS:
Being a city which is increasingly designed for the business tourist, the
easiest time to find a hotel room is in August when prices drop by about 50
per cent.
Package tourists generally stay on the Costa Brava and visit the city for
the day. The busiest times are when a big trade exhibition is taking place
at the Fira, which last year registered 1.6m visitors.
The biggest were for food at the end of February, consumer electronics in
the middle of September and tourism in the second half of April. Plenty of
hotel rooms are now on offer, but it is worth booking in advance at these
times of the year if you have a specific hotel in mind.
RESTAURANTS:
The city has thousands of bars. Many of these serve a lunchtime menu which
includes bread and wine and can vary from the excellent to the grim. In the
top bracket there are a number of restaurants with one Michelin star, but
only one, Neichel on the Avinguda de Pedralbes, which has two.
It is worth booking a few days in advance for the more expensive
restaurants, although the recession has reduced pressure on places.
CLUBS:
The Circulo Ecuestre, Balmes 169, is one of the best-known among the
business community. It is for members only but the British Chamber of
Commerce (317-3220/3120) holds a lunch there on the first Thursday of every
month which is open to visiting businessmen and women who contact the
chamber in advance.
One of the most popular business lunching spots, almost the equivalent to a
club amongst the financial and commercial elite, is the restaurant
Finisterre (Avinguda Diagonal, 469).
TIPPING:
The guidelines on tipping are not clearly established. In the top bracket
restaurants and hotels 5 per cent is considered correct. In bars and taxis
there is no obligation to tip.
AIRPORT:
The redesigned and expanded national and international airport of El Prat
del Llobregat is seven miles from the centre of the city to the south.
Iberia has just announced that it is to become the centre of its European
operations. Air Europe and SAS have both recently entered the market.
Iberia operates a shuttle service to Madrid which runs from early morning to
late evening.
The airport itself provides information on flight arrivals (Tel: 478 5000)
but it is necessary to call each airline for information on departures
(Iberia in Barcelona: 301 3993).
TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT:
It normally takes between 15 minutes and half an hour to get to the airport
from the centre by car. An airport bus runs every 15 minutes from Placa
Catalunya, at a cost of Pts 400, which takes half an hour. The times to be
wary of are when the morning and evening rush hours combine with some other
event, for example one of Barcelona Football Club's important games of the
season, or the beginning of a long weekend in the middle of the skiing or
mushroom-picking seasons (the latter in the autumn). Trains run regularly
from Sants station.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT:
The centre is well-served by the metro system which is also cheap. A
tarjeta, a ticket for 10 journeys costs Pts 560. The same applies for the
buses, which have a separate tarjeta.
Within the city itself it is sometimes preferable to use the Ferrocarrils de
la Generalitat, the regional suburban network, when for instance, you need
to go further up the Tibidabo mountain than the metro. An old,
well-preserved tram operates from the end of the line at Avinguda del
Tibidabo for the last leg to the top.
The city has 11,300 black and yellow taxis. A green light on the roof and a
sign on the windscreen saying 'Libre' or 'Lliure' indicates they are free
for hire.
Six trains depart daily to Madrid from Sants station which take eight or
nine hours and cost Pts 3,800 to Pts 11,000 one way. The overnight sleeper
to Paris from the newly-renovated Estacio de Franca leaves at 2100 and costs
Pts 14,800.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (16): Decisions must be made - Rail
links / The case for a high-speed train from Barcelona to Madrid is clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOONER rather than later, serious talk is going to have to start on
Barcelona's high-speed train links with Madrid and with the French frontier,
if the project is to be up and running by its 2004 target date. So far,
plenty of discussions have taken place but no firm decisions have been made.
The absence of clear rulings is distressing, because Barcelona, which is
almost equidistant from Madrid and Lyons, in France, will be superbly served
by a railway service that puts it within, at most, three hours of both
cities.
The case for a high-speed train link between Madrid and Barcelona is
unarguable in terms of travel time. The air shuttle service between the two
cities takes 50 minutes flying time - that is to say, longer than a
high-speed train link, once check-in times and city-centre to airport
transport is accounted for. With 2m people a year travelling on the air
shuttle - at an inflated return ticket price of Pta 29,000 - the arguments
for a distinctly lower-cost travel alternative are just as powerful.
Barcelona points out that the high-speed train link between Madrid and
Seville, a city which is economically negligible compared with Barcelona and
less than half its size, has been a runaway success since it came into
service in April 1992. The national railways estimated that 41 per cent of
the 1m passengers that travelled between Madrid and Seville on the
high-speed train in its first year of service had formerly travelled by
aeroplane.
Barcelona overcame one hurdle in its battle for a high-speed train when the
principle was accepted that the bullet train into France's TGV network would
pass through the city and cross the frontier at Port Bou, on the
Mediterranean edge of the Pyrenees. There had been a counter plan that gave
priority to the route into France via Bilbao, which would cross the frontier
on the Atlantic side of the mountain range at Hendaye.
It is not, however, clear whether the line will take the direct
Madrid-Barcelona route, via Zaragoza, or whether it make a detour to embrace
Valencia, Spain's third largest city. There is a strong lobby, centred on
Valencia's fruit growers, that wants a fast train link for the area's
produce to the frontier and to Madrid.
Nor is it certain that the Barcelona connection, whether through Zaragoza or
through Valencia, will be a genuinely high-speed train using the TGV's
GEC-Alsthom system that is already in service between Madrid and Seville, or
whether it will be downgraded to use Spain's Talgo system, allowing for
maximum speeds of around 200kph.
Whichever the final route, and whichever the type of train that will travel
on it, new European gauge tracks, which are narrower than the Spanish ones,
will have to be constructed to carry the trains into France. If the tracks
are built to TGV specifications, the outlay for a route via Zaragoza to the
French frontier is initially estimated to be Pta1bn.
Draft plans at Madrid's transport ministry call for a consortium, in which
public money would provide some 70 per cent of the cost of the Barcelona's
high-speed rail infrastructure, with the private sector making up the
balance as well as footing the bills for the rolling stock.
Exploratory presentations of the draft cost breakdown by ministry officials
to the capital markets, have proved encouraging. All that is required is a
final decision on what type of train will travel on which of the two routes.
Barcelona cannot afford to wait much longer.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (17): Visitors presented with a
wider choice - Where to stay / The recent increase in the number of hotel
rooms on offer has brought with it competitive prices and discounts for
groups
</HEADLINE>

MORE than a year later than planned, the Hotel Arts, housed in one of twin
towers of the Olympic Village development, is due to open under the
management of Ritz-Carlton.
Since the developer's financial problems have been resolved, the work has
restarted and last month 4,500 hopefuls were interviewed for the 300 staff
jobs in the huge conference hall below ground, where they were served with
refreshments and entertained by a string quartet. Ritz-Carlton has prudently
avoided setting a date for its opening except to state that it will be
before the end of the year.
When it is open it will offer visitors to Barcelona something new: a
five-star hotel on the beach, in the former Olympic village, five stops on
the metro from the centre and a short walk from the old centre and the port.
Barcelona is a low-rise city, and so the advantage which the Hotel Arts can
claim is the range of views. The one looking back over the city, straight
back up the Avinguda Carles I to Gaudi's Church of the Sacred Family is
particularly impressive. The main drawback is that although 70 per cent of
the flats in the Olympic Village have been sold, far fewer have been
occupied and so the hotel's immediate surroundings, except for the
restaurants of the Olympic port next door, appear deserted.
A complete contrast to this is a hotel in the heart of the old part of the
city - the Hotel San Augustin, just off the Carrer Hospital in what is
colloquially known as the Barri Xines or Chinatown.
The city council has been transforming this district, which has faced the
usual inner city problems of crime and lack of investment, with a radical
rebuilding plan. The San Augustin is an example of a small, three-star hotel
which has been modernised without losing its 19th century character.
As a result of the increase in the number of hotel rooms in the past few
years and the slowing of the economy, the prices in Barcelona are generally
soft, and so it is worth asking for concessionary rates, especially for
groups.
As a rough guide starting prices for a double room in a three-star are Pts
14,000, going up to Pts 20,000 in a four-star and to Pts 24,000 and upwards
in a five-star hotel.
In the centre is a choice of family-run hotels such as the five-star Claris,
one block away from the Passeig de Gracia, whose owner, Jordi Clos, is
Barcelona's foremost Egyptologist, as can be seen from the works of art in
the hotel.
The four-star Hotel Regente is a another small, family-run hotel on Rambla
de Catalunya, an upmarket version of the more famous Las Ramblas into which
it runs. Some of the top rooms have patios with excellent views, and a tiny
open air swimming pool sits on the roof terrace, a blessing in midsummer.
Other four-star establishments include The Gran Hotel Havana on Gran Via -
an example of how modern, stylish Barcelona design has brought an old
building back to life - and the Avenida Palace further along the same street
which has never lost its traditional atmosphere, complete with liveried
staff.
But the most impressive location can be claimed by the newly-expanded Comtes
de Barcelona directly opposite Gaudi's La Pedrera on Passeig de Gracia.
Of the new hotels, two have been built specifically to serve the Fira or
Exhibition Centre. The Barcelona Plaza is a large, grey-stone faced block
overlooking the Placa Espana, with a spacious and colourful interior. Behind
the Fira at the foot of the Montjuic mountain is the Feria Palace. Both of
these are brand new modern four-stars with a touch of style.
But the most prominent addition, apart from the Hotel Arts is the five-star
Hotel Juan Carlos I, located on the way out of the city inland about 1km
from the Placa Francesc Macia on Diagonal. The inconvenience of being this
far out of the city is balanced by the extra space the hotel offers.
The lobby is a huge atrium reaching up to the top of the building,
prestigious tennis and polo clubs are next door and the hotel has its own
jogging track and children's playground.
For those who would like to get away from the city in the evening, Sitges, a
former fishing village which still retains much of its original character,
is well within reach being only half an hour away by train south along the
coast.
There, the four-star San Sebastian Playa, completed in 1990 but blending in
unobtrusively with its surroundings overlooks a small, sandy bay, and can
seem much further away from Spain's second largest city than it is.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (15): It helps to learn the native
tongue - Language / While not essential, some knowledge of Catalan - spoken
in and around Barcelona - is an advantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most popular television programmes on the Catalan language
channel of TV3, following the common format of an open debate, is called
'Right to Speak'. One moment which attracted a kind of awed gratitude
recently occurred when a Japanese couple among the audience joined in and
spoke in Catalan.
This is the other side of what those who speak Castilian - the main language
of Spain - can sometimes find a frustration when they visit Barcelona. A
Castilian-speaking Frenchman who came to the city to research a cultural
topic recently was amazed to find that some of the books published by the
Generalitat (the autonomous government) appeared in both Catalan and
English, neither of which he understood.
Catalans can occasionally be obstinate about sticking to their native tongue
if they feel that it is not being accorded due respect. Alternatively, they
can often be more receptive to someone speaking Catalan. So though, for most
practical purposes, for foreigners there is no necessity to understand or
speak Catalan, rather than Castilian, there are advantages.
The language itself has a more abrupt, less inflected sound than Castilian.
Both are derived from Latin, but it seems that Catalan comes from a later
form of it, as did Provencal, the language spoken on the other side of the
Pyrenees and to which it is in some ways similar.
In Barcelona, there is a form of bilingualism which is probably unique. When
two people say goodbye, often one will say 'Adios' and the other will say
'Deu' or 'Adeu'. Everyone can understand both: Castilian, because it was the
only official language until Franco died in 1975; and Catalan, either
because it is their mother tongue, or because the regional government's law
to normalise the use of the language has been so successful.
The Generalitat's department of linguistics affirms that 94 per cent of the
population in Catalonia understands Catalan, though a large minority are
immigrants from other parts of Spain or the children of immigrants.
It even occasionally happens that a conversation between two friends is held
in both languages, with each speaking the language in which he is most
comfortable.
This pervasive bilingualism can occasionally be confusing for a visitor  -
for example, over street names. These are all signposted in Catalan, but are
often referred to in Castilian. There is not much difference between Passeig
de Gracia and Paseo de Gracia, but there is between Carrer Roger de Lluria
and Calle Lauria, or Carrer de l'Argenteria and Calle Plateria.
A director of the American Institute in Barcelona in the 1970s, shortly
after the restoration of democracy, is reputed not only to have learnt
Catalan but to have sung in the cors de Clav, traditional Catalan choirs.
This is about as far as it is possible to go, but it is at least wise to
know that Castilian is not the only official language.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (14): Eating out - Whether simple or
extravagant, the tomato remains a vital ingredient of Catalan cuisine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL Spain's regional cuisines, Catalan is the one which is most difficult
to imagine before the tomato was introduced to Europe.
The tomato is almost like a national symbol, as it is used to make tomaquet
 -bread rubbed with tomato and seasoned with oil and salt - which forms the
basis of the simplest and most authentic meal when eaten with fuet (a form
of salami), butifarra (sausage), pernil (ham), and possibly various forms of
truita or omelet.
Barcelona has a wide range of restaurants - including Chinese - and one of
the most expensive, Via Veneto, is Italian. But a good place to start is at
Can Punyetes, a traditional Catalan establishment with an extravagant
modernist exterior and a simple, rustic interior, located not far from the
centre on the Carrer Maria Cubi. In addition to tomaquet, it specialises in
grilled meats, eaten accompanied by the powerful garlic paste allioli.
As Catalonia has a Mediterranean coast, a fertile interior and the
mountainous region of the Pyrenees, its national cuisine is also highly
varied. But as it becomes more sophisticated, it still relies heavily on the
tomato, which is an ingredient in its sauces, the sofregit, samfaina and
romesco. There is also the picada, made from ground almonds and garlic,
which is used to thicken other sauces.
The Casa Jordi, decorated in the style of a Catalan masia, or farmhouse, in
the Passatje Marimon, is a good place to try some of the variations with
these sauces.
For the other side of Catalan cuisine, head for the port. One of the few
losses to the Olympic renovation of the city were the ramshackle restaurants
built illegally on Barceloneta beach that served fish and seafood without
any frills to the crowds that used to descend on the district at the
weekends. Although these have now been knocked down and their places taken
by palm trees, some of the proprietors have relocated on the Passeig
Nacional, the promenade which looks out over the port.
The other latest venue for eating seafood, which became popular last summer,
is the Port Olimpic. In both places the usual fare is paella, or mixed
grilled fish.
For fish cooked in a more complicated fashion, and for one of the most
attractive restaurants in the city, it is worth visiting Els Pescadors, in
the Placa Prim, which is a short journey out of the centre in the district
of Poblenou. It is set in a square overlooked by old village houses, the
front dining-room keeping the appearance of an old bar and the one at the
back typical of modern Barcelona design. If it is warm enough, it is
possible to eat at tables in the square. Here, there are plenty of Catalan
dishes to choose from, such as the excellent bacalao (salt cod) amb
samfaina.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (13): Let the feet be your guide -
Passing the time / Even though the city's public transport is highly
efficient, Barcelona is best explored on foot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ONE OF the qualities which makes Barcelona an enjoyable city to visit is
that it is best explored on foot. Its two most famous streets, the Passeig
de Gracia and Las Ramblas, are both designed for the pedestrian, and both
offer different aspects of Barcelona's culture.
The Passeig de Gracia was once the connecting road between Barcelona itself
and the village of Gracia, along which wealthy Catalan families built their
mansions. Now it cuts through the centre of what is called the Eixample, or
expansion, which is the 19th century addition, its regular grid reference
streets designed by the avant-garde town-planner, Ildefons Cerda.
In the space of a few yards on the Passeig de Gracia, it is possible to see
three of the best examples of modernist architecture, one by each of its
most famous practitioners. Close to the intersection with Carrer d'Arago,
standing next door to each other and unmissable, are Antoni Gaudi's Casa
Batllo and the more restrained Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. A
little further down is the Casa Lleo-Morera by the architect Lluis Domenech
i Montaner.
Las Ramblas bisects the old part of the city and leads down to the port. It
is much narrower than the Passeig de Gracia and is the place where at times
the whole city seems to be out for a stroll. Trying to attract the attention
of the crowd are all forms of street entertainers, from break dancers to
live statues.
Halfway down on the right, is Spain's premier opera house, the Liceu; while
a little further on on the left is the Carrer dels Escudellers, which is
synonymous with the rough end of the city.
The Barri Gotic is a tight network of narrow streets and contains the
centres of the regional and local government, the City Hall and the
Generalitat, which face each other across the Placa Sant Jaume, and most of
the architectural heritage of the earlier period.
As Barcelona has its back to the mountain of Tibidabo, and is flanked by the
hill of Montjuic, where the Olympic stadium and the Palau Sant Jordi stand,
there are plenty of vantage points from which the whole of the city can be
seen. One of the best spots for this is the Parc Guell. This is well worth a
visit not only for the view but also for an opportunity to see this fantasy
garden designed by Gaudi on the slope of the mountain.
One other trip worth taking from the city centre is a visit to the most
recent addition to its cultural agenda, and one which will compete with its
Picasso Museum as the most visited by tourists. It is the part of the
Thyssen-Bornemisza collection which is on display, from last month, in the
monastery of Pedralbes, and which includes works by Titian, Tintoretto and
Velazquez.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (11): Market relatively buoyant
despite abundance of supply - Property / The number of projects currently
under way and falling rental prices are seen as good news by economic
promoters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE amount of office space in Barcelona has more than doubled since the
start of the Olympic building programme, and rental prices have tumbled from
a maximum of Pta 3,500 a square metre to between Pta 2,000 and Pta 2,500.
'It has been excellent,' said Manuel Ludevid, director of economic promotion
at the city council. 'If our companies do not go bankrupt - and the signs
are that they are not going bankrupt - we have a product which is twice as
good, better quality and cheaper.'
The market changed rapidly from one where there was a marked shortage of
supply to one where large buildings have been left empty, most notably the
MAFRE tower, one of the two skyscrapers in the Olympic village, owned by the
Spanish insurance company.
Also reaching completion is the huge L'Illa complex on Diagonal, which
includes 115,752 sq m of office space, and retail premises which have
already been taken by Marks and Spencer and Benetton, among others.
More than 20 major projects are currently under development, covering a
total of 1,000 hectares, according to the city council.
Lluis Armet, the deputy mayor, cites the proximity of all these projects to
the city centre as a reason for the relative buoyancy of the market under
such a weight of supply.
He also points to the involvement of insurance companies in several of the
developments - for example, Winterthur in the case of L'Illa - as a sign
that they attract 'investors who think in terms of long-term opportunities'.
As part of the first sector to be affected in the construction cycle, Josep
Maria Gordi, a Barcelona-based architect, has seen a steep drop in demand
for new building designs in the past two years. This has only recently begun
to show signs of recovering, but given the one constant factor - there is
still a shortage of land which can be built on - he does not expect prices
to fall much further.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (12): Renowned for private clinics -
Health / Barcelona's highly developed private sector distinguishes its
medical care from that of other Spanish cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUG Clembuterol first hit the headlines when it was discovered in
Barcelona's anti-doping centre during the Olympics - a fact which its
organisers now claim as evidence of the centre's effectiveness.
As part of its unsuccessful bid to win the European Agency for the
Evaluation of Medicines for the city, Barcelona offered the building in
which these tests were conducted as the site for the agency.
Barcelona has a long medical tradition, which has been strengthened by its
universities. It has 11,425 hospital beds and 66 hospitals, of which the
largest are the Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, founded in the 14th century.
But what distinguishes Barcelona from Madrid and other Spanish cities is not
so much the public health sector as the number of high-profile private
clinics. Probably the most famous of these is El Clinic Barraquer, founded
in 1942, which has built up a world-wide reputation in ophthalmology. Others
include the Fundacio Puigvert, specialising in urology and also founded by
one of Barcelona's most famous doctors, and the Institut Dexeus, known for
obstetrics and gynaecology.
As a result of the concentration of private centres and the number of
patients coming to Barcelona from abroad, in 1987, 20 of these clinics
decided to form the Barcelona Medical Centre Association, to co-ordinate the
services they could offer, incorporating also the services of hotels, the
Catalan savings bank, La Caixa, and Iberia, the Spanish state airline. A
spokesman for the centre estimated that 60,000 patients had come to
Barcelona from outside Catalonia, to make use of its private health sector,
in the past two years.
Xavier Casas, the councillor responsible for health at the city council,
points to the improvement of the public health sector in the past seven
years, which has slightly increased its share of Spanish patients. But the
city council is also working with the private sector and the regional
government, which has direct control over health in Catalonia, to build on
the city's highly-specialised medical expertise.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (10): Marriage of art and finance -
Banking / As the region's leading bank has 2,752 cash machines in the city,
Joan Miro's design for its emblem is never far away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS 1993 was named the Ano Miro, the emblem of La Caixa (Catalonia's leading
financial institution) became the most obvious example of how the Catalan
painter's work was omnipresent.
In 1980, Miro was commissioned by the bank to paint a picture, in which
appeared the star that is now its corporate logo. La Caixa is the biggest
financial institution in Spain, measured by its deposits, which are
currently Pta 5,200bn, and one of the biggest in Europe.
As it has 2,752 cash machines and 107 branches in Barcelona, Miro's star is
never far from view.
In addition to La Caixa and the other Catalan banks, such as Banc de
Sabadell, Barcelona has the whole range of Spanish financial groups, as
would be expected in the country's industrial centre.
These include: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Banesto and Banco Central
Hispano, which has given the city its the special claim of having the
highest density of cash machines in the world.
The head offices of the banks are mostly to be found in a relatively
concentrated area of the city which is known as the central business
district. This area is formed by Placa Catalunya, Passeig de Gracia and
Diagonal.
In terms of deposits, Catalonia accounts for a little over a fifth of the
national total and a little under a fifth of its commercial and retail
banking loans, most of which are concentrated in Barcelona.
'There is quite a lot going on here,' said Sheena Campbell, president of the
Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, 'Madrid is the financial centre, but there
are a lot of multinationals here.'
The rating agency IBCA established its only Spanish office in Barcelona, in
1991. And although the Barcelona stock exchange has seen its volume drop to
negligible proportions since trading concentrated in Madrid after the 1989
stock market reform, Barcelona has kept an outlet for financial innovation
in the Mercat de Futurs Financers, its futures market, which was founded in
1990.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (9): Benefits remain intangible -
The verdict / While physical changes are visible, profits arising from the
Olympics have been modest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCELONA'S Olympic Organising Committee (COOB) liked to emphasise that it
was following the example set by Los Angeles in its approach to the Games,
except in one respect: it was not seeking to declare a profit. The benefits
to Barcelona would come in the form of infrastructures and reputation. When
the COOB eventually closed its books - at a ceremony on Montjuic which
included the screening of the Olympic film Marathon - exactly a year after
the opening of the Games there was a surplus of Pta 358m.
But while citizens could see the physical changes, the intangible benefits,
though potentially as great or greater, have yet to be realised. Lluis
Bassat, a leading advertising agent in Barcelona and a shareholder of Ovideo
Bassat Esport which designed the Olympic ceremonies, has calculated that the
advertising from which Barcelona benefited in the three-and-a-half hours of
the televised inauguration of the Games alone could be valued at USDollars
3bn.
But on the whole, the profits of the companies most closely connected with
the Games seem to have been modest. According to Tony Camin, a director of
Ovideo Bassat Esport, the company made Pta 3,500m on the staging of the
ceremonies, a margin of 6 per cent on the total cost. The fact that the COOB
planned originally to give preference to local companies for sponsorship
deals, but found offers from multinationals too good to turn down is some
measure of the competition that arose among those wanting to be involved in
the Games.
Local restaurateurs and small businesses, - expecting a huge influx of trade
during the Games - found that, except in the areas of the city frequented by
the Olympic family, July and August were slow months: the city hall campaign
to avoid congestion had been so effective that many of the residents left
the city.
The sector in which most money was invested was undoubtedly construction.
The private sector accounted for Pta 313bn of the total Olympic investment
and construction groups such as FCC were employed on projects such as the
complete overhaul of the airport which was funded by the central government.
The profits made by construction companies softened the blow once the market
slowed down. 'They made a lot of money in the last few years,' said Manuel
Ludevid, director of economic promotion for the city hall. This, he added,
was why they were able to survive now.
But the intangible benefit is beginning to be noticed by businesses with a
more tenuous Olympic connection. In the textile industry, for example,
designers say they have found it easier since the Games to sell their goods
abroad. According to Salvador Maluquer, director of the Spanish Intertextile
Council, Catalan designers are successfully using the leitmotif of the Games
at international trade fairs. 'The direct effects are difficult to quantify
and could be of little importance beside the indirect ones,' he said.
It is hoped that this will eventually more than offset the cost of servicing
the debts the city hall has run up. At Pta 242bn, it represents a threefold
increase since 1987, during which time there has been a 71 per cent increase
in municipal taxes. But the 20 per cent of income that is spent on paying
interest is not so high that it has yet damaged the council's reputation for
prudent financial management - Moody's rates its short-term debt A2 - built
up by an innovative financial team headed by Pilar Solans.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (7): Lines of communication move
streets ahead - Transport / A new ring-road has cleared the congested
streets of the city and made getting to surrounding areas an easier task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the improvements which Barcelona can boast, the one that most
directly affects the transport in the city is the 40 km of new four-lane
ring-road, which opened a month before the Games, is lined in parts with
palm trees, and cost a total of Pta 136,071m.
Barcelona's compact nature, which was one of its strong points when it came
to bid for the Olympics, has also made it a difficult city to drive in. As a
result of the new roads, traffic in the centre has lightened by 15 per cent
and communication with the surrounding areas has improved dramatically.
The inland section, the ronda de dalt, has been cut into the Tibidabo
mountain which overlooks the city, while the ronda litoral runs along the
coast, going underground as it passes the Olympic Village development and
the port.
But the first of the transport systems to receive attention was the metro.
It reaches 2.5m of the 3.5m inhabitants of the metropolitan area of
Barcelona, which includes the city itself and the surrounding municipal
districts such as L'Hospitalet and Badalona. Air conditioning, badly needed
in the summer, was installed in 90 per cent of the trains, and one of the
four lines was extended to reach the Olympic Village and Port.
Both Renfe, Spanish state-owned railway group, and the Ferrocarrils de la
Generalitat, the regional network, connect the nearby towns of the Baix
Llobregat and Valles, many of which have developed rapidly in recent years
as part of the commuter belt, and have put the coastal resort towns of
Castelldefels and Sitges within half an hours' journey from the city.
In an effort to encourage people to leave their cars outside the city,
before the Games large car parks were built at many of the suburban
stations. Public transport, either by bus or by metro, is heavily subsidised
 -with the average cost of a journey less than Pta 60, about half of what it
costs the city council.
Joan Torres, the head of public transport at the city council, says the
figure of 11,300 distinctive black and yellow taxis is around 3,000 more
than the European average, given the size of the city.
As transport falls under the jurisdiction of all three administrations -
central, regional and local - a consortium has been created, inspired again
by the co-operation of the Games, to plan for the future. The next step is a
programme of underground car parks, and in a few years it is hoped that
trams will be reintroduced. But in such a compact city, the simplest form of
transport, and the one which 30 per cent the population use to go to work,
remains walking.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (8): Philosopher speaks with the
voice of reason - Pasqual Maragall / Barcelona's mayor, a Mr Fixit in public
matters, is also a reflective scholar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the public image of Pasqual Maragall is that of a can-do mayor, who
organised in his home town what are generally considered to be the best
Olympic games to date, the private persona is a deeply reflective
intellectual.
Mr Maragall is something of a philosopher mayor, who likes to discuss Sir
Ralf Dahrendorf, in the way that a philosopher king such as Frederick of
Prussia talked about Voltaire.
He toys with Sir Ralf's ideas about the 'centre of gravity' between civil
society and politics, between individual egoisms and general welfare.
Running a big city, which is what he has been doing for 11 years, since he
was 41, allows him plenty of scope to test and to formulate theories.
Mr Maragall may be a mayor, but he is also a scholar who studied at New
York's New School for Social Research and taught economics at Barcelona
University before he was drafted into city politics.
The city, says Barcelona's mayor, is where a proper gravity can be
established, where tensions can be overcome. He goes on to make bold claims:
'What Europe really has in its favour is a system of cities.' He asserts
that Europe's true roots, and therefore its best projection to the future,
lie 'not in the nations, not in the regions, but in the cities.'
In Mr Maragall's view, nations and regions rest on identity and are
exclusive - and that spells trouble. The cities are inclusive, and those who
live in them know that collective identity is not enough.
The urban nucleus, which is confined and complex, has historically ensured
'contacts' between its different components and established a 'system of
minimum guarantees'.
The upshot is that those who live in a Manchester, a Hamburg and a Barcelona
will always be able to 'understand each other', because the very stresses of
city life impose the 'minimums' and the 'contacts'. The same cannot be said,
Mr Maragall argues, 'for a Bosnia or a Flanders'.
The mayor believes Europe 'is going to be terrified of its diversity' and
that, because of this, the true value of cities will be realised. The cities
will become, if not exactly islands of mutual tolerance, at least 'safety
nets' where peaceful co-existence can be practised.
Mr Maragall dismisses the Hollywood vision of blade-runing urban wastelands
as a specifically 'American nightmare'. The city is not the enemy of the
human in Europe, and certainly not in Barcelona. In the philosopher mayor's
fiefdom, the gravitational pull is rational and reasonable.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (5): Plans put into action - The
Olympic Effect / Economic and strategic projects that were drawn up for the
year 2000 at the time of the Games remain the driving force behind continued
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN in 1981 Barcelona city hall decided to enter the bidding to host the
Olympic Games, it was already looking for a way to realise its pent-up
ambitions.
Extensive urban plans dating back to 1978 for the regeneration of the city
were designed to correct the neglect it had suffered during the Franco
regime, when its suburbs grew and the centre became steadily more congested.
The success of its Olympic bid gave Barcelona a chance to make up that
deficit. 'In the five years before the Games,' said Lluis Armet, the deputy
mayor, 'public investment was the same as in the previous 30 or 40.'
Putting these plans into action not only took money, but also relied heavily
on the enthusiasm of the residents who had to live through the a period when
large parts of the city were turned into building sites, or obras, until it
became a popular joke that the city be renamed 'Bacelobra'.
The city hall made no secret of the fact that it saw the Games chiefly as a
means to an end. When earlier this year, it came to shouldering the deficit
of Holsa, the publicly-owned Olympic holding company, the central government
was not at first happy about forking out more cash.
According to Manuel Ludevid, head of economic promotion at the city hall,
this was partly because the hall had been responsible for its management and
because, he said, Madrid 'suspected, partly correctly, that some projects
which were not directly-related to the Games were passed through it'. It was
finally agreed that the deficit be shared.
What was directly-related to the Games was not easy to define. Only 9.4 per
cent of the recorded total figure of Pta 926,439m was spent on sports
facilities, for example; the rest on improvements in the transport system,
new hotels, telecommunications, the transformation of whole districts, such
as Vall d'Hebron and the Olympic Village, and the liberating of land for
building.
Spain's oldest railway, which ran along the coast and cut the city off from
the sea, was ripped up, for example, opening up the previously blighted area
for development, and prompting the overhaul of the city's inadequate
drainage system.
But not included in this total are all the other privately-funded projects
stimulated by this wave of urban renewal and upgrading of services. These
projects, such as the massive development of the coastal end of Diagonal,
the avenue which extends the whole way across the city, will at a slower
rate have as significant an impact as in the six years before the Games.
One legacy which the city has learnt to build on is the successful
co-operation between the private and public sectors. 'The Japanese example
is quite clear,' said Mr Ludevid, 'the Miti (ministry of trade and industry)
has been doing this for years, and it has had fantastic results.'
While the Olympic spirit of co-operation was still at full tilt, an economic
and strategic plan for the year 2000 was drawn up by 560 Catalan experts
from the government, the unions and business. This is one of the most
important factors behind the continued optimism, in spite of the harsh
economic climate.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (6): Games bid restores the balance
 -Accommodation / A change in the law allowing developers to buy land has
made way for the construction of badly needed hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WEBSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER and quality of Barcelona hotels was not one of the city's strong
points when it was bidding for the Olympic Games.
The city is a site of Spain's biggest trade fairs, but it was not unusual
for visiting businessmen to commute via the shuttle from Madrid when one of
the fairs was on, to avoid the difficulty and expense of finding a hotel
room in Barcelona. Others would stay in hotels in coastal resorts as far
away as Lloret de Mar.
However, as with offices, the Olympic building programme has tilted the
balance back in favour of the consumer, to the satisfaction of the city
council.
According to Manuel Ludevid, the city council's director of economic
promotion, the city broke hold that hoteliers had on the market. This was a
position that they had abused in the past, he said.
In order to achieve this, the council had to change the law to allow land to
be sold to developers, under a 50-year lease, as part of a general hotel
plan. Eight projects were successfully auctioned, and the number of hotel
rooms, which had been particularly scarce in the four and five-star
brackets, has now increased by 60 per cent to 30,000.
The most notable additions are the Hotel Juan Carlos I, which overlooks the
city from the inland end of Diagonal; and the Hotel Arts, one of the two
Olympic skyscrapers, which is about to open under Ritz-Carlton management.
According to Enric Truno the councillor for hotels and tourism, 55 per cent
of visitors to Barcelona are businessmen; and this has meant that its hotel
trade has been vulnerable to the downturn in the economy which has led
companies to cut back on expenses.
Nevertheless, the number of visitors staying in hotels has risen to 1.25m a
year from 850,000 since 1991, and occupancy rates of 52 per cent mean that
the sector is withstanding the crisis, even if it is having to find new ways
of promoting itself.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (4): A well crafted financial
strategy - City finances / In spite of its massive debt burden, Barcelona's
city hall has managed to achieve an admirable credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY that Barcelona says it is going about lowering its staggeringly high
debt should prompt deficit-burdened European governments to call on the city
hall's treasury team in the hope of picking up a few tips.
The city hall's debt stands at Pta241.9bn (Dollars 1.8bn), represents
Pta107,400 per inhabitant and is by far the highest of any municipality in
Spain. Madrid, which has population of nearly 3m against the 1.6m in
metropolitan Barcelona, has a city debt of Pta107.4bn or Pta37,000 per
inhabitant.
There does not, however, appear to be the slightest sign of nervousness in
the city hall. 'The debt is not my problem, I can finance it,' says Joan
Clos, Barcelona's assistant deputy mayor and its chief financial officer.
Mr Clos and his team have embarked on a finely tuned strategy that has, for
the time being, earned the approval of rating agencies such as Moody's which
has awarded the city A-2 for the its short-term debt.
Income, through city taxes, is high but fiscal impact is softened by special
policies aimed at making Barcelona affordable. Expenditure, including
running costs, is meanwhile being reduced.
Barcelona's residents are the highest taxed city dwellers in Spain and pay
Pta53,000 per capita in annual taxes. Inhabitants of Bilbao, the second
highest municipal tax payers, pay Pta46,000. The upside is a network of
services, especially public transport, that most cities in Europe, let alone
Spain, might well envy.
The city hall says that it has invested, providing soft credit lines in
sectors such as hotels and car parks with the aim of creating a
price-depressing oversupply. 'We've spent money to make the city cheaper,'
says Mr Clos. 'We're breaking down monopolies and making Barcelona
competitive.'
Either through the effect of Mr Clos' deregulation crusade or through the
blunt truth of economic recession, the fact is that Barcelona is less dear
than it was. A recent restaurant survey found that overall prices were down
by 30 per cent while printed hotel charges are merely notional and open to
souk-type bargaining.
The city council's investment budget has meanwhile been drastically reduced
from a Pta30bn high in the run-up to the Olympics to a present Pta15bn and,
in order to further reduce the debt burden, the leases on municipal car
parks are being sold off to the private sector.
The most eye-catching example of Barcelona's financial probity has been its
savings on running costs. In the course of this year the city council has
shed just over 1,000 jobs, mostly through voluntary retirement, and reduced
its labour force by 10 per cent.
Set against the norm of the highly-regulated and labour-intensive Spanish
bureaucracy, such staff reductions represent a remarkable achievement.
Barcelona's massive debt is excusable in the wake of an Olympic games and
its approach to the burden is commendable.
The question is whether the reduced spending will be enough. Independent
economists, among them Barcelona University's respected Professor Joaquin
Muns, say that the city's debt is in reality twice as high as is officially
admitted because a consolidated profit and loss account should include
numerous loss-making semi-privatised companies that are controlled by the
municipality.
Revenue is meanwhile receiving a double punch: it is being reduced by the
general recession and it is being lowered further by a flight to the
suburbs. Increasingly, Barcelona residents are moving out to dormitory
towns, where the rates and municipal taxes are far lower, but they continue
to commute into the city where basic services have to be maintained.
Barcelona is by no means the only debt-burdened Spanish town and its
authorities are right to point out that while Barcelona's deficit may be
higher than elsewhere, the city is in a better position to service the debt.
Malaga, the main population centre on the Costa del Sol resort area, has,
for example, recently suffered the indignity of having municipal telephone
lines cut because Telefonica, the state-controlled telecommunications
company, lost patience over the the city's unpaid telephone bills.
The chief concern among Barcelona's financial officers is that the
municipality's admirable rating status could be affected by the knock-on
effect of the doubtful creditworthiness of other cities which have also
borrowed strongly on the domestic and international markets.
Because of this, mayor Pasqual Maragall has joined the leaders of other main
Spanish cities such as Madrid, Valencia and Seville to pressure the central
Madrid government into helping the municipalities keep their creditors at
bay. The Spanish treasury's response has so far been lukewarm because the
central administration's finances are as hamstrung by deficits, as are those
of the big urban centres.
Mr Maragall and Mr Clos deny that joining forces with other cities means
that they are worried about Barcelona's debt.
Bu in common with the other major municipalities, Barcelona does want to
have greater fiscal autonomy. This demand is not likely to cut much ice
among Madrid's central government authorities who believe that big cities,
Barcelona included, are incorrigible big spenders.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (3): Labour laws weigh heavily -
Employment / Changes to its rigid legislation are vital if Spain is to
continue to attract investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE DECISION last month by Volkswagen, the German car producer, to close
down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish subsidiary Seat sent shudders
through the city. Under VW's plans, 9,000 employees will be made redundant
or retired early and, unions claim, 30,000 to 50,000 indirect jobs will be
affected.
Some saw the writing on the wall two years ago when Akzo, the Dutch
chemicals and fibres group, closed its Barcelona factory, La Seda, and added
the unit's 2,600 labour force to Spain's growing legion of unemployed. Like
Seat's Zona Franca plant, which was built in 1951 on the city's outskirts,
La Seda, dating from the turn of the century, was an emblem of Barcelona's
industrial might.
'What worries me is the whole philosophy that governs foreign investment,'
says Antoni Negre, chairman of Barcelona's chamber of commerce. 'The
multinational quite rightly wants a return on its outlay and it requires a
proper labour market framework in order to maintain its investment.'
Seat's losses - estimated to be about Dollars 770m this year - are denting
VW's balance sheet and La Seda's 1990 shortfall of Dollars 26.6m contributed
to a 30 per cent decline in Azko's results that year. 'The Dutch made a
serious proposal to restructure La Seda, but it was not accepted and they
just walked away,' Mr Negre says.
VW is not walking away. It plans to step up production at a highly automated
Dollars 2.2bn Seat plant which it opened earlier this year in Martorell,
35km west of Barcelona. But industrial action - prompted by the Zona Franca
closedown and spilling over to the Martorell factory - will not make the
German group enthusiastic about its Spanish subsidiary.
Spain's labour legislation, which is bureaucratic and weighted towards rigid
job classifications and fixed employment, is a problem that affects the
entire domestic productive system. But it is in Barcelona that the
legislation's negative effects appear to be most keenly felt.
The Spanish government is seeking to change the domestic hiring and firing
rules as part of a general deregulation of the labour market. It is
encountering strong union resistance, not least in Barcelona's industrial
belt, but business leaders insist that sweeping changes are essential if
Spain is to continue to attract multinationals.
Volkswagen delivered its blow last month and Nissan could deliver one later
this month for it is seeking to axe at least 1,100 jobs from the 7,000
labour force that it employs at its plant close by the stricken Seat factory
in the Zona Franca area.
What the city's business leaders hope is that the unions will be amenable
and will accept whatever cuts are necessary, as cheaply as possible, in
order to salvage the investment.
Nissan, which produces Vanettes and Patrols at its Barcelona plant, is the
showpiece of Japanese investment in the city and it has helped to attract
117 fellow Japanese companies to the Barcelona area - a figure that
represents 85 per cent of Japanese industrial investment in Spain. Just as
importantly, Nissan is, with Seat, the only car producer installed in Spain
with its own on-site design centre and is thus able to place orders directly
with local suppliers.
The manner in which Seat has been pushed to the edge could, however, be
salutary. At one point VW reportedly planned to absorb the Spanish unit
altogether, bury the Seat trademark, wind up the Martorell design centre and
turn that plant into a mere assembly centre for imported parts.
Now VW is promising to step up its purchase of Spanish-made components for
Seat in order to soften the blow of the Zona Franca closedown.
VW has given the go-ahead for a Dollars 230m investment which will raise the
proportion of Spanish components in Seat cars from 54 per cent to 67 per
cent. The hope is that most, if not all, of this additional supply will be
manufactured on the same Zona Franca plant site that Seat is vacating.
If this project is delivered as planned, Barcelona, for all its present
shudders, will have reason to congratulate itself. The city's pride in its
manufacturing muscle will remain intact for it will have lost an obsolete
plant and gained a forward-looking industrial park.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (2): Axis for the twenty-first
century - Hub of the future / The city is gearing itself up to become a
gateway to southern Europe with a port to rival that of Rotterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
THE expansion of Barcelona's airport is a measure of the confidence with
which the city faces its economic future. The airport tripled its total area
in the run up to the 1992 Olympic games and its four terminals now have the
capacity to handle 16m passengers a year - four times the population of
greater Barcelona and double the annual number of visitors that fly into the
city.
But the airport's under-capacity does not appear to worry anyone in
Barcelona. City hall officials, business leaders and academics share the
view that Barcelona is destined to become a 'Mediterranean Rotterdam', the
most important communications centre in southern Europe, the gateway to the
southern swathe of the Economic Community.
'We are talking about the motorways we have, the port we are building up and
the high-speed train we have been promised,' says Professor Joaquim Muns, a
senior member of the economics faculty at Barcelona University.
'The sum is a practical and efficient intermodal nucleus, a sort of
Rotterdam.'
Barcelona's economy, once rooted in its textile industry and latterly in car
and chemical manufacturing, is now increasingly viewed as being bound up in
its role as a gateway and a crossroads. Those who think Barcelona through
into the next century talk about the city's location and discuss the 'axis'
and the 'arc'.
The axis has to do with Spain and with its two high growth areas, the Ebro
river valley that meanders across north Spain to the Mediterranean and the
Mediterranean coast line itself. Barcelona stands at the motorway
intersection of these two expanding belts, well linked to Zaragoza, the Ebro
valley's focal point, and to the fast-growing Valencia nucleus that lies to
its south on the Mediterranean.
As, and when, Spain emerges from recession, wealth will again begin to flow
down the Ebro valley and up the Mediterranean coast to pass through
Barcelona on its way into northern Europe. It is no accident that the plants
of two of Spain's sturdiest, export-driven manufacturers - General Motors
and Ford - lie next to Zaragoza and Valencia respectively.
The arc relates to the Mediterranean stretch from northern Italy, through
southern France to north-eastern Spain which has some 50m inhabitants. This
area, which is coming to be known as the 'southern banana', is viewed as a
dynamic complement to the better known 'hot banana', the name given to the
central European arc that extends south from the Paris-London-Amsterdam
triangle along the Rhur valley to Milan and Lombardy.
Barcelona takes its local banana arc seriously for this is where the
Rotterdam analogy comes into play.
During the 1980s, the number of containers passing through the port of
Barcelona increased from 180,000 teu (twenty foot equivalent units) to
448,000. By 1991 the total was up to 488.917 teu, turning Barcelona into one
of the world's biggest Mediterranean ports and putting it comfortably ahead
of its closest competitors, Marseilles and Genoa.
The city projects itself as an intermodal distribution centre that will
quickly move maritime cargo arriving at its international container terminal
on to motorway and railways networks. With a view to consolidating
Barcelona's role as the centre of freight distribution for southern Europe,
the city's port authorities have a blueprint for a new container terminal
which will raise the harbour's handling capacity to 700,000 teu a year.
The future, as the city planners see it, has maritime cargoes from the
Pacific Rim saving four days in their journey to Europe by unloading at
Barcelona instead of at Rotterdam. Time saving will be greatly improved once
Barcelona is connected on a European-gauge track to Europe's high-speed
train network.
Freight traffic will make intensive use of the planned railway connection.
According to a forecast by Barcelona's city hall, 2.8m annual tonnes of
freight in the short term - the high speed network is scheduled to be
operating by 2004 - will rise to 4m tonnes in 2010. As a major European
entry point, Barcelona's vast airport might begin to fill up.

FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (1): Contrasts on every corner -
First impressions / Tom Burns finds that contradictions colour Barcelona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS was the most famous traveller to reach Barcelona. The
statue that honours him at the harbour sums up the city's contradictory
nature.
On his return from his first voyage to the New World, Columbus went straight
to Barcelona where his patrons King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had
temporarily established their travelling court.
But while Columbus - who presented the monarchs with slaves and parrots but
not much gold - announced that he had opened up the westward route to the
Indies, the harbour front statue to the discoverer has him looking in the
opposite direction, pointing east with his right arm towards his Italian
homeland.
Barcelona should probably not have a monument to Columbus at all. His
discovery shifted the whole direction of Spanish policy towards the Atlantic
and away from the Mediterranean. Barcelona itself was closed off from the
New World riches by the monopoly established in Seville.
Barcelona's contrasts are manifested in the emotional swings of its
inhabitants as they move between seny and rauxa. The Catalan word seny has
no Castilian Spanish equivalent and it means a mixture of business acumen
and commercial cunning. Rauxa, another wholly Catalan term, means boisterous
anarchy.
Barcelona has the most sober entrepreneurs in Spain but also the most zany
and outrageous experimental theatre. La Vanguardia, the city's
long-established quality newspaper, mixes excellent reporting and thoughtful
analysis with columns of luridly explicit small advertisements informing the
reader on who to 'contact', how to 'relax' and what can be roughly expected
in terms of cost and benefit.
The city's ability to be all things to all people extends to its political
institutions. Barcelona's municipal council is controlled by the socialist
party while the Catalan home rule government, which has its seat in the
city, is dominated by local nationalists whose ideological bent is decidedly
conservative.
The city hall and the Generalitat, the home rule government headquarters,
occupy opposite ends of the Sant Jaume square in the heart of old Barcelona
and eye each other suspiciously, the former from its the neo-classical
facade, the latter from its renaissance front. On important occasions, such
as the Olympics, politicians of both camps and institutions bury their
differences but at other times, petty squabbling is the norm.
Ever since elections started to be held again in Spain's post-Franco
democracy, Barcelona's residents have voted for the socialists in municipal
polls, for the nationalists in the local government ones and have had both
parties running neck and neck in general elections.
This entrenched dual track voting pattern could be an example of a
checks-and balances seny but it could just as easily be demonstration of the
rauxa syndrome that wants to keep everything confused.
The present day traveller to Barcelona will find contradictions on every
corner and in every restaurant. The local cuisine is adept at placing
opposites, such as lobster and chicken, in the same stew pot and
accompanying delicate fish grills with sauces - romescu and allioli - that
are calculated to blow the roof off a normal mouth.
From corner to corner, Barcelona architecturally embraces the modernist
fantasy of a Gaudi and the functionalism of a Mies van der Rohe, tight slums
that could be Naples and a grid street system punctured by solidly bourgeois
octagonal blocks with a Parisian feel to them.
The city's pace can be as fast as the traffic whizzing along its ring-roads
and as indolent as the crowds who amble along Las Ramblas.
Barcelona's contradictory character emerges in the tension between the
narrow Catalan provincialism that dominates so much of its city life and the
bravado of its European gateway claims. Its past has had it alternatively
squashed by Madrid and Castile, only to pick itself up again.
Typically, Catalonia's national day commemorates an 18th century defeat  -
one of the several occasions when its local privileges and national identity
were trampled on.
Now the city is riding triumphantly high. Astonishingly, after all the
building that went on before the Olympics, when the city was turned inside
out, building is still going on, although now it is mostly shopping
precincts that are going up rather than sports stadiums.
And yet there are doubts. The city council says it can cope with its massive
debts but the markets may need a certain amount of convincing. Huge inflows
of direct foreign investment appeared in the late 1980s but the likes of
Volkswagen and Nissan are having second thoughts.
Barcelona's see-saw history suggests that it will emerge from whatever
troubles lie ahead. Certainly its infrastructure is now magnificently
equipped to withstand a recession.
If not a single peseta was spent on the city for the rest of the century, it
would still look good in the year 2000.
The business visitor should take Barcelona's duality with an open mind.
There will be plenty of seny in the daytime and endless opportunity for
rauxa after hours.

Results in line with expectations, but accompanied by a fairly cautious
statement, kept British Airways shares in negative territory. They closed 2
adrift at 397p following turnover of 4.9m.
Pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 235m, against Pounds 227m a year ago,
while the dividend was raised to 3.18p per share from 2.93p previously.
Analysts' forecasts had ranged from 3.1p to 3.3p.
In the three months to the end of September, 8.1m passengers flew on the
airline's scheduled services, 14.4 per cent more than a year ago, with
revenue passenger kilometres rising by 12.6 per cent. Cargo traffic rose 9.3
per cent.
Most brokers left their full-year forecasts unchanged. Smith New Court
reaffirmed its positive stance on the stock, highlighting the growth in
premium traffic and the load trends.
Bank shares were driven in both directions, apparently by broker
recommendations. Royal Bank of Scotland was the sector's best performer,
rising 8 to 364p, within 4 of the stock's all-time high, as the market
continued to anticipate more good news from the bank's Direct Line insurance
subsidiary, due to announce figures next week. One leading firm of
marketmakers was said to have been an aggressive buyer of the shares.
Abbey National eased a shade to 403p in spite of some particularly heavy
activity in the traded options market, where one front line agency broker
was said to have sold 1,000 'puts', equivalent to buying 1m shares.
Barclays, up 6 at 582p, and Lloyds Bank, a shade off at 563p, were said to
have been recommended by UBS, while Swiss Bank was thought to have been the
downside driving force in Standard Chartered, 9 weaker at 1034p.
The insurance area of the market failed to arouse much interest ahead of
today's third-quarter numbers from General Accident, which analysts forecast
will show nine-month profits of around Pounds 230m, against a loss of Pounds
37m last year.
GA's shares eased a penny to 691p, while those of Commercial Union declined
8 to 594p on 568,000 shares traded in front of tomorrow's third-quarter
numbers.
Results from British Steel prompted a volatile session in the shares as a
positive reaction to improved profits and dividend turned negative after a
downbeat statement from the management. The shares were eventually 2 1/2 off
at 122p in turnover of 8.9m.
The market had little time to react to a statement by Tiphook - made a few
minutes before the market closed - that its losses would extend into the
second half, that no final dividend would be paid and that it was in talks
to sell its container division. The company also said it had made further
progress in its restructuring talks with the banks. The shares were up 3 at
98p.
Cable and Wireless was among the FT-SE 100's worst performers, slipping 11
to 486p on keen turnover of 2.7m, ahead of interim figures scheduled for
Thursday.
The weakness of the shares was said to have been sparked by a bout of
sustained selling by US investment bank Goldman Sachs, although this was not
confirmed. C&amp;W shares were badly mauled a couple of weeks ago by suggestions
that CITIC, the Chinese government investment agency, was considering the
sale of a substantial block of its 57 per cent shareholding, although this
was said to have been denied by the Chinese authorities.
Amstrad was among the market's most active stocks, with more than 12m traded
in the cash market and the equivalent of 3.5m dealt in the options market.
The underlying shares edged up 1 1/2 to 53p.
BICC jumped late in the session, closing 6 higher at 395p amid speculation
of a big order from the US.
The oil and gas sector did little more than mark time as dealers pondered
the recent weakening by international crude oil prices and the chances of a
further bout of uncertainty ahead of the next Opec meeting, scheduled for
November 23.
Shell Transport, roughly handled by the market last week following results
only marginally below best expectations, improved 2 to 692p, but Enterprise
Oil dipped 7 to 445p. Lasmo, another to suffer substantial downside pressure
last week, rallied 1 1/2 to 130p.
Utilities lost ground across the board, with regional electricity stocks
featured by Eastern, 7 lower at 580p, and Midlands, which dropped 7 to 596p.
FT-SE 100 stock Southern eased only 3 to 600p.
Unilever rebounded from Friday's post-results fall, closing 19 ahead at
1105p. Kleinwort Benson and Strauss Turnbull both issued buy notes, while
NatWest Securities also took a positive view.
Shares in Euro Disney recovered after an initial fall, fin-ishing a net 15
firmer at 385p. The stock was hit at first by bearish weekend press comment,
but rallied on some international buying interest, according to dealers.
Walt Disney, in the US, yesterday had some of its debt downgraded, partly as
a result of last week's heavy losses at the French theme park.
Forte improved 4 to 231p ahead of an analysts visit to the group's motorway
service centre in France this week. Profit-taking clipped 5 from Airtours,
which ended at 434p. Adverse press comment hurt First Leisure in the wake of
last week's downgrade by the company's broker. The stock retreated 10 to
239p.
Ladbroke remained friendless, losing 5 at 163p in big turnover of 5.5m. US
buying was said to have lifted Rank Organisation, up 11 at 846p.
Conglomerate BTR slipped 5 to 354 1/2 p after Credit Lyonnais Laing
reiterated its cautious stance on the stock at the morning meeting.
Zeneca was helped by a report that one of its products had moved to the
final phase of development following 'particularly encouraging' results in
phase two patients. The shares appreciated 11 to 765p.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television strengthened 13 to 218p on weekend newspaper
coverage suggesting that LWT was interested in increasing its stake in the
company. LWT relinquished 9 to close at 499p on the speculation.

<TEXT>
There was a two-way tussle over SmithKline Beecham yesterday as a critical
press article vied with good news about one of the company's products.
The stock was under pressure on a selective piece of broker comment,
highlighted in a Sunday newspaper article, which suggested a split between
Mr Bob Bauman, the chief executive, and Mr Jan Leschly, the chairman.
However, many pharmaceuticals analysts felt that any difference of opinion
had been exaggerated beyond the bounds of credibility. One seasoned observer
said: 'Undoubtedly they have a different background and different
personalities, but I am completely confident that they have not had a rift.'
Helping the stock was a statement from the company saying that trials
comparing SmithKline's anti-nausea compound Kytril with Zofran, the rival
product from Glaxo, showed Kytril was more effective and popular with
patients.
Glaxo was further affected by weekend reports that the company had sacked
members of its sales force following an internal investigation into
mishandling of the company's funds. The shares lost 12 to 642p. SmithKline
'A' finished 6 1/2 lower at 402p ex-dividend.

FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties find support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELECTED property shares advanced as James Capel, the London institutional
broker, reiterated its bullish stance on the sector.
The broker, which first turned positive a year ago, said it continued to
recommend an overweight position because of what it believes to be the
continuing improvement in the market fundamentals. In particular, the broker
notes that 'when rental growth begins, property will cease to be rated
purely in terms of the cost of money, but more in terms of the income growth
potential'.
Capel is recommending Land Securities, which advanced 7 to 715p yesterday.
While the broker is forecasting a net asset value of 647p this year, it said
this could grow to 900p to 950p within three years. Elsewhere in the sector,
Slough Estates climbed 8 to 254p and British Land 3 to 401p.

FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES traders opened the new equity account with a nervousness masked
by strong technical trading in FT-SE futures and options contracts, writes
Peter John.
Turnover in Footsie futures was boosted by one house taking advantage of the
differential between the contract which expires next month and the contract
for March and rolling forward its exposure. More than 2,500 December
contracts were sold and the equivalent number of March contracts bought.
The December contract rose through the morning to hit a high of 3,123, a
premium of some 15 points above cash compared with its new estimated fair
value of about 6 1/2 . It then trickled back to around 3,100 in late
trading.
Dealers were also selling FT-SE options to take advantage of high implied
volatility in the contract. Recent concerns over the direction of the
underlying equity market had pushed implied or theoretical volatility up to
15 1/2 per cent by the start of trading. That uncertainty is not expected to
go away ahead of the Budget. But the nervousness was considered slightly
overdone yesterday and marketmakers were offloading puts and calls to pocket
their profits. The implied figures eased to 15 per cent by the close.
Volume in traded options was just over 30,000 lots with FT-SE options
contributing 12,440 and Amstrad (3,482) topping stock options.

FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious start to new equity account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW equity trading account, to be featured this week by the outcome of
the Nafta vote in the US Congress and which will also take the stock market
to the very brink of the Budget from the UK chancellor of the exchequer,
made a cautious start yesterday. Trading volume was around 23 per cent down
from Friday's total and well below the average levels of the past three
months.
The FT-SE 100 Index trod an erratic path, losing the 3,100 mark in early
trading, then retrieving it with a gain that extended to more than 10
points, only to slide away again when Wall Street came in sharply lower in
UK trading hours. At the final reading of 3,093.3, the Footsie showed a loss
on the day of 5.8.
At the opening of the market, attention focused on the Seaq overnight
ticker, which reported the equity trades executed on Friday and identified
as a move out of equities and into gilt-edged securities by a UK insurance
institution.
The US securities house which took the equities trade, worth around Pounds
250m, had then covered itself by selling stock index futures on Friday, in
what was probably the largest deal recorded in that sector.
Yesterday's market was also affected by the latest round of results from
leading British companies. Although trading figures from British Airways and
then from British Steel were not too far from expectations, both companies
disappointed the market with unpromising comments on the outlook.
Poor trading volumes showed a final total of only 493.6m shares through the
Seaq network, compared with Friday's 639.4m. Business in non-Footsie stocks
was also light, making up only about 46 per cent of the day's total. But
with marketmakers quicker to mark down quotations in the second liners, the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to fall, shedding 4.6 to 3,416.5.
The outcome of the Nafta vote in the US congress troubles securities
analysts because of its significance for the GATT trade negotiations and the
fear of an international trade war. The UK stock market this week also faces
a heavy list of important data on the domestic economy.
The high point will come tomorrow with the October Retail Price Index; while
most UK securities houses hope that annualised inflation will remain at 1.8
per cent, some fear that it may have begun to creep higher. Inflation is
seen as the key to the chances for a cut in base rates around the time of
the Budget speech at the end of the month.
Thursday will bring the latest average earnings statistics, also a potential
source of inflationary pressure and the October unemployment figures. The
same day also features the regular policy meeting of the Bundesbank and will
inevitably prompt speculation of impending cuts in German interest rates.
Against this somewhat dangerous backcloth, fund managers and securities
houses alike are now unwilling to take on heavy trading positions ahead of
the Budget.
The market was held back by a mixed performance from the pharmaceutical
stocks following further allegations of malpractice by leading companies.
Oil stocks, too, lacked supporters in London and the whole of the
international sector looked dull at the close of the session.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow easier on bond yields,
Nafta worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
RISING BOND yields and concern about the fate of the North American Free
Trade Agreement kept US share prices anchored in negative territory
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.99 at 3,677.52. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.64 at 463.75, while the American SE composite
shed 1.78 to 477.82 and the Nasdaq composite fell 6.87 to 772.45. New York
SE volume totalled 251m shares.
The markets opened the week in an uncertain mood. Although the economic
background continues to improve - official data yesterday showed that
industrial production rose a stronger than expected 0.8 per cent in October
 -investors remain troubled by several factors: rising bond yields, which
may be a precursor of higher short-term interest rates; the high valuations
of stock prices, which may lead to a substantial correction if investor
sentiment suddenly turns negative; and the possibility that congress may
reject Nafta tomorrow.
The worries about interest rates were at the forefront yesterday because of
an early rise in bond yields. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond
initially climbed to 6.18 per cent in the wake of the strong industrial
production data, before falling back to the opening level. Nafta was also on
the minds of investors, who fear that if congress votes against Nafta this
week, long-term economic growth, and corporate profits, could suffer.
Shares of the major television network companies were all higher on news of
a court ruling that will allow networks to own financial stakes in shows
produced by outsiders. CBS jumped Dollars 8 1/4 to Dollars 303 1/8 and Cap
Cities ABC Dollars 11 5/8 to Dollars 630 3/4 , while General Electric,
parent of NBC, firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 94 1/4 .
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 as investors
appeared unimpressed by a sweetened takeover offer from QVC Network. The
original agreed offer from Viacom still appears close to success in the bid
battle, although a court ruling today on the legality of a special
anti-takeover agreement between Paramount and Viacom may alter the final
outcome. Viacom shares were down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 53 1/8 and QVC up
Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 51 3/4 .
Telefonos de Mexico, the biggest 'Nafta-play' in the market, fell Dollars 1
to Dollars 54 3/8 in volume of 4.6m shares on fears that the trade pact will
collapse.
UAL dropped Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 142 5/8 after broking house Bear
Stearns downgraded the airline's stock.
Canada
IN contrast to Mexico, Toronto stocks closed sharply lower as profit-taking
and worries over the outcome of tomorrow's Nafta vote in the US braked the
TSE's recent upward charge.
The TSE 300 index fell 21 points to 4,281.8 in trade of 76.8m shares valued
at CDollars 741m. Falls led rises by 475 to 331.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt climbs 1.7% on zero
growth warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THIRD quarter results season was well under way, but Frankfurt preferred
to second-guess the Bundesbank once again, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT heard chilling economic news at the weekend; yet it took the DAX
index up by 34.10, or 1.7 per cent to 2,049.11. Turnover leapt from DM6.7bn
to DM9.7bn.
Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven, an institutional adviser at Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, said that hopes for further interest rate cuts were raised by
the forecast of zero West German growth in 1994 by Germany's 'five wise
men', the government's independent economic advisers.
However, he said, this also weakened the other leg of the German equity
scenario, which would involve the beginnings of corporate earnings recovery
from the middle of 1994.
Two of yesterday's best performers, Mannesmann and Thyssen, were losing
money at the moment, he said. Mannesmann, up DM13.40 to DM369.80, had
accumulated a gain of DM30.10 over the past five trading days. Yesterday saw
a big US buy order and one dealer said that reports of a forthcoming
telecommunications link between AT&amp;T, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
had excited fans of Mannesmann's telecoms offshoot.
In financials, Bayerische Vereinsbank rose DM18, or DM3.5 per cent to DM527
following an analysts meeting late last week, while AMB dropped DM45 to
DM1,405 for a two-day drop of DM95 from last week's speculative peak.
PARIS saw a spate of nine-month figures as the CAC-40 index rose 21.05, or 1
per cent to 2,117.90, short of its day's high of 2,128. Analysts said that
the market took its main encouragement from a number of external factors,
including strength in Germany and hopes that trade talks will be boosted by
an agreement on Nafta later in the week.
Rhone Poulenc was up FFr3.40 at FFr153.60 ahead of a government announcement
on privatisation details after the close. Among those releasing turnover
figures, Bouygues added FFr4 to FFr655 on a small fall in the numbers.
AMSTERDAM remained strong with VNU showing one of the day's biggest gains,
but in small volume. The publisher's shares gained Fl 6.50 to Fl 158.00,
just off their all time high of Fl 158.20 as the CBS Tendency index added
2.5, or 1.8 per cent to 137.9.
Unilever recovered some of last week's losses on its third quarter figures,
closing a net 62 cents higher at Fl 212.10, ex a Fl 1.48 interim dividend.
After reflection, some analysts have returned fairly positive comments on
the group. Hoare Govett, in sticking to its buy recommendation, noted that
while the headline figures may have been unsatisfactory, the 'underlying
picture' remained good.
ZURICH found interest in corporate developments but the SMI index eased 3.7
to 2,717.4.
CS Holding added SFr45 to SFr3,425 on a share split, and its offer for Leu
Holding, the private banking group. Leu firmed SFr98 or 16.6 per cent to
SFr690. BK Vision, which invests in shares of leading Swiss banks and
insurers, rose SFr80 or 4.7 per cent to SFr1,770 after it sold its Leu
shares to CS Holding.
Alusuisse, planning to buy Canada's Lawson Mardon group packaging company,
fell SFr15 to SFr515.
Holderbank, the cement producer which found strong demand last week, saw
profit-taking as its forecast of a 3.9 per cent rise in current year profits
proved at the bottom end of expectations. The shares dipped SFr11 to SFr859.
MILAN was inhibited by today's end of the monthly account and the Comit
index eased 0.90 to 545.42.
Fiat rose to an early L3,748 before easing to finish L19 lower at L3,609.
Pirelli, firmly denying market rumours that it planned a rights issue,
picked up L39 of last week's losses to finish at L1,775.
BCI, forecasting a net profit for the current year as it launched its
privatisation prospectus, added L36 to L2,253.
MADRID responded to third quarter results as the general index closed 0.85
higher at 300.89 in turnover of some Pta19.5bn. In banks, a small reduction
in nine-month profits left Central Hispano Pta50 lower at Pta3,595 while in
motors, quintupled losses at Nissan Iberica left it Pta28, or 14.6 per cent
down at Pta164.
Pryca, the supermarket retailer, rose Pta45 to Pta1,425. Its figures,
incorporating a 15 per cent gain in profits, came in after hours but Ms
Alexandra Perricone at James Capel thought that after a period of share
price weakness, the market would be satisfied with this performance.
ISTANBUL gained 4 per cent helped by easier money market rates and a calmer
political situation. The composite index was up 610.7 at 15,788.5.
Investors were also encouraged by news that the government intends to push
ahead with privatisation plans after the forthcoming party congress.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong hears a different story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in senior global markets had an uncomfortable time last week.
As measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the US performed better than
the other big blocs, with a rise of 1.4 per cent against one of just 0.1 per
cent in Europe and a fall of 0.8 per cent in Japan.
However, Wall Street's eventual gains were based on indications of economic
recovery, which left an apparent price to be paid elsewhere.
International economists and strategists now expect higher US interest
rates, sucking US investment back into the domestic bond market and away
from the foreign adventures which have given Pacific Basin, and occasionally
European equities, a high old time of it recently.
So far, so good. The US was up, Europe flat, and Japan overvalued, according
to analysts and investment managers. But that did not stop Hong Kong
advancing a further 8.7 per cent, taking its gain to 76.6 per cent so far
this year.
Mr Michael Paterson, at Asia Equity in London, says that US interest rates,
for Hong Kong, are a secondary argument. 'A sharp rise in US rates would
have some effect,' he says, 'although Hong Kong as an exporter would enjoy a
US recovery.'
However, adds Mr Paterson, the important thing about Hong Kong is that China
has had an economic revolution and that it is using Hong Kong as a financial
centre. He argues that the Hong Kong equity market, on a discount to the
world on a 1994 price/earnings ratio of 15, should actually be at a premium.
As Hong Kong rose, New Zealand fell, by about the same amount. First, the
equity market there failed to get the National government it wanted, and
expected, says Ms Pauline McAtamney at Ord Minett in London. Secondly,
delays in the outcome of voting on eight marginal seats has produced further
uncertainties, which may be resolved when the results are known tomorrow.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
by 2.3% as region advances

<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average lost 2.3 per cent on worries over political reform
negotiations, arbitrage selling and unwinding of margin positions, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index was down 418.94 at 18,074.61 after a day's high of
18,506.95 and low of 17,952.20. Volume was 280m shares, against 438m.
Weak futures prices triggered a wave of heavy arbitrage-linked selling,
which constituted one third of the volume.
Declines led gains by 833 to 208, with 123 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 26.42, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,539.65 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.43 to 1,237.71.
Traders said many investors were concerned about the prospects of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, achieving a breakthrough in political
reform talks with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. 'If the political
reform bills do not pass through the lower house in the next few days, there
will be a big delay in decision making regarding measures to boost the
economy,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Analysts also pointed to the absence of public funds, which had been the
main support for share prices until East Japan Railway was listed last
month.
Mr Makoto Takano, an analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, estimated that the
postal insurance and welfare organisation, which invests postal insurance
funds for the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, only had around
Y600bn (Dollars 5.65bn) left to invest in stocks this fiscal year to March.
If public pension fund managers were to place 5 per cent of the market
turnover per day, this would only leave 34 to 45 days worth of funds
available, he said.
JR East weakened Y16,000 to Y462,000, while NTT shed Y26,000 to Y773,000.
Railway stocks were lower, with Keisei Electric Railway dropping Y33 to
Y896.
The yen's rise to the Y105 level against the US dollar prompted selling in
export-oriented stocks. Hitachi fell Y13 to Y798 and Sony declined Y80 to
Y4,810. Toyota Motor retreated Y20 to Y1,770 and Nikon dipped Y40 to Y830.
Banks fell on arbitrage-related selling. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y50
to Y3,180 and Sakura Bank Y40 to Y1,600.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 317.78 to 20,288.58 in volume of 18.5m
shares.
Roundup
MOST of the region's markets began the week in strong form.
HONG KONG established another record close, although profit-taking trimmed
gains after the Hang Seng index breached 9,800. The index ended 32.09 higher
at 9,733.34, having peaked at 9,825.50 during the early afternoon.
The upbeat tone was set by Beijing's vow to speed market-style reform and by
hopes that the forthcoming meeting between the Chinese and US presidents
will improve links.
HK Telecom accounted for the bulk of the index's retreat, ending 40 cents
down at HKDollars 16.50, having been 20 cents ahead at one stage.
SEOUL finished at a year's high for the fourth consecutive session on the
back of an across-the-board buying spree pared only by light profit-taking.
The composite stock index added 14.07 at 810.72.
Buying interest was strong in heavily weighted financial shares and
securities houses, taking the securities sub-index 115.40 higher to
2,748.07, but expensive blue chip manufacturers faced consolidation.
TAIWAN set a new five-month closing high, helped by weekend news that the
Finance Ministry would allow a further batch of commercial banks to invest
in the market.
The weighted index advanced 57.91 to 4,329.05 in turnover of TDollars
47.5bn.
Foreign institutions were active in the electronics sector, with Acer
closing limit up at TDollars 32.10 after last week's news that it was to
raise its 1993 profits target by 25 per cent.
KARACHI was sharply higher on strong buying of blue chip stocks. The KSE
index added 16.74 at 1,717.07, its best level in 23 months.
COLOMBO retreated after the recent bull run as foreign investors were
unnerved by heavy army losses in last week's Tamil rebel raid. The all-share
index relinquished 22.18 to 895.74.
KUALA LUMPUR weakened in reaction to continued restrictions on purchases and
the lower Tokyo market. The composite index dipped 11.10 to 961.37.
SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking, leaving the Straits Times Industrial index
16.45 lower at 2,095.55.
MANILA improved, with some interest seen in oil stocks. The composite index
rose 18.19 to 2,384.89 in turnover of 1.2bn pesos.
AUSTRALIA lost a large proportion of early gains on late profit-taking and
the All Ordinaries index finished a net 8.9 up at 2,082.9. Turnover was a
thin ADollars 328.4m.
Fairfax ended 2 cents down at ADollars 3.17 ahead of announcing a 124 per
cent jump in first-quarter profits after the market had closed.
NEW ZEALAND fell back as most investors continued to await the final outcome
of last week's general election. The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 11.17 to
1,998.71.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Danes lower rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANISH central bank yesterday lowered its discount and deposit rates by
 1/4 percentage point to 6 3/4 per cent, writes Conner Middelmann.
The move is expected to be followed today by a  1/4 point cut in the
certificate of deposit rate to 7 1/2 per cent. If so, the CD rate will have
eased by 3 1/2 percentage points since August 2, when the fluctuation bands
for most currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were widened to
15 per cent.
The Danish krone has been the weakest currency in the EMS grid for some
time. However, among Europe's central banks the Danish central bank has been
among the most aggressive in taking advantage of the wider bands to ease
interest rates independently of the Bundesbank, and analysts say the process
is likely to continue amid high unem-ployment, a sluggish economy and a
relatively stable currency.
In Germany, operators are getting geared up for another drop in the rate for
securities repurchase agreements at today's allocation of 15-day
variable-rate repos.
According to a survey of German money dealers by market analysis firm MMS
International, most traders are calling for a drop in the repo rate of some
8 basis points to 6.30 per cent. Fairly comfort-able liquidity conditions
and expected drains from tax payments this week should roughly balance each
other out, so that only a very small addition to liquidity is seen,
according to MMS's analysts.
However, most traders do not expect the Bundesbank's central bank council to
cut leading interest rates at its meeting on Thursday. Instead they expect
further reductions in the bank's discount and Lombard rates in December.
The December three-month Euromark futures contract on Liffe ended at 93.92,
up 0.03 point from Friday.
In France, the central bank left money market rates unchanged at its latest
round of securities repurchase agreements, as expected. The Pibor futures
contract ended at 93.55, up 0.01 point from Friday.
UK money market conditions were stable ahead of Wed-nesday's retail price
and sales data. 'Wednesday is a bit of a watershed - it will set the tone
for the run-up to the Budget,' said a London money dealer. He added that
market hopes for a substantial rate cut accompanying the November 30 Budget
were waning.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar squeezed higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORT-squeeze pushed the dollar sharply higher against the yen in late
London trade, writes Conner Middelmann.
Following several days of slippage against the Japanese currency, the dollar
sank as low as Y105.50, where many traders had expected to see central bank
intervention in support of the US currency.
A substantial buy order from a large US bank and unsubstantiated rumours
that the US Federal Reserve was buying dollars put an abrupt halt to the
dollar's slide and caused it to rebound, hitting Y107.05 before closing at
Y106.50. In New York it ended at Y106.68.
Further buoying the dollar was a slew of strong data: capacity utilisation
at the highest level since August 1990 at 82.4 per cent, as well as strong
industrial production, business sales and inventory figures.
However, dealers say the dollar/yen exchange rate is likely to remain
volatile ahead of tomorrow's vote in the US congress over the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and Friday's meeting in Seattle between US
President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
The Nafta vote still looks a close call, and if the pact is rejected that
would hit not only the currencies of the trading partners concerned - Mexico
and Canada - but also the US dollar, since it would be seen as a major
defeat for the Clinton administration.
The weakness of the Canadian dollar prompted intervention by the Canadian
central bank, which bought Canadian dollars for US dollars around CDollars
1.3245, dealers said. The Canadian dollar closed in London around CDollars
1.3240.
The D-Mark weakened against the dollar and some European currencies on
widespread expectations of a substantial reduction in the 15-day rate for
securities repurchase agreements today. Most dealers expect the lowest
accepted repo rate to ease by 8 to 10 basis points from last week's 6.38 per
cent. The dollar closed at DM1.6900, but rose as high as DM1.6950 in late
London interbank trading. It finished New York trading at DM1.6935.
The Belgian franc received a small lift from widespread hopes that the
government is close to agreeing a new austerity package. It closed at
BFr21.35 per D-Mark, after BF21.37 on Friday.
Sterling profited from D-Mark weakness and last week's stronger than
expected trade data and ended a pfennig up at DM2.5175. Against the dollar,
it advanced modestly to Dollars 1.4895, from Dollars 1.4830 on Friday.
In Spain, a higher than expected October inflation number caused the
currency to weaken as traders feared that higher prices would lead to
tougher demands in the country's ongoing wage restraint talks. The peseta
closed at Pta81.25 to the D-Mark, after Friday's Pta80.78.
Meanwhile, the Italian lira remained beset by political worries ahead of
Sunday's municipal elections. The lira ended at L984.5 against the D-Mark,
after L979.5 on Friday.

The ALUMINIUM market led a general price fall at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday afternoon, with the three months delivery position ending after
hours trading Dollars 19 down at Dollars 1,059.50 a tonne. Dealers said the
market had opened on the defensive following its failure to breach
resistance at Dollars 1,080 a tonne on Friday and quickly lost ground under
pressure from Far East selling and trade offerings. Speculative liquidation
pushed three months COPPER towards the lower end of its recent range. Last
business was at Dollars 1,659 a tonne, down Dollars 11.50 from Friday. ZINC
prices drifted in early trading but found support below Dollars 950 a tonne
for three months metal, which ended at Dollars 952, down Dollars 3 on the
day. Three months LEAD spiked to Dollars 417 a tonne in early trading, but
profit-taking reversed the trend and although prices remained underpinned by
recent consumer interest and an analyst's report of a tightness in lead
concentrate supplies it ended at Dollars 412, up only Dollars 1 on balance.
NICKEL continued to correct from an oversold condition and the three months
price bounced away from the Dollars 4,600-a-tonne level.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch zinc plant may have to
close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDEL smelter in the Netherlands, which produces about 5 per cent of the
western world's zinc, will have to close by the middle of 1995 if no
agreement about waste storage can be reached with the Dutch authorities by
the end of this year.
The future of the smelter, which is jointly owned by Billiton, part of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, and Pasminco, the Australian resources company, is
threatened because it produces cadmium-containing hazardous waste called
jarosite.
Pasminco has revealed that attempts are being made to use low-iron zinc
concentrates (an intermediate material) - if these can be found in
sufficient quantities - to eliminate jarosite from the waste. Budel,
Pasminco and another Australian resources group, CRA, are working on this
process. The Fl 310m (USDollars 163m) already provided by Budel's
shareholders to solve the jarosite problem will probably cover the cost.
Pasminco also said it expected agreement to be reached with the Dutch
authorities about Budel's long-term survival before the year-end.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK dairy company makes premium
offer to farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN FOODS has announced that it will pay British farmers a premium of
1.2p a litre for their milk above the level set by Milk Marque when the
country's market is freed in April. Milk Marque is the voluntary farmers'
co-operative set up by the Milk Marketing Board following its abolition in
September.
The premium to be paid is higher than many farmers had expected and reflects
Northern Foods' need for a steady supply of liquid milk, which commands
higher prices than milk for processing.
'It's a very brave thing for them to do - I didn't think there was that
amount of margin in it,' said Mr Hugh Black, a dairy farmer in
Herefordshire. 'They must be prepared to lose a bit of money at first
because the margin must be fractions of pennies,' he said.
The premium contains a one-off goodwill bonus to all producers of 0.5p a
litre, which means that prices could drop slightly after the first year
under the new arrangements. The Northern Milk Partnership, which has been
set up by Northern Foods to buy milk directly from producers in the new free
market, has already signed up enough farms to supply its annual requirements
of 2bn litres. The group has 3,100 producers on its books representing 18
per cent of the UK's annual output.
Milk Marque has not yet set an official price for payment to farmers, but Mr
Andrew Dare, chief executive, has suggested that the price could rise by 2p
a litre or more above current prices of 22p a litre as supplies remain tight
in the UK market.
However, Mr Roland Williams who recently retired as director of economics at
the Milk Marketing Board, said he does not believe Milk Marque will be able
to afford to pay farmers more than 23p to 23 1/2 p in the 1994 to 1995
marketing year.
Mr Williams' comments will add to the row about pricing in the free milk
market, where farmers are hoping to see their margins improve. Mr Dare has
said consumers should not see large price increases.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uranium prices predicted to
begin recovery within two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URANIUM PRICES, at present at their lowest-ever level in real terms, should
start to recover in 18 months to two years, according to Mr Peter Wade,
managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group.
He also suggests that, although demand for iron ore is likely to pick up and
the volume of sales by Australian producers should increase in the coming
year, there was still room for a further fall in prices for ore supplied to
big Japanese customers.
Discussing the uranium market at a meeting in London with the Association of
Mining Analysts, Mr Wade pointed out that last year mines in the west and
former eastern bloc countries provided only 65 per cent of the uranium
consumed by western utilities - the material is used solely to produce
nuclear energy - and the rest was drawn from stocks.
'At the rate stocks are being depleted, they run out in 18 months to two
years,' he said.
This calculation assumed that the Commonwealth of Independent States would
continue to supply 100 per cent of its domestic market and 20 per cent of
the western market.
Free market uranium prices peaked at USDollars 45 a pound in 1978 when it
seemed oil prices were going sky high, but they have been languishing below
Dollars 10 for nearly five years. Over-optimistic predictions about nuclear
power demand contributed to a build-up of stocks at the western utilities
which brokers have been selling off. More recently, the brokers have also
had access to excess stocks in the CIS.
NBHP owns 66 per cent of Energy Resources of Australia, which operates the
Ranger mine in the Northern Territory. Mr Wade that said prices well below
production costs had forced ERA to cut back production to a level where it
was servicing only those long-term supply contracts not related to the free
market price.
To fulfil its other contracts ERA had first bought uranium from brokers but
more recently had signed a five-year supply contract with Kazakhstan. ERA
was able to ship this uranium to US customers despite the present ban on CIS
imports of the material because its contracts with American utilities
pre-dated the ban.
Mr Wade said the ban provided a clue to where uranium prices might be
heading because the US government had said limited CIS imports would be
permitted when the market price reached Dollars 13 a pound and all
restrictions would be removed at Dollars 21. He said the upper limit was
probably too high because prices between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a pound
would encourage new uranium mines to come into production.
Dealing with the iron ore negotiations, Mr Wade pointed out that NBHP was
the fourth-largest iron ore producer in the world and had a Japanese
partner, so it did not set the pace in the price negotiations with the
Japanese. Nevertheless, he felt there was room for another price cut this
year - but it would be 'a single digit' reduction, following last year's 13
per cent.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Untangling Australia's wool
problems - Industry that needs all the help it can get after a slump in
prices
</HEADLINE>

NO SOONER had Sydney corralled the Olympic Games for the year 2000, than the
cry went up: uniforms, for Australian athletes and officials, should be made
from wool.
Marketing nous, or desperation? Perhaps a bit of both - for two years after
a guaranteed pricing system for wool came to an end in Australia, the
industry needs all the help it can get. In April, the real price of wool at
auction slumped to its lowest level this century, and although matters have
improved slightly since then, the outlook is anything but rosy.
In its latest quarterly report, for example, the Australian Bureau of
Agriculture and Resource Economics forecast that average prices during the
1993-94 selling season would be below those of the previous year. Out on the
hillsides, the number of sheep shorn this year is expected to be 156m, a
12.2 per cent drop from last year.
This is no small problem. In value terms, wool is still one of Australia's
largest export categories, and Australian sheep account for 30 per cent of
the world's total wool production. The highly-fragmented industry, moreover,
comprises about 65,000 individual wool growers, who are hurting badly.
Incomes have been squeezed, and stories of bank loan defaults are rife.
The government responded to the near-crisis situation earlier this year,
when it called in Professor Ross Garnaut, from Australian National
University. In August, the Garnaut commission reported, and its
recommendations were immediately taken on board in Canberra. As a result,
legislation is passing through parliament, which - assuming no hiccups -
will further reshape the tattered industry.
The question is, will it really solve the sector's problems ?
These are basically two-fold. On the one hand, there is weak demand from
Japan and Western Europe, largely reflecting recessionary conditions. The
European Community cut imports of Australian wool by a fifth in 1992-93;
Japan, by 23 per cent. China, the largest market for Australian wool last
year, is a more complicated case. Demand has been increasing sharply, but
there are concerns that the nation's tighter economic policies - in response
to overheating - will mean that it becomes volatile in the short-term.
Chinese import duties and tariffs, meanwhile, are high, ranging up to 100
per cent. On this score, wool-growers saw some signs of progress a few weeks
ago, when talks between trade officials indicated that China might be
willing to negotiate a reduction in return for support in its application to
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The discussion generated no
concrete promises, but was, in the words of one Canberra official, 'a good
bonding session'.
But the supply and demand situation has been compounded by the presence of
the large wool stockpile - all 824,000 tonnes of it - and associated debt
that built up under the guaranteed pricing system. As the Garnaut report
noted, 'the stockpile is almost as large as Australia's expected 1993-94
wool production. . . Its presence and its sale inevitably exert downward
pressure on pricing, while generating costs in terms of storage and debt
servicing'.
In reality, sales from the stockpile over the past two years by the
Australian Wool Realisation Commission (which was set up for this purpose)
have been fairly modest - and at July 1993, the stockpile still stood at
693,000 tonnes by July 1993. Nevertheless, its very presence, and the
uncertainty surrounding the timing of sales from it, has been sufficient to
depress the already lacklustre pricing situation.
Just as the industry's problems are multifarious, so were the Garnaut
Commission's solutions. On the trade front, it was emphatic that wool,
wool-related products, textiles and garments should be fully included within
the current Uruguay round of Gatt talks and that efforts should be made
facilitate exports, both to China and to Mexico, under the planned North
American Free Trade Agreement.
On an organisational front, it suggested that the Australian Wool
Corporation and the Wool Research and Development Corporation be merged into
one statutory authority. This would concentrate solely on marketing
promotion and research, leaving matters like training to private industry.
The Australian Wool Industry Council, another statutory authority, would
cease to exist.
But by far the most controversial element of the report - and the
legislation passing through parliament - is a plan to privatise the AWRC,
under the name of Wool International.
The privatised body would have two objectives: firstly, it would develop a
range of wool-based financial mechanisms, like futures contract; and
secondly, it would administer a fixed schedule of sales from the stockpile,
retaining a balance to support its financial instruments.
None of this would happen overnight. At the outset, Wool International would
be a government-owned organisation. Shares in it would then be issued to
growers in direct proportion to stockpile levy payments between 1993-94 and
1996-97. However, by mid-1997, when the privatisation would be scheduled to
take place, the amount of wool in the stockpile should have reduced to
around 240,000 tonnes. That would be 'within the range of centralised stocks
that a smoothly functioning futures market would be able to accommodate
without disruption'.
The advantage to this plan is that it tries to turn at least part of the
stockpile into a useful plus. The downside is that Wool International must
gear up for this new activity while administering the fixed schedule of
sales, which some industry players suggest will further unsettle a market
which struggling to match supply and demand.
Some Australian wool-growers have also argued that if wool prices do not
lift, the plan may not be viable - yet responsibility for the stockpile will
have shifted to the industry, regardless.
Not least of those unhappy with the proposed set-up is the Sydney Futures
Exchange, which argues that a plausible futures market needs to be
independent of both government and suppliers.
'It's a bit like asking Opec to run an oil contract,' comments the SFE.
Not surprisingly, the SFE is attempting to revitalise its little-used,
existing wool contracts, and has been circulating a discussion document
among members. But the exchange admits that while management of the
stockpile remains uncertain and no significant forward market exists in
wool, a viable futures market is unlikely to develop. But once the fixed
stockpile sales schedule is up and running, Wool International will be in
business. 'It's a case of chicken and egg,' it says.
The Garnaut report, by contrast, suggested that there would be clear
advantages in having Wool International tackle the futures market. 'There
are. . . weaknesses on the Exchange - the absence of a capacity to make the
contracts deliverable, and some international doubts about trading in
commodities outside the main world centres,' it concluded.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market pushes towards
Pounds 1,000 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES in London broke out of a three-week stalemate yesterday and
made strong gains on the back of fresh investment fund buying in New York.
The second position March futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange
hit its highest level since July 1988, reaching an intra-day peak of Pounds
997 a tonne before closing Pounds 23 higher at Pounds 994. It had not been
above Pounds 991 during a day's trading since October 21.
The London market had been waiting to see what happened in New York last
Friday, the first notice day for physical delivery against the December
contract, which expires on December 14.
The New York market had been weak in the run-up to the notice day as it
waited for funds to get out of their positions or roll them over. But in the
event, Friday brought a notice for December delivery of a large number of
contracts by a leading trade house, reported to be Goldman Sachs. As it was
thought likely to hold on to the cocoa, thus reducing supply, this helped to
boost prices.
The London market took heart from the move early on and technical buyers
moved in when the price breached Pounds 991.
'There hasn't been any indication in the London market that people were
prepared to go short, even when New York was weak,' said one trader. 'Today
the situation got a little bit enthused. With holidays in Brazil and Ivory
Coast there was no origin selling, and there's some concern about shipments
and quality of cocoa from Ivory Coast.'
LCE Coffee futures were also firmer, encouraged by new that the Brazilian
government had bought 51,000 bags of beans (60kg each) for the export
retention stockpile at Friday's auction, bringing the total so far to 76,500
bags.
The January position closed at Dollars 1,227 a tonne, up Dollars 17.
Under the retention plan coffee producers are holding 20 per cent of their
supplies off the market. Current prices are some 22 per cent higher than
when the plan was agreed at the end of July, but they remain well below the
2 1/2 -year peaks reached in September.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries recover most of early falls
in late rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH longer-dated US Treasury securities ended the first day of the new
week in negative territory, a late rally helped prices recover most of the
earlier losses incurred in the wake of strong industrial production data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond, which had been down half a
point at one stage, was only  3/32 lower at 101 1/4 , yielding 6.152 per
cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 19/32 , to
yield 4.076 per cent.
Prices at the long end fluctuated in early trading, but turned decisively
lower mid-morning when it became clear that there would be no follow-through
from initial dealer buying. Sentiment was not helped by the news that
industrial output climbed 0.8 per cent in October.
The data was the latest to show resurgent economic growth, yet the downward
pull on prices they exerted in the morning eventually eased. By
mid-afternoon, the long end had recovered most of its losses as dealers
anticipated increased demand from municipal authorities.
GERMAN government bonds rallied following the announcement of yet more
gloomy news on the economic front. Bunds were further supported by
expectations that the Bundesbank will lower interest rates at today's repo.
The government's independent council of economic advisers, known as the Five
Wise Men, forecast zero growth in 1994 for west Germany and a further
increase in unemployment in their annual report, released yesterday morning,
which provided a good bid for the Bund market early in the trading session.
News that western German wholesale prices fell 0.2 per cent in October and
were down 0.6 per cent from a year earlier also supported Bund prices.
The market's attention is likely to be focused on the Bundesbank's repo,
with many dealers predicting that the rate will be cut by between 5 and 10
basis points. Last week, the lowest rate on the 14-day facility was 6.38 per
cent.
Mr Julian Jessop, economist at Midland Global Markets, said speculation of a
5 to 10 basis point cut was fuelled by 'the fact that call money is soft and
that the repo rate would have to come down accordingly' but he thought a 2
basis point cut more likely. Bund futures rallied from Friday's close of
99.78 to a high of 100.03, before slipping back to 99.84 by late afternoon.
THE DANISH central bank cut key interest rates by 25 basis points but the
move came late in the trading session and had little initial impact.
However, traders expect the cut to help lift prices when the market opens
today.
RUMOURS of a poor auction result pushed Italian government bonds sharply
lower yesterday afternoon, although when the final auction details were
released later on, the rumours turned out to be unfounded.
The sale of L1,500bn of 10-year paper eventually came through in line with
expectations, with the net yield falling to 7.94 per cent from 7.99 per cent
at the previous auction.
UK gilts opened on a firm note, taking their cue from other international
government bond markets, but fell back after yesterday's US economic data.
Dealers said that the market is waiting for the release of the UK PSBR
figures today and the October retail price index tomorrow for direction.
The Liffe long gilt future rose from Friday's close of 114.22 to a high of
114.30 but traded at 114.24 by late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bonds opened sharply higher on the back of Friday's
rally in the US Treasury bond market and the yen's strength, but drifted
lower during the course of the day as domestic players took profits.
Although usually a boosting factor in the government debt market,
yesterday's tumble in the Tokyo stock market - a 418.94 point fall to
18,074.61 - was largely shrugged off by the bond market.
Interest rates on three-month certificates of deposit remained low, trading
at 3.32 per cent, while the call rate edged up to 3 5/8 per cent, which
dealers said reflected the fact that this was the end of the reserve period
for the Bank of Japan.
Expectations in the markets are high that the prime minister will propose
income tax cuts of between Y5,000bn and Y6,000bn later this week, to be
financed by short-term bridging bonds.
The March futures contract, which opened at 114.39 after Friday's close of
114.19, fell to a low of 114.12 and ended Tokyo trading at 114.15.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Austria 30-year deal further widens
German maturity range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Austria further extended the maturity profile of the German
bond market yesterday when it raised DM1.5bn through an issue of 30-year
Eurobonds.
Austria's 30-year issue is part of a process which was started in August by
LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance when it launched the first offering of 15-year
bonds in the D-Mark sector. The issue raised DM1bn but was increased by
DM500m shortly afterwards to satisfy investor demand.
Syndicate managers said that Austria's offering was well received by the
market, which raised hopes that the German government and other highly-rated
borrowers would follow suit.
In 1986, Germany's low inflation rate prompted its government to issue two
DM1bn offerings of 30-year bonds. However, they became illiquid as changed
market conditions dissuaded the government from issuing more 30-year bonds.
Due to the lack of benchmark German government bonds beyond 10 years, yield
spreads in the Dutch government bond market are used in the pricing of
long-dated D-Mark Eurobonds.
Lead manager Deutsche Bank said 30-year Dutch government bonds were yielding
56 to 59 basis points more than 10-year Dutch government bonds. In addition,
Austria's D-Mark Eurobonds were yielding 8 to 10 basis points more than
German government bonds.
Therefore, Austria's 30-year Eurobonds will be priced today to yield 65 to
68 basis points over the German government's 6 per cent bond due 2003.
Istituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's state industrial holding company,
will launch its well-flagged Dollars 500m offering of five-year Eurobonds
today. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield 37 - 40 basis points over
US Treasuries.
Cable &amp; Wireless is expected to raise Dollars 400m early next week through
an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The issuer is well-known among investors and
although unrated, it is perceived as being double-A risk. However, the yield
spread on the bonds will also reflect C&amp;W's exposure to Hong Kong.
China Textile Machinery is due to launch a SFr35m five-year convertible bond
offering today, the first by a Chinese company listed in mainland China.
China Textile, which is 50 per cent state-owned, is listed in Shanghai. The
bonds, which carry a three-year put option, will be convertible into China
Textile's B shares. They are likely to have a conversion premium of between
5 and 10 per cent and a coupon of between 1 and 2 per cent. If the put
option is exercised the bonds will yield around 4 per cent.
Hanson plc has launched two commercial paper programmes, one for Dollars 2bn
in the European market and the other for ADollars 400m. Drawings under the
Australian programme will reduce the amount available under the European
programme.
