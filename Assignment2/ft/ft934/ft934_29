FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (16): Passengers would rather go
to sleep - Airline service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS said that there are four kinds of airline service: the amiability of a
Qantas or Virgin Atlantic, the formality of a British Airways or Lufthansa,
the deference of a Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific and the surliness of
just about any US domestic carrier.
The comparisons are, of course, slightly unfair. The US domestic market is
dominated by bruising price wars. The drive to save a few more dollars on
the ticket cuts the numbers and wages of cabin crew. Add to that the damage
to morale engendered by an airline on the verge of bankruptcy, and it is
easy to sympathise. In theory.
In practice, the business traveller has got plenty on his or her mind, too:
it is a rare employer who is prepared to spend thousands of pounds sending
someone on a trip without demanding rapid and concrete results.
More than that, the airline will have in its charge a more demanding
customer than in recent years. He or she is a survivor of corporate
cost-cutting, someone who is probably overworked for whom a few hours on
board an aircraft should be a haven of peace, an opportunity to recharge the
batteries.
The job of the airline, then, is to deliver passengers to their destination
in as good as, or better, condition than it took them on board.
It is a task that can involve everything from the meal menu to headphones
and how staff deal with a complaint. But according to Mr Chris Lane,
chairman of management consultancy TMI, many airlines' response to this
imperative is to pile on the techno-gadgets. From seatback televisions
offering eight tracks of entertainment to check-in by mobile telephone
before you get to the airport, the business passenger is regaled with
technology.
Yet the real struggle that faces the airlines, says Mr Lane, is how to
improve the 'soft' aspects of service. How do they make the customer feel
like an individual, create a relaxed yet reassuring atmosphere, and deal
with complaints and mishaps?
Ms Sue Moore, BA's general manager, relationship marketing, agrees: 'The
core of being different in the airline business is customer service.'
Such sentiments are easy to proclaim and difficult to realise: it is simple
to install a new piece of hardware, much trickier to find a way to delight
the passenger with the human touch.
One method being introduced by BA is its decision to allow non-cash
compensations for delayed passengers. Ground staff now have the authority to
send flowers or wine to a passenger's spouse if a delay means that an
anniversary celebration is missed.
As well as being a winning way with passengers, the strategy is
cost-effective, says Ms Moore. 'They are low value items compared with
paying cash compensation.'
The idea came from BA's programme of consultation with managers and
customers.
The airline holds seminars to which members of its Executive Club, the
frequent flyer programme, are invited. The seminars have produced most of
the service changes at BA in the last 18 months.
These include the sleeper service in which passengers on a short overnight
flight of less than nine hours can be fed on the ground to maximise the time
they have to sleep. The idea has already been copied by other airlines.
Another result of the seminars, BA's Well-Being In The Air programme, has
also been copied. It is a health regime that suggests exercises for
passengers while they travel and offers menus of low fat, high-fibre foods.
An awareness of health issues has spilled over into the centrepiece of
airborne service: catering. Most large carriers now offer light meals as
well as the more traditional rich meats and cheeses.
But sometimes the emphasis on health can go too far, as at United Airlines,
the second biggest US carrier. 'Last year we went heavily into earthy foods
like lentils and beans,' says Mr Len Sacchitello, manager of worldwide
catering at United. 'This time around, we are hearing from flight attendants
and direct calls from customers that these ingredients don't belong in the
first-class cabin.'
The speed of response at United to such complaints has improved in the last
two years through computerisation of 'flight attendant feedback', says Mr
Sacchitello. Flight attendants can record customer requests or complaints on
computer terminals when the aircraft lands.
The scheme has already led to the English tea service - including scones and
clotted cream - being extended from first and business class to economy on
its US-bound flights from the UK.
But passenger feedback can produce different findings in different carriers.
United remains resolutely formal in first class. When menus are proposed by
the airline's consultant chefs, for example, cabin crew representatives
still test them to decide whether they can be distributed by 'silver
service', someone holding a fork and a spoon in one hand.
Other airlines eschew such formalities. Virgin Atlantic says that crews are
encouraged to express their personalities, to respond appropriately to
different kinds of passenger. The idea is to generate a sensation of
personal attention for the passenger. It is a strategy that has led to the
employment of eight beauty therapists who travel on many flights between
London and New York and Los Angeles.
The airlines lay great store in these niceties of service. But does does the
regular business traveller take much notice? A survey published last week by
Official Airlines Guides, a publisher of airline timetables, gives
conflicting evidence.
Among business travellers, it says, eating is the second most popular
pastime on a long-haul flight.
But it is beaten in the popularity stakes by the desire for a good, long
sleep.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (15): Rules of the frequent
flyers' game - The points are an important weapon in the airlines' armoury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE so many frequent flyer programmes (FFPs) on offer to the airline
passenger that it is easy to get the impression that carriers are falling
over themselves to give away free flights in an effort to drum up business.
In practice, some airlines are more generous than others and how much you
gain from buying a ticket will also depend on where you live and what time
of year it is.
An address in the US will confer more points-earning power than one in
Europe or Asia. A US resident can earn rewards from frequent flyer schemes
on just about any ticket, even at deeply discounted prices. The rest of the
world usually has to buy a full-price ticket to benefit. A BA passenger
living in the US who buys a discounted economy fare ticket from San
Francisco to London, for example, will earn FFP points. The buyer of the
same-priced ticket bought by a UK resident flying from London to San
Francisco will not.
The reason for the discrepancy lies in the history and evolution of FFPs.
They were born and raised in the US during the 1980s as a means of creating
and maintaining loyalty to a single airline or group of airlines.
The principle is that the buyer of a ticket earns points which can be
accumulated and eventually exchanged for free flights or other benefits.
Over the last decade, airlines have joined forces with other companies in
the travel industry and points can now be earned by staying in hotels, using
car rental firms, and buying things with certain credit cards. The awards
can include upgrades to business or first class on aircraft, holiday
weekends and even hot-air balloon trips.
The scope of FFPs has been extended to help airlines fill aircraft at slack
times.
For most of the 1980s, airlines outside the US watched the growth of FFPs
with a mixture of disdain and fear. There was disdain because they seemed to
be a fad unconnected with service quality and more associated with
savings-stamp schemes once used to persuade motorists to buy petrol. But
there was also fear because the US airlines were both demonstrating the
effectiveness of the schemes and racking up huge liabilities in flights owed
to passengers.
When, in the 1990s, European and Asian carriers were finally forced into the
game, they changed the rules to limit the give-aways: hence the variety of
schemes under which tickets can earn points.
Logic, as well as fear, prompted the rule changes. The goal for any airline
is to attract the regular business passenger, not the penny- pinching
leisure traveller who flies once a year.
FFPs have shown themselves to be effective in capturing business traffic.
This month's survey by Official Airline Guides of European business
travellers shows that 70 per cent said that, given a choice of carriers on a
route, they would choose the one to which their FFP belonged. UK residents
were the most swayed, with 74 per cent saying it would determine their
choice.
But the leisure traveller is at least as much swayed by simple price
discounting, argue the airlines.
'It is not commercially viable to offer miles on the low cost fares. It is
not worth doing it if it can possibly be avoided,' says Ms Sue Moore, BA's
general manager, relationship marketing. Cut-throat competition pushed US
carriers into using FFPs to compete even for discount ticket sales and BA
has reluctantly joined in for the US market.
Late arrivals in the FFP business such as BA, Air France and Lufthansa have
also improved on the US experience by imposing deadlines for the time by
which accumulated points must be cashed in. This once again favours frequent
travellers, who fly often enough to earn free flights quickly.
By targeting the FFPs at regular business customers, the airlines have
generated some useful spin-offs.
Members of FFPs have their flying habits tracked. The more a passenger
spends with a particular airline, the more the passenger is likely to be the
target of marketing drives and market research.
British Airways, for example, has four levels of frequent flyer membership.
New recruits are at the blue level, with a few benefits such as priority on
a waiting list for overbooked aircraft. The next two levels are silver and
gold, which provide higher waiting list priorities, access to executive
lounges and free travel insurance, for example.
At the top is a select group of about 1,000 holders of a blue-grey card who
include BA's most important cus- tomers: chairmen, chief executives and
finance direc- tors responsible for spending at least Pounds 1m a year with
BA.
They have all the benefits of a gold-tier member plus the option of being
met at airports and personally ushered through the airport. Customer service
staff single them out for individual attention.
The FFP is now one of the most important weapons in the airlines' armoury.
There are tens of millions of FFP members in the US alone. Those numbers
seem destined to grow further and rapidly over the next few years as
European and Asian carriers join in. If FFPs are a fad, it will be a long
time before they are seen as passe.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (14): The class that counts in the
air - Some airlines offer more than others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NOT ALL business classes are the same. But their differences are as much a
matter of style and temperament as facts and figures.
The airlines that offer a door-to-terminal limousine service, for example,
are often not the same as those which have their own airport lounges.
The reason is simple: big carriers such as British Airways simply have too
many business class passengers to offer a free limousine service to them
all. Small carriers, or those which may use an airport once or twice a day,
find it more economic to offer a limousine service than a lounge. Cathay
Pacific will drop you at your door within 40 miles of Heathrow without
charge, but it does not have an executive lounge at the airport.
For business passengers who care to choose their airlines carefully, at
least seven features should be take into account when choosing a carrier.
Flight frequency. The business traveller needs to know that if that last
meeting day grinds on or the traffic on the Peripherique is locked solid,
there will be another flight home later.
Most airlines will accept another carrier's ticket, but it should really be
a last resort as you may have to wait at a ticket desk, pay extra and
probably lose your frequent flyer benefit.
Seat pitch. The distance between the back of one seat and the back of the
next one forward can make a significant difference to comfort on long-haul
routes, especially for tall passengers.
Most business classes, such as those on British Airways, American Airlines
and Lufthansa, the German carrier, plump for a 40-inch seat pitch in
long-haul aircraft. Air France and KLM, the Dutch airline, however, offer 38
inches or less.
On some carriers, the pitch varies between aircraft. Swissair's A310
aircraft have 36-inch seat pitches in business class, but 40 inches in
Boeing 747s.
The business classes that are impossible to beat are those on carriers that
sell first-class seat pitches - 55-60 inches - to business class ticket
holders. The best known of these are Virgin Atlantic and Continental, the US
carrier, on long haul services. But look out for Lauda air, the independent
Austrian carrier run by former world champion racing driver Niki Lauda, and
Eva Air, the Taiwanese carrier. Both fly between Europe and south-east Asia,
and Eva has links to the US, too.
Eva has a particularly unusual philosophy: it has a four-class aircraft. The
upper deck contains first and business class, and the front of the lower
deck has super economy, with seat leg-rests and some other features normally
associated with business class. The idea is to appeal to the
budget-conscious business traveller.
Seat width. This is important for more than just the wider passengers. A
narrow seat may feel comfortable for the first hour or two. But, as seasoned
flyers know, finding another comfortable position may be hard work.
Seat width depends as much on the aircraft type as the carrier. Seventeen
inches is a typical economy seat width, 19 inches in business and 20 or more
in first class. But if you are flying from Europe to south-east Asia, SAS
business class seats on its Boeing 767 are only 18 inches across; on Thai,
they are 21 inches across.
Airport lounges are inc- reasingly becoming business tools, places in which
reading, writing, phoning and faxing can be done in relative comfort. Their
importance is redoubled if you have a connecting flight and need to stay in
an airport for several hours, or if your business meeting can be conducted
at the airport.
The best lounges tend to be at an airline's main airport. There are four
British Airways lounges at Heathrow's terminal four alone. But business
class flyers going from Taiwan to Hong Kong will find that a BA ticket will
get them an old sofa in a dingy room by the public canteen at Taipei's
Chiang Kai Shek airport. If you have a ticket with China Airlines Inter-
national, one of Taiwan's carriers, your lounge would grace any European
airport.
Some carriers will only offer lounges to first class passengers or
registered frequent flyers, as with Lufthansa at New York's JFK and Air
France at San Francisco.
Much of this is irrelevant to business travellers who fly economy,
especially on short-haul routes. Their choices are usually limited to any
privileges conferred by membership of an airlines executive club.
Others using London's Heathrow may prefer to pay a Pounds 50 a year
subscription to UK travel agent Thomas Cook to use its new business centre
at the airport. Travellers on a budget can make use of the usual business
class lounge facilities such as conference room, secretarial support and
showers.
Limousines are as much for the good of the airline as the passenger. The
sales pitch may be door-to-door service, but once the carrier has you on
board its car, it knows you are going to turn up for the flight, that you
will be on time and that you will almost certainly not switch to another
carrier. No wonder that just about every long-haul airline flying out of
Heathrow offers it.
The exception, British Airways, goes some way to making up the gap for
passengers bound for New York by giving away helicopter transfers to
Manhattan for both first and business class carriers. Air France does the
same for flights from Paris to JFK. And remember: if you are really in a
hurry to get to the Big Apple, the Air France Concorde supersonic aircraft
arrives in New York before BA's.
Separate check-in and priority luggage handling. Essential tools for the
executive short of time, separate check-in counters and fast luggage reclaim
are standard with most airlines.
A few exceptions include: no priority luggage handling on BA's short haul
routes or any SAS routes.
Airport convenience. City centre airports may be irrelevant for the
executive who goes straight to the departure gate from verdant suburbia, but
arriving at the other end with an easy transfer downtown can be a boon. For
this reason, London's City airport is more popular with incoming executives
than their London-based competitors.
The US is the home of the convenient airport: visitors to the Bay area of
northern California, for example, can choose from San Jose, Oakland and San
Francisco Inter- national. Oakland is the closest to San Francisco's
financial district.
At the other end of the state, you can choose to arrive at LA International,
Orange County (for Disneyland), Long Beach and several others.
Taking such considerations seriously may cost you more money for your
ticket. But many passengers find that it is worth the extra. The airlines
recognise the selling power of factors such as flight fre- quency and
lounges. Expect them to step up their sales campaigns as economic recovery
takes hold.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (12): How to lounge in luxury - A
look at facilities available on the ground for those awaiting departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR THE ordinary airline passenger, the airport departure lounge is often a
dismal torture. But the business traveller can get away from all that.
Instead of noisy milling crowds and long queues, he or she can enjoy a
dizzying array of services ranging from the exotic - relaxing massages to
ease that tension - to the practical, such as access to high-tech office
equipment for those who still have work in mind.
Business passengers can now sit in the cloistered calm of their very own
lounges. Some of them will have access to special queue-beating Fast Track
systems designed to get them on their flights as quickly as possible.
One of these systems for first-class and business passengers is now being
used by more than 65,000 travellers a month at Gatwick Airport, London, with
60 per cent of them citing it as a significant factor in their choice of
airport.
At Gatwick it offers a dedicated security channel and passport control as
well as priority desks at Thomas Cook and Travelex bureaux de change for
picking up previously ordered foreign currency. There is even a special till
at duty free.
Similar Fast Track facilities are operated by a number of airlines -
including Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada and Air Malta at Heathrow Airport,
London. KLM, the Dutch airline has its own check-in systems in place,
designed to speed up the process.
Mr Barry Evans, KLM deputy marketing director, UK and Ireland, says: 'We
hope to keep the queueing time and length down for the business traveller.
The high frequency flyer, particularly in Europe, wants to make the time
spent as short as possible with later check-in or gate check-in.
'It has been said that if you run a perfect operation the traveller can't
remember who he flew with] The aim is to make air travel smooth, effortless
and memorable.'
At its home base at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, KLM has two business class
lounges which between them cater for more than 300 passengers. Personal
computers, printers, fax machines and access to car rental and rest and
business areas are provided.
Last autumn, KLM opened a Pounds 500,000 business class lounge at Heathrow
which offers a business area, including fax and telephones and complimentary
refreshments, and accommodates 95 passengers.
'Business users provide one third of our total revenue. This is important
traffic which is vigorously competed for,' says Mr Evans. He adds that the
business customer is looking for value for money and a difference between
economy and business class.
In Germany, the Frankfurt Airport Centre, directly connected to the terminal
departures level, offers a variety of services for business travellers.
Besides Airport Club Frankfurt, a business club for members and their guests
and the Airport Business Centre, there is the Airport Conference Centre,
which has equipment for live TV and radio broadcasts, a simultaneous
interpretation system and facilities for worldwide conferences via
satellite.
At New York's Kennedy Airport, individual airlines operate their own
business lounges which provide facilities enabling the passenger to get on
with some work or to relax.
Claiming to be the largest operators at Kennedy, Heathrow and Gatwick,
Travelex foreign currency services offer airmiles on currency transactions
to British Airways Executive Club and Latitude card holders.
Travelex operates a system which almost amounts to having currency on spend
or return. Customers exchanging Pounds 300 or more can change back up to 30
per cent at the same exchange rate, commission free, for a month after the
original transaction.
At Heathrow Airport, Virgin Atlantic has opened what could be described as
the ultimate in lounges for the Upper Class (business class) traveller - the
Pounds 1m Virgin Clubhouse at Terminal 3.
The accent is on luxury and there is something for just about everyone.
Facilities include a health spa and pre-flight grooming salon offering
massage and aromatherapy, a library with over 5,000 books, a
timber-panelled, acoustically isolated music room and a study featuring mini
offices with state-of-the-art technology for those who feel the need to do
some work.
Mr Stephen Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's marketing director, says that business
travellers in revenue terms are very significant in what overall is a
phenomenally competitive market.
He adds: 'We are pushing the envelope all the time to provide a total travel
experience  .. to influence and control the passenger situation from the
time they book the ticket at home to the time they get back.'
Over at Birmingham International Airport, the Pounds 60m terminal Eurohub
has business facilities, including the opportunity to use secretarial
services. Passengers with just hand baggage can also check in at either the
concourse, ticket and information desks or the departure gate.
Ms Sheila Lashford, Birmingham Airport's head of external relations, says:
'Eurohub is principally for business travellers and was designed with them
in mind. The check-in time is around 35 minutes and the longest distance you
have to walk is 250 metres.
'The business person wants everything to be smooth; he or she wants to
develop tunnel vision, to take a path through the airport onto the flight.
However, he or she still wants goods of a specific quality and amenities. A
cup of coffee has to be good coffee, so we have to cater for all that.'
At Heathrow a new Business Centre run by Thomas Cook has opened in the
Queens Building between Terminals 1 and 2. It has a members' lounge and
facilities include telex and workstations. There is even the opportunity to
take a shower before you leave.
British Airways has opened the doors of three new departure lounges for
premium passengers at Heathrow's Terminal 4.
Mr Michael Batt, British Airways director of marketing, says of the new
'lounge pavilion': 'Business travellers are looking for speed, space and
support to do business. They have to deliver and we have to be in the
position where we help them deliver.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (11): Safety first is best advice
abroad - Jim Kelly gives some hints on how to cope with a growing problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD ADVICE on personal safety can do a lot for the average business
traveller: it can preserve your health, save you money and protect your
deal. And in rare circumstances, it can save your life.
'One of our executives was involved in a hijack and found himself
confronting a terrorist,' recalls the head of security at a global
multinational.
'Later he told me: 'I suddenly remembered what you had said. The words DON'T
STARE HIM OUT flashed before me. I dropped my eyes'.'
For most business travellers the dangers are more mundane - and so is the
advice. The same security expert who trained his executive in how to handle
a violent hijacker has some more earthy advice for those travelling abroad.
'I tell them to behave as if they are on holiday with their bank manager,
their doctor, their boss and their mother-in-law.' That advice, modified by
the fact that 23 per cent of all business travellers are women, boils down
to a plea for normal behaviour.
But normal behaviour is not always enough. Here is a checklist of useful
hints. But every trip is different, so think about problems that may arise
and take advice before setting out.
Dress down. If you don't need a business suit, then don't take one.
Don't travel with company logos emblazoned on your briefcases, etc.
If finance allows, stay on the executive floor if the hotel has one.
Go for an hotel with valet parking and card keys.
On-site restaurants may be useful in some cities.
Never hang a 'Please clean my room' sign on the door]
Be guided on airlines. Think about regional tensions. If in doubt, take the
national carrier out of any country with internal problems.
Try to take direct flights.
Don't wear conspicuous jewellery, watches, etc.
If you are really worried, shop around and find a business travel agent with
a 'meet and greet' service.
Be guided by your host. At least, give yourself time to become acclimatised
before any adventurous outings.
Learn something about local customs. Try to find out specific areas of
national reverence, both religious and political.
Find out if taxis hailed in the street are safe. It may be better to get one
from an hotel.
Try to avoid taking close-up pictures of people without their consent.
Read about your destination, especially in up-to-date newspaper coverage,
prior to the visit.
Do not discuss your travel plans with strangers.
When travelling to a new country for the first time, it is extremely helpful
to get some kind of briefing on the kind of environment in which you are
likely to have to do business.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office publishes 'Dos and Don'ts' on many
countries. It also gives verbal briefings on request - these may be over the
telephone or in person - although the Department of Trade and Industry also
gives advice on doing business abroad.
The US government also has an information system which is normally
restricted to its own citizens. However, the State Department's Citizens'
Emergency Centre in Washington is open to all callers and producers Travel
Info Sheets on every country in the world.
This service can be accessed by ringing Washington 647 5225. (Beware: to
trigger the correct sheet the first four letters of the country must be
punched out on a digital phone. On US phones ABC = 2 and so on, until PQRS =
7, TUV = 8, and WXYZ = 9). Both the Foreign Office and the US State
Department information is regularly updated.
You can, of course, pay for security advice. The Control Risks Group has an
information services division which publishes a Travel Security Guide,
available on screen as well as in hard copy. It grades various destinations
by safety category and tailors advice for the traveller.
On the principle that information improves security, up-to-date guide books
on the country of destination are helpful. More practically, considering the
pressures on the average executive, an airport guide is the best way of
getting off on the right foot. Thomas Cook's Airports Guide International is
a good example: with plenty of information on hotel services, road and rail
links. Pan Books' The Flier's Handbook is good for the regular traveller.
The most difficult task facing a business traveller on a trip to a strange
country is the need to keep a sense of proportion. On the day after the Gulf
War started, for example, some internal European flights were almost empty.
Some locations reach world attention through headline stories which do not
reflect everyday working life. In contrast, dangerous destinations can
appear innocuous.
The recent incidence of lethal attacks in Florida, for example, should be
seen against the fact that living there is still more dangerous than
visiting the state. In 1992 1.8 per cent of all homicide victims were
foreigners.
As a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office points out, the
number of business travellers mugged each year abroad is 'very few'. Last
year Britons made 31m visits overseas and there were 25 reported homicides.
Part of the problem for many business travellers from Europe and North
America is that they are often moving from a 'low crime' environment into a
'high crime' one. Because businessmen are usually well-insured and will
probably want to return home promptly, crimes in which they are the victims
are less often resolved that those concerning other tourists since the key
witness may already be out of the country when the criminal is caught.
There is a marked trend among business travel agents towards 'partnership'
with the client company and this can only improve the services offered to
travellers on arrival at their destination. A good example is Wagons-lits
Travel which offers a 'meet and greet' service in Lagos and Moscow: and in
the latter a taxi service with security cleared drivers.
In the travel trade generally there is agreement that more travel
information is needed. Who provides it is a more difficult question. Many
travel agents and airlines are wary about giving advice: they fear legal
liability either by omitting key information or including out-of-date or
faulty advice.
Business Travel World, the new trade magazine, recently canvassed the views
of agents about the updating of safety information and the responsibility
for providing it. The magazine concluded: 'Comments tend to reveal that
agents in continental Europe are more anxious for action than are their
counterparts in the UK.'
For example Mr Jan Van Steen, of BBL Travel, Brussels, secretary of the
Belgian Guild of European Business Travel Agents, says: 'It's not enough to
read all the newspapers. On a national and international level, more exact
information is needed.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (13): Hand luggage is really all
you need - Traveller's Tale / Adele Biss talks to Michael Skapinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER

<TEXT>
AS SOMEONE who began her business career in the 1960s taking coach-loads of
tourists around Europe, travel has long been part of Ms Adele Biss's working
life.
Her subsequent career in public relations was largely spent representing
companies in the tourist industry and travelling on their behalf.
Her appointment as chairman of the British Tourist Authority last May has
made one important difference to the way she travels: she no longer has to
find her own way to hotels in foreign cities.
There is always a local representative of the authority at the airport to
meet her. She does not have to search for a piece of cardboard with her name
on it; her photograph has been widely circulated since her appointment and
staff usually recognise her.
'It's tremendous to see a welcoming face,' she says. 'The first thing they
do is take my luggage off me.' Before she was appointed to her current job,
she says, 'one of the worst things was to arrive in a city and wonder how I
would get to the centre. It's uncomfortable coming tired off a flight and
getting into a taxi whose driver doesn't speak English, even sometimes when
it's in an English-speaking country.
Heading the drive to attract tourists to the UK involves constant travel.
'It's Jo'burg one week, Cumbria the next,' she says. She makes a business
trip, either in the UK or abroad, every 10 days or so.
Although, as head of a tourist authority, sightseeing is part of her job,
she tries to keep to a minimum the number of days she is away from home.
'I'm normally travelling alone and it's time away from my family,' she says.
Like many veteran travellers, Ms Biss keeps her luggage to a minimum. A
priority of many business travellers is to avoid waiting at the baggage
carousel to see if your suitcase has successfully completed the same journey
you have.
Ms Biss says: 'I can travel for a long time on hand luggage. The trick if
you are a woman is non-crease, light fabrics. I take a suit with different
blouses, so that the bulk is in the suit and the variety is in the blouses.'
Airports and hotels do not help women travellers much with their clothing,
she says. There is usually an airport shop selling ties. Shops selling
tights are far less common.
Ms Biss says airlines have become better at looking after women travellers.
She tries to travel on a UK carrier, which means she usually flies British
Airways. 'They're quick to help with your bags and I like the fact that most
of the cabin crews are mixed male and female.'
Most hotels do not know how to look after women travellers, she says. 'There
are the usual problems like being shown to a lousy seat in a restaurant.
'But I don't think the biggest problem business- women face when they travel
is security or loneliness. It's having to keep up appearances. We need to
able to get sewing kits. We need to be able to have a shampoo and a blow dry
before a 9.30 am appointment.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (10): Space: the final frontier to
cross - Airline comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE LOOKING at a photograph of airliner cabins in the old days might be
forgiven for thinking that life had improved little.
When the Boeing 314 flying boat was in its heyday, passengers ate at dining
tables and could stand up without hitting their heads on overhead luggage
bins.
Today, business class passengers on short-haul flights are likely to find
themselves crammed into space more normally associated with public buses.
Even on long-haul flights, buyers of tickets that cost thousands of pounds
are forced to catnap in seats that seem to be designed so that only one
position is comfortable. No wonder that British Airways' new arrivals lounge
at Heathrow - where incoming travellers can have their clothes pressed - is
so popular.
The days of cruise liner service and space may have gone. But there are
still some real differences in cabin comfort to be found between airlines.
Regular surveys of business travellers by the International Air Transport
Association (Iata) show that what passengers really want is space.
Some airlines have taken rapid advantage of this. Virgin, Continental of the
US and Eva Air of Taiwan already make a selling point out of offering more
leg-room.
Virgin and Continental have fitted first-class seats but sold them at
business class prices. They recoup some of the lost revenue by dispensing
with the more overt luxuries that other carriers give to first-class
passengers: there are no second helpings of Beluga caviar or Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild on Virgin or Continental.
Eva has extended this principle to the economy passengers, who have the kind
of extending leg-rests that other carriers fit only in business and first
class.
But there is a limit to what manufacturers can do within the dimensions of a
single aircraft type. Aircraft manufacturers recognise this, and the launch
of a new model gives them an opportunity to add space as well as increase
range and fuel efficiency.
The likes of Airbus and Boeing have introduced models which are simply
bigger than their older rivals.
The Airbus A320 competes directly with the Boeing 737 for short-haul markets
such as Western Europe, south-east Asia and domestic US. Designed in the
1980s, the A320's passenger cabin is 25 centimetres wider than the 737's and
9cm higher.
This allows airlines to carry the same number of passengers but to put them
in wider seats with more headroom. It is one of the factors behind the
success of Airbus and hence Boeing's Dollars 1.5bn plan to upgrade the 737.
But Boeing's main hope for the 1990s is the long-haul 777, scheduled to
enter service in 1995.
The 777 will be able to carry over 300 passengers - less than the 747 but
more than the 767. It will be a twin-engined alternative to the new
four-engined Airbus A340.
Boeing has made passenger comfort a big selling point for the 777 as it
tries to persuade cash-strapped airlines to commit themselves to buying the
new model.
One significant change is that the cabin floor is lower in the fuselage than
previous models. This has two effects on passenger space: window-seat
passengers have more headroom because the ceiling begins to curve over their
heads at a greater height above the seat, while aisle passengers have more
headroom because the stowage bins are set higher.
Boeing argues that extra headroom all-round also gives passengers the
impression that there is more seat room in the 777 than there is in a 747
Jumbo jet, even though there is not.
Impressions are important in attracting the business traveller. And that
most elusive of incentives to fly with a particular airline - the feeling of
a pleasant surprise - should be at the top of the list of priorities when
airlines serve the jaded business class passenger, says Mr Chris Lane,
chairman of airline consultancy, TMI.
He attacks the thinking behind the technological tricks now on offer.
Seatback videos are already spilling from first into business class cabins.
There are satellite links for telephones and faxes on Singapore Airlines,
live broadcasts from BBC world service radio on Cathay Pacific, with the
promise of live television to come. Next year should see video screen with
computer keyboards attached.
Virgin Atlantic, having already offered a masseuse to business class
passengers, says it now wants to introduce gambling in the skies.
The carriers' idea is not only to take away the tedium of flying, but also
to distinguish it from its rivals.
But these changes at best satisfy the business passenger and rarely delight
them, argues Mr Lane. What is innovative now can be humdrum in six months'
time.
Airlines may be beginning to recognise this. Three years ago, Japan Air
Lines set its engineers the task of dreaming about a future aircraft cabin.
The result was a series of proposed engineering marvels including adjustable
headrests with built-in speakers, seats that could be adjusted vertically
and width-wise, computerised ordering of drinks ('enhanced with
photographs') from the seat and even videos of soothing landscapes.
Now the scheme, called Romantech for romantic technology, has been shelved
indefinitely.
JAL is not alone in reconsidering heavy investment in passenger gadgetry,
given the questions being asked by airlines executives. Can such
discretionary spending be justified during the airline industry's biggest
recession for almost 50 years? Is it clear which of the changes would pay
back the investment through a greater number of passengers paying higher
ticket prices? Perhaps most importantly: why not eliminate risk by waiting
to see which innovations work for a rival and then simply copy them?
And therein lies the attraction of newer models of aircraft such as the A320
and Boeing 777. Not only do business passengers value the extra space, but
aircraft purchase programmes cannot be undertaken as lightly as a cabin
refurbishment: it can take years, and billions of dollars, for a competitor
to catch up.
Of course, buying a new model of aircraft is an expensive way of creating a
better product. But it is a step that can be taken by large and relatively
financially healthy carriers that are already winning the race for the
business traveller's heart and wallet.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (8): Head east for value and
comfort - Gillian Upton offers practical advice for getting around in
south-east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN UPTON

<DATELINE>
   BY THE year 2000 the gross domestic product of south-east Asia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from Japan to Indonesia - will equal that of the US and total about
four-fifths that of the European Community. No one doubts the might of the
region even now, as western businesses shift their focus of operation
eastward in an effort to tap rich opportunities.
Culturally, it is a colourful area in which to do business. Most Asian
nations practise their own brand of capitalism which is a mix of industrial
policy and freewheeling competition. But it is also a corrupt continent.
Corruption is endemic except for one nation, Singapore. It is probably at
its worst in China and Vietnam.
In terms of creature comforts, however, only superlatives will do. Hotel
accommodation in the region is among the best in the world and offers far
better value for money than Europe due to its much lower labour costs. The
exceptions to this rule are the emerging nations - Laos, Myanmar (formerly
Burma), Cambodia, Vietnam and parts of China - and here you will need
guidance.
Domestic flights within these embryonic countries still leave a lot to be
desired, but western joint ventures will lessen the discomfort and danger in
time. What is absolutely essential is flight reconfirmation as overbooking
is rife; do it as soon as you enter the country.
Brushes with chicanery are most commonly found with taxi drivers in Vietnam
and Cambodia but less so in China. In Hanoi, it is common practice to
overcharge the foreigner who seeks a ride downtown in one of the minivans
that sometimes double as taxis; in effect, the foreigner pays for all the
locals who squeeze in after him.
It is a safe bet to halve whatever figure is suggested. The hour-long
journey to downtown Hanoi should not exceed Dollars 15 but be warned that it
will usually be in ancient and non-airconditioned vehicles. In Ho Chi Minh
City, by contrast, taxis are usually modern, Japanese cars but the much
shorter distance - just 4 1/2 miles - will still cost Dollars 10, but no
more.
Getting around in either the federal or commercial capital is by taxi or
cyclo (bicycle taxi) but the latter are not really practical if you want to
turn up at an appointment in suitable condition as they take the many
potholes particularly badly. And attempts by the drivers to keep you dry
during the frequent heavy rainstorms are usually pointless.
Staying in Hanoi, Vietnam's federal capital, is usually necessary on a
business trip in order to get licences, contracts and the like
rubber-stamped. The choice is easy as only one hotel is up to western
standards. The Metropole is managed by the French-owned Pullman chain; it
offers western facilities such as direct dial telephone, air-conditioning,
satellite TV channels, in-house videos, mini-bar, laundry and dry cleaning
and a swimming pool. Rates start at Dollars 130. The hotel also offers an
airport shuttle bus.
In Ho Chi Minh City there is more choice. The older properties with a sense
of history and character, such as the Continental, Cuu Long Majestic and the
Rex, are more than adequate and it is worth upgrading to junior suites in
each case for a nominal premium rate. Deluxe rooms are around Dollars 70 in
each of these properties and suites from Dollars 90-Dollars 130. The two
modern properties are Saigon Floating hotel (all mod cons but small rooms)
and the Century Saigon on the main street, Nguyen Hue Boulevard (bookable
through Utell). But they are also more expensive, at about Dollars
150-Dollars 175 for singles and Dollars 260-Dollars 350 for suites.
If business takes you to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, then, like Hanoi, there is
only one sensible choice, the Cambodiana on the edge of the Mekong river. It
is not cheap but is the only clean, western option. Taxi rip-offs are
commonplace.
In China, western standards of accommodation are easier to come by,
especially in Beijing and Shanghai. The country's economic boom means that
booking well ahead is essential to avoid disappointment. Doing business
needs patience; this is not a place to make a quick dollar. And punctuality
is vital; better to turn up early than late.
In the sprawling capital city, it is essential to choose your hotel by
location if you are to avoid Beijing's notorious traffic snarls. Among those
centrally located are China World, its three-star sister property Traders,
the Palace and Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza. To the north-west are the
Shangri-La and ANA Beijing New Century hotels and to the north-east of the
city centre - towards the embassy district and en route to the airport - are
a cluster of hotels of note, namely Kempinski Beijing Lufthansa Centre,
Swissotel and Sheraton. Rates range from Dollars 120 to Dollars 240. One
locally-run hotel worth noting is the centrally-located Jianguo Beijing,
where rates are around the Dollars 100 mark.
Always allow extra time to get to appointments in Beijing; traffic volume
(both cars and bicycles) will infuriate you. Cab drivers often have
difficulty finding your destination and few of them speak English. Have the
hotel bellman write the address in Chinese and give the driver specific
directions. Long journeys will not necessarily cost you a fortune as cabs
are cheap; from Y2 per km and with a minimum fare of Y12 (Pounds 1.40).
Your best transport option downtown from the airport is the hotel bus. Allow
around an hour for the trip and a fare of Y70. The extensive construction
work on this stretch of road should now have materialised into an expressway
linking Beijing capital airport with the town centre so the journey time
should now be less than an hour.
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial city, is an altogether
more compact city, which makes walking to appointments viable when the
traffic is at a standstill - and it often is.
The Portman Shangri-La is the best hotel option in Shanghai; a huge combined
office, apartment and hotel complex with good western standard restaurants.
The Sofitel Hyland, Hilton, JC Mandarin and Shanghai International
Equatorial are also good options. The airport, some 14 km away, can be
reached in 30 minutes on a good day, but allow plenty of time as the queue
for taxis is often horrendous. The fare in an hotel car is Y200 but in a
taxi only Y40-Y70 (depending on whether it is a small or large taxi).

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (9): The game of ripping off the
foreigner - Why you need to be on your guard in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN UPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPREAD of lawlessness in former eastern Europe has been well enough
publicised to put every business traveller on guard, yet the great game of
ripping off the foreigner flourishes unabated.
A rampant underworld has taken hold in eastern Europe since the demise of
communism, taking the form of racketeering, prostitution, drugs and arms
dealing and protection rings. Violence often erupts as opposing gangs fight
for control. Corruption and bribery remain a reality of everyday business
life.
A phenomenal haul of weaponry turns up regularly in traffic checks in
Moscow, while there have been deaths on the streets of Prague as Mafia-style
gangs take control of taxi stands. One taxi driver was recently murdered in
the middle of the day on Wenceslas Square after a passenger had been ejected
from another taxi, whose driver thought her destination was not profitable
enough.
The best advice in Prague is not to use the taxi stands in the city centre -
at least, not at Wenceslas or Staromestske - but to ask staff in the office
that you are visiting to call a taxi. In any event, always check that the
taxi meter has been turned on and that it is on level 1, otherwise you will
be charged twice the amount it should be. Ignore demands for a flat fare;
inevitably it will be more than a metered ride.
This is particularly so for the run-in from the airport to downtown, some
20km. It should cost no more than Kcs300-400 (Pounds 7-Pounds 9). The city
itself is very compact and the business district cramped into Praha 1, so
most of it is walkable. Alternatively the metro provides the quickest mode
of transport for longer journeys; it is clean and simple to understand. The
three-line underground system is coded by colour, letters and the
end-station name. A one-day, all-transport pass costs just Kcs30, a five-day
Kcs100. Remember to validate the tickets in the yellow machines inside the
station before you travel, otherwise you are liable to be fined.
Hotels in the city are generally soulless and impersonal, many of them being
large, modern structures, such as the Atrium and Forum, which nevertheless
charge western prices. Cosier in size and more stylish is the Palace (rooms
from Dollars 280) while the Inter-Continental (remember to request new
rooms), Diplomat and Praha Penta are about Dollars 50 less and offer a good
standard of service. Note that there is an enormous 23 per cent tax on hotel
rates.
There is also an outsize bureaucracy, so do not expect to do your business
in a rush. And it is essential to take an interpreter in a country where new
laws have yet to be tested.
Much the same can be said about doing business in Moscow. You need a lot of
money and time, as well as a long view while the economy stabilises and the
legal framework is set up. Visitors can at least stay in comfort while they
wait as hotel standards in the city have improved enormously as good,
privately-run hotels have gradually replaced the depressing Intourist-run
establishments. There are no bargains though; expect to pay at least Dollars
200 a night, plus an array of extras which anywhere else would not be
charged for.
Some of the top hotels are the Radisson Slavyanskaya, Baltschug Kempinski,
Metropol (run by Inter Continental), Savoy, Palace and Penta. The ones to
avoid are the Moskva, Izmailovo, Cosmos and Rossiya.
Getting around Moscow has got progressively worse; traffic congestion has
forced more people to use the metro, which is cheap and quick but seriously
overcrowded. A better bet is the tramway; more comfortable still would be
your own car.
It is not advisable to get a taxi downtown from the international airport,
Sheremetyevo Two - it can cost up to Dollars 60. Robberies and extortion are
commonplace. Your hotel may provide a taxi service; better still, insist
that you be collected by car by the company with which you are dealing.
Alternatively, Wagons-lits Travel offers a 'meet and greet' service which
includes transfers to and from the international and domestic airports, use
of private car and driver, assistance with customs and immigration
formalities at the domestic airport, a visa invitation letter,
English-Russian interpreter service and sightseeing and theatre trips.
Prices start from Pounds 35 for a one-way transfer.
In Warsaw, foreigners are recommended to stay in the open areas of the
Polish capital, to dress down and watch their wallets. On the plus side,
hotel standards are good, starting with the butler-serviced and luxurious
Forte Hotel Bristol, the Warsaw Marriott (go for corner rooms for bigger
bathrooms, or its executive floor), Victoria Inter-Continental or cheaper
Orbis Holiday Inn. Many hotels offer airport transfers. Bureaucracy here is
a problem and a Polish partner is essential to garner local sympathy.
Travelling from Ferihegy airport into Budapest, a 25-minute journey, is best
done by airport bus. Buy a ticket (Ft400) in the arrivals hall and it will
drop you anywhere in the city. The taxi ride is liable to be a rip-off; it
should be Ft800-1,000 but drivers regularly charge twice that amount.
Choosing where to stay in the city is an altogether easier affair, though
booking ahead is advisable particularly if you are visiting in spring or
autumn. The Grand Hotel Corvinus Kempinski is the finest of all, followed by
the Atrium Hyatt and Forum. The Gellert is also good but definitely in need
of its planned refurbishment while great things are expected by end-1994
after Marriott's redecorations at the Duna Inter-Continental are completed.
Single rooms in these hotels are around the DM300 mark, although the Hilton
is only DM250.
Finding suitably dedicated staff is one problem faced by foreign companies
in Hungary, another is office rents that are higher than those in Vienna. Be
warned that pickpockets are a constant irritant.
Berlin suffers less of the problems associated with emerging business
destinations; it is boom time in the new German capital so hotel
reservations need to be made well in advance. The appositely-named Grand is
situated on Unter den Linden, the old embassy district in former east
Berlin, and is perhaps the best, though some prefer the Bristol Kempinski on
the Ku'damm or the Schweizerhof. Others in the top league are the
Inter-Continental, Grand Hotel Esplanade Berlin and the Hilton, which is
located next door to the Treuhand.
Taxis are expensive, around DM3.60 per km. But help is at hand in the form
of an inexpensive and efficient mass transit network, the S-bahn train, the
U-bahn underground within the city limits and the bus system. Individual
tickets cost DM3. Taxis from Tegel international airport to downtown - a
journey of around 30 minutes - cost around DM30 in metered cabs. The 109 bus
does the trip every five to 10 minutes.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (6): Tunnel will need a good start
 -Charles Batchelor looks at the possible impact of the new way of crossing
the Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH OF the interest surrounding the opening of the Channel tunnel has
focused on the competition it will offer to the ferries. Yet the most
dramatic impact of the tunnel could be on business air travel between
London, Paris and Brussels.
If train services which run through the tunnel can emulate the success of
France's high-speed trains on the Paris to Lyons route, they could corner as
much as 80 per cent of passenger journeys.
Initially, two services will be available through the tunnel. Passenger
trains operated by European Passenger Services, trading as Eurostar, will
run from Waterloo to Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels Midi. At the same time,
a shuttle service, known as 'le shuttle', and carrying cars and lorries,
will operate between terminals at Folkestone and Calais.
The shuttle service is due to start next May, beginning with two departures
an hour but rising to four an hour in the peak holiday season in August. The
journey will take one hour from motorway to motorway.
Travel agents do not expect large-scale business use of the shuttle service,
though businessmen who use their cars to carry exhibition materials or
samples are potential users.
European Passenger Services, a British Rail subsidiary, is still testing the
special trains it will run on the London to Paris/Brussels route and will
say only that it expects to start operations next summer.
The journey will take three hours to Paris and 3 hours 15 minutes to
Brussels. Track improvements in France and Belgium should cut the Brussels
times to 2 hours 40 minutes by 1996. The opening of the high-speed link
through Kent and East London in 2001, assuming there are no further delays
to the project, should cut journey times to Paris to 2 hours 30 minutes and
to Brussels to 2 hours 10 minutes.
When the high speed link is opened, the main passenger terminus in London
will move from Waterloo to either St Pancras or Kings Cross.
Passengers who do not want to go as far as Brussels or Paris can make use of
those trains which stop at intermediate stations. These are being built at
Ashford in Kent, Calais and Lille while further stations have been proposed
at Ebbsfleet, near Gravesend, Rainham in Essex and Stratford in East London.
In 1995 passenger services will be extended beyond London with night
services from Plymouth and Glasgow through the tunnel to the Continent.
Daytime services will operate from Manchester and Edinburgh. For travellers
who want to go beyond Paris and Brussels, there are existing rail
connections while high-speed links are being further developed. Further high
speed rail links are planned to come into use in France in 1994-95, skirting
Paris to link with the existing high-speed trains to Lyons and Bordeaux, and
in the Netherlands and Germany in 1988.
More than 40 trains will run in each direction every day and even at
off-peak times there will be at least one train an hour, Eurotunnel says.
There are also plans for overnight services linking London and other cities
in the UK with continental destinations.
'Once people get used to rail travel this could open up the rest of Europe,'
says Mr Paul Allen, chairman of the Guild of Business Travel Agents. 'To my
mind there is no choice when you can jump on a train, sit down at your seat
and get straight on with some work.'
The main advantage the train can offer over air travel begins before
boarding. For many travellers it is far simpler and quicker to travel to a
rail terminal in the centre of town than to an airport on the outskirts.
Flying frequently involves a long journey by taxi or underground to the
airport and a wait to board the aircraft. Take-off and landing delays caused
by congestion at airports can also prolong a flight.
The tunnel rail service will offer regular departures which should make
pre-booking unnecessary at many times of the day, though booking will
probably be necessary at peak times.
The tunnel should also offer a means of travel which is unaffected by the
weather, unlike autumn and winter airline flights which can frequently be
delayed by fog and ice.
For the nervous flyer the tunnel offers an alternative though questionnaires
of whether people would use the tunnel have revealed many travellers do not
welcome the prospect of a long journey in a tunnel. The time actually spent
in the tunnel will vary from 23 to 27 minutes.
Travel agents are generally enthusiastic about the benefits which the
Channel tunnel service will bring for customers. Just as the arrival of
competition in airline routes in Europe has brought down prices, so the
tunnel is expected to exert further pressure, says Ms Vanessa Leak, head of
marketing for Thomas Cook Travel Management.
But there are residual doubts about the delays in building a dedicated high
speed link in the UK and some travellers, disillusioned with the poor
commuter service provided by British Rail on some routes, may need
convincing that rail can be an attractive alternative.
'Our research suggests that the first few months will be crucial,' says Ms
Leak. 'We anticipate strong initial demand because of the novelty value. But
if travellers are in any way disappointed, it will be extremely difficult to
win them back.'
What is not yet clear about tunnel travel is the price of tickets.
Eurotunnel says prices will be announced in January, though it has said that
the shuttle ticket prices will be similar to ferry prices.
European Passenger Services says it will offer a range of prices which will
be competitive with the airlines. It expects to announce its fares structure
in the spring.
For businessmen who prefer to continue travelling by air, the opening of the
tunnel may also bring indirect benefits. Some travel agents are forecasting
that the cross-Channel routes will experience competition similar to that
which has prevailed on the North Atlantic air routes in recent years. These
have led to considerable price reductions and improvements in the quality of
the service offered.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (7): Operators locked in battle -
Computer reservation systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXACTLY 40 years ago, a chance meeting took place on an American Airlines'
Los Angeles to New York flight involving two Mr Smiths. One, CR Smith, was
American's president, the other, R. Blair Smith, was a senior sales
representative for IBM.
The outcome of the conversation between the two men was a project,
designated Semi-Automated Business Research Environment or Sabre. Almost a
decade and Dollars 40m later, the world's first airline computer reservation
system (CRS) came into operation.
Initially, Sabre was an internal system which enabled American
electronically to link a passenger name to a specific seat sold on an
aeroplane. By 1964 Sabre's telecommunications network stretched from coast
to coast and from Canada to Mexico and it was already the largest real-time
commercial data processing system in the world.
Since 1976, when the first Sabre terminal was installed in a travel agent's
office, a handful of competing CRSs has been set up. These have evolved into
extremely sophisticated marketing and distribution tools for the airlines
which own them. In the process, they have reshaped the way travel is
organised and helped travel agents provide a more flexible, efficient and
global service to their customers.
Today CRSs are an indispensable part of the travel industry. In the US, the
most mature CRS market, an estimated 95 per cent of all travel agencies are
linked to at least one CRS, 88 per cent of all airline tickets are issued
through a CRS and travel agents account for 75 per cent of all tickets sold.
All the main CRSs now include features which enable travel agents directly
to access a participating airline's own computer database and make 'real
time' bookings and reservations.
Sabre itself has more than 109,000 terminals installed in over 25,100
locations throughout 65 countries. Its high security underground computer
complex in Tulsa, Oklahoma, holds details of 45m fares from 651 airlines,
together with other travel data on hotels and car rental companies.
It is the market leader in the fiercely competitive US market with about 40
per cent market share, ahead of Galileo International, formed earlier this
year through the merger of the US Covia (Apollo) and European Galileo
groups; System One, which is owned by EDS; and Worldspan, which is owned by
a consortium of airlines including Delta, TWA and Northwest.
However, Sabre has had more trouble breaking into Europe - a market which
unlike the US is still growing. Amadeus - owned by Air France, Iberia
Airlines of Spain and Lufthansa German Airlines - is the market leader in
Europe with around a 50 per cent market share according to Ovum, the
UK-based technology consultancy which tracks value-added network services
such as CRSs in its information service, 'Vans Market Europe'.
As Ovum noted in a recent report: 'Europe has recently seen a revolution in
the CRS market, with two rival European systems (Galileo and Amadeus)
replacing individual countries' reservation systems.' Indeed, Europe is part
of a much larger battle between the large CRS operators to build systems
spanning the globe.
The advent of global industries and large-scale international travel for
both business and leisure purposes has become one of the main driving forces
shaping CRS development. As travel agencies have followed their customers
overseas and formed international alliances, CRSs have been forced to do the
same.
'To be a successful CRS, you need to be in touch with your customers - the
travel agents,' says Mr Allan Loren, Galileo International's chief
executive. 'As they have become more global, we have had to become more
global.' This, he says, was the logic behind the recently completed merger
of Covia and Galileo.
The new Galileo International, which claims to be 'the largest and first
truly global CRS,' with a 30 per cent share of the worldwide market, is
owned by 11 European and US airlines, including United Airlines, British
Airways, Swissair, KLM, USAir and Alitalia.
Its Global Access product enables travel agencies to integrate information
from Galileo International's three separate databases, Apollo, Galileo and
Gemini (the associated CRS in Canada). Using it, a Galileo-automated agency
in London can retrieve a customer reservation created by an associated
agency using Apollo in Chicago and make any change required by the client en
route.
However, although the merger has enabled Galileo to take advantage of such
factors as economies of scale and a centralised administration and data
processing structure, Mr Loren emphasises that Galileo International
recognises that 'every region has distinct needs'.
Accordingly Galileo, like its European rival Amadeus, has been set up to
work with individual national distribution companies (NDCs) which add local
content like rail and ferry fares and are responsible for Galileo's customer
sales, service, support and training - and for feeding customer comments and
local needs back to headquarters. Galileo's motto, says Mr Loren, is: 'Think
global, but act local'.
Amadeus provides its service through locally-based National Marketing
Companies (NMCs) but has also set its sights on building a global network.
However, a planned partnership between Amadeus and Sabre fell apart
acrimoniously in 1991 because of last-minute disagreements. Since then,
Amadeus, Worldspan and Abacus, which is owned by five Asian airlines, have
formed a co-operation agreement under which their respective computer
reservation systems are being interconnected.
Given the pressures to provide a global service, many inside the travel
industry think that, even after the recent flurry of mergers and agreements,
further consolidation among the CRSs is likely. Eventually, many believe the
total number of CRSs will shrink to just two or three.
It is unlikely that any new CRSs will start up because of the huge costs
involved. Charging policies vary between the CRSs. Both Sabre and Galileo
charge travel agents a small sign-up fee but, once a travel agent has
reached certain booking levels, the service is free and the bulk of the
CRS's revenues come from the participating airlines which pay about Pounds
2.50 for each fare segment booked.
For the airlines this is a small price to pay for a highly efficient
distribution system, but CRSs have another big attraction for them. Data
collected by the CRS enables an airline to run its own sophisticated
programmes called revenue management systems (RMS) or inventory control.
These systems are designed to juggle the availability of fares in order to
maximise the revenue collected by each flight - vital in a fiercely
competitive deregulated market like the US or the transatlantic routes.
The existence of such powerful marketing tools has made CRSs and their
airline owners obvious targets for scrutiny by rivals and by the regulators
concerned over allegations of bias in the way systems display or handle
data.
In Europe this led to a bitter public battle earlier this year over the
passage of a new EC code of conduct governing CRSs.
However at the end of September a new code of conduct was finally agreed by
the EC Council of Ministers based on a compromise which has been generally
welcomed throughout the industry and appears to have re-established an
uneasy peace between the main protagonists.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (5): An accommodating computer
does the bookings - Paul Taylor on advances in hotel technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before setting foot in the hotel lobby, the chances are that today's
business traveller will have, probably unknowingly, benefited from the
introduction of computer technology to the hotel industry.
If the reservation was made via a travel agent, perhaps in conjunction with
air travel, an airline computer reservation system (CRS) or dedicated hotel
CRS may have been used. Alternatively, the booking may have been made by
calling a hotel's computerised central reservation system.
All the main airline-owned CRSs, including the US and European market
leaders Sabre, Galileo International and Amadeus, now provide their travel
agent customers hotel and car hire information as part of their services.
For example, Sabre's Shaarp Plus hotel booking service carries information
from over 180 hotel chains and reservation companies along with details of
more than 27,000 hotels. A direct connect service is available for 57 hotel
groups, enabling Sabre to link into hotels' host computer systems and
provide latest room availability and rate information, together with
immediate confirmation of the booking.
Some large hotel chains have installed their own central reservation systems
while others have joined one of the marketing consortia such as Best Western
Hotels and Supranational Hotel Reservations which run reservation systems or
one of the booking services like Utel International Reservations which
handle telephone bookings for a wide range of independent hotels.
These central reservations systems use sophisticated software developed
in-house by big chains such as Forte or by software specialists including
MDIS (McDonnell Douglas Information Systems) which has installed 26 'Hornet'
systems in the UK and continental Europe. MDIS customers in the UK include
Best Western and Hilton whose system, installed three years ago, handles
bookings for 42 Hilton hotels in the UK.
In the wake of the Gulf war and the recession, Mr Stephen Sawyers, general
manager for hotel and leisure industry operations at MDIS, says: 'Hotels and
hotel groups have woken up to the need to market their services more
effectively and aggressively and they need technology to help them do it.'
Central reservation systems like Hornet also handle the links between
hotels' host computer systems and global CRSs. 'It is quite a difficult
integration job,' says Mr Sawyer.
One key advantage of these systems is ease of use. For example, a traveller
visiting several European capitals can telephone a central reservation
system and make confirmed bookings for each city while on the line. The
central computer system then updates individual hotels' host computer
systems, either electronically or by fax, and updates the records held in
any participating airline CRS. If the booking covers several different hotel
chains, the central system will handle all the electronic 'paperwork' and
charge the hotels the appropriate commissions.
Some travel management companies have gone one step further, providing an
integrated approach to hotel booking. For example, Thomas Cook Travel
Management has spent 18 months and more than Pounds 1m to develop a new
booking system called System Four. Mr Bill Kirkwood, director of sales and
marketing, says of the system: 'On a single CRS screen, which is divided
into four segments, all the relevant information necessary to book flights,
hotels and car hire appears.'
As with central reservations systems, the main advantage for the business
traveller is that hotel bookings are confirmed on the spot, while the
customer is on the telephone. A profile of the client is held on the system,
so that preferences such as a non-smoking room or business facilities can be
arranged without the caller needing to ask for them. 'Technology will be the
key differential between travel management companies in the future,' says Mr
Kirkwood.
Technology is also becoming increasingly important in the internal
management of hotel systems. As soon as a guest arrives in the hotel lobby,
another range of sophisticated computer programmes called Property
Management Systems (PMS) comes into play.
Many varieties of PMS are available from software companies and specialist
system houses on both sides of the Atlantic. Most consist of a central or
core programme which handles basic functions such as reservations, check-in
and check-out and accounting. They also accept add-on specialist 'modules'
and provide electronic links or 'interfaces' to other automated hotel
systems, including energy management, electronic key and telephone
management systems.
Among the PMS suppliers in the UK is Avon Data Systems, which has been
selling a range of PMS packages which run under MS-DOS on desktop computers
for 10 years. Its software packages cater for hotels with between six and
1,500 bedrooms and prices range from Pounds 600 for an entry level system to
Pounds 3,500.
Mr Clifford Springer, Avon's managing director, says that these days
customers are demanding more integrated packages and sophisticated reporting
so they can do budgeting and yield management, of critical importance in the
fiercely competitive hotel industry.
Mr Christopher Lomax, managing director of Misys' Innsite subsidiary,
another UK-based PMS supplier, adds that 'some hotel groups are realising
that they have to use sales and marketing more.' Data collected by a PMS can
help this effort and most PMS packages such as Innsite's Omega accept add-on
sales and marketing modules.
Another large PMS supplier is Hotel Information Systems, a specialist
software group with operations on both sides of the Atlantic and customers
around the world. HIS supplies a wide range of PMS products designed for all
sizes of establishment.
Its flagship, Paragon Front Office PMS, which runs on IBM AS/400 computers,
provides a range of tools for managing guests from reservation to check-out
and integrates with Paragon Back Office, Central Reservations, Yield
management, Concierge and other add-on modules and complementary products.
Among its features, it enables hotel operators to develop sophisticated rate
structures, maintain records of previous guest visits and generate a wide
range of financial and other reports. The latest generation of the product
offers more than 300 interfaces including connections to point-of-sale, call
accounting, mini-bar, voice mail and other hotel-based systems.
Information technology is also helping to improve other aspects of hotel
performance. Security is being tightened. The days of the traditional hotel
room key already look numbered. For instance, Sargent Systems markets a
system that includes a card-producing computer, up to 16 levels of magnetic
stripe keycards, computerised card-reading door locks and a hand-held
computer that programmes, interrogates and troubleshoots door units.
When a guest arrives, a new card key is made which automatically expires at
a designated date and time. Using the hand-held computer, management can
also track the last 120 entries for each room by date, time and by card type
and serial number meaning that no-one - guest or staff - can use the lock
without leaving a clear trail.
Once inside the hotel room, other IT systems monitor and control the
environment. For example, Staefa Control Systems, based in Switzerland,
provides a highly sophisticated automatic temperature control system which
can be integrated with a front office booking system and enables the hotel
to control energy usage precisely.
Most hotels will also have an automated telephone management system. These
work with a hotel's private automated branch exchange (PABX) and its PMS and
some provide automatic wake-up calls in a guest's native language or enable
the guest to control a hotel pay-movie video system from the room telephone.
Even the mini-bar has been automated in some hotels. One system manufactured
by RoboBar provides on-line information on stock levels, sales analysis,
automatic billing and accounting audit trails for room mini-bars which can
be connected to any PMS system, or work on its own.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (4): Don't pay what they charge -
Michael Skapinker offers advice on choosing a hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Approaching a hotel a year or two back, a business traveller would look from
the outside at how many room lights were on and then how busy the lobby was.
If the hotel appeared to be having a difficult time, as so many were then,
the business traveller would demand a room at a ludicrously cheap price -
and get it.
Things have changed slightly since then. In some cities, such as London,
occupancies have crept up and hoteliers are less inclined to give their
rooms away for next to nothing.
But despite the improvement in some hoteliers' business, published or 'rack'
rates are largely fictional. Few travellers pay them.
Mr Juergen Bartels, chief executive of Carlson Hospitality, which owns the
Radisson hotel chain, says that in the US, only 20 per cent of guests pay
the full rate. One of London's most distinguished hotels admits that only 10
per cent of its guests pay the rack rate.
A survey published earlier this year by Pannell Kerr Forster, a leisure
consultancy, found that guests in Edinburgh hotels were receiving average
discounts of 44.8 per cent off the official rate. In Oslo, discounts of 44.7
per cent were available. Business travellers could get 42.8 per cent off
their bills in Manchester and 40.1 per cent in Athens.
Even the European cities with the firmest room rates were found to be
offering substantial reductions: 12.5 per cent in Zurich, 14.5 per cent in
Prague and 15.5 per cent in Berlin.
Business travellers are in a stronger position to negotiate than five years
ago because there are fewer of them as a proportion of all hotel guests. Mr
Geoff Parkinson, a director of the Horwath hotel and leisure consultancy,
says the worldwide proportion of hotel guests who are business travellers,
conference delegates and government officials has fallen from 56 per cent in
1988 to 49 per cent in 1992. The remaining guests are tourists - who spend
less.
Mr Parkinson says: 'Although tourists are clearly welcome, the tourist
market is very competitive and many hotels will not be able to return to
full profitability without an increase in business traffic.' But while the
business traveller remains the guest of choice for hoteliers, his or her
money has been difficult to come by since the Gulf War.
Mr Michael Ball, marketing director of Utell International, which handles
sales and reservations for hotels around the world, sees signs everywhere
that companies and business travellers are economising on their hotel
expenditure. Although occupancies have started to rise in a few European
cities, bookings are still being made far later than they were three years
ago.
The length of time that business travellers stay in hotels is shorter than
it was a few years ago. Mr Ball says cross-border hotel reservations are now
for an average stay of 2.5 nights, compared with 2.7 nights before the Gulf
War.
Companies are still looking for reduced rates or instructing their staff to
stay in cheaper hotels, Mr Ball says. The difference compared with a year
ago, he says, is that it is corporate buyers who are now obtaining the
discounts; individual travellers attempting to negotiate a cheaper rate
might find it more difficult.
He says: 'The individual traveller can no longer make the guaranteed
assumption that rates are going to be reduced. There will still be hotels
where, if you arrive late, you will be able to negotiate the rate down. But
the fire sales which we saw in some markets have pretty much come to an
end.'
However, Mr Michael Stajdel, Inter-Continental Hotels' head of marketing in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says that companies have become far
shrewder in negotiating hotel rates for their travelling employees.
Mr Stajdel says: 'In years past, travellers had almost a completely
discretionary choice as to where they would stay and what airline they would
fly. At the time of the Gulf War, companies began to scrutinise their travel
and entertainment budgets and they realised that there were opportunities to
make savings.
'Companies began to analyse what they were worth to travel suppliers such as
hotels and to use that to negotiate more effectively. They've begun to limit
the number of hotels they use. This increases the volume of travellers they
send to any given hotel and they can use that to get a better price.'
Some companies have begun to instruct their employees to use certain hotels
rather than others. In one US financial institution, a regular travel report
throws up the name of any employee using a hotel which is not recommended by
the company. The employee is asked why the hotel was chosen and warned that
staying in unauthorised accommodation could result in travel expenditure not
being reimbursed.
These rigorous procedures are not yet in force everywhere, however. Many
employees still have more choice over hotels than they have over airlines or
car hire firms.
Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director at Thomas Cook Travel
Management, said research carried out for his company in the UK by the
University of Surrey, found that 27 per cent of companies had strict
policies on which airlines staff could use. Nearly one third placed strict
limits on the choice of car hire firm. However, only 18 per cent of
companies told staff which hotels to use.
This means hotels can still try to find ways of attracting individual
business travellers. Apart from keeping their rates down, hotels are looking
at how to make business travellers' stays more comfortable. Free gifts, free
breakfast and reduced telephone and facsimile charges are some of the
devices being used to attract business travellers to hotels.
Ms Vanessa Leak, Thomas Cook Travel Management's head of marketing, says:
'Hotels are starting to see the benefits that loyalty programmes have
provided to airlines. Frequent guest programmes differ from airline
programmes in that they usually give a benefit that is immediately
redeemable, like a room upgrade or fast check-out.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (8): Global upturn must come first -
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE glancing at the roaring Australian stockmarket might conclude that
boom times are just around the corner, writes Nikki Tait.
In reality, however, Australia is waiting anxiously for world economic
growth to pick up - and finding that any marked improvement is slow to
arrive.
In some respects, Australia looks to be in better shape than bigger,
recession-hit counterparts. Gross domestic output, which grew by an average
annual rate of over three per cent in the 1980s before slumping badly in
1990-1 and 1991-2, recovered to a rate of 2.5 per cent in the last fiscal
year.
Government forecasts have suggested that a slightly higher percentage
increase - 2.75 per cent - could be in view for the current 12 months,
although some analysts view the figure as over-optimistc.
Even on the pessimists' figures, however, Australia still stands ahead of
Japan, West Germany or the UK, and probably on a par with the US. In short,
no rip-roaring boom, but conditions could be worse.
Inflation - an Australian bugbear for most of the 1980s - has also ceased to
be an immediate worry. Consumer prices rose by a miserly 0.3 per cent last
year, one of the lowest price rises seen in the industrialised world. This
figure, admittedly, has already increased; the September consumer price
index suggested a 2.2 per cent increase, year-on-year. It will jump further
as a result of indirect tax increases in the government's latest budget. But
the underlying inflation remains subdued.
In spite of these fairly positive trends, however, the economy still faces a
couple of big problems. For a start, the growth which is occurring generally
owes more to public sector spending than private sector investment. Interest
rates may be at their lowest levels for over a decade, but according to a
recent survey by Commonwealth Bank, published in the late summer: 'Since the
peak in business investment in the September quarter of 1989, private
expenditure on plant and equipment has fallen by about 32 per cent, while
non-dwelling construction has declined by around 44 per cent'.
Meanwhile, retail sales remain weak, with September's value only 0.8 per
cent higher than in August and volumes down 0.6 per cent. And, while there
were signs of a strong, double-digit surge in both new car registrations and
in housing finance in September, most pundits interpreted these numbers as a
fluke - probably inflated by customers nervous about possible fiscal
changes.
It is true that Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, has outlined a
strategy which should reduce the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-7,
or ADollars 5.8bn. But not everyone agrees that this aim is achievable. The
government's heavy reliance on indirect tax rises to fund its promised tax
cuts has prompted debate over the eventual implications for inflation and
growth. As Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac Bank, puts it: 'We believe
the government's growth forecasts are, on average, too optimistic and expect
that, for no other policy changes, the 'target deficit', will be missed by
Dollars 2-Dollars 3bn, or 0.5 per cent of GDP.'
Perhaps the biggest headache - especially for a Labor government which is
still closely bound to the union movement - is how to tackle the high levels
of unemployment which persist at present without throwing the deficit
reduction strategy way off course. The unemployment rate is stuck in
double-digit figures - although it did edge down from 11.1 per cent to 10.9
per cent in September. However, few economists think that it will drop
significantly in the near-future.
In part, this pessimism stems from the industrial restructuring, which has
followed the reduction in Australia's protectionist tariff barriers. Jobs
losses have been most marked in some of the 'old' manufacturing sectors,
while self-employment has actually risen. In the long-term, there are hopes
that a balance may be struck: that the growth of higher value-added,
export-oriented industries, and a more entrepreneurial breed of small
businesses - supplying 'outsourced' services, for example - will mop up some
of the labour surplus. For the moment, however, dislocation is the order of
the day.
All that said, a couple of brighter spots shine through these clouds. First,
the corporate sector has been undergoing a cathartic overhaul.
This has been spurred partly by recession, partly by the need to address
overstretched balance sheets, and partly by broader political decisions,
such as the tariff changes. In the main, this has reduced, rather than
added, jobs and brought little net new investment. But it has produced a
significant upturn in profitability. According to the Australian Financial
Review, net profits from 500 listed companies whose financial year ended on
June 30, rose by 98 per cent. Sales, by contrast, grew by only 4.5 per cent.
Secondly, there has been a marked difference in economic performance between
the different states and territories. Western Australia and Queensland have
been well ahead of the pack, while growth in New South Wales has lagged the
national average. This is usually attributed to the resource-based activity
in the former two states, and the presence of more traditional (and hitherto
protected) manfacturing operations on the east coast.
But at the end of the day, some meaningful improvement in economies of the
country's leading trading partners, such as Japan, looks neccessary before
Australia enjoys any real lift. Many analysts caution that this could be
slow to develop, and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource
Ecnomics has recently forecast a further three per cent fall in commodity
prices in 1993-4, although a tumbling exchange rate could leave them higher
in Australian dollar terms.
All this may change by 1994-5. But, as one analyst has concluded: 'The issue
is whether the Budget strategy can deliver enough economic growth in the
short-term to enable Australia to hitch a ride on the upcoming locomotive of
world economic growth.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (9): In the front line - Mining
</HEADLINE>

WHILE Australia's politicians have been haggling about taxation on
Chardonnay wine, the din has all but drowned out an issue of far greater
national significance, writes Bruce Jacques.
The index of commodity prices to Australian producers, measured in Special
Drawing Rights terms, fell to its lowest level for at least seven years,
dragging the Australian currency briefly to its lowest point for six years.
The commodities slump, now entering its second half decade, has further
highlighted the vulnerability of the Australian economy to external forces.
As a world export leader in many key commodities including coal, iron ore,
gold, alumina, copper, lead and zinc, Australia has sensitive antennae to
world recession.
Yet the mining industry has again comfortably held its place as the
country's largest export earner. It has done so, however, only by producing
more for less, thus playing a big part in chasing world prices down.
The pattern was clearly indicated in a recent analysis from ABARE, the
Australian Government's commodity analysis body. ABARE calculated that the
weighted basket of Australia's commodity prices fell by 8 per cent in
1992-93 and predicted a further 3 per cent fall in the current year.
Yet the agency is also predicting that the value of Australian commodity
exports will rise by about 3 per cent to ADollars 49bn in the current year.
This is forecast to reflect a 2 per cent fall in rural exports, easily
offset by a 7 per cent lift to ADollars 31.8bn in mineral exports.
Australia's export growth in mining goes against all the world's leading
economic trends. Its counter-cyclical nature is perhaps most strikingly
demonstrated in relation to steel, still the pivotal metal for economic
growth.
ABARE forecasts that, in spite of the lower steel production in leading
economies, Australia's two best export performers this year will be in
steel's key raw materials, coal and iron ore. Coal exports are forecast to
rise 3.5 per cent to almost 133m tonnes, with revenue up 4 per cent to
ADollars 7.8bn. Iron ore exports are predicted to rise 2 per cent to 110m
tonnes, but earnings would fall 3 per cent to ADollars 2.9bn.
The incongruity of this export position has been the catalyst for a lively
debate on Australia's economic direction. The Federal Government is
championing a push to increase exports of manufactured products where world
prices are less influenced by consumer countries. Recent growth has been
impressive, especially in technology related areas.
According to figures from the Bureau of Industry Economics, manufactured
exports grew at an average annual rate of 12.5 per cent in the decade to
1992, or from ADollars 10.3bn to ADollars 33.4bn. This slightly exceeded
average annual growth in mining exports of 11.5 per cent and dwarfed
agricultural export growth of just 2.8 per cent. Even with manufactured
exports growing quickly, Australia will continue to be a price taker for a
large part of its total exports, but there are two strong pluses to the
scenario.
The first is the country's fortunate geographic location, affording natural
access to some of the world's big growth economies in Asia. Emerging Asian
economies account for the bulk of growth projected for Australian mining
products this decade.
The second, perhaps paradoxically, is the corrective effect of the world
commodity price slump on the value of the Australian currency. After
averaging around ADollars 1.43 against its US counterpart for 1992-93, the
Australian dollar was trading in late October at ADollars 1.50 against the
US dollar.
While this devaluation is causing problems in some areas of the economy, it
has been a handy cushion for Australian mining company earnings. Although
performances were mixed, and often marred by hefty write-offs, 1992-93 was a
year of overall recovery in Australian mining results. But much of it came
through cost-cutting.
Having thus battled hard to weather the commodity recession, Australian
mining companies moved towards 1994 facing another challenge. The industry
is in the thick of the controversy over native title brought on by the High
Court decision in mid-1992 in the so-called Mabo case.
As a major user of non-urban regions, the mining industry stands to be
heavily affected by Mabo, which could give Australia's Aboriginal people
title to large tracts of land. Confusion ruled late in 1993 on the likely
full effects of the Mabo decision as Federal and State governments moved to
pass competing legislation.
The main fallout for the mining industry is a new wave of uncertainty on
access to exploration and extractive sites. Some companies have reacted by
taking a hard line, few harder than the CRA subsidiary, Comalco. Late in
1993, the company threatened to ditch almost ADollars 2bn worth of expansion
if an Aboriginal claim over its bauxite leases at Weipa in northern
Queensland was not quickly settled.
The immediate impasse was resolved through Federal Government intervention
to validate Comalco's leases. But the piecemeal nature of the resolution to
what is a pervasive national problem has given mining companies little
reason for confidence.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (6): Geography has the last word - Asia
trade gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Uruguay round of talks on world trade liberalisation sinks deeper
into uncertainty, Australia's regional trading initiative, the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), is gaining increasing support from both
within and outside the region.
For the Labor government which sired the idea, Apec is starting to pay
dividends on two fronts. First, it is rewarding the gamble to grab the
leadership initiative in a region where most other countries regard
Australia as a suspicious white foreigner. Secondly, Apec is beginning to
look like it might provide an avenue for greatly liberalised trading between
the region and its major western trading partners, particularly North
America.
Apec was born partly of Australia's frustrations over the agricultural
subsidy war between the US and the European Community. Often caught in the
crossfire, Australia has sought to use whatever influence it had to get
other countries together and get an open multilateral trading system
working, even if only on a regional level.
Australia has suffered severely from the grains war, with the US infringing
on several of its traditional wheat markets, including China, Kuwait, Yemen
and Pakistan. As a result, its wheat export earnings have fallen from a peak
of ADollars 2.45bn in 1989 to ADollars 1.51bn in 1991, a decline aggravated
by droughts in wheat-growing areas.
Together with other non-subsidised agricultural exporters snared in the war,
Australia has formed the Cairns Group, which has played a key role in
getting the Gatt talks to focus on agricultural trade liberalisation. But
France's continuing intransigence over subsidies will now force Australia to
re-channel energy to Apec.
Apec was also born of a determination to get accepted as an integral part of
the Asia Pacific region, and thus get a better share of the bounty from its
dynamic economies. Despite its proximity, Australia has not really developed
strong trading relations with the region. This was partly because in many of
the countries, especially in south-east Asia, former western colonial
markets are very well entrenched. Australia also suffered from an image
problem: while geographically located in the region, it is seen to represent
the interests of the big white man. Australia itself has traditionally
enjoyed more comfortable trading with Britain and Europe.
Over the last decade, Australia has tried to rectify the position. Prime
minister Paul Keating, while still treasurer in the early 1980s, began
switching the government's focus from Europe to the Asia Pacific.
During his first term as prime minister, Australian business and government
for the first time joined forces to capture a larger slice of the lucrative
Asian market. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has enlisted
business support to produce trade and investment strategy in south-east and
north-east Asia. The strategies drew on experiences pf Australian companies
already operating in the region, and identified opportunities as well as
constraints in doing business in the region.
The trade department has also restructured its operations so that for the
first time, the Asia division is now bigger than the Europe and the American
branches.
The efforts have been well rewarded. In Vietnam, which has just opened its
doors to foreigners, Australia has emerged as one of the biggest investors.
Earlier this year, BHP won the contract to develop the huge Dai Hung
oilfields. The project, worth around USDollars 1.5bn, places Australia as
the second largest investor in Vietnam, next to Taiwan.
When Apec was first mooted in 1989 by the then Australian prime minister, Mr
Bob Hawke, it was greetly blandly by its polite Asian neighbours. Japan and
the US were even more guarded, unsure of how the new grouping fitted in
among the established institutions with which they already had pleasant
relationships, especially the Association of South East Asian Nations. Dr
Mahathir Mohamed, the Malaysian prime minister who had organised another
grouping, was outright suspicious of Apec. His East Asia Economic Caucus
excludes Australia and New Zealand.
But because of the faltering Gatt talks, the main mechanism for multilateral
trading, it seems that the previously most cynical Apec members now accept
that regional integration would be the best insurance against a Gatt
collapse.
The most dramatic turnaround was from the US. During Mr Keating's visit to
Washington last month, US president Bill Clinton threw his full weight
behind Apec as another link in the free trade chain, and as a vehicle for
locking the US into the region.
Importantly, there have also been strongly positive signals of Japan's
acceptance of Australia's leadership. The Ministry of International Trade
and Industry has said it was important that Mr Keating kept up the momentum
for regional integration. And the head of the Asian research arm of Nomura
Securities, Mr C. H. Kwan, has said: 'Australia has a big role to play in
this region. It is very difficult for Japan to play a leadership role
because of its relations with Asean, and Australia is in the best position
in the region to bring everybody together to discuss common interests.'
Apec has also achieved a political coup by getting the three Chinas -
Beijing, Taiwan and Hong Kong - sitting together as members.
With the members' growing receptiveness, Australia is poised further to
assert its leadership, not only of the region but also of a more permanent
body that would keep alive the region's hopes for continued liberalised
trading.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (3): Is your journey necessary? -
Gillian Upton explains how companies are trying to reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN UPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN BEFORE the Gulf War and the onset of the recession, companies had
started to turn the spotlight on travel costs. Airlines had already been
witnessing a downtrading from first-class to business class, for example.
'People are using the recession as an excuse,' claims Mr Steven Lek, general
manager, UK and Ireland, for Singapore Airlines, one of the airlines
retaining first-class cabins in the hope of a cyclical upturn.
'And anyway, business class is so good now it's difficult to justify
first-class,' he says. Long a poorly tracked item in a company's report and
accounts, necessity - in the form of recession - has turned the spotlight
even harder on travel expenditure.
But three years later, companies have got used to the substantial savings
and are now prepared to forgo flexibility and staff demotivation in favour
of cheaper tickets.
Mr Kevin O'Brien, author of The West European Business Travel Market
1993-97, published by the Financial Times earlier this autumn, believes that
the new-found cost-consciousness will not diminish after the recession ends.
'The Gulf War educated the corporate sector as to the amount of
non-essential travel expenditure incurred in previous years.
'The 1990s will witness the advent of the responsible, cost-conscious
business traveller,' he says. 'Traveller preferences will become less
important to the corporate client as the benefits of cost reductions will
increasingly outweigh them.'
Major corporations have become more stringent in their travel policies for
staff or have written a formal travel policy for the first time. However,
according to Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of pan-European travel
agency chain Wagons-lits, there is still a resistance to implementing the
policy.
'They're not prepared to grasp the nettle,' says Mr Rainbow. 'It's more for
an easy life than anything else although so many companies have cut down on
staff levels that they might not have enough staff to police what's going
on.' There are, of course, plenty of examples in the UK corporate sector
which are exceptions to this. 'One of the things we are looking at more
vociferously now is the need to travel, not just costs,' explains Mr Kevin
Watts, travel manager of the British Council. 'We will always travel when
there's a business need but we are looking at the business need,' he says.
The first thrust of the council's strategy is to cut back on domestic travel
between its London and Manchester offices by installing a permanent video
conference link between the two locations. It was installed only six months
ago and it is too soon to track savings, but Mr Watts is convinced that it
will 'knock a big dent in our domestic travel cost. Two out of three trips
between the two locations could conceivably be handled by video
conferencing,' he says.
The initial resistance to using the facility was overcome by offering staff
social use of it over lunch periods so they could talk to their friends.
Attempts to make extra savings on overseas travel are just beginning. The
council is now asking whether business class is appropriate on all journeys
over two and a half hours, a class of air travel stipulated in the company's
travel policy. 'We point out that if they go Economy class instead, they
would get more trips out of their travel budget,' says Mr Watts.
While he appreciates that the majority of the overseas trips are necessary
(trips are generally of around 10 days' duration and involve major projects)
he believes that the advent of worldwide video conferencing will change the
face of long-haul travel. 'Travelling per se is unproductive,' he says.
By contrast, Mr Jim Thomas, head of travel and transport services at the
Shell Centre, part of Shell International, believes teleconferencing and
video conferencing do not take the place of travel; instead, they augment
rather than replace it. 'Electronic communication isn't a good substitute
for face to face interviews,' says Mr Thomas.
Shell International with an emphasis on staff motivation, has a more liberal
policy toward executive travel than the British Council. There has been no
downtrading since the recession; it has not been on the agenda. 'It's not an
issue,' says Mr Thomas. 'The purpose of the journey is of paramount
importance. People are expected to work harder now, so downgrading is not
seen as the way to go.'
Instead, the company looks to reap benefits from airlines in the form of
route rebates. The company's outlay on air tickets is a cool Pounds 12.5m a
year and on overseas hotels Pounds 5-6m a year. Such spending can speak
volumes around a negotiating table. Anybody who needs to travel still has to
get authority to do so and then it will be suggested which airlines to
patronise. 'We don't dictate,' says Mr Thomas, 'but we would obviously like
the travellers to use the preferred carriers where we can get deals.'
The last round of downtrading was undertaken a decade ago when first-class
disappeared for all inter-continental flights. Now it is business class,
even within Europe, for the company's 2,500 travelling executives. Only some
60 senior staff are eligible to fly first-class.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (2): Executives who must now turn
right - There has been more cost-cutting in the air than on hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY BUSINESS travellers had no idea until quite recently that you could
turn right when you entered an aircraft, says Mr Keith Webber, UK director
of Uniglobe Travel, a network of franchised travel agents.
Turning right when you enter an aircraft takes you to economy class. An
increasing number of business travellers now spend their journeys there.
Mr Webber says: 'If you have always travelled business class and then one
day there's a policy change and they say any flight of less than 10 hours is
now economy, that takes some getting used to.'
Only 14.9 per cent of UK companies now allow all staff to fly business class
throughout the world, according to Thomas Cook, the travel agents. A year
ago, the proportion was 25.4 per cent. A year from now, only 13.4 per cent
expect to permit all staff to fly business class.
However, there are still many people flying business or first class, as any
traveller can see. Many have bought cheaper tickets but have managed to get
themselves upgraded. Others have retained the right to fly at the front of
the aeroplane because of their seniority.
A high proportion of those flying at the front are likely to be Spanish and
Belgian, reports a recent Europe-wide survey by American Express. Over 20
per cent of Spanish senior managers still fly first class on long-haul
flights. Nineteen per cent of Belgian senior managers fly first class,
followed by German executives at 16 per cent. The least likely to be flying
first class are the Swedes (4 per cent), the Dutch (5 per cent) and the
French (7 per cent).
Business remains the class of choice for senior managers in most European
countries. Around half of all senior executives in Belgium, Hungary, Italy,
the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK fly business class on long-haul
flights.
A striking feature of the American Express survey, however, is the number of
senior managers who now fly economy class on long-haul flights. Spanish
senior executives, who have the highest representation in first class, also
have the highest number flying economy. About 40 per cent of senior Spanish
managers fly economy on long-haul flights.
Other countries with large numbers of senior managers in economy are the
Netherlands (36 per cent), Italy (31 per cent), Sweden (30 per cent), and
the UK and France (26 per cent).
However, such travellers, now flying in greater discomfort than previously,
have a greater chance of holding on to their old privileges when it comes to
choosing a hotel.
Some travel industry managers, such as Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing
director of Thomas Cook Travel Management, criticise companies for devoting
too much of their cost-cutting effort to the airline bill. He says: 'Too
many companies are wasting the savings they have made in the air with a poor
choice of hotel.'
But Mr Webber says there is a logic to companies worrying less about which
hotel their employees stay in than which airlines they fly. The hotel bill
forms a smaller proportion of total travel costs than airline bills.
The American Express survey found, however, that while air fares are the
biggest travel expense for companies, hotels are not far behind. Air fares
account for 26 per cent of travel expenditure, with hotels at 19 per cent
and motoring costs at 19 per cent.
Mr Richard Lovell, managing director of Wagons-lits Travel, says the reason
why business travellers have been allowed greater freedom in choosing a
hotel than an airline is that many companies are still unaware of what
accommodation is costing them.
Only 25 per cent of hotel bookings are made through travel agents, he says.
Many travellers' hotel bookings are handled directly by their secretaries.
By contrast, 70 per cent of airline bookings are made through travel agents,
and the number is growing. The greater mass of airline information provided
by travel agents makes cost control easier.
Mr Lovell says there have, nevertheless, long been general rules about which
staff stay in which class of hotel. In domestic business travel
particularly, staff sent out to sell goods and service customers' equipment
have been expected to stay in budget hotels of the sort provided by large
groups such as Forte in the UK and Accor in France.
At the top end of the corporate hierarchy, senior executives have
traditionally stayed in exclusive five-star hotels. That has changed over
the past two or three years, with many senior managers deciding to stay in
less exclusive establishments.
This is not necessarily because those senior executives want to save money.
Large savings have been available at many of Europe's most exclusive hotels
over the past few years. Mr Lovell says he remembers getting a Pounds 225
double room at a top hotel in London for Pounds 80 for one of his clients.
The real reason why many senior executives stay in four-star or even
three-star hotels is they want to be seen to be setting an example to staff.
A manager at one of the world's most exclusive hotels laments the fact that
many senior executives will no longer stay at his establishment, no matter
how little the rooms cost. If word got around the office that the chief
executive was staying there, the credibility of the company's cost-cutting
policy would be irretrievably damaged. Explanations that the chief executive
had got a special deal would cut little ice.
Four-star hotels have benefited from this need to be seen to be austere in
choice of accommodation. Small, exclusive hotels in London have also been
able to attract senior executives who are steering clear of better-known
establishments.
One area where exclusiveness appears to be thriving, however, is rail
travel. Mr Lovell says that his company has seen an increase in bookings of
first-class rail tickets. He says: 'We think that what is happening is
people are being told they can't stay away overnight. They have to do their
journey in a day. What they can do, however, is go first-class on the
train.'

labour laws are gradually being amended

OF all the challenges facing the new Labor government, developing industrial
relations reform legislation has been one of the toughest. Last month, Mr
Laurie Brereton, the industrial relations minister, finally revealed the
package of measures to parliament - no small political achievement. The
question is whether, in its efforts to win union support, the government has
missed an opportunity to accelerate the pace of change in wage fixing.
Historically, Australia's industrial relations system has relied on a
network of quasi-judicial federal and state industrial commissions which
have set wages for the majority of workers in centralised fashion  - paying
little attention to productivity levels, regional conditions, or individual
employers' ability to pay. In the event of disputes, the commissions have
had the power to order compulsory arbitration, and to fine or imprison both
workers and employers who fail to comply.
In recent years, this system has also operated within the framework of an
incomes 'accord', agreed between the federal government and the Australian
Council of Trade Unions, an umbrella body for the nation's various labour
organisations. The first deal was struck in the early 1980s, and there have
been six subsequent compacts. For the most part, the objective has been to
deliver a degree of wage restraint in return for certain fiscal measures or
welfare improvements.
The seventh, and current, accord was unveiled earlier this year, shortly
before the election. It differed slightly from its predecessors, being more
of a 'social document' than a simple prices and incomes formula. But, in
essence, it concentrated on two subjects: jobs and enterprise bargaining.
On the former, a target for employment growth of 500,000 over a three-year
period was laid down; on the latter, a commitment was given to devolved wage
fixing, based on workplace bargaining. Finally, the agreement promised an
arbitrated 'safety net' pay increase of Dollars 8 a week (with other
flat-rate increases foreshadowed for 1994 and 1995); in the event,
bargaining failed to produce a deal.
None of these elements has proved easy to implement. Unemployment remains
stubbornly high, with the September jobless rate standing at 10.9 per cent.
Moreover, some forecasts have suggested that, even if the 500,000 jobs
target is met, population growth and an increased worker participation rate
would still leave the 1996 unemployment rate in double-digits.
The ACTU has been critical of the new government's first budget, claiming
that Mr Keating and his cohorts seem more interested in containing the
nation's deficit than in job creation. At the ACTU congress in September,
there were calls for a shorter working week to distribute 'leisure time',
and for various fiscal initiatives to help reduce unemployment.
The government, for its part, set up a task force to look into the issue,
and faces increasing pressure to tackle the issue from its own
back-benchers. Any substantive action, however, is unlikely before 1994.
The second main plank of the seventh accord, 'enterprise bargaining', has
been just as thorny, with much of the debate centring on who - on the labour
side - should be permitted to strike these devolved workplace deals. ACTU
members naturally preferred that existing unions be the vehicle. Mr
Brereton, the industrial relations minister, is committed publicly to
opening enterprise bargaining to non-unionists.
Throughout the debate, the union movement faced two pressures. First, it
knew that a Labor government might not be in power forever. There was,
therefore, a desire to shore up defences against a potential successor - by
getting the right to strike enshrined in law, for example.
The ACTU also knew that its power depends on a controlling position in the
labour market place, and was never likely to embrace any measures which
threatened this. Union membership generally has been on the wane in
Australia, although there have been some signs that the position has
stabilised recently. At the end of 1992, for example, just under 40 per cent
of workers belonged to a union, compared with over 50 per cent in the
mid-1970s.
At the end of the day, the legislation presented fudges onthe enterprise
bargaining issue. Non-unionised workers will be able to strike enterprise
deals through the use of flexibility clauses incorporated into centralised
wage awards, but unions will be able to scrutinise such deals (although they
will not have any power of veto). This, say some employers, is no reform at
all: the scrutiny, and ability of unions to question deals in the
arbitration forum, will deter many companies from going down this path.
Greater protections for workers, however, are set out very clearly. Key
measures include new national minimum standards on employment; a legal right
to strike; and, if unions break laws against secondary boycotts, a
'conciliation' period of up to 72 hours before an employer can take legal
action.
With this debate over enterprise bargaining commanding such widespread
attention, many industrial relations practices which have become de rigueur
in other western-style economics barely get a look-in. Employee share
ownership is relatively limited, for example, although some notable
exceptions, such as the scheme at financial services group, Lend Lease, do
exist. The title of a recent publication from the ACTU summed up the labour
movement's ambivalent approach: it was Handle with Care.
Meanwhile, 'concession bargaining' - a practice of exchanging pay or
workrule entitlements for, say, equity in a business, which became
increasingly common in the US during the recession - remains anathema.
That said, the extent to which the labour market has already undergone
changes should not be underplayed. The Australian labour movement has
streamlined internally, cutting the number of unions. The number of working
days lost through industrial disputes has also fallen, although the picture
is scarcely pretty: the total stood a 1.015m in the year to end-June,
compared with 1.57m two years previously.
Finally, enterprise bargaining is finding its way into a fair number of
workplaces regardless of the furore over legislation, and about 11 per cent
of the workforce is reckoned to be covered by such deals at present.
For many industrialists, the changes cannot come fast enough. For the labour
movement, in a country which has a long history of protecting the 'working
man', it is a question of ensuring that precious rights are not eroded.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (3): By the dawn's early light -
Politics / Paul Keating plays the republican card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Australian Labor party, in power for a decade, had expected defeat at
the March national election. But prime minister Paul Keating's surprise
victory gave Labor the chance to start a new era for both the party and
country.
Eight months after that startling comeback there are early signs that
Labour's new era will be a uninspiring period, in which government appears
bereft of fresh ideas and looks decidedly weary. It may also be a period in
which Mr Keating's forceful political persona and blustery performance in
parliament are tempered by forced compromises with opposition parties,
especially those which hold the balance of power in the senate.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, has already been forced into
humiliating horse-trading with minor Green and Democrat parties who hold the
balance of power in the Senate, and who were threatening to block
legislation needed to implement the federal government's budget, announced
in August. He was forced to back down on some of the budget measures after
the Labor Party caucus threatened to revolt and vote against the measures in
parliament.
Mr Dawkins, a driving force in the government's active reform programme
during the 1980s, vividly captured the party mood when he slumped at a press
conference announcing the third step of amendments to his budget, and
speculated openly about the attraction of political retirement.
Eventually, Mr Keating intervened, negotiating a deal with the minor parties
 -which offered them further concessions in exchange for passing the
revenue-raising bills. In the course of this messy process, the Labor party
was left trailing in popularity stakes, and Mr Keating suffered an all-time
low in leadership ratings.
One of the key problems for the Keating government is how to fix a stubborn
economy. A mild recovery has been underway during the last 12 months, but
the shaky foundation of world demand precludes a stronger trend.
Occasional sparks of economic good news have provided the much required
psychological boost. The annual rate of inflation was 2.2 per cent in the
three months to September, maintaining Australia's low inflation regime. The
September current account deficit of ADollars 1.1bn, seasonally adjusted,
was below market expectations, giving hopes that the Australian ADollars
18bn forecast in the budget might come in lower.
And there are a few bright spots such as the rapid growth in manufactured
exports, which have bolstered an impressive 19 per cent growth rate over the
past five years. But commodity prices remain depressed and the rural sector
remains stuck in the doldrums; domestic demand is still weak; and business
investment is at low ebb.
The government has attempted a mild fiscal stimulus by reversing its hard
won budget surpluses of the 1980s and running up budget deficits in the last
two years. The government's fiscal hand is constrained, however, by
continuing balance of payments deficits and external debts of more than
ADollars 160bn (Dollars 108bn), or over 40 per cent of GDP.
The 1993-94 budget debacle illustrated how tightly Mr Dawkins' hands were
tied by both fiscal and political constraints. While it was Mr Dawkins who
framed the document, he had to work within some untouchable parameters set
by Mr Keating, including the non-inclusion of tax measures that might be
construed as de facto goods and services tax, and the delivery of election
promises, especially income tax cuts. The personal tax cuts will cost the
government around ADollars 8.6bn between 1994 and 1996.
The budget was widely seen by the markets as fiscally responsible. It
allowed for a deficit of ADollars 16bn but included a programme to reduce
the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1995-6.
But because it paid the price of election promises, it turned out to be
politically inept. It included several measures that raised small amounts of
revenue but at a high political cost - for example, a plan to remove public
health benefits for eye care which would have saved the government only
ADollars 48m, but received a massive outcry for its potential effect on low
income earners who might not be able to afford adequate care.
Other unpopular measures included a three cent excise on leaded petrol which
hit low income earners hardest, and a wine tax.
The events leading to Mr Dawkins' budget backdown also revealed a Labor
Party in serious disarray, with several members disillusioned by Mr
Keating's one-up-manship. When it looked like the minority Democrat and
Green parties were going to succeed in ramming through some budget changes,
the party's parliamentary caucus angrily demanded a meeting with Mr Keating
and Mr Dawkins. This overflowed with anger over the Treasurer's and the
prime minister's failure to consult on the budget in other major policy
issues.
After threatening a revolt in parliament against the budget the caucus
extracted an undertaking that Mr Keating in future would canvas opinion more
widely on major policies.
It was the first time that caucus and cabinet had asserted themselves since
Mr Keating wrested power from the previous Labor leader, Mr Bob Hawke, in
December 1991. Mr Keating had mesmerised the party with his uncanny ability
to pull a rabbit from the hat whenever the government's political fortunes
ran perilously low. This magic became even more powerful after his stunning
election victory in March. Caucus had accepted his unprecedented authority
while Cabinet largely stood by while he tackled policies only with his
closest personal advisers.
But morale sank significantly when the government's dramatic slide in the
popularity polls began. Shortly after the budget was handed down, support
for the goverment fell to 42.5 per cent on a two-party preferred basis,
compared with the opposition support of 57.5 per cent. The Morgan poll also
showed Mr Keating reaching an all-time leadership rating low of 24 per cent,
down two per cent.
In recent weeks, some ground has been regained. This has been partly due to
the resolution of the budget fiasco. But recovery in Keating's rating was
also helped by a breakthrough in the vexed issue of Aboriginal land rights.
Until last month, the goverment suffered the ire of several interested
parties for failing to produce satisfactory measures to protect their land
leases from possible Aboriginal claims.
After months of agonising and emotional debates, Mr Keating delivered,
literally overnight, a compromise package that, for the first time, seemed
to impress the Aborigines, mining companies and pastoralists, and state
governments.
The new proposals include a mechanism that would decide claims to native
title, another mechanism that would decide whether mining should proceed on
native-title land, and an option for Aboriginal groups to convert their
pastoral leases to another form of native title.
The land rights issue blew out last year after a High Court decision
recognising Aboriginal land title and overturning the doctrine of Terra
Nullius, which essentially held that the land was empty before British
settlement in 1778.
But even the land rights problem was marked by some clumsy handling at
first. Mr Keating had to back down from an earlier refusal to help Comalco,
the aluminium-producing subsidiary of the CRA Group, from Aboriginal claim
to its bauxite leases in the state of Queensland. The claim had jeopardised
Comalco's proposed ADollars 1.75bn aluminium smelter project.
Mr Keating had initially rejected the Queensland government's call for a
complementary federal-state government legislation to validate Comalco's
leases. A complementary federal legislation was required because the state
legislation alone might breach federal racial discrimination laws.
Mr Keating appeared to have refused to help only because the Queensland
government had placed the onus of responsibility on the federal government.
But after the threat of a another caucus revolt, Mr Keating turned around
and struck a deal with the state government to validate the company's
leases.
While the land rights issue has been handled adroitly in its latter stages,
the government has been far less convincing in its industrial relations
policy, one of the few areas where it could act to boost employment in the
medium term. The Labor party had earlier introduced enterprise bargaining
and begun to shift from centralised wage fixing. Both are essential to
breaking down the labour markets' rigidities and removing restrictive work
practices that have dogged productivity gains in Australian industry.
The industrial relations minister, Mr Laurie Brereton, however, faced
intense pressure from the powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions
(ACTU), when he proposed to open up enterprise bargaining to non unionists.
The ACTU's support for the Labor Party's economic programme was central to
its successful reforms during the 1980s and its political support was one of
the keys to the party's victory in the March election. The government has
since bowed to the ACTU's opposition, and scrapped plans to open enterprise
agreements to non-unionists. A bill introduced last week provides that
unions will be able to scrutinise but not veto non-union 'flexibility
agreements'. This has, however, angered employer groups who have called the
government backdown 'pathetic'.
There have been some lesser debacles, too. The government has mishandled the
introduction of subscription television and some seemingly pointless reforms
of its scientific and industrial research policies. All have compounded the
image of a government adrift and tinkering at the edges.
For some Australians, the debate over whether the country should become a
republic epitomises the paucity of real policies. Mr Keating has held aloft
the idea of breaking ties with the British crown and forging a future for
Australia enmeshed in the booming economies of Asia - essentially a 'vision'
of a new Australia.
This has certainly captured a great deal of attention. Mr Keating hopes to
declare a republic at the centenary of Australian federation in 2001. There
is a strong pro-monarchy opposition to his plan but he has found unexpected
support from some conservatives in the Liberal Party. Even the opposition
leader, John Hewson, refuses to oppose the republic outright.
But with unemployment still high at 10.9 per cent, many see the republic as
a diversion and the general electorate is desperately seeking economic
leadership. The government's failure to provide it has, at least
temporarily, enabled Dr Hewson to bounce back from the brink of political
ruin. But the danger now for Mr Hewson is that his coalition of conservative
parties may be sidelined as the main opposition group, with Mr Keating
preferring to court the minor parties in the crucial senate chamber.
The prime minister himself has been conspicuously absent during many of the
domestic debates. He has had several overseas trips, where he has
successfully shifted the focus to Australia's leading role in liberalised
trading in the Asia Pacific region.
While overseas, he has taken every opportunity to focus attention on the
republican issue. In his final speech to the International Olympic Committee
at Monte Carlo, Mr Keating linked the Sydney bid to Australia's push for a
new identity. 'Australia's transformation as a nation is marching side by
side with a transformation of the region of Asia, Oceania and the Pacific
Basin,' he told the Olympic Committee.
But in the political climate at home, Mr Keating's push seems rather hollow.
While he may well be on track to get popular support for a republic, it will
only happen if the Labor government remains in power long enough during the
1990s to set the nation on an irreversible path to a repub lic. His
government's current performance may make that unlikely.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (1): Free-spending days are over -
All over the world, business travellers are under pressure to cut costs, fly
economy and stay in cheaper hotels. At the same time, airlines and hotels
are trying to make their guests feel their money is going further
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AS YOU lie sleepless in an unfamiliar hotel bed, wondering whether switching
on CNN will provoke another round of irate wall-knocking from next door,
comfort yourself by pondering the contribution you are making to a great
industry.
Not the chemical, pharmaceuticals or financial services industry, but the
business of business travel. The money that companies spend ferrying
employees from city to city, from sales presentation to conference to
contract signing, now accounts for an average 2.5 per cent of European gross
domestic product.
German companies spend Dollars 38.8bn on business travel and expenditure
annually. British organisations spend Dollars 30.3bn; French companies
Dollars 25.3bn.
Not that the average business traveller is seeing much of this lavish
outlay. While the amounts spent on business travel might seem high, they are
not growing. A recent 10-country survey by American Express found that
European business travel expenditure is expected to fall by 0.3 per cent
this year. In Sweden, it is expected to drop by 11 per cent, in Germany by 6
per cent, in Switzerland by 4.5 per cent.
Expenditure will rise in some countries. The UK, after two depressed years,
will see business travel spending grow by 9 per cent. Spain will enjoy
growth of 4.4 per cent and Hungary, beginning from a low base, will see a
rise of 14.3 per cent.
Even in countries where expenditure is growing, however, the opportunities
to enjoy business travel are becoming increasingly restricted. Business
travellers are expected to spend fewer days, rushing to more appointments,
flying ever further back in the aeroplane and staying in cheaper hotels.
Mr Juergen Bartels, chief executive of the Carlson Hospitality group, which
owns Radisson Hotels, offers this cheery thought: it is never going to get
better. There are some signs that business travel expenditure increases as
national economies improve, but Mr Bartels insists the free-spending days of
the 1980s will not return.
European and US businesses' painful restructuring in the face of Asian
competition will keep costs under pressure until long after today's business
travellers have retired, he says. There is, he adds, no point in building
any new four- or five-star hotels in the US or western Europe. The demand
will not be there.
The American Express survey, which covers 3,500 companies, appears to bear
out this pessimism. Although 64 per cent of European companies have taken
recent initiatives to control travel expenditure, many feel they have
further to go. Only 54 per cent of European companies say they are entirely
satisfied with their cost-cutting efforts so far. The travellers likely to
endure the least additional pain in the future are the Spanish and the
British.
Almost 90 per cent of Spanish companies say they are satisfied with their
cost-cutting. Nearly two-thirds of UK companies say their travel expenditure
is now under control. The travellers who are in for the toughest time are
the French; only 26 per cent of companies in France believe they have
successfully controlled travel expenses.
Nearly three-quarters of European companies tell their employees which
travel agent to use. About a fifth of those have changed their travel agent
in the past two years, either because they were dissatisfied with the
service they were receiving or because they thought the new agent could
obtain larger discounts.
But if employers are giving business travellers less money to spend,
airlines and hotels are constantly looking for ways of making their guests
feel their money is going further. Hotels and airlines are linking up to
reward their most loyal customers. There are free flights for those who
stick to one airline. Hotels are offering gifts for travellers to take home
to their children.
As in all industries, it is cheaper to keep old customers than attract new
ones. As money becomes tighter, the business travel industry is poring over
surveys of its customers, trying to determine who they are and what they
want.
According to the American Express survey, the European business traveller is
still likely to be male. Only 13 per cent of European business travellers
are women. This contrasts strongly with the US, where Mr Bartels puts the
figure at close to 40 per cent.
There are signs that European businesswomen are travelling more. In the UK,
the proportion of women business travellers is now 23 per cent, double the
number in 1989. In the financial services sector, 44 per cent of UK business
travellers are women. In Spain, women make up 17 per cent of business
travellers. The number of female business travellers in the other large
European economies is still relatively low: in France it is 10 per cent, in
Germany 11 per cent and in Italy 7 per cent.
The industry expects the number of women to rise throughout Europe,
particularly as economies continue the shift from manufacturing to service
industries. However, many hoteliers are still ill-equipped to meet women
travellers' needs, according to Mr Mark Harris, marketing manager of
Expotel, a large hotel reservations agency.
His company's market research shows that most women travellers are generally
satisfied with hotel service standards. Hotel reception desks are usually
given high marks for their endeavours to make women guests feel welcome.
But hotels, particularly in the UK, still fail to provide the level of
physical security that women travellers are looking for, Mr Harris says.
Many British hotels do not have peepholes or chains on doors and car parking
areas are poorly lit. He says Expotel's women customers also want a more
discreet check-in process, so that only the guest knows the room allocated
to her.
Other complaints focus on the lack of facilities in rooms. While hotels
provide trouser presses and suit hangers, many do not have skirt hangers,
hair dryers, irons or ironing boards. Hotel restaurants are criticised for
not providing tables for single guests. Twenty-four hour room service is
regarded as essential by many women business travellers, Mr Harris says.
While business travellers are encouraged to spend fewer days away from the
office, they still resent the time spent away from their families, says Mr
Michael Stajdel, head of European, African and Middle East marketing at
Inter-Continental Hotels.
When Inter-Continental asked its customers what they wanted from the chain,
the most popular answer was to be able to being their spouses and partners
along. As frequent flyer programmes can be used to win a free ticket for
partners, many travellers have been asking for double occupancy of their
hotel rooms at no extra charge. Another popular request was for transport
from the airport to the hotel. Many said it provided a more comfortable
start, particularly in cities where they did not speak the language.
Given the pressures on them to show that their journeys have been
worthwhile, today's business travellers also want hotels to make it easier
to work while they are on the road. 'If we look at the research of 10 years
ago, people said they wanted their hotels to be homes away from home,' Mr
Stajdel says. 'Today they want them to be offices away from the office.'
Some of the ways to ensure office-like efficiency in hotels are already
standard, such as swift delivery of facsimile messages or fax machines in
rooms. At the Inter-Continental in London, guests can leave a voice mail
message in the language of their choice.
Today's business travellers feel the need to be healthier and more alert.
Hotels have built more health clubs as well as business centres. 'Whereas 10
years ago travellers would want a bottle of whisky, today it's fresh fruit
and mineral water,' says Mr Stajdel.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (2): A place in the Pacific sun -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL tourism has emerged from near obscurity to become one of
Australia's fastest growing industries in the past decade, but it heads
towards 1994 in a state of dichotomy. Although the industry is one of the
few defying world recession with solid growth rates, tourism remains
hazardous ground for investors, writes Bruce Jacques.
This reflects a 'two-speed' growth record in the past decade which has left
substantial imbalances in infrastructure, sapped confidence and increased
the perceived risk of tourism investment. But there are signs, boosted by
Sydney's successful bid to host the 2000 Olympics, that tourism is set for a
period of accelerated new growth.
International tourism burst on to an unsuspecting Australia amid the
financial boom of the mid 1980s, with overseas visits jumping nearly 200 per
cent to 2.25m in the half decade to 1988. Figures just released confirm that
growth in the half decade since has been a more modest 28 per cent for
visits of just under 2.8m in 1992-93.
This growth volatility has left some bad investment decisions in its wake.
Real estate estimates suggest that almost 10 per cent of the nation's three,
four and five star accommodation properties are now either in receivership
or under the administration of their banks. That is almost 70 properties,
covering about 10,000 rooms - enough to give pause to any investor.
Several other factors have added to the industry's roller coaster feel,
including:
the Federal Government's deregulation of the aviation industry and
subsequent heavy losses and rationalisation among the country's airlines;
the unique double failure of Compass Airlines - the new market entrant that
was touted as giving meaning to deregulation; and
postponement of the public float of Qantas, the country's international
carrier, from which the Federal Government hopes to raise more than ADollars
1.5bn.
But just as investors were caught by overestimating the industry's growth,
there are signs that those who continue to retreat will miss the next cycle.
Christopher Brown, executive director of tourism's umbrella body, Tourism
Task Force, believes some hard lessons have been learned.
target more rapid growth.
'You have to remember we've only been in the international tourism business
in a big way for just over a decade,' Mr Brown says. 'What we had in the
1980s was a marketing-led rather than product-led boom. Some of our early
marketing campaigns (notably the Paul Hogan 'shrimp on the barbie'
advertisements) were among the best in the world. But events since have
shown that the industry wasn't really able to handle the boom in overseas
tourists that followed.'
Mr Brown believes the industry tried to become too sophisticated too early.
'We thought we had achieved worldwide awareness, but we now know we didn't.
But the result is that, although some of it is under-utilised, we now have
some of the world's best tourism infrastructure.'
Mr Brown says that with the Olympics and increased government recognition
and funding for tourism, the industry is now targeting an annual rate of
around 7.5m overseas arrivals by 2000. The target would have been around 6m
without the Olympics, but both aims are considerably higher than estimates
of 4.8m arrivals by the government funded Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR).
While any of these estimates suggests strong growth, the industry still has
a task ahead in educating investors. Mr Brown says banks and institutions
are still far less adept at assessing investments in tourism than other
sectors. That ranks as a serious oversight given the scale of the industry.
While tourism is often proudly promoted as Australia's biggest export
earner, that description understates its economic importance. If the
international and domestic tourism components are taken together, the
industry is arguably Australia's biggest.
Judging by BTR figures, no investment institution of any standing can afford
not to have exposure to the industry. The BTR publication, Tourism and the
Economy, calculated that tourism accounted for 465,000 jobs, 5.6 per cent of
the country's gross domestic product and 10 per cent of its foreign exchange
earnings in 1992.
The BTR figures showed that domestic tourism expenditure, at ADollars
18.4bn, was almost 2.4 times the size of its international counterpart at
ADollars 7.7bn, for respective GDP contributions of 3.8 and 1.8 per cent.
Latest estimates suggest that in 1993 domestic tourism expenditure will
exceed ADollars 22bn, with international expenditure rising to ADollars
8.6bn.
Perhaps the clincher for the tourism industry in its push for a larger share
of investment funds lies in Australia's geographic location. Leading
stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan (AM) put the case well in a recent publication,
urging investment in Australian air lines.
'Australia is positioned on the edge of the fastest-growing tourism region
in the world - the Asia/Pacific,' AM analysts said. 'By the Year 2000, the
Asia/Pacific region with a 39 per cent share, is expected to dominate the
world's international air traffic.
'The other two major regions will be Europe (26 per cent) and North America
(23 per cent). For the remainder of the 1990s air travel in the Asia/Pacific
region is expected to grow by an average 9.4 per cent a year, almost twice
as fast as the US (4.9 per cent) and far faster than Europe (5.5 per cent).'
AM quoted a BTR break down forecasting that the proportion of Asia/Pacific
tourists visiting Australia will rise from 43 to almost 50 per cent by 2000.
'Japan, Asia, the US and Europe will be the key inbound markets by the year
2000,' AM said. 'The proximity of these countries to Australia, together
with relaxation of institutional constraints on travel, .. augurs well for
larger visitor numbers.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (1): New hopes on the horizon - The
capture of the 2000 Olympics Games is helping to keep Australians smiling
during a bout of painful restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY A curious quirk of fate, Australia secured the 2000 Olympic Games exactly
10 years after Alan Bond, the Perth-based businessman, won the America's
Cup. Was this, local commentators wondered, a favourable omen?
For many Australians, the America's Cup triumph is still a glorious memory.
Not only did a nation prone to viewing itself as an appendage on the edge of
the world take on the best and win, but the yachting victory against the
Yanks seemed to usher in an era when Australian businessmen strode the world
stage and prosperity rained down.
True, this golden age ended - less than a decade later - in overstretched
balance sheets and a rash of bankruptcies. But already there is speculation
that Australia's latest sporting prize could mark a similar uprush of
confidence and herald a second economic renaissance.
In reality, this seems too optimistic. Many changes are being wrought in
Australia at present, both on the cultural and economic fronts, but they are
of a far more fundamental nature than a lot of easy bank lending. As a
result, they are also more complex and contentious. A very different nation
may emerge at the end of the day - probably more competitive, and certainly
more diverse. But there is no sign that the transformation process is about
to become easy.
Australia's trade relations are a case in point. Australia started to throw
its lot in with the Asia-Pacific region almost two decades ago, but the
strategy has accelerated in recent years, first under Bob Hawke's Labor
government, and then under his successor, Paul Keating. Today, the pro-Asia
policy cuts across party political lines and, given the growth potential of
that region, is generally judged astute. But the pace and manner in which
the 'new order' is blended with the older, Euro-centric ties still prompts
debate.
Australia's decision to 'opt into Asia' was always a hard-headed one, driven
more by economic necessity than philosophical ruminations.
When established trading partners - Britain, in particular - started to
concentrate on their internal European market, and the US began moving
towards a North American 'free trade' block, Australia was forced to think
long and hard about its own position.
As Mr Keating has pointed out, his country was fortunate to find the Asian
doors still open. 'Twenty years ago, Australia had a White Australia policy
(discriminating against Asian immigrants),' he has noted. 'In the event, we
were very lucky not to be marginalised in the Asia-Pacific region.'
Today, politicians and trade mission leaders like to recall that 60 per cent
of Australia's trade is conducted in Asia-Pacific, compared with about
one-quarter 30 years ago, and that eight of the country's top dozen export
markets lie in this area. This is true, although it is should be added that
Japan still dominates the picture. In the year to end-June, the Japanese
took a hefty 25 per cent of Australia's total exports, almost double that of
the Asean nations (Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Brunei and
Indonesia).
Australia's salesmen have to work harder to dispel the notion that their
country acts as the region's 'farm and quarry', supplying raw agricultural
and commodity products which neighbours with cheaper labour then convert
into manufactured items.
In reality, about 61 per cent of the ADollars 60bn annual exports take the
form of manufactured goods. Of this, perhaps one-third are 'higher-valued
added' items. That is a marked improvement on the 11.5 per cent share taken
by more sophisticated manufactures back in 1986-87, although no one seems
keen to predict how much further the trend may go. 'People are loath to nail
a number to the mast,' says Steve Prytz, at the Australian Manufacturing
Council.
But glance at the nation's investment inflows, and a very different picture
emerges. Here, Australia's 'old partners' - the US and the UK - still
dominate, supplying over 60 per cent of new foreign capital ploughed into
Australia in the 12 months to end-June. Japan, until it fell on hard times,
was also prominent. Asean countries, by contrast, accounted for less than
two per cent of total foreign investment in Australia at mid-1993.
So, when it comes to pleading for investment dollars, state government
agencies suddenly remember their former heritage - and sing the virtues of
Australia's clement environment, Western-style facilities, trained labour
force, and so on.
The worry, then, for some Australians is that emphasis on Asian links could
risk demoting older ties, which still have a good deal to offer.
'East Asia is extremely important, but so also are Europe and North
America,' remarked Professor Robert O'Neill, the Australian-born director of
London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, in a recent public
lecture.
HE said: 'The economic prospects offered by East Asia are indeed impressive,
but it remains a politically weak area. Even in terms of economic relations,
Australia may find that it is increasingly on a playing field which slopes
uphill.'
If foreign relations are a delicate balancing act, moves to loosen the
historically-protected Australian economy have produced more acute tensions.
Steady privatisation of government-owned enterprises and the use of
competition to promote efficiency have been keystones in recent government
policy. In a country where one person in four still works for the public
sector, this, too, is broadly applauded.
But dogma has sometimes ridden roughshod over common sense and the
limitations of a small population base. Attempts to deregulate Australia's
domestic airline industry, for example, prompted only one new carrier to
take to the skies. It subsequently collapsed, twice, within three years.
In the media sector, an auction system which was supposed to distribute
licences to operate satellite pay-TV led to high but speculative bids from a
couple of start-up companies. They were duly declared winners - only for the
authorities to discover that cash, at the promised levels, was not
forthcoming.
More seriously, the quest for efficiency has created social hurdles. On the
one hand, recession and the need to restore balance sheets has prompted many
companies to streamline activities by asset disposals, plant closures and
the like. There is nothing uniquely Australian about this; a similar
response has occurred in most Western economies in the face of sluggish
demand. And, as in the US, there is every sign that corporate profitability
is beginning to benefit from the catharsis.
But Australia is also committed to a big reduction in its tariff barriers by
the year 2000, which is essential if the country is to join the Asian party.
This, in turn, has prompted some multinationals to rethink the economics of
manufacturing locally. Last July, for example, Isuzu Motors announced that
it would stop making trucks in Australia in about three years. By that
stage, the tariff on trucks should have dropped to five per cent, compared
with 12 per cent at present.
For the working population, the combined effect of these two trends has been
devastating. The unemployment rate remains stuck in double-digit figures
and, as the structural upheavals continue, few economists are willing to
predict any significant reduction in the foreseeable future. That, in turn,
has done nothing to ease relations between the government and the labour
movement. These have already been strained as Australia tries to develop a
devolved, enterprise-based wage-bargaining system - essential to freeing up
a labour market which has been among the most heavily-regulated in the OECD.
Culturally, some of the challenges are just as tough. 1993 was named the
year of the indigenous people and Aboriginal music is selling in high street
record stores.
But the fight over land rights remains heated, and the High Court's 1992
'Mabo' ruling - which overthrew the notion that Australia was uninhabited
before European settlement and declared that native title could exist where
Aborigines had retained a close association with the land - has yet to be
translated into a viable system for deciding native title claims.
On this score, a political compromise, which wins a modicum of backing from
many of the interested parties, is finally on the table, although the
all-important details have yet to be fleshed out. Even then, it is unlikely
that the Aboriginal community will see this as a final settlement of past
wrongs: 'a native title bill is just a first step,' comments one moderate
representative. 'We're going to have to do this piecemeal.'
Mr Keating has indicated that the discordant strains could be better
harmonised under a 'Republican' flag. To some observers, this is cheap
politicking - an attempt to divert people from real underlying issues, with
a largely symbolic rallying cry. But that, perhaps, misses the point. When a
country goes through a fundamental and painful adjustment, a little
attention to the symbols may be no bad thing.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Union binds EC in all but name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IT'S official. The Council of Ministers of the European Community (EC)
reconstituted itself yesterday as the Council of the European Union (EU).
But the 12 foreign ministers who took the decision each had two hats - EC
and EU - and not all of them were wearing the same one at the moment they
appeared to have made up their minds.
Confusion about what the EC should call itself after the entry into force
this month of the treaty on European Union signed at Maastricht in February
1992 will continue a good while yet, sowed in almost equal amounts by
Euro-federalists (EU) and sticklers for national prerogatives who prefer
loose, inter-governmental co-operation (EC - or less).
Yesterday the 12 foreign ministers agreed that the Council of Ministers  -
which decides EC policy, usually on the basis of proposals from the European
Commission - should henceforth be a Union body.
The Commission of the European Communities - the quasi-executive of the EC -
will henceforth be known as the European Commission, quite helpfully really
because that was what everybody knew it as anyway.
The Council will become Union-ist, 'notably,' the decision said, 'within the
framework of titles V and VI of the TUE' - to use the French acronym for the
Treaty of European Union (which give or take an accent, is rather like the
French word for 'dead').
Titles five and six of Maastricht cover the common foreign and security
policy, and co-operation on justice and home affairs, both areas for
inter-governmental co-operation outside the normal framework of Community
business, to keep them safe from Brussels intrusion.
The problem is that both kinds of business are conducted by the same people,
at the same time, sitting around the same table, and invariably with the
Commission present; hence the need to bring at least two hats, and the
fastidiousness among some about the dress code.
Thus the UK, which prides itself on the succintness of its insertions into
EC/EU policy, yesterday more than doubled the verbosity of the 'Union
decision'.
It said: 'This change does not in any way alter the current legal position
that the European Union does not enjoy any international legal personality.
Nor does it affect the designation of the Parties to any international
instrument having legal effects, which will be a matter to be decided case
by case.'
In the UK case, part of the objection to 'Union' has to do with the cost of
changing everything from the headed notepaper to the brass plaques for its
EC/EU delegations, one British official intimated. Few other delegations in
Brussels seem in a desperate hurry to make the change either.
The current Belgian presidency of the Union/Community is a clear exception.
Even invitations to the summit last week - held before the entry into force
of Maastricht - convened member states to a Council of the European Union.
At the same meeting of foreign ministers in the Union-ist capital, devoted
yesterday principally to the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, Sir Leon
Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, decided to fudge the theological
question of the moment.
'I think I will just dispense with all (Euro) titles and give my name,
hoping that people remember who I am.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bespak savaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health products manufacturer Bespak suffered a savage investor rerating
after issuing a warning that profits would be sharply lower than in the
previous period.
The company, which makes aerosol valve systems, plastic moulding and
micropumps, said profits for the first half of the year would be about half
the year-earlier figure and it expected full-year results to be lower than
the previous period. Bespak said a fall in the business of US Surgical, its
largest US customer, and uncertainty among other health care customers
pulled down the group's results. Also, sales in dollar terms in the US fell
in the first half of the year. The shares plunged 155 to 318p.
In the year to April, Bespak made Pounds 11.5m, a jump of 66 per cent from
the previous year.
The first investment trusts giving access to the Lloyd's insurance market to
be quoted on the stock exchange began trading yesterday. Hiscox Select
closed at 110p, a 10p premium to the subscription price. However, the new
HCG Lloyds trust ended the day only a penny above its subscription price, at
101p.
Several bank stocks were sold down after Hoare Govett, the securities house,
reiterated its unenthusiastic view. Hoare underlined a neutral stance on
National Westminster, which fell 8 to 539p, Royal Bank of Scotland, 11
cheaper at 349p, and Lloyds, down 7 1/2 at 555 1/2 p
Standard Chartered, in contrast, was steady at 1028p after news that the
bank was planning a simultaneous secondary listing of its shares in Hong
Kong and Singapore, possibly within six months.
Shell Transport saw its share price rise in a depressed market as investors
hoped for encouraging third-quarter results on Thursday. Buyers were
motivated by good figures from British Petroleum, which last week announced
a big rise in third-quarter figures.
Shell improved 5 to 720p, while BP recovered from profit-taking seen at the
end of last week and closed 1 1/2 firmer at 352p. BP Oil, a unit of the BP
group, said it was evaluating several options for its refinery in Marcus
Hook, Pennsylvania, including its sale.
Pharmaceutical groups SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo were weaker after the
former announced that it was launching a price war in the US. It said it was
cutting the price of Tagamet, its ulcer treatment, by offering a Dollars 10
rebate. The price cuts could affect sales of Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment
Zantac.
SmithKline slipped 13 1/2 to 395 1/2 p and Glaxo was 2 lower at 653p, the
latter's shares held up by a positive annual meeting. Glaxo's chairman Sir
Paul Girolami told shareholders that results and sales were on target so far
this year.
Drugs concern Wellcome dropped 25 to 677p after Nomura changed its
recommendation to sell from hold. The shares were also dragged down by
general weakness in the sector.
Stores shares were mostly resilient, with several moves into positive
territory by the sector leaders. Hoare Govett was yesterday pointing out the
recent weakness in the sector as overdone and its belief that, the Budget
notwithstanding, retailers are likely to benefit from good Christmas sales.
Dixons put on 3 at 280p, with one broker said to be recommending the stock
following the recent visit to PC World in South Wales. MFI slipped a
half-penny to 140 1/2 p amid presentations to clients. Elsewhere, Boots
added 2 at 506p, Kingfisher a penny at 640p, Lloyds Chemist 5 at 272p, Sears
2 at 115p and Marks and Spencer 2 at 398p.
Among food issues, Booker weakened 5 to 390p, with weekend press reports on
the threat of Norwegian salmon farming said to be partly to blame. Reports
of litigation in the banana business hit Geest, the shares ending 19 off at
342p.
Leisure stocks largely underperformed against the rest of the market as last
week's good run came to an abrupt halt. Only Forte found good support,
advancing 4 to 219p, although turnover was a weak 1.2m. Manchester United
was another bright spot, advancing 19 to 567p on positive weekend press
comment. Ladbroke shed 3 to 174p as turnover hit a bumper 15m in late
trading.
Granada, 9 off at 466p, suffered profit-taking after excitement in the
broadcasting sector on Friday. Thorn EMI slid 13 to 929p as the company
attempted to defuse the controversy surrounding its Rent-A-Centre US
business.
After Friday's heavy fall following a trading statement and analysts visit,
Guinness recovered 4 to 412p.
The power generators performed well in a mainly weak session for utilities
as investors drew comfort from what is expected to be a bumper dividend
increase when National Power reports results on Thursday. Its shares climbed
6 1/2 to 411 1/2 p. PowerGen rose 6 to 465p and Scottish Power 4 1/2 to 401
1/2 p.
Recs and water stocks remained under a cloud following last week's Ofwat
report which underlined the tougher regulatory environment for the two
sectors.
Electronic component distributor Abacus came to the market at 140p and
closed a good opening session 13 higher at 153p. TT Group gained 4 1/2 at
330 1/2 p on hopes that it would benefit from any expansion by Sega in South
Wales.
Siebe advanced strongly as it announced the acquisition of a controls
company in Germany. Engineering analysts added that the recent rights issue
had been well received. Kleinwort Benson was also said to be positive on the
stock. The old shares closed 6 forward at 566p and the nil-paid 8 up at 84p.
Motor components group Lucas ended a penny firmer at 176p. Dealers said
there was a growing belief that Mr George Simpson, deputy chief executive of
British Aerospace, would accept the post of chief executive of Lucas.
Shares in Wardle Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment manufacturer,
dropped 17 to 431p after the company announced that profits from its cash
pile had been eaten into by the steady reduction in UK base rates over the
past year.
Wardle was also unenthusiastic about future prospects. It said it was
difficult to see how there could be any improvement in economic conditions
in the UK when the company's main overseas market, continental Europe, was
in such disarray and any improvements in results would be in spite of market
conditions rather than because of them.

Good results from Associated British Foods sent the shares upward, although
profit-taking clipped the gain before the close. Turnover, however, was a
below-par 330,000, with the shares adding 4 to finish at 479p. Pre-tax
profits came in at Pounds 338m, well ahead of the market range of Pounds
300m to Pounds 320m.
Most of the excess was down to one-offs, with operating profits only
marginally in front of last year's figure. For this reason, most analysts
retained their forecasts for the 1993-94 financial year, with Strauss
Turnbull staying at Pounds 310m. Analyst Mr Carl Short said: 'The shares are
worth holding on to for the eventual improvement in milling and baking.'
However, most food specialists agreed that the short-term problems in the
bakery division will probably continue to overshadow the stock.

FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT in demand

<TEXT>
Recent news from the US that tobacco prices could be poised to recover
ensured that BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, bucked
the market trend. The stock rose 17 to 478p.
BAT announced last week that a cut-throat cigarette price war in the US had
depressed its third-quarter profits. The group said the move to reduce
prices, started by rival Philip Morris, cost it nearly Pounds 100m in the
quarter to the end of September.

FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS group Fisons was the most heavily traded stock in the London market
yesterday after investors considered the impact of an alleged malpractice
scandal. The shares fell 6 to 147p on turnover of more than 17m shares.
The selling was a reaction to a Sunday newspaper story claiming doctors had
been paid for prescribing Tilade, Fisons anti-asthma treatment.
Fisons issued a statement yesterday saying it believed that any malpractice
was limited to a handful among its 100-strong UK sales force.
However, one analyst commented: 'It is not what the sales staff were doing
but what lies behind it in terms of Tilade's sales.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOP-LOSS selling in the stock index futures sector helped to restrain the
equity market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
The December FT-SE 100 contract fell to a discount both against the cash
market and the index's estimated fair value premium as traders sold out
futures positions built up at the market's peak.
Such positions are traditionally subject to 'stop-loss' market levels at
which the trader can sell out his client's position, and it was these
safeguards which sprang into action yesterday.
December was at a discount for most of the session and at its low point
stood at a 7-point discount to cash and around 18 discount to fair value,
now estimated by some houses in the 8 1/2 to 10-point area.
The contract steadied to close at a discount of around one point to the cash
market, or 11 to fair value, after heavy turnover of 13,707 lots. Most
business came from independent traders.
Traded options were less active than on Friday, with contracts dipping to
43,626 from 64,958 and the FT-SE option down from 37,017 to 23,750. The Euro
FT-SE option saw 6,633 contracts transacted. Individual stock options were
headed by J. Sainsbury as investors continued to reshape portfolios in the
light of increased price competition in the sector. Fisons (1,102 lots)
reflected adverse press reports on marketing tactics.

FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early falls reduced in nervous trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAVOURABLE UK economic statistics, a steadier lead from Wall Street and
firmness in domestic bonds all helped to check the setback on the London
stock market yesterday. Although traders remained apprehensive ahead of
important US data due today and tomorrow, early losses in share prices were
more than halved by the close of business.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index down by 8 points at 3,077.6,
and some market strategists continued to warn that the index could be
vulnerable down to the 2,850 area if selling resumed.
The stock market opened higher, heartened by the 18-point recovery in the
Dow Average on Friday, which drove some of London's more speculative sellers
to hasten to buy stock to meet selling commitments entered into on Friday
morning.
However, the Footsie topped out at 3,096.5 early in the session, indicating
that it was not confident enough to test 3,100 again at present. The loss of
impetus soon turned into a downturn as weakness in the futures market drove
the December contract on the Footsie to a discount.
Stop-loss selling of the futures contract proved to be a negative influence
throughout the day. Before noon, the market was down by 20.5 on the FT-SE
scale and then remained nervy as it awaited the opening of the new session
on Wall Street.
In the event, Wall Street made a good start, and was only a shade easier
when London went home for the day. The Footsie, having traded a somewhat
erratic pattern, largely under the influence of the stock index future, was
rallying at the close.
The London market was fuelled at first by the announcement of a sharp jump
in UK consumer credit in September, indicating reviving economic activity,
and then by the non-inflationary implications of a modest increase in
factory gate prices in October.
'The economic data was excellent for the stock market,' commented one
leading trader, noting that the statistics implied that, whatever the
worries regarding the outlook in the US, the UK economy is expanding while
inflation remains under control.
But traders agreed that, since the shakeout in global markets had clearly
been prompted from the US bond sector, the near term outlook will depend
heavily on how federal bonds react to the US producer price index, to be
announced today, and to the US consumer price index expected tomorrow;
overhanging both is the outcome of this week's US bond auctions.
London's rally from the day's lows reflected some good quality buying from
investors taking the view that the market had been oversold. At Strauss
Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett pointed to market support from real dividend
yields, prospective dividend and earnings growth, a good equity bond ratio,
and expectations of further falls in base rates.
Underlying nervousness took its toll of the second line issues, where share
prices were more readily marked down. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was driven
down by 19.4 to 3,440.7. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of
the Seaq total of 557.6m shares. On Friday, Seaq reported that 773.3m shares
changed hands for a retail worth of Pounds 1.74bn, one of the highest daily
figures this year.

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow back on upgrade after a
cautious start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER AN uneasy start, Wall Street posted modest gains yesterday as
investors put aside their concern over inflation and instead focused on
signs of more robust economic growth, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 4.47 firmer at 3,647.90. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 0.64 at 460.21, while the
American SE composite rose 1.27 to 476.60. The Nasdaq composite showed a
solid gain of 3.22 at 766.21. New York SE volume totalled 234m shares and
rises outnumbered falls by 1,174 to 896.
The mood was decidedly cautious at the opening, as Wall Street looked ahead
to this week's reports on producer and retail prices for October. With data
expected to show a significant uptick in inflation, many investors were
sitting on the sidelines, bracing themselves for a further increase in
long-term interest rates later in the week, after the big sell-off last
week.
In the bond market, activity was light and prices drifted higher as traders
anxiously awaited the inflation data. After early declines, the benchmark
30-year issue was trading  5/32 ahead at 100 23/32 , to yield 6.189 per
cent. Prices at the short end of the maturity range were modestly firmer.
In spite of concern over the October prices data, equity investors managed
to regain their nerve near midsession, with cyclical stocks, which are most
sensitive to changes in the economy, showing particular strength.
In the automobile sector, Chrysler moved up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 5/8
, Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 and General Motors Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 48 5/8 .
In heavy equipment, Cummins Engine showed a Dollars 2 1/2 advance to Dollars
99 1/8 , while Caterpillar was Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 91 3/8 .
One of the session's most heavily traded issues was RJR Nabisco, which
softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 6 3/8 even though Bear Stearns upgraded the
stock to a 'speculative buy'. Tobacco shares had surged on Friday on hopes
of higher cigarette prices. Philip Morris also gave back some of last week's
gain, shedding Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 .
Paramount Communications climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 81 7/8 . At the
weekend, Viacom sweetened its takeover offer for the entertainment company
to Dollars 80 a share, or Dollars 10.4bn. On the American SE, Viacom class
'A' shares were down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 57 3/4 but the 'B' stock
advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 48 1/2 . QVC, which is under pressure to raise
its competing bid, eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 on the Nasdaq
market.
In the pharmaceuticals sector, Medco Containment Services rose Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 38 1/4 after the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would
not challenge Merck's Dollars 6m merger with the drug-distribution concern.
Merck dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 32.
Canada
AN EASING of prime lending rates to 5.5 per cent from 5.75 per cent by the
major Canadian banks helped the Toronto market to break a three-day losing
streak, rallying in heavy but reduced turnover.
The TSE 300 index closed 14.4 better at 4,216.4 and rises outpaced declines
by 416 to 350 after volume of 68.7m shares.
Transportation recorded the day's biggest advance, 2.17 per cent. Golds
eased slightly.

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Divergent views emerge on the outlook
for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets adopted a more sanguine mood yesterday after last week's
declines, which stemmed from Wall Street and spilled over to Europe and
Asia, resulting in a 2.3 per cent fall in the FT-Actuaries World Index.
Europe, France and Germany were among those hardest hit over the week, while
Italy, the biggest loser, had the additional burden of political worries and
their potential for disrupting the passage of the budget and the timetable
for elections next year.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities expects that markets will end this
week marginally lower. He notes that European bourses have had a 'supremely'
good run and says that it was natural for investors to want to book some
profits. He believes that prices will need to drift lower still before
buyers would be enticed back into the market once again.
Mr Sushil Wadwhani at Goldman Sachs International views last week's weakness
as temporary turbulence, believing that the global bull market in equities
is intact.
He concedes, however, that there could be short-term risks as a result of
continued profit-taking, with an increase in investor nervousness
precipitating further price falls.
But his optimism for the medium term stems from an expectation that
inflation should remain subdued. At the same time, he says that equities
remain significantly undervalued relative to interest rates. 'The equity
weakness that has so far been caused by higher interest rates should,
therefore, be a relatively temporary affair.'
Mr Wadhwani adds that typically in periods of optimism about economic
growth, equities outperform bonds.
Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson is more bearish about the outlook. He
began recommending investors to raise cash last Wednesday, warning that a
rise in US short term rates was close. He sees no reason this week for
investors to be returning to equities on a global front.
He notes that US rates were cut sharply in mid-1992 to kick-start the
economy and breathe life into an ailing banking sector. However, with the US
recovery from recession now 32 months old and the banking sector back at
record profits, he believes that an increase in the Federal funds rate is
close. 'The risk is that the markets do not view a  1/4 point increase in
isolation but as the first in a series of tightenings, which it will be.
Equity markets such as Hong Kong and Germany are especially vulnerable to
fears of a reversal of the US mutual fund finance.'
Conversely, the economics team at James Capel doubts that the fall in the US
bond market in recent days marks the end of a rally which had taken 30-year
yields down from around 9 per cent in 1990 to below 6 per cent this October.
'The correction which has taken place so far is relatively small compared
with previous sell-offs and is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely,' the
team notes. 'We remain of the view that bonds will continue to rally through
to the second quarter of next year, with 30-year yields dropping to just 5.2
per cent.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses retrace ground after
early rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES made an attempt to recover from Friday's losses, but in the end they
had to settle for equilibrium, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT exemplified the continental trend, the DAX index hitting an
intraday high of 2,031.32 before subsiding to close 1.75 lower on the day at
2,010.81.
Turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM7.4bn. Daimler, excited a month ago by its
New York stock market debut, dropped another DM10.50 to DM712, DM59.50 below
its high for the year, while BMW eased only 20 pfg to DM613.80 against a
1993 high of DM640.
In retailing, Karstadt, rose DM20 to DM617 on talk of a merger between it
and the Hertie store chain. Hard news, meanwhile, took Lufthansa up DM3 to
DM155 on a third quarter profit and a more than halved 9-month operating
loss.
AMSTERDAM took a negative view of the details of Akzo's merger with Nobel
Industries of Sweden. The shares closed down Fl 12.10, or 6 per cent at Fl
185.10 following their 11 per cent gain last week after good third quarter
results.
Some analysts were concerned that the terms of the merger - under which the
Dutch chemicals group will raise Fl 1.3bn through a share placing - were
very expensive. Others commented that, in spite of a dilution in earnings
next year, the new group could be expected to capture increased market share
as the sector passed the bottom of the current downward cycle. Cost cutting
measures would also result in substantial savings over time, they added.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.7 to 135.7. KLM fell Fl 1.00 to Fl 39.80
following weekend news that no agreement had been reached on the Alcazar
talks. However, there was speculation that should these talks fail, KLM and
Swissair might attempt to form a link between themselves.
PARIS was modestly better following losses throughout last week. The CAC-40
index gained 3.78 to 2,084.79.
In the automotive sector, Michelin rose FFr6.20 to FFr175.70 while Peugeot
slipped back FFr5 to FFr653. In a review, Lehman Brothers noted that there
has been a 9 per cent outperformance by the sector over local markets in the
year to date, in spite of car sales and earnings falling short of
expectations. This, it said, had been due to interest rate cuts and
favourable currency movements, which could also provide a favourable
backdrop to a good performance through 1994.
ZURICH gained ground early in the day as bargain hunters returned, and while
prices turned back from their best levels, the SMI index finished 21.1
higher at 2,675.3.
Interest centered on blue chips, which had been particularly hit by the
correction. Roche certificates, the most active issue, added SFr70 to
SFr5,730. Banks and insurers saw gains: Winterthur bearers rose SFr36 to
SFr868.
Electrowat added SFr30 to SFr3,310 with its forecast of higher net income
proving in line with expectations.
MILAN's Comit index finished 1.14 higher at 556.60 in thin volume.
Telecommunications issues saw the best business, with Sip dipping L34 to
L3,245 and Stet edging L13 higher to L3,885.
The fanfare that greeted the launch of Fiat's new small Punto car at the
weekend failed to spill over to market dealing. The shares finished L22
higher at L3,446 after a high of L3,535.
MADRID closed mixed after a strong opening on the bond market gave shares an
early boost, the general index ending 0.50 down at 299.54.
However, the market extended its critical support. After Kleinwort Benson's
upgrade of the market from underweight to neutral a week ago, as a result of
domestic interest rate cuts in October, and the more promising outlook on
labour reform and wage moderation, Goldman Sachs said yesterday that it was
raising its twelve month target for the index to 370.
ISTANBUL advanced 4.1 per cent aided by an improvement in the political
outlook after the government announced anti-terrorist measures. The
composite index rose 599.6 to 15,085.9.
TEL AVIV, down 1 per cent on profit-taking on Sunday, rebounded again on
underlying rumours of peace moves to close at a new all-time high in active
trading. The Mishtanim index jumped 6.28, or 2.5 per cent to 253.78 in
turnover of Shk465m.

THE Nikkei average rose marginally on bargain hunting, closing higher for
the first time in five trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 34.70 at 18,625.16 after a day's low of 18,380.84
in the first hour of trading and high of 18,671.67 later in the morning.
Arbitrage selling of Nikkei 225 component stocks left out of the new
300-issue index continued to depress the 225 index, while individual
investors liquidated margin positions.
Some arbitrageurs shifted positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Topix index,
lifting bank stocks.
Volume was 240m shares, against 433.7m. Declines led rises by 484 to 471,
with 195 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged
up 2.96 to 1,583.81 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.23 to
1,267.40.
Individual investors, who had bought East Japan Railway at its initial
offering price of Y380,000, took profits, depressing the stock by Y6,000 to
Y479,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y11,000 to Y799,000,
closing below the Y800,000 level for the first time since March 11.
Banks were higher on Topix index-linked buying. Industrial Bank of Japan
rose Y20 to Y3,340 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank put on Y10 at Y2,330.
Steels firmed on bargain hunting, with Nippon Steel, the day's most active
issue, appreciating Y11 to Y331.
Profit-taking depressed some consumer electronics manufacturers: Sony
weakened Y40 to Y4,910 and Pioneer Electronic declined Y70 to Y2,700.
Keisei Electric Railway, which had lost ground in tandem with JR East,
recovered Y21 to Y889 on bargain hunting, while Sumitomo Metal Mining, which
had plunged last week on margin liquidation, rallied Y49 to Y857.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 36.48 to 20,764.81 in volume of 18m
shares. Roundup
THE REGION'S markets were generally in an uncertain mood yesterday.
NEW ZEALAND tumbled by nearly 10 per cent at the opening in reaction to the
inconclusive election result; a partial recovery later in the session saw
the NZSE-40 capital index close a net 138.4, or 6.3 per cent, off at
2,046.8.
Most of the selling was attributed to retail investors, said Ms Pauline
McAtamney, an analyst at Ord Minnett in London, although, henceforward,
there was expected to be some downweighting of the market by institutions.
She added that the risk premium had returned to equities, following their
recent period of outperformance, and that investors would be watching
closely what happened in the bond market over the coming days.
Telecom, one of the leading stocks, fell 42 cents to NZDollars 4.08.
AUSTRALIA retreated on what analysts described more as profit-taking than
reaction to events in New Zealand. The All Ordinaries index lost 25.7, or
1.24 per cent, at 2,054.2. Turnover came to ADollars 349.1m.
Banks were among the biggest fallers ahead of next week's earnings
announcements. National Australia Bank shed 10 cents to ADollars 12.50 and
Westpac 17 cents to ADollars 4.21.
HONG KONG rose on demand from overseas institutions, particularly in the
property sector. The Hang Seng index gained 181.02 at 9,177.95 in turnover
of HKDollars 5.4bn.
Sun Hung Kai Properties advanced HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 55.50, Cheung
Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 36 and Henderson Land 75 cents to HKDollars
30.25.
SEOUL strengthened slightly, registering a gain in the composite index of
6.10 at 775.47 in Won908.3bn turnover.
Brokers said export-orientated stocks were given a boost by good October
trade figures. Samsung Electronics and Samsung Electron Devices went the
day's limit up, both rising by Won1,600 to Won48,600 and Won58,000
respectively.
TAIWAN fell back for the fourth straight session as investors continued to
take profits. The weighted index relinquished 25.78 to 4,195.82. Turnover
amounted to TDollars 28.9bn.
MANILA added to its recent losses as another heavy fall in PLDT shares made
its impact felt. The composite index dropped 59.86 to 2,351.46.
Brokers said the fortunes of PLDT would dictate events in the near term,
with some forecasting that the stock was now due for a rise in US trading.
It fell 65 pesos to 1,760 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR declined 2.5 per cent but was off the day's lows on bargain
hunting. Some commentators attributed the market's loss to the fact that
dealers had been forcing clients unable to meet payment deadlines to unload
their positions. The composite index shed 23.42 to 921.52.
BOMBAY firmed on strong buying by foreign investors which led the BSE index
up 48.58 to 2,713.30.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Muted activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOWNWARD revision in the rate of growth in Germany's M3 measure of the
money supply boosted hopes of further monetary easing by the Bundesbank by
the end of the year, writes Peter Marsh.
The revision to the annualised growth rate in September to 6.8 per cent from
7 per cent was another signal that inflationary pressures in Germany may be
abating. That should give the green light to the central bank for a further
cut in its key interest rates either this month or next.
In Britain, economists largely shrugged off figures from the Central
Statistical Office showing a pick-up in new consumer loans and lower than
expected inflation at the level of factory goods.
The belief in markets continues to be that political pressures will push Mr
Ken-neth Clarke, the chancellor, into cutting bank base rates around the
time of the Budget on November 30, to offset a likely fiscal tightening.
Partly in reaction to the revised M3 figures, the December Euromark futures
contract was quoted last night at 93.85 after opening at 93.83.
This signified increased expectations in financial markets that the
Bundesbank will cut its internationally important Lombard and discount
rates, currently at 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively. Many
investors think the central bank could act at one of its council meetings in
December.
In Bonn, Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the Federal Association of German
Banks, added his weight to the conjecture over monetary easing by saying
that the Bundesbank had further scope for rate cuts. He said inflation would
be at an average annualised rate of about 3 per cent next year, below this
year's level.
In the UK, money market activity was subdued, with few analysts becoming
wildly excited by the announcement that in the first nine months of this
year new consumer loans totalled Pounds 1.84bn, compared with Pounds 362m in
the whole of last year and Pounds 1.06bn in 1991.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, took the figures as
a further indication that the British economic recovery is on track.
In the Bank of England's money market operations the Bank met a shortage of
Pounds 1bn through routine bill purchases and by lending to the discount
houses Pounds 440m in so-called 'late assistance'.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR failed to rise against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday,
languishing near the bottom of its DM1.65 to DM1.70 range, writes Emma
Tucker.
Its performance disappointed dollar bulls, who were hoping to see the
currency build on last week's promising performance. With interest rates in
Germany set to decline further towards the end of this year, and faster US
growth encouraging talk of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, many
investors believe the dollar's next move will be upwards.
There were no particular reasons for the currency's sluggishness yesterday.
Some dealers attributed it to the con-tinued effects of profit-taking that
followed the dollar's brief foray through DM1.70 last week.
News that German M3 was revised down to an annual rate of 6.8 per cent from
a provisional 7 per cent had little effect on the market. But the revision
moved M3's annualised growth rate closer to the top of its 4.5 to 6.5 target
range and helped to reinforce expectations that rates in Germany will come
down towards the year-end, or early in 1994.
'There is a real prospect that M3 will come back within its target range by
the end of the year,' commented Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS. 'Then we will see
the Bundesbank focus on the real economy rather than monetary aggregates,
and that will fuel speculation on interest rate cuts.'
Inflation figures in the US today could trigger a rise in the dollar,
although Mr Avinash Persaud at JP Morgan said it is still too early for the
Fed to consider an increase in rates.
'I think we are in a long term bull track for the dollar, but the markets
have to sense that the Fed, when it makes its first move, has plenty of
excuses,' he added.
He believes that the current picture coming from the US of fast growth but
subdued inflation does not provide the Fed with the necessary background for
a tightening of policy.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.6850, compared with Friday's close of
DM1.6915. It finished New York trading at DM1.6851.
Trading in European currencies was uneventful. The pound was weaker against
the D-Mark, which was marginally stronger virtually across the board. The
market shrugged off UK economic statistics showing that prices of
manufactured goods are rising at a slower rate than two months ago, while
consumer borrowing rose in September for the second successive month.
Sterling closed two pfennigs down at DM2.4950. Against the dollar it
finished softer at Dollars 1.4805, compared with Friday's Dollars 1.4865.
The Belgian franc was slightly firmer against the German currency, finishing
at BFr21.26 compared with the close of BFr21.35 at the end of last week. The
French franc stood at FFr3.479 against the D-Mark, mildly below Friday's
FFr3.475.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC stands firm on cow hormone
ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission said yesterday that approval for the milk-boosting
dairy hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) in the US would not affect its
plans to extend its ban on the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration in Washington last week approved the BST
drug, Sometribove, manufactured by Monsanto, which will be marketed under
the name Posilac.
Monsanto has spent Dollars 500m developing the drug, which increases milk
output by 6-20 per cent by supplementing the cow's natural BST hormone.
A spokesman for the Commission said there was 'no reason to change' its
plans to extend a four-year ban on BST for a further seven years.
The Commission proposed the extension in the summer on socio-economic and
environmental grounds, saying that use of BST would concentrate milk
production on larger farms, driving smaller producers out of business.
It would encourage the sort of overproduction that the Common Agricultural
Policy reforms were designed to cut, increasing slaughterings of dairy cows.
Commission surveys had shown it would also encounter resistance from
consumers.
The spokesman said the ban was unlikely to lead to the sort of trade war
with the US that was triggered by the EC ban on hormones in beef production
since 'we don't import dairy products from there'.
The entry of BST on to the US market is expected to cost the US government
Dollars 15m in payments to buy up excess supplies of milk from dairy
farmers.
The FDA said milk from treated cows had been found to have the same
nutritional value and composition as milk from untreated cows. 'The public
can be confident that milk and meat from BST-treated cows is safe to
consume,' said FDA commissioner David Kessler.
The agency said Monsanto had agreed to monitor BST residues and carry out
tests on milk produced in 21 leading dairy states for the next two years.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Call for tighter health checks
on cattle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANIMAL health experts and farmers' leaders in Britain are calling for more
stringent European Community controls and greater vigilance by importers
after the first outbreaks of the cattle diseases brucellosis and warble fly
for three years.
Brucellosis, which causes cows to abort and can lead to severe fever in
humans through direct contact or unpasteurised milk, has broken out on three
separate farms in Anglesey, north Wales, and Cheshire, north-west England.
Animals showing antibodies to the disease - known as reactors - have been
found on two other farms in Cheshire. Ministry of Agriculture vets are
checking to see whether the disease, which has been absent from Britain
since 1990, was brought into the country by imported French or Dutch cattle
or has been lying dormant in domestic herds.
The warble fly outbreaks, which have reached 107, have been traced to
imported French cattle that carried certificates of health.
The fly burrows under the skin along the spine, causing discomfort and death
if untreated and affecting the quality of the hide. The infestations can be
treated with chemicals, unlike brucellosis, where infected cattle have to be
slaughtered.
Warble fly is not a notifiable disease in the EC, so the Ministry of
Agriculture has put the onus on UK farmers to treat newly imported animals
against it.
Some farmers are blaming the diseases on the advent of the single market,
which ended border checks on live animals on January 1. Quarantine
restrictions against foot-and-mouth disease were removed in April last year.
But Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, said yesterday
that it was up to livestock importers to ensure that UK cattle were kept
free of imported disease.
He blamed 'a small minority of irresponsible dealers'. 'It is imperative
that all those involved in the livestock trade adhere strictly to the
certification requirements covering the movement of animals from one country
to another,' he said.
The British Veterinary Association said the outbreaks of disease,
particularly brucellosis, were 'very worrying'.
'With the advent of the internal market, the movement of animals has gone up
10 or 15-fold,' said Mr Francis Anthony, senior vice-president of the
association. 'The more movements there are, the more risk of disease.'
The threat does not stem solely from within the EC. Italy suffered an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease earlier this year, which was brought in
from eastern Europe.
Mr Anthony said the European Commission had to ensure all member states used
common health certification standards. Under single market rules, animals
for export are given health certificates by officially appointed vets on the
farms where they originate. Spot checks for diseases are also carried out on
imported animals once they arrive at their destination.
'Veterinarians are not trained to the same standards throughout member
states,' said Mr Anthony. 'We and our fellow veterinarians in member states
need to be able to trust each other's certification. There's a dirty great
question mark surrounding it at the moment.'
The association is advising farmers to quarantine imported animals for two
weeks before introducing them into domestic herds.
The European Commission has approved the slaughter of 600,000 German pigs to
combat outbreaks of classical swine fever, Reuter reports.

GOLD'S price was 'fixed' in London at a three-month high of Dollars 377.90 a
troy ounce in the morning. But it eased back to close 50 cents down at
Dollars 376.25. The failure to build on Friday's gains prompted light
liquidation of long positions built up during the recent rally, dealers
said. The shake-out had been expected, given the lack of follow-through
buying in the morning, but the move had not dented the market's generally
bullish outlook. Support for the metal was expected to hold at Dollars 375.
A report that Russian ALUMINIUM exports would be between 1.8m and 2m tonnes
this year, up from 1.5m tonnes in 1992, caused little surprise in the
market, which is close to eight-year lows. Yesterday the three-month LME
price drifted down another Dollars 5.25 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,062.
COFFEE prices in London ended slightly lower after disappointment in New
York over the relatively small purchase of 10,000 bags in Friday's second
Brazilian auction in the retention scheme. The January futures contract
closed Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 1,228. It had earlier reached Dollars
1,250.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): No time to
taste the main dish - The UK is promoting niche food but ignoring the volume
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ballroom of the Copdock Hotel, Ipswich, had never smelled as good. Even
out in the car park wafts of the delicious aroma were inviting. Once inside
the sight of beautifully presented fare together with offers to taste
completed an enjoyable gastronomic experience.
Before I become a candidate for pseuds corner in a perhaps less auspicious
organ I should explain that I was attending the inaugural exhibition of
Tastes of Anglia - launched last year to encourage small, speciality food
companies in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk.
Membership of the initiative is about 100, and more than 30 of those were
showing their wares on trade stands at the hotel with a view to attracting
more buyers for their products. The range of food and drink varied from a
number of different types of apple juice to Essex-reared venison and from
quails eggs to chutney. In between were such delicacies as home-baked meat
pies for the pub trade, cooked hams, smoked salmon and ice cream made from
real cream.
It all looked - and I can vouch that most of it tasted - excellent, and a
fair number of East Anglian caterers turned up to search for new suppliers.
The promotional organisation, Food From Britain, was there supporting the
only sector of the UK's domestic food production now within its remit.
A few weeks ago, the minister of agriculture, Mrs Gillian Shephard, ruled
that FFB should concentrate on exports. But she included speciality foods in
the UK within its responsibilities and they are eligible for a small part of
FFB's Pounds 7m budget.
The minister of food, Mr Nicholas Soames, also attended the exhibition to
cheer the initiative along and to put his ministry's seal of approval on a
very jolly occasion.
FFB hopes to have another half-dozen such regional groups running soon and
some are well advanced. They have developed from county associations, which
failed to gather momentum, mainly, according to FFB, because they 'lacked
critical mass'. In other words they could not attract sufficient members to
stage a show like that at Ipswich. Moreover, only one-third of the members
of Tastes of Anglia exhibited at the event. The rest, presumably, were too
small to fill and staff a small booth.
Now I am in danger of damning the enterprise of those who organise and show
at such events with faint praise. I do not want to do that for I wish them
well and applaud their energy and their products. I also believe it is
entirely appropriate that government money should continue to be spent on
aiding individual small producers to improve their marketing.
But the fact is that in national terms the producers at the Ipswich show
represented a tiny niche in the food market. And if all the production of
similar regional groups were added together the volume of food would still
be insignificant when compared with national consumption.
Niches can, of course, grow as Michael Marks' penny store in Leeds and the
small butcher's shop of the original Mr Sainsbury prove. But in the
meantime, most of the attention of the media and more seriously the
government seems to be dominated by niches, and volume sales seem to be
neglected.
Giant retailers, of course, promote their own brands very efficiently. But
as competition for customers intensifies, with the launch in the UK of
discount and warehouse clubs, it is inevitable that all such companies will
seek to squeeze the prices they pay their suppliers in order to preserve
profits. Once that possibility is exhausted they may well seek further
advantage by buying more from marketing organisations abroad. Surplus
producers in Europe would grab the opportunity for a bigger slice of the
lucrative UK food market with both hands.
In the meanwhile, however, the UK's food trade gap - the gap in value
between the food we import and the food we export - has risen to Pounds 6bn
a year, and food is now the trade sector with the biggest deficit. By far
the majority of these imports, the volume of which is still rising, come
from other northern European countries. In other words, the goods could
easily be produced at home.
If the government is serious about containing and then reversing this trend
and improving the balance of payments at the same time (as the prime
minister and agriculture ministers have been claiming for at least two
years) it is vital that it acts urgently.
The recently announced Pounds 6.4m of group marketing aid over three years
to help more small businesses like those at Ipswich is welcome, of course,
but inadequate to the scale of the task. The food industries of France and
Germany have Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year each to promote their produce. No
wonder the UK is being left behind.
What is needed is a new co-ordinating body to replace and develop the
curtailed activities of Food From Britain on the domestic front and to
address volume markets. Its remit should include initiating national food
quality assurance schemes, promoting the superiority and safety of
home-based production, and persuading retailers and consumers that British
food is best value. It would be unrealistic to expect the government to pay
for all that, but most of the cost could be funded by statutory levies from
the farming and food industries.
As Mr Nicholas Soames said at Ipswich the other day, food and farming
together employ some 14 per cent of the British population and between them
produce 10 per cent of the gross domestic product. The UK cannot afford risk
the security of such a large and important sector of the economy. Nor can it
afford a food trade gap that could rise to Pounds 10bn by the end of the
decade if nothing is done to stop it.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil falls further to Dollars
15.60
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES continued to weaken yesterday, putting more pressure on the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to take action at its meeting
in Vienna on November 23 to cut its production ceiling of 24.52 million
barrels a day.
The price of Brent Blend for December fell by more than 25 cents in late
London trading yesterday to Dollars 15.60 a barrel. Analysts expect prices
to remain in the Dollars 16-Dollars 17 range as long as the current market
perception persists that crude oil supplies are plentiful.
An estimated surplus in worldwide oil inventories of 30m-40m barrels is
sufficient 'to allow traders and refiners to feel complacent', according to
Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London.
He suggested that an Opec cut of 500,000 barrels a day made on a pro-rata
basis by all 12 members would be needed to 'shake the psychology of the
market.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian federal government has accepted the suggestion of the Indian Jute
Mills Association to allow free import of jute in the current season to next
June.
The move is a reaction to concern about the runaway inflation in raw jute
prices, which may force financially weak jute mills to close.
Until now, the mills have only been allowed to import jute for use in
producing export goods.
However, industry officials said the liberalisation would not give much
relief to jute mills. At this stage, the Indian mills would not find it easy
to import jute of required grades and quantities and were resigned to
importing low-grade fibre, including cuttings from Bangladesh where prices
are higher than in India.
The jute crop has suffered a setback both in India and Bangladesh.
Industry officials said the situation would not have been as grave if the
government had freed the import of jute earlier in the season. It had not
considered it necessary to do so because official crop monitoring agency
forecasts had pointed to a near-normal raw jute production of 7.2m bales in
July.
Now, the industry thinks the crop will be no more than 6.5m bales, while the
trade estimate is even lower at 6m.
Industry officials said most jute mills were finding it 'extremely
difficult' to buy fibre at the prevailing rate.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusaf forges ahead with giant
smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUSAF is rushing to bring the biggest aluminium smelter in the western
world into production ahead of schedule, even though the South African group
is forecasting market conditions will remain severely depressed until 1997
or 1998.
Mr Fred Roux, chairman, said in London yesterday that the feasibility study
on the 466,000-tonnes-a-year smelter had assumed that supply and demand in
the world aluminium market would return to balance in 1995-96, at which time
London Metal Exchange prices would return to Dollars 1,650 a tonne (in 1993
prices).
'We still believe those prices are attainable but the recovery may have been
deferred for two years,' he added.
Nevertheless, Alusaf hopes to start up the smelter, now called Hillside,
five months ahead of schedule in June 1995 and hit full-capacity working 12
months after that. The group would save R2m (Dollars 437,000) a day on
interest payments during the construction phase, Mr Roux pointed out.
He also revealed that Alusaf would save at least R700m (Dollars 153m) on the
original R6.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn) cost. Equipment suppliers were quoting
prices 20 to 30 per cent below those they supplied 18 months ago for the
feasibility study. At that time three new aluminium smelters, all using the
same technology supplied by Pechiney of France, were being constructed.
Today only Alusaf is building a new plant and virtually every other project
in the world has been either cancelled or shelved.
Mr Roux said he suspected many suppliers were quoting below cost. 'It is a
question of survival for many of them.'
He said savings would be used to cut the debt being raised for the smelter
and consequently lower its production costs so that it would break even at
prices below Dollars 800 a tonne. At Dollars 1,050 a tonne the smelter would
generate surplus cash.
Last night aluminium for delivery in three months closed on the LME at
Dollars 1,062 and analysts suggested that most smelters were not even
covering their cash production costs at that level.
Alusaf is 48 per cent owned by Gencor and 34 per cent by the Industrial
Development Corporation of South Africa. South African financial
institutions own the rest. The company will be floated on the Johannesburg
stock exchange when aluminium market conditions improve.
Mr Roux said Alusaf had signed a 10-year supply contract for alumina, the
essential raw material for aluminium smelting, with Billiton, part of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, and a 15-year contract with Alcoa of Australia
(owned by Western Mining of Australia and Alcoa of the US).
In return the two organisations would take about half the new smelter's
aluminium output. Alusaf had also signed a five-year contract, starting in
1994, with Alussuise to supply alumina to the existing 170,000-tonnes-a-year
smelter at Richards Bay. This would replace complex arrangements made when
trade with South Africa was subject to sanctions.
Mr Roux said Alusaf was also negotiating a management contract with Pechiney
to replace the simple technology agreement.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ahead slightly as uncertainty
prevails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BOND prices crept slightly higher yesterday but European government bond
markets mainly drifted. Last week's sell-off appeared to be petering out,
with European markets uncoupling themselves from the US, but the tone of the
market remained uncertain.
Last week, selling of US Treasuries fed through into European bond markets,
as the approach of the year-end encouraged a spate of profit-taking, in what
for many houses has been a record year for bond trading.
US BOND prices edged higher yesterday in lacklustre trading, as the market
anxiously awaited this week's reports on October inflation and prepared for
the Treasury's November note auctions.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 100
23/32 , to yield 6.189 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was  3/32 higher at 99 17/32 , to yield 4.107 per cent.
In the wake of last week's big sell-off, the mood was decidedly cautious as
yesterday's session opened, with the long bond showing early declines. On
Friday, upbeat data on US employment intensified fears in the Treasury
market that inflationary pressure was growing, and the 30-year issue
tumbled.
In the aftermath, many traders yesterday decided to remain on the sidelines
in anticipation of today's report on producer prices and retail price data
to be released the following day. Both measures are expected to show
unsettling advances.
As the afternoon progressed, however, the market was able to put its
uneasiness temporarily at bay, and 30-year issue inched back into positive
territory.
On the short and intermediate segments of the maturity range, prices were
modestly firmer ahead of the auction of Dollars 12bn in three-year notes
today and Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes Wednesday.
THE JAPANESE government bond market, which shrugged off the turmoil in other
markets last week, continued to outperform the rest of the market, gaining
close to half a point yesterday.
Three-month certificates of deposit were issued at a record-low 2.33 per
cent, which helped fuel the rally in the bond market. Dealers said the
futures market was particularly firm.
THE GILTS market also performed well yesterday, gaining  1/4 point. In fact,
sentiment in the gilts market appears to have recovered better than in other
European markets, helped by some encouraging economic data.
Yesterday's producer price data showed a 0.2 per cent rise in output prices
and a 1.1 per cent fall in input prices in October, which provided further
assurance that inflationary pressures were at bay.
Hopes of a further rate cut are still intact, but the stronger performance
of the short end of the market last week was partially reversed yesterday.
AFTER holding its ground well last week, the German government bond market
put in a rather lacklustre performance yesterday.
The bund market failed to benefit from a downward revision of German M3
data, even though analysts said the positive data makes further rate cuts by
the Bundesbank more likely.
The December bund future on the London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange ended down 0.04 point at 99.34.
MARKETS in both Spain and Italy remained volatile, but dealers said this was
due largely to internal political problems rather than outside influences.
Spanish bond prices fell more than  1/4 point, and Italian bonds lost
ground.
FRENCH bond prices ended the day virtually unchanged in thin volume. Dealers
said that volume is likely to be low this week, ahead of Thursday's
Armistice Day holiday.
The December bond futures contract on the Matif in Paris ended at 123.12,
down 0.14 from Friday.
Having substantially underperformed the German bund market last week, some
dealers now believe that the 10-year yield spread of more than 20 basis
points represents a buying opportunity.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Philadelphia merger would
consolidate options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE unsolicited bid for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) launched by
the Chicago Board Options Exchange would consolidate options trading in the
US and put the Chicago exchange back into the growing business of foreign
currency options trading.
The deal, if successful, would also broaden the largest US option exchange's
reach into the regional stock dealing business.
CBOE members trade options, not stocks, on the exchange's Chicago floor, but
the CBOE does a quietly lucrative business clearing stock trades through its
regional electronic subsidiary, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange.
The terms of the CBOE's merger proposal, made last week, were not disclosed,
but published reports value the offer at Dollars 60m. The Philadelphia
exchange has 505 members.
The fifth-largest stock exchange in the US, the Phlx has had a record year.
Although the bulk of its business is stock and equity options trading, about
10 per cent of its turnover is foreign currency options. The disarray in the
ERM has brought big trades to the Phlx, particularly to its French franc and
D-Mark options pits.
The CBOE briefly traded foreign currency options in the 1980s, but ceded
victory to the Phlx in 1987, passing its open accounts to Philadelphia in a
good-natured surrender. Since then the Phlx's foreign exchange dealings have
grown dramatically.
Mr Nicholas Giordano, Phlx president, said his board would consider the
CBOE's proposal. The Phlx rejected a similar takeover bid from the American
Stock Exchange in 1990.
Mr John Davidson, for seven years the head of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's clearing house, is to become manager of Morgan Stanley's US
derivatives operations on December 6.
In his new job he will oversee clearing for Morgan Stanley's on and
off-exchange derivatives trading, and will maintain a 'continuing interest'
in the discussions over a clearing house for off-exchange derivatives.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Canadian borrower's CDollars 1bn offer
dominates issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CDollars 1bn offering of five-year global bonds from Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp (CMHC) dominated a relatively heavy day of issuance in the
international bond market yesterday.
The offering is designed to establish a benchmark for the government-owned
issuer's initiative to lend directly to social housing projects. CMHC plans
to raise CDollars 2bn a year over the next five years in order to refinance
existing mortgages.
Syndicate managers said that CMHC's bonds were snapped up by investors
because of their premium of 15 basis points over the yield on underlying
Canadian government bonds.
Around 80 per cent of the issue was placed equally in North America and
Europe and the remaining 20 per cent was sold into Asia. Non-Japanese
investors in Asia were particularly keen buyers. When the bonds were freed
to trade, the spread tightened to 12 1/2 basis points.
The volume of new Eurobond issues is expected to remain high for the rest of
this week. Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the central bank for the savings
banks in that German state, is likely to launch a Dollars 500m five-year
offering today. The bonds, via Goldman Sachs, are likely to be priced to
yield between 20 and 25 basis points over US Treasuries.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, which has a high double-A rating, has done some
small Eurobond deals in the past year but they have been targeted mainly at
retail investors. Today's offering is seen as the start of an international
borrowing programme.
There is a growing trend among German banks to shift the emphasis of their
funding away from the domestic German bond market. For example, Depfa, the
German mortgage bank, has been active in the international bond market in
recent months and is likely to tap the French franc sector this week.
BAT Industries, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is widely expected to raise
Dollars 500m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds today. The bonds, via
CSFB and Goldman Sachs, are likely to be priced to yield around 70 basis
points over underlying US Treasuries.
Among yesterday's other new issues, the FFr1.1bn seven-year offering from
Electric Power Development Co (EPDC), the rarely-seen Japanese government
agency, sold more quickly than the FFr1.3bn 10-year deal from Andalucia, the
Spanish autonomous region.
Syndicate managers said that the rarity value of EPDC enabled it to achieve
a relatively tight yield spread of 20 basis points over underlying French
government bonds. When the bonds were freed to trade the spread remained
intact.
By contrast, Andalucia's bonds remained in syndicate overnight to allow time
for the bonds to be marketed in the Far East. It was widely thought that
last week's French franc offering from Catalonia had stolen the thunder from
Andalucia.
Elsewhere, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector
arm of the World Bank, announced that it was buying back up to Dollars 150m
of four outstanding Eurobond issues which are close to redemption. The
repurchase programme was designed to enhance value for holders of the
high-coupon bonds since they were trading at a substantial premium to par.
The move also allowed the IFC to extend the maturity of its debt and to
re-finance old, high-coupon debt with cheaper, current-coupon paper.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Finnish investment house to
market fund in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG foreign interest in Finland's resurgent stock market has prompted
Arctos, one of Finland's five leading investment houses, to market its most
recent investment fund to institutions in the UK.
Finland's stock market has almost doubled in value this year on signs that
its economy is recovering from virtual collapse two years ago. The abolition
of restrictions on foreign ownership of shares at the start of this year has
also contributed to the big improvement in daily turnover.
Mr Topi Piela, executive officer of Arctos Asset Management, said yesterday
the open-ended fund offered foreign investors an exposure to high-technology
and export-oriented stocks, the two growth areas in the Finnish economy.
In addition, the fund is the only Finnish investment fund to use
derivatives, mainly index and stock options and futures, to protect itself
against falls in equity prices and to produce an additional yield.
The fund's hedge against downside risk should attract foreign investors who
have been put off Finland's stock market by its high volatility, of around
30 per cent. This compares with between 15 to 20 per cent in other
countries.
The Guernsey-registered fund has attracted FM40m from domestic investors
since its launch at the end of May. However, Mr Piela expects the size of
the fund to reach FM2bn by 1998.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Belgian tool group looks to Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LVD, Belgium's biggest machine tool company, is planning to begin
manufacturing in China to take advantage of growth prospects in Asia for
machines that bend, punch and cut sheet metal.
The expansion will be one of the few manufacturing investments in Asia by
European machine tool companies, most of which are two small to contemplate
such a move.
It would also be the first western or Japanese company in the machine tools
sector to start manufacturing in China. LVD's two main rivals, both larger,
are Amada of Japan and Trumpf of Germany.
The family-owned concern has narrowed down its choice of Chinese partners to
two, said Mr Jean-Pierre Lefebvre, president. The plant could be in
operation by late next year.
Mr Lefebvre said Asia accounted for 35 per cent of LVD's Dollars 90m
turnover last year, up from 15 per cent in 1990.
He added that Asia was the only region where the company saw substantial
growth over the next few years. China was the best choice because products
made there were welcome elsewhere in Asia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITABLE, the US insurer 49 per cent owned by Axa of France, repaid its
recent star billing by Wall Street analysts with third-quarter results which
showed a further all-round improvement in its operating position.
Net income for the three months to end-September rose to Dollars 71.3m, or
32 cents a share fully diluted. A year before, excluding costs of the
company's demutualisation, Equitable earned net profits of Dollars 32.7m or
18 cents a share.
The company's shares, which shortly after its flotation in July 1992 traded
at a low of Dollars 7 1/2 , jumped yesterday morning by Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 26 5/8 , before settling back to close at Dollars 26 3/8 .
The company benefited from a strong performance in both its life insurance
and investment services businesses. Post-tax profits in insurance rose to
Dollars 21.4m from Dollars 17.4m a year earlier, before capital gains and
other special items.
The improvement resulted from reduced costs and higher profit margins, which
more than offset higher than expected mortality during the quarter.
Capital gains after tax were Dollars 24.3m, compared with a Dollars 15.1m
loss a year earlier.
Investment services - which includes Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the
stockbroker in which Equitable is expected to float a minority stake,
Alliance Capital Management, and Equitable Real Estate Investment Management
 -saw net income rise to Dollars 56.9m from Dollars 47m. DLJ was the largest
contributor to growth, with a 14.9 per cent rise in net income.

MR JOHN Sculley, the former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer,
who last month shocked the computer industry by joining Spectrum Information
Technologies, a small technology development company, was granted stock
warrants now worth Dollars 72m, the company said yesterday.
Mr Sculley's 18m warrants were issued at a price of Dollars 6 1/8 .
Yesterday, the stock was trading at Dollars 10 1/8 . Mr Sculley is precluded
from exercising more than 3m warrants this year and the remainder can be
exercised over a four-year period.
'We believe that the arrangement reflects Mr Sculley's long-term commitment
to Spectrum,' the company said. 'The warrants were issued at the market
price when he joined the company, last month. He will benefit, along with
all Spectrum shareholders, only when the company performs well.'
Separately, Spectrum announced that its founder and two other executives
have resigned and that it has settled an outstanding shareholders lawsuit.
Spectrum said it has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5n in cash and issue 750,000
warrants at or above the current market price to settle the action. The
company admitted no wrong-doing.
The lawsuit was filed by shareholders in May when Spectrum's stock price
dropped sharply after AT&amp;T challenged the company's claim that a technology
licensing agreement could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in
royalties.
Mr Sculley also announced yesterday that he plans to cut back loss-making
operations and refocus the company's communications services operations on
contract engineering and consulting services. He said that Spectrum plans to
acquire a small contract engineering and consulting services firm with
annual revenues of about Dollars 12m.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: JP Morgan invests in China
capital fund

JP MORGAN, the US investment bank, plans to set up a China fund to invest in
Chinese enterprises with emphasis on the energy, telecommunications and food
processing sectors.
Mr Weijian Shan, vice-president of corporate finance, said JP Morgan aimed
to mobilise funds to 'help China's economic development, and help our
foreign clients seek new investment opportunities at the same time'.
Mr Shan said the bank would establish representative offices in Beijing and
Shanghai within the next few months to help spearhead its drive into China
which is 'gripped by a capital shortage'.
JP Morgan's decision to focus on China investments is part of an
accelerating trend among US institutions, which are beginning to take
developments in the Chinese economy more seriously. Mr Shan predicted that
Chinese organisations would raise up to Dollars 1.2bn in the US capital
markets over the next 18 months and that at least half would be in Yankee
bonds.
BankAmerica has reached agreement to sell troubled commercial property loans
with a face value of Dollars 340m in a further sign that demand for
distressed property assets is picking up, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The sale, to an investor group formed by Goldman Sachs, will take the bank's
disposal of troubled assets to nearly Dollars 3bn over the past year.
BankAmerica would not reveal the terms of the latest deal but said it
expected to sell the loans at above their written-down value. Most were
classed as 'assets pending disposition', a category with a written-down
value of Dollars 668m at the end of September, down from Dollars 3.35bn the
year before.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Gemms come back into fashion -
Sara Webb looks at the recent turnround in interest in trading gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT trading is back in fashion again, if the latest round of musical chairs
is anything to go by. Securities houses are queueing up at the Bank of
England for approval to set up as gilt-edged market-makers, or Gemms, lured
by the prospect of earning healthy profits.
The recent spate of hirings of gilt traders, sales staff, economists and
trading strategists is testimony to the fact that at least two houses have
serious intentions of setting up in the near future.
Yamaichi International (Europe), the European arm of the Japanese securities
house, is expected to start operating as a Gemm later this month while
Merrill Lynch is likely to follow suit soon.
Both have been busy recruiting to complement their existing bond trading
operations. Yamaichi hired Mr John Shepperd and Mr Nigel Richardson, two of
SG Warburg Securities' better-known UK economists, Mr John Battye (Warburg's
head of gilt sales), and Mr Jim Goodey (NatWest's head of gilt trading), as
well as three gilt traders and three sales staff.
Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch has hired Mr Stephen Rumsey, former chief executive
of BZW's bond operations, Mr Ifty Islam, BZW's gilt economist, Mr Dominic
Franklin, from BZW's Eurosterling operations, Mr John Standeven, a bond
analyst at BZW, Mr Tony Gray, Daiwa's short-dated gilt trader, Mr Alex
Miller, NatWest's medium-dated gilt trader, and Mr Jeff Derx, NatWest's head
of gilt sales.
In addition to Yamaichi and Merrill, ABN-Amro of the Netherlands and
Chemical Bank are understood to be considering setting up as Gemms.
The desire for such status marks a turnround in interest in gilt trading.
Following the reorganisation of the gilt market at the time of Big Bang,
several houses found they could not make sufficient money and pulled out.
These included both Merrill and Hoare Govett, now owned by ABN-Amro.
The sudden demand for gilt specialists means firms are having to pay dearly
for qualified staff, with market rumours circulating of seven-digit salaries
and three-year guaranteed contracts. Clearly, some Gemms are worried their
best people will be poached by newcomers.
The combination of falling interest rates and high government debt issuance
(after a period in which the government was buying back debt and the size of
the gilt market had shrunk) provide an ideal scenario for making profits out
of gilt trading.
Mr Bob Pearce, head of gilt sales at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Since we left
the ERM, we've been in a major bull market. We've been helped by favourable
financing conditions since the positive shape of the yield curve means there
is a lower funding cost for long positions.'
Gemms as a group - there are 19 - posted an increase in overall profits in
1992 for the third year in a row. Their combined post-tax profit amounted to
Pounds 65m, up from Pounds 49m in 1991, according to the Bank of England.
The overall post-tax return on the Gemms' starting capital was 15 per cent
in 1992, up from 12.4 per cent the previous year.
The table shows the profits made by the Gemms in 1992 and in some cases,
1992/93 (the most recent years for which figures are available), taken from
accounts filed at Companies House.
BZW, the UK securities house, retained its position at the top of the league
for the fourth consecutive year, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 37.174m.
It was helped by the diversity of its trading strategies, which helped to
spread risk, although rivals point out that BZW's figures include not only
gilt trading but also its Eurosterling and Ecu government bond business,
whereas some houses only include their gilt operations in the figures they
file.
The Eurosterling sector has seen record new issuance this year and several
houses are thought to have benefited from this, due to the fact that
Eurosterling bonds offer a better margin (in terms of the bid-offer spread),
and generate fee income for lead managers.
The ranking of Gemms' profits is a matter of much rivalry. 'The fundamental
thing is you don't have a true league table of profits in this area as the
figures are not strictly comparable,' complained one Gemm, who preferred to
remain anonymous.
While 1992 has clearly been a good year for most Gemms, many expect 1993 to
be as good or even better, due to the continued rally in the gilts market
and the prospect of continued new supply. If the immediate future looks
rosy, though, some warn that as interest rates bottom out, 1994 could prove
a more difficult year for making profits.
'You wonder whether some of these chaps who are coming in now are getting in
at the top of the market,' scoffed one veteran of the gilt market.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sculley unveils expansion
strategy for Spectrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Sculley, the former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer,
who last month joined Spectrum Information Technologies, a small technology
development company, yesterday unveiled aggressive expansion plans.
Spectrum said its founder and two other executives had resigned, that it
would cut back a loss-making operation and that it has acquired a small
engineering group.
Mr Sculley's decision to join Spectrum last month shook the computer
industry because the company has a history of losses and legal disputes.
In a lawsuit settlement, Spectrum said it had agreed to pay its shareholders
Dollars 1.5m in cash and issue 750,000 warrants to buy stock at prices at or
above the current market price.
The lawsuit was filed by shareholders in May when Spectrum's stock price
dropped sharply after AT&amp;T challenged the company's claim that a licensing
agreement could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties.
Spectrum admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and said it was trying to
end the 'disruption of basic operations and to avoid the nuisance and costs
of protracted litigation'. It said nearly all the cash payment will be
covered by insurance.
The company said the resignations of Dana Verrill, its founder and former
chairman, John Rule, vice-president of corporate development and Katherine
Bachand, in charge of investor relations, were on amicable terms. It also
announced cuts at its Data One, a mobile communications systems hardware and
related services subsidiary.
'Our strategy now is to move out of direct hardware sales to end-users and
to refocus our communications services investment towards contract
engineering and consulting services,' said Mr Sculley.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tribasa securitises toll road
revenues
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIBASA, the Mexican construction company, has sold Dollars 110m of bonds in
the Euromarkets backed by the revenues from two private toll roads. It is
the first successful international toll road securitisation by a Mexican
company this year.
The bond offering was oversubscribed, with about 80 per cent of the demand
from the US and the remainder from Europe. The bonds, of an average maturity
of 8.5 years, were priced at 10.5 per cent, 500 basis points over US
Treasury bills of the same period.
The demand for the bonds augurs well for other Mexican toll road and
infrastructure securitisations, which bankers say could constitute a
multi-billion dollar market.
The Mexican government has awarded concessions on more than 4,000km of toll
roads in the past five years, and construction companies are keen to
off-load debt by securitising the roads.
The finance ministry is planning to securitise the state-owned
Cuernavaca-Mexico City toll road in the international markets in January
next year. The securitisation, which had originally been planned for
September, may fetch about Dollars 600m.
So far, Mexico's toll road programme has been plagued by the poor
performance of many of the roads, with traffic use far below projections and
construction costs far above. However, the government and construction
companies are working to resolve the problems by agreeing on capital
increases for the troubled roads.
Tribasa sought to reassure investors concerned about a devaluation or low
traffic by agreeing to extend the life of the toll road bonds to 18 years
should US dollar revenues fall short of those forecast.
The two roads securitised were the heavily used Ecatepec-Piramides road near
Mexico City, and the less popular Armera-Manzanillo on the Pacific Cost.

WEAKER export markets caused earnings at Amcoal, the coal arm of the Anglo

previously, in the six months to the end of September 1993, writes Philip
Gawith.
Sales rose to 22.85m tonnes from 20.74m in the same period in 1992, due to
higher exports and increased sales to the electricity utility Escom.
Earnings per share before abnormal items fell to 484 cents from 487 cents
and the dividend was maintained at 150 cents.

subsidiary

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest automobile manufacturer, is setting up a new
financial services subsidiary with the aim of obtaining better financing
conditions for the group's leasing and other financial services activities.
Volkswagen Financial Services, as the company is to be known, will bring
together the number of individual financial services companies that
Volkswagen operates and will have direct access to international capital
markets.
'The new company will make it much easier to access the most favourable
financing rates available on world markets,' Volkswagen said yesterday. 'The
result will be a significant reduction of refinancing costs and an
improvement in the return on the capital committed to the financial services
business.'
The group said yesterday the new company would be used to finance the high
liquidity requirements of the group's financial services activities. Since
the group established a separate financial services division in 1989, the
balance sheet size of these activities has grown from DM14bn (Dollars 8.6bn)
to DM22bn.
Unlike VW's mainstream automobile manufacturing activities, the division is
profitable, making DM270m pre-tax profits last year, up from DM120m in 1989.
Volkswagen said yesterday profits are set to increase again this year.
The new company is to be formed from the merger of financing companies in
France, the UK, Italy, Spain and the former Czechoslovakia as well as
Germany. Outside Germany the existing companies operate in tandem with the
national VW importer.

JAPAN'S two largest shipping companies, Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Mitsui OSK
Lines, blamed their latest profits declines on a fall in imports to their
economically depressed domestic market, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Nippon Yusen's first-half revenue fell 10 per cent to Y268bn (Dollars
2.47bn), on which pre-tax profits collapsed by 49 per cent to Y3.61bn.
Mitsui OSK's first-half taxable profits fell 23.8 per cent to Y2.72bn on
turnover down 8.2 per cent to Y223bn.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Omron gains against the trend

<TEXT>
OMRON, the Japanese maker of control components and health equipment, bucked
the trend of poorer performances caused by recession with a 7.5 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits.
Omron's profits increase in the first half of fiscal 1993 to Y2.16bn
(Dollars 20m) from Y2.01bn a year ago came on higher turnover of Y173.8bn,
up 2.4 per cent from Y169.8bn.
The company, which makes control equipment for factory automation,
electronic fund transfer systems and electronic thermometers, attributed its
better results to a strong rise in export sales despite the yen's
appreciation.
While business in Japan was negatively affected by the virtual freeze on
plant and equipment purchases by Japanese manufacturers, this was more than
offset by strong exports, Omron said.
Exports, which make up less than 20 per cent of Omron's sales, were
particularly buoyant in Asia, which saw a rise of 32 per cent in the first
half. However, sales in the US were also 15 per cent up on the strength of
the economic pick-up in that country. Sales to the EC were also up 9 per
cent.
Omron was not spared the impact of the high yen, which came to about Y1.6bn.
However, it was able to combat the adverse effect of the currency's strength
with cost-cutting efforts in addition to higher sales. The company expects
capital expenditure, for example to fall by Y4bn from its initial forecast
of Y33bn for the year. It has also implemented a programme to cut employee
levels by 1,500 through natural attrition over the next three years.

GOODMAN FIELDER, the Sydney-based food and bakeries group, is to sell its
remaining stake in Ridley Corporation, Australia's largest commercial stock
feed miller, raising approximately ADollars 60m (USDollars 40m) in the
process.
Goodman currently holds around 32.1m ordinary shares in Ridley and 26m
convertible notes - which will be converted into an equivalent number of
shares before the sale takes place.
The total holding sold amounts to a 29.7 per cent interest in the stock feed
company, which also has large salt operations.
Yesterday, SBC Dominguez Barry, which is underwriting the offering at
ADollars 1.03 a share, said that it expected approximately half the shares
to be sold to institutional investors. The other half will be reserved for
priority applications from Goodman Fielder shareholders. Full details of the
offering are promised shortly.
Like many Australian companies, Goodman Fielder has been pruning back its
business recently and concentrating on core operations.

<TEXT>
CSR, the large Australian building materials company, is to invest ADollars
29m (USDollars 19m) in a concrete products joint venture in Taiwan, bringing
its total investment there to ADollars 50m.
The Sydney-based group has also signed a 'strategic business alliance' with
the Taiwanese government, aimed at upgrading the technical capabilities of
Taiwan's building industry and, from CSR's point of view, developing Taiwan
as a 'base to pursue opportunities in building and construction materials in
Asia'.
CSR claimed to be the first Australian company to sign such an agreement,
although it noted that a number of large US corporations, such as AT&amp;T,
General Motors and General Electric, had done so. CSR first established a
presence in Taipei last year, 'to co-ordinate building materials expansion'
in northern Asia.
The joint venture company, CSR Taiwan Humes, will be 75 per cent-owned by
CSR and 25 per cent by Yung Ming Precast, which makes concrete pipes and
pre-cast concrete products.
It plans to build a concrete products factory in Taiwan, which will come
into production by the end of 1994.
CSR said it expected the plant to put particular emphasis on producing PVC
sheet-lined pre-cast concrete pipe and tunnel lining segments, for use in
water and sewerage infrastructure projects.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Minolta again omits payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINOLTA, one of Japan's leading makers of cameras and photocopiers, blamed
depressed profits on a decline in consumer and private capital spending and
a strong yen.
Minolta, which has a high export ratio of nearly 80 per cent, reported a 10
per cent decline in sales for the first half of fiscal 1993 to Y89.2bn
(Dollars 825m) from Y99.5bn a year ago.
The company made a pre-tax loss of Y1.05bn, which was significantly less
than its pre-tax loss of Y4.98bn in the previous first half. However, it is
passing its dividend for the third consecutive term.
It said that despite the introduction of new products its camera division
had suffered a sharp decline in sales of 15 per cent, while its business
machinery division saw sales fall back by 7.9 per cent.
Minolta has made efforts to deal with the impact of the higher yen and weak
demand through price increases, shortening of the time it takes to bring
products to the market and standardisation of parts. It has been cutting
back on recruitment and other costs.
Nevertheless, the company does not expect the main economies of the world to
emerge from their gloom easily.
Minolta is counting on the launch of new camera products to help lift sales
but sees little prospect of improvement in spending by corporations.
As a result, it is forecasting a loss for the full year of Y1bn on sales of
Y188bn and will pass its final dividend.

bond market
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ministry of finance is poised to ease its grip on placements of
yen-denominated bonds issued overseas as part of its continuing deregulation
of the country's financial markets.
Ministry officials said they could come to a decision early next month to
allow Eurobonds issued by sovereign borrowers to be placed with domestic
investors immediately after the issuance.
In order to protect the country's fledgling straight bond market, the
government has tried to keep Eurobonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds
issued overseas from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance.
However, officials said the the 'lock-up' period for Eurobonds issued by
domestic borrowers and corporate overseas borrowers is expected to remain
intact for the time being.
Some securities house officials point out that the eventual lifting of the
placement restriction will make little difference to the Euroyen market.
Japanese securities houses have found their way around the restrictions by
agreeing to 'warehouse' Euroyen issues for three months before selling the
paper off to Japanese investors at the issuing price.
The decision to lift the 'lock-up' rule for sovereign issuers may accelerate
the deterioration of Japan's samurai market, which is currently facing the
departure of top-rated borrowers.
Issuers like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have started to avoid
the samurai market due to the lack of cost differential between borrowers
with low credit ratings and high credit ratings.

AN IMPRESSIVE performance from offshore arm Belron helped Plate Glass and
Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), the glass group in the South African
Breweries (SAB) stable, record a 74 per cent increase in earnings per share
to 241 cents in the six months to the end of September, compared with 138
cents a year ago.
The better performance was largely attributable to better results from
Belron, the automotive glass company.
Domestically, Glass SA's results held steady and PG Bison, the board
company, improved on last year's performance. Management said earnings were
expected to increase in the second half, but at a 'much lower' rate than
during the first half.
Turnover rose by 17 per cent to R1.58bn (Dollars 46.9m) from R1.35bn and
operating profit was 47 per cent higher at R172.5m (R117.2m). Attributable
income rose by 115 per cent to R73.4m (R34m). The dividend was increased by
31 per cent to 85 cents from 65 cents a share.
HIGH financing costs and difficult trading conditions, aggravated by
violence and political disruptions, saw Amrel, the clothing, footwear and
furniture retailer in the SAB group, record a first-half loss of R8.4m
against a R1.9m loss a year earlier.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Solvay seeks to close Austrian
offshoot
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemi-cals group, will today seek agreement to close
down Halvic, the Austrian plastics company in which it has an 82 per cent
stake. The request will come at an extraordinary meeting of Halvic's
shareholders, the group confirmed yesterday.
The remaining 18 per cent of the company, which makes PVC products, is held
by Creditanstalt Bankverein, the Austrian bank with diversified
manufacturing interests.
Halvic has made losses of BFr600m (Dollars 16.6m) in the past three years in
spite of efforts to reduce costs. The recession in western Europe,
'unbridled' competition from east European producers, and high production
costs had made the Austrian company uncompetitive, Solvay said.
Halvic's lack of size - it employs 136 workers - and a narrow domestic
market for PVC products were additional handicaps.
Halvic produces 60,000 tonnes of PVC annually, representing about 5 per cent
of the Solvay group's 1.2m tonnes PVC production capacity.
'Halvic's closure will contribute to bring about a better balance between
PVC supply and demand in Europe,' Solvay said.
A senior executive vice-president at Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals
group, said there were signs of improvement in chemicals prices. However, a
rise in volumes was still not in sight, Reuter reports from Paris.
This meant Rhone-Poulenc's operating profit may improve a little in 1994, he
said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Strong third quarter helps
Lufthansa reduce deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGGRESSIVE cost-cutting helped Lufthansa return to profit in the third
quarter, the state-controlled German airline said yesterday .
It said in the three months ended September it made a parent company pre-tax
profit of DM145m (Dollars 85.8m). This cut the loss for the first nine
months to DM76m, sharply down from the DM262m deficit in the same period
last year.
Lufthansa forecast it would meet its target of halving operating losses by
the end of the year, despite the usual seasonal weakness of the final
quarter.
For the whole of last year, the parent company lost DM297m. The airline's
objective is to reduce this loss to around DM150m for the year as a whole.
Lufthansa said the return to profit in the third quarter was due to
rationalisation rather than any revival in the crisis-stricken airline
industry.
Operating expenditure for the first nine months fell 4.5 per cent, while
personnel costs dropped 9 per cent. In total, the number of group employees
was down by 5,500, or 11 per cent, in the period from mid-1992 to the end of
September this year.
This was against the backdrop of continuing price erosion in the industry.
Prices for passenger flights had dropped by 8 per cent per kilometre over
the last year, and by 2 per cent for freight.
The passenger total rose 3.5 per cent to 25.8m in the nine months, and cargo
volume rose 1.6 per cent to 790,000 tonnes. However, pressure on prices
meant the group's turnover slipped 0.8 per cent to DM11.9bn.
The impact of the fall in revenue was offset by the combination of
cost-cutting and a substantial increase in capacity utilisation, with the
overall load factor climbing by 4.4 per cent to 69 per cent. This led to
better operating results, Lufthansa said.
Separately yesterday, Mr Hemjo Klein, a member of the Lufthansa board, said
the airline would increase prices for internal German flights by DM20 to
DM40 per ticket from the beginning of next year.
Addressing a travel agents' conference in Tunisia, he said prices within
Europe were likely to be increased by between 2 and 10 per cent.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: German exchange rule warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RULES requiring issuers of securities on German stock exchanges to publish a
full prospectus in a so-called 'official stock-market newspaper' should be
done away with, the president of the influential Association of German Banks
said yesterday.
Germany was the only country in Europe to have such a rule, Mr Eberhard
Martini said. This put the German financial markets at a competitive
disadvantage to other European financial centres.
He said it cost between DM75,000 and DM150,000 per prospectus to comply with
the rule, and this could drive business away from Germany.
Mr Martini, chief executive of the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank,
warned the rule increased the tendency of issuers of DM bonds to launch
deals outside Germany. It also hindered the German stock exchanges' attempts
to persuade foreign issuers to seek a listing in Germany.
Mr Martini suggested the proposed law on the reform of the German securities
markets, the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz which received cabinet
approval last week, should be amended to do away with the rule.
The law contains sweeping measures to enhance German financial markets. It
will make insider dealing a criminal offence, and establish a regulatory
body for securities market supervision.
After his official speech yesterday, Mr Martini said the German banking
sector was proving itself one of the most stable in the world.
Despite the deep recession in Germany, he said operating profits would rise
substantially at many banks this year.
However, he warned that these gains would be offset by, in some cases,
'massive' provisions for bad and doubtful debts.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ferfin mulls legal action
against accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW management of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the troubled Italian
industrial group with total borrowings of more than L28,000bn (Dollars
17bn), has proposed legal action against Price Waterhouse, the international
accounting group which audited its books.
The decision, to be put to a shareholders' meeting later this month, is a
second blow to Price Waterhouse. In August, Consob, Italy's companies and
stock markets watchdog, revoked the firm's authorisation to audit Ferfin's
books, on the grounds that it had failed to reveal alleged accounting
mismanagement and political corruption.
Ferfin, which announced a first-half 1993 loss of L1,136bn, accused the
accountants of 'negligence' and 'lack of skill' in auditing its books. Price
Waterhouse was unavailable for comment last night.
Ferfin's new board, largely appointed by the group of five Italian creditor
banks which recently prepared a restructuring plan, also issued a tough
warning to foreign bank creditors still undecided about the proposed debt
moratorium and reorganisation.
Continued opposition to the plan beyond November 30 could risk the salvage
operation, Ferfin warned. It has called a special shareholders' meeting at
the end of this month to approve a substantial capital increase.
To underline the claim that the group remained fundamentally sound, Ferfin
issued partial nine-month figures showing a continuing improvement in its
performance.
Group sales jumped 16.4 per cent, to L16,779bn, while gross operating
profits rose 26 per cent to L1,987bn.
In an attempt to win over recalcitrant foreign banks, many of which have
been incensed by the restructuring plans, Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman,
last week held talks in New York with Citibank, a leading foreign creditor.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Merck wins go-ahead for Dollars
6bn takeover of Medco
</HEADLINE>

US anti-trust authorities yesterday cleared the proposed Dollars 6bn
takeover by Merck, the US's largest drugs group, of Medco Containment
Services, the country's biggest drugs distributor. The go-ahead could open
the door to a further reshaping of the country's pharmaceuticals industry.
The Federal Trade Commission had asked Merck in September for information
about the proposed acquisition, suggesting it might seek to challenge the
deal. Yesterday, though, Merck said it had received FTC clearance even
before it had supplied all of the requested evidence.
The acquisition is now likely to be completed on November 18, when Medco
shareholders vote on the proposal. News of the FTC clearance lifted Medco's
share price by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 , while Merck's shares fell
back on fears that the takeover would dilute the company's earnings and not
yield the hoped-for benefits.
The deal signals Merck's belief that pressure to hold down drug prices will
force manufacturers instead to fight for market share. By acquiring Medco,
Merck, which claims a near-8 per cent share of the US market, would control
the distribution channel through which drugs are supplied to 33m people in
the US.
Before obtaining FTC approval, Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive,
said: 'We're not just trying to remodel Merck, we're trying to remodel the
entire industry. The rest of the sector normally follows what we do.'
Dr Vagelos said access to Medco's database, which carries details of the
drugs taken by people covered by the company, as well as the outcome of
courses of treatment, would enable Merck to target its drugs more precisely.
Access to greater information would also make it easier for Merck to price
'capitation' services, under which it meets all of a person's drug needs for
the year for a flat fee agreed in advance, he added.
The FTC's clearance is likely to intensify the debate among other drugs
companies about the merits of vertical integration in the industry. Merck's
surprise move, announced in July, has given it a clear lead over rival
manufacturers, most of whom have set up urgent studies into whether they
should follow suit.
However, other industry executives question whether Merck is overpaying for
Medco, and whether access to Medco's database will give Merck the advantages
it claims.
Health insurance companies and health management organisations already have
databases with more information on the outcomes of drug treatments than that
maintained by Medco, said Mr Raul Cesan, president of Schering Laboratories
in the US, part of Schering-Plough.

plan

NORWAY'S finance ministry plans to make public a condensed version of a
confidential report laying out options for possible mergers between the big
four Norwegian banks.
It said yesterday the report, prepared by Davis International Banking
Consultants of the UK, had gone missing. As a result, a condensed version
would be made available.
The report, commissioned last year by the ministry, had a mandate to make
recommendations about the structure of Norway's banking industry with a view
to improving profitability.
The report has apparently gone missing from the office of a member of the
board of Norway's state-backed Bank Insurance Fund.
The ministry said it had not made any decisions about recommendations in the
report. 'In the discussion of possible merger solutions, all combinations
between the four largest banks are considered,' the ministry said.
Norway's four biggest banks, ranked by assets, include Den norske Bank
(DnB), Christiania Bank, Sparebanken Nor, known internationally as Union
Bank of Norway, and Fokus Bank.
'The report considers different measures to improve the profitability of
Norway's banking business, among other things possible adjustments to the
banks' domestic and international networks of subsidiaries and possible
merger solutions,' the ministry said.
Norway's banks have just begun to emerge from a six-year crisis. Christiania
Bank plans to launch a public share issue this year, while DnB said it would
issue shares some time next year.
Against this background, the contents of the missing report are likely to
raise a number of extremely sensitive political and stock market issues.
The sector's fall into heavy losses forced the state to take a controlling
share in three of the four biggest banks. Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest
savings bank, remained independent.
Norway has refused to allow its banks to establish so-called 'bad banks',
into which defaulted loans are placed in a bid to speed recovery and protect
healthy operations.
DnB said the bank had no plans to merge. Christiania Bank refused to comment
on the report.
The report also suggests a further concentration of the savings banks and
'sees Sparebanken Nor as the natural centre for such a process'. The report
also sees the state-backed Post Bank and Post Giro as possible merger
candidates for the banks.

FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Buy-out to cost Ina L580bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSITALIA, the Italian non-life insurance group, was suspended from trading
on the Milan stock exchange yesterday after Friday's announcement that its
majority shareholder intended to buy out the minority stake.
Assitalia, one of Italy's biggest general insurers, is controlled by Ina,
the state-owned life insurance group due to be privatised next year.
The buy-out represents a cleaning-up operation by Ina, after advice by its
bankers that privatisation would be easier if shareholders were offered
stock in a full-range life and non-life group.
Buying out the Assitalia minorities, which own 40.5 per cent of the company,
is expected to cost Ina at least L580bn (Dollars 353m), based on Friday's
pre-suspension share price of L9,538.
Ina is expected to reveal its formal offer price later this week. However,
the deal may also involve some mechanism allowing Assitalia shareholders to
swap into Ina stock on privatisation.
The Assitalia deal is the second big financial transaction launched by Ina
in recent weeks.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ward Thomas takes the helm at Yorkshire TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WARD THOMAS, who started Yorkshire Television and put it together with
Tyne Tees until the old Independent Broadcasting Authority split the two
asunder in 1982, was back again in the chairman's chair at Leeds yesterday.
Mr Thomas had lunch with Mr Clive Leach, the outgoing chairman and chief
executive whose resignation he sought over the weekend. As Mr Leach left
after more than 20 years at the company, Mr Thomas assured staff that
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had suffered 'a bad hiccup, but it is no more than a bad
hiccup'.
The dimension of the 'hiccup' resulting from overselling of advertising time
is certainly around Pounds 9m, something that will push the Yorkshire group
into a pre-tax loss for the year to September 1993. The loss is likely to be
less than Pounds 5m.
A financial settlement has already been reached with Mr Leach, who was on a
three-year rolling contract, although the settlement, it is believed, was
aimed mainly at protecting Mr Leach's pension rights. No decision has yet
been taken on whether Yorkshire will seek a new chief executive.
It is possible that Mr Ward Thomas, who has moved from his home in the south
of France to the UK because of his growing involvement with the ITV group,
may continue to run the company together with Mr John Fairlie, managing
director of Yorkshire, and Mr John Calvert, managing director of Tyne Tees.
As Mr Thomas embarks on the task of trying to reverse the decline in the
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees share of ITV advertising - now down below 10.5 per cent
 -there were growing rumours in ITV that Yorkshire was not the only ITV
company that has been overtrading.
Mr Kenneth Miles, director of the Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers, said yesterday: 'It's not just Yorkshire, there are certainly
others doing the same thing but Yorkshire was doing it in spades.'
Mr Miles added: 'It matters to the extent that somebody is losing money and
it can't only be the television station.'
ITV companies usually sell their advertising through deals linked to the
station average price. This is dependent on an individual company's share of
advertising revenue and viewing levels.
When advertising is sold on too optimistic a station average price,
advertisers get a discount, usually in the form of further advertising
slots. At extreme levels, companies run out of airtime in which to fit the
discounted advertising, and the problem is rolled up from month to month -
until, as in Yorkshire's case, the music stops. Industry gossip suggests
that both Granada and Carlton are both a little 'overdealt'.
Granada said last night: 'We are not overtrading. We are trading in our
normal way.'
Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the advertising sales house which
sells airtime for Central, Anglia and Ulster, said yesterday that 'in the
end it is necessary to have fewer ITV companies and fewer and more equitably
balanced sales houses'.
That, Mr Wootton believes, is the only way to solve the problem and also the
only way 'you will get ITV to punch its weight'.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Better third quarter for Holmes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLMES PROTECTION, the US security group which is quoted in the UK, got back
on its recovery track in the third quarter, reporting a pre-tax profit of
Dollars 239,000 (Pounds 158,000) for the nine months to end-September.
Though well below the Dollars 4.76m achieved in the corresponding period
last year, when profits were boosted by exceptional items totalling Dollars
2.99m, the outcome at the period end represents an encouraging advance on
the pre-tax profit of Dollars 133,000 reported at the half-way stage.
Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, said the company's performance in the third
quarter, while still below expectations, showed an improvement over the
second quarter, and reflected the initial steps taken to reduce expenses.
Turnover for the nine months slipped from Dollars 42.1m to Dollars 40.4m.
Earnings came out at 0.2 cents (48.5 cents).
The company has negotiated an expanded credit facility with its bankers in
the form of a Dollars 9m five-year term loan and a Dollars 3m revolving
loan. The facilities will be used to replace existing short-term borrowings
of Dollars 6m, to finance acquisitions, and provide working capital.
Since the period-end, Holmes had reached agreement for the acquisition of
two subscriber monitoring contracts and certain related assets providing
some Dollars 1.6m of annual recurring revenue. The consideration - subject
to the performance of the assets - is Dollars 3.75m net of costs. This sum
has been drawn from the new credit facility.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telspec set for London market listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELSPEC, a fast-growing manufacturer of sophisticated electronic
telecommunications equipment, plans to come to market next month through a
placing and intermediaries offer likely to value the company at more than
Pounds 40m.
The group, founded in 1975 by Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, an Australian
electronics engineer with broad international experience, manufactures
equipment which helps telephone operators improve the efficiency of their
networks and reduces the cost of installing or expanding local telephone
services.
Mr Hackett-Jones, Telspec's chairman, is expected to sell about 35 per cent
of his personal stake in the group as part of the flotation, which he said
was designed principally to lift the group's profile and provide it with 'a
sound financial base for future development'.
However, the flotation will also be used to raise new funds for the company.
Mr Garth Riley, Telspec's chief executive, said the new funds will be used
to expand Telspec's overseas marketing operations. 'It is a growing industry
and there are lots of opportunities,' he said.
The group, which spends about 10 per cent of its turnover on research and
development, has manufacturing operations in Rochester, Kent and near
Melbourne in Australia and employs about 240 people. It is also considering
setting up joint-venture manufacturing operations in south-east Asia to
address emerging markets including China.
The group has grown rapidly in recent years, buoyed by the wave of
telecommunications privatisations and market liberalisations. In the year to
December 31 the group posted pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3.4m on
turnover of Pounds 18m.
Its main customers include BT, Telecom Australia, Cable &amp; Wireless and
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, and it supplies a rapidly growing segment of
the telecommunications market in Europe and elsewhere.
In the developed world many PTT monopolies have recently invested heavily in
converting their main 'trunk' networks to digital technology in preparation
for new competition.
However, telecommunications network operators are reluctant to invest in the
'local loop' - the part of the network which connects local subscribers to
the telephone exchange - because of the long payback time.
For example, BT estimates that the existing local loop is used about 4
minutes each day and that it costs Pounds 1,500 to connect one new
subscriber.
Most of Telspec's products are aimed at improving the capacity or usage of
existing local telephone lines, traditionally based on a 'twisted pair' of
copper cables or, in the case of new installations, reducing the cost.
The group's products include 'pair gain' equipment, which enables more than
one call to be carried on a single line; 'line concentrators', which allow a
large group of subscribers to share a small group of telephone lines; and
line amplifiers and extenders, which enable calls to be carried over longer
distances.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, financial advisers for the issue, are expected to
issue Telspec's pathfinder prospectus later this month with dealings set to
begin in early December.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Arjo shares advance to SKr121.5 as
conditional trading gets under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Arjo, the Swedish international healthcare group, closed at
SKr121.5 as conditional trading started in London yesterday.
The shares were priced last week at SKr112, giving a market capitalisation
of SKr2.3bn (Pounds 189m).
Arjo, which is raising SKr1.43bn before expenses, has applied to be listed
on both the London and Swedish stock exchanges.
It expects the listings to become effective and unconditional dealings to
begin next Monday.
The group intends to use the money to reduce its net borrowings of
SKr1.43bn. Last month it forecast a pre-tax loss of SKr140.9m for the year
ending September 30, but it estimated that without the debt operating
profits would have been SKr175.2m on turnover of SKr1.1bn.
A total of 14.55m ordinary shares were on offer. Of these 2.05m were placed
with Warburg, Pincus Investors and 310,000 were placed with Arjo employees
and Swedish retail investors.
The remainder were placed with international institutions, 40 per cent in
the UK, 20 per cent in the US and 40 per cent, including a large slice to
Sweden, in Europe. Demand was roughly equal to allocation.
After the offering Arjo's leading shareholder will be Warburg, Pincus with
23.3 per cent. CWB Capital Partners will hold 11.5 per cent and the
management 2.3 per cent.
Arjo claims to be the world leader in hygiene and lifting systems for
elderly and disabled patients, with customers in 40 countries. Half the
manufacturing is in Sweden, 25 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the US.
Arjo was the subject of a leveraged buy-out in 1990 from Malmros
International, a Swedish conglomerate.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: EW Fact makes Pounds 11m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EW Fact, the USM-quoted accountancy training group with a market
capitalisation of just Pounds 7.82m, is to pay Pounds 11m for Accountancy
Tutors Limited.
Mr Suresh Tanna, Fact managing director, said that at his company's
suspended share price of 104p the enlarged company would have a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 18m. A full market listing has been applied
for.
The company was to have announced the merger last week with its interim
results, but, although the acquisition price had been settled, not all the
documentation had been finalised.
Mr Tanna said that Fact and ATL were in the same market but had different
customer bases. Further, Fact is represented in north and central London,
Manchester and Leeds, while ATL has a presence in south London, Southampton
and Dublin.
The Pounds 11m consideration is to be satisfied by the issue of 9.9m new
ordinary shares at Pounds 1 and of Pounds 1.1m of loan notes. The loan notes
are to be allotted to Mr Dhanraj Gidwaney, the founder of ATL, as are
900,000 of the ordinary shares, which he cannot dispose of for two years.
Another 987,000 of the ordinaries will go to seven of ATL's shareholders and
cannot be disposed of until April 6.
Qualifying shareholders can apply for the 8.77m placing shares in the open
offer on a 7-for-6 basis.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge lifts Prowting to
Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Prowting, the Middlesex-based housebuilder which nine
weeks ago acquired Galliford Homes for Pounds 22.6m, jumped from Pounds
120,000 to Pounds 520,000 during the six months to the end of August.
The first half improvement was due mainly to reduced interest payments which
fell from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.01m.
Operating profits by comparison declined from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 1.5m as
gross margins came under pressure following house price falls when sterling
left the exchange rate mechanism.
House prices have since stabilised and Prowting expects margins to improve
further as house builders ease back on sales incentives and volume sales of
houses increase.
Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said that the acquisition of Galliford
would have a positive impact on Prowting's earnings in the first year.
He said the combined businesses should sell 650 to 700 homes this year,
equivalent to 900 to 1,000 homes in a full 12 months. During the first six
months of this year, without the benefit of Galliford, sales had risen by
only 11 from 154 to 165.
'We are delighted with the Galliford purchase which will increase the number
of sales outlets and enable us to take full advantage of our existing land
holdings,' Mr Roydon said.
He added that the group currently held 6,200 plots available for development
at an average cost of just Pounds 10,700. Sales of 1,000 homes a year would
still leave the group with a six-year land bank.
Mr Roydon said that after slowing in September, house sales had accelerated
in October. He appealed to the Chancellor to do nothing in the Budget to
upset the fragile returning confidence of prospective house buyers.
The positive cash flow from housebuilding had enabled the group to reduce
net borrowings from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 6m at the end of August.
Following the purchase of Galliford net debt had risen to Pounds 30.8m,
equivalent to 44 per cent of shareholders' funds of the merged businesses.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 1.7p from earnings of 0.3p
(losses 0.3p) per share.
For the full year analysts are expecting the group to make profits of Pounds
3.5m to Pounds 4m compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 4.93m. The
return to the black would provide sufficient earnings to cover a forecast
maintained final dividend of 1.7p.
Prowting shares, of which the Prowting family holds 61 per, slipped 3p to
145p yesterday.

issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett Emerging Markets, an investment trust specialising in shares quoted
on the stock markets of developing countries, is planning to more than
double its size via a Pounds 30m issue of 'C' shares.
The trust was only launched in July, when the issue raised Pounds 25m. Net
assets per share have risen by 23.5 per cent since launch, according to
Govett.
A number of emerging markets funds have either been launched, or have
expanded their capital, over the last two years.
The directors pointed out that the use of 'C' shares is now common for
investment trusts which want to expand their capital.
The 'C' shares will be converted into ordinary shares only after the bulk of
the new money has been invested.

<TEXT>
With income static and no exceptionals to boost this year's figure, Estates
&amp; Agency Holdings, which owns property investments in the UK, saw pre-tax
profits for the year to June 30 slide from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 708,000.
Operating profit was down from Pounds 787,000 to Pounds 708,000 and there
were no exceptionals this year (Pounds 324,000). Income was Pounds 5.06m
(Pounds 5.05m). Earnings per share came out at 9.64p - a 7.33p decline of
which 5.4p relates to the exceptional income taken in 1992.
The delayed sale of the site at Marsh Mills in Plymouth has now been
completed and the directors can therefore recommend a final dividend for
both 1992 and 1993, of 2p and 7p respectively. With the addition of the
interim of 0.5p (1992 2.5p and 0.5p) this makes an increased total for the
year of 7.5p (5p).

THE TAKEOVER Panel is likely to give a rap on the knuckles to Mitchell

disclosed 24 transactions in the shares of Spring Ram, the UK kitchens and

The transactions dated from late August to mid-October, and all should have

Ram was in bid talks until the end of last month with Masco Corporation, the
US building products firm, but these have now ended.
Mitchell Hutchins' stake in Spring Ram peaked at 1.74 per cent in
mid-September and stood at just over 1 per cent after its most recent

CELLTECH, the bio-technology company that issued a pathfinder prospectus
yesterday, plans to reserve a fifth of the shares for sale in Switzerland.
The Slough-based company, which is a leader in genetic engineering of
antibodies, has contracts to manufacture a series of monoclonal antibodies
for Roche, the Swiss drugs group.
The flotation will raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m for the company's
existing drug development programme, and will value Celltech at about Pounds
180m. The shares will be priced on November 25 and the offer closes on
December 2.
The administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth, who currently hold over 36 per
cent of the shares, will end up with a less than 10 per cent stake after
selling in the flotation.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Angry Ferranti holders form group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISGRUNTLED Ferranti shareholders, concerned about GEC's proposed 1p a share
bid for the troubled defence electronics group, plan to form a shareholders'
association to obtain independent professional advice on the offer and to
represent their views.
The association is being formed by Mr John Katz, an investment consultant
who has emerged as the central figure in the discontented Ferranti ranks. He
has also gained support among other shareholders.
'Following newspaper comment that I was looking at the proposed GEC offer
for certain shareholders, I have been besieged by shareholders wanting to be
part of a concerted group,' Mr Katz said. More than 400 shareholders,
representing about 20m shares, had contacted him so far.
Mr Katz, who runs the investment research consultancy John Katz &amp;
Associates, said yesterday that the planned Ferranti shareholders'
association would have a number of objectives including obtaining all
necessary information on the merits of GEC's Pounds 10.1m offer.
This would involve establishing independent values for Ferranti's fixed and
intangible assets, including its Pounds 172m order book, putting a value on
the group's operating subsidiaries and obtaining commercial valuations for
other intangible assets including the group's unutilised tax losses.
The association would also deal with the Ferranti directors and their
advisers as a group representing a significant stake in the company 'with a
view to coming into an active negotiating position to achieve a 'stay in'
position with a chance of recovery for all or part of members holdings'.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Forte dispute poised to resume - Two sides
begin talks on who will take over the chair at Savoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPUTE between Forte and the Savoy group could resume today as the two
sides begin discussions over who should take over the leadership of the
Savoy's hotels.
Forte is expected to resist strongly any attempt to elevate Mr Giles
Shepard, Savoy's managing director, to the chairmanship when the Savoy board
meets today. Forte is also expected to oppose any move to make Mr John
Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, the chairman. Both parties
refused to comment.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, and Mr Donald Main, the group's finance
director, both sit on the Savoy board. An acrimonious 1980s takeover battle
left Forte with a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of voting shares.
Sir Anthony Tuke, Savoy's current chairman, is expected to retire in May
next year. Both sides regard him as having been even-handed. Forte is
thought to oppose the appointment of Mr Shepard or Mr Kemp-Welch on the
grounds that they have been too closely associated with Savoy.
Forte's favoured candidate is thought to be Sir Michael Richardson, chairman
of brokers Smith New Court.
The two sides are believed to be closer in their candidate to be chief
executive: both favour Mr Willi Bauer, chief executive of the Wentworth golf
and country club group.
Mr Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy, held talks with Forte during
the summer about becoming the head of the Forte Exclusive portfolio of
hotels, which includes the Hyde Park in London, the George V in Paris and
the Ritz in Madrid.
Mr Bauer said he decided not to take the Forte job because it would have
required too much foreign travel.
Running the Savoy group, whose hotels also include Claridge's and the
Connaught, would involve less foreign travel than the Forte job. Although Mr
Forte and Mr Bauer clashed strongly during Forte's bid for the Savoy, their
recent discussions are said to have been amicable.
Mr Bauer was unavailable for comment. He is believed, however, to have been
approached by the Savoy. He dined at Claridge's with Mr Shepard last Sunday
night.
Under an agreement between the two parties, Forte has said it will give 12
months notice of its intention to bid for Savoy.
The right to give notice began at the beginning of this month. As it is a
rolling 12-month period, it will be difficult for Forte to activate, as
giving notice would probably result in an increase in the Savoy share price.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ShareLink surges to Pounds 3.7m amid high
market activity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARELINK Investment Services, the telephone based stockbroker, more than
quadrupled its interim profits as stock market activity reached
exceptionally high levels.
In its first figures since coming to the market last July, ShareLink
announced that in the six months to September 30, it had pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.68m compared with Pounds 785,000 for the same period of 1992.
This translated into earnings per share of 16.07p against 3.73p, and
permitted the payment of a maiden interim dividend of 3p, 20 per cent more
than predicted in the listing prospectus.
Profits were inflated by Pounds 1.47m earned from handling part of the
government sale of BT shares, but there was also a 46 per cent increase over
the 1992-93 first half in the volume of personal share dealings handled by
ShareLink. Turnover rose to Pounds 11.25m from Pounds 6.04m in the
comparable half.
In the normal course of events ShareLink earns the greater part of its
profits in the second half, reflecting the faster tempo of share dealings as
the financial year nears its end.
But, this financial year, warned Mr Richard Fielding, the chairman, 'the
normal distribution of profits between the first and second halves is likely
to be affected by the abnormally high level of dealing activity during the
summer'.
ShareLink has been widening its client base and introducing new products so
that it now consistently handles some 10 per cent of all stock exchange
transactions.
It is this enlarging business, manifest in the 143 per cent rise in first
half profits after stripping out the effects of the BT privatisation, that
led Mr Fielding to estimate that there are 'good prospects for further
growth.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in two of the new Lloyd's investment trusts began trading yesterday.
Hiscox Select Insurance Fund immediately moved to a 10p premium compared to
net asset value with the shares closing at 110p.
Hiscox has raised some Pounds 30m in capital. The larger HCG Lloyd's
Investment Trust, which raised Pounds 65m when it was launched late last
month, closed 1p up at 101p.
Trading was relatively light with 765,000 shares in Hiscox and 112,000
shares in HCG changing hands. Analysts suggest investor interest in listed
shares will be restricted until all the trusts have come to the market.
'They are coming thick and fast at the moment. Interest will be limited
until they are all fully traded,' said one specialist.
Ten trusts have now raised more than Pounds 600m in equity capital to
support underwriting at the Lloyd's market. Two of the largest schemes,
London Insurance Market Investment Trust and CLM Insurance Fund were both
launched last week.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys declines to Pounds 8.04m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARDLE Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment company which has more
than Pounds 30m cash, showed full year pre-tax profits down, mainly because
of lower interest earnings and an accounting change.
The company had flagged difficult conditions in its last report and
accounts, but shares fell 17p to close at 431p.
The company said interest rates are likely to fall further, while trading
conditions in the UK showed no sign of recovery and continental European
markets were in 'disarray'.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 9.81m to Pounds 8.04m in the year to August
31 on sales of Pounds 53.2m (Pounds 50.6m). Under FRS 3, Wardle
re-classified a Pounds 563,000 extraordinary gain as an exceptional, which
raised the comparative figure.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said: 'We have been trying like hell to
make an acquisition. No-one, least of all me because I own 13 per cent of
the company, is unaware that we ought to transfer that cash into operational
assets.
'It is easy to make an acquisition but difficult to make a good one.'
Mr Taylor said profits over the past three years had been a function of
introducing new products as much as efficiency measures. Cost cutting could
not go on indefinitely but he said the company had proven its ability to
increase the yield from raw materials and to make all kinds of economies on
a continuing basis.
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 5.84m (Pounds 5.93m) and net cash fell
slightly with interest income down at Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 3.32m).
Earnings per share dropped to 21.7p (25p) and the board is recommending a
final dividend of 12.25p (12p) giving a total for the year of 17.25p (16p).
COMMENT
Wardle's reliably good yield should provide some support for its shares.
However, the market is unhappy about continuing poor trading conditions and
disappointed by these results notwithstanding Wardle's early warnings. The
figures include the benefit of a roughly 10 per cent drop in the price of
PVC, a significant raw material for the company's largest division,
technical products. This drop reversed in October. Meanwhile both the City
and the company know the key is putting the company's cash to better use by
acquisition. On forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.5m earnings rise to
23.1p giving a multiple of 20 times which is unlikely to find many buyers.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: One-off factors help ABF to Pounds 338m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH profits from Associated British Foods, the Kingsmill bread, Ryvita
and Burton biscuits, and Silver Spoon sugar group, were significantly above
market expectations, much of the 26.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 338m was due to one-off factors and higher investment income.
The period covered 53 weeks, with the extra week adding about Pounds 5m to
pre-tax profits. Translation effects added Pounds 9m to profits.
Operating profits were only 1.5 per cent higher at Pounds 273m. Within that,
trading profits from the British Sugar beet business rose from Pounds 139m
to Pounds 162m thanks to a record harvest in 1992-93, the revaluation of the
green pound and greater efficiencies. This year's harvest was lower but
still good, Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said.
Total manufacturing operating profits from the UK and Europe, including
British Sugar, were Pounds 200m, up from Pounds 191m.
Retail profits, mainly the Irish supermarket business, were down from Pounds
45m to Pounds 34m, but this included a Pounds 10m fall to Pounds 13m in the
first half. Mr Weston said price cutting in the first half had eased in the
second and ABF had recovered market share.
Profits from Australia and New Zealand were up 16.1 per cent to Pounds 36m
mainly through translation gains. North America, largely Twinings tea,
contributed Pounds 3m, a Pounds 1m rise.
Pre-tax profits also included investment income of Pounds 83m (Pounds 67m)
less interest of Pounds 34m (Pounds 41m). The group's net cash holdings rose
from Pounds 409m in the 1992 balance sheet to over Pounds 500m. There was a
Pounds 4m (Pounds 2m) profit on property sales.
ABF recorded a Pounds 12m rise in the value of its 18.8 per cent stake in
Berisford International, after losing Pounds 22m on the shares in 1992 and
Pounds 100m in 1991.
Earnings rose 37 per cent to 50.7p. A second interim dividend of 6.5p (5.5p)
makes a 15p (14p) total.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: National Australia Bank to develop UK
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank is seeking to build up a life and pensions operation
in the UK, and is considering acquisitions, joint ventures or the creation
of a new life company.
The Melbourne-based bank - which owns the Yorkshire, Clydesdale, Northern
and National Irish banks in the UK and Ireland - has appointed a team of
senior executives to develop the insurance activities of these four
subsidiaries.
This will be headed by Mr John Windeler, currently NAB's chief financial
officer, who recently relocated to the UK. NAB has also recruited three
British insurance industry executives - Mr Michael Pinder, formerly
marketing director at Prudential Life and Pensions, Mr Jonathan Rasleigh,
who was finance and operations director at Legal &amp; General Investment
Management, and Mr Richard Field, from the TSB Group.
Mr Windeler made clear that, aside from expanding existing 'independent
financial adviser' operations, NAB is considering a range of ways in which
to build up the UK insurance business. These could include acquisitions, a
life company 'start-up', or joint venture arrangements.
NAB is seen as one of the strongest of Australia's banks, and analysts note
that there has been emphasis recently on 'cross-selling' - not only within
traditional banking products, but also including insurance and
superannuation schemes.
There has also been speculation that the company would hit the acquisition
trail, looking both within its existing geographical areas and, possibly,
the US.
The planned move into the UK life insurance and pensions industry comes at a
time when over-capacity is widely recognised as a problem in the British
life industry, and the regulatory regime for companies is expected to become
tougher in the immediate future.
But Mr Michael Wadsworth, partner in the insurance practice at consulting
actuaries R Watson and Co, said that the prospect of a shake-out in the
industry would not dismay newcomers confident they had a competitive
advantage which would enable them to continue, and perhaps even to benefit
from the inability of other offices to survive. 'Banks and building
societies appear to have the potential to sell long-term products to
customers at lower cost,' he said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning slices 155p off Bespak
share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE third time this year difficulties in the US health market have sent
shares in Bespak, the healthcare manufacturing group, tumbling.
They dropped 165p in early trading yesterday before recovering 10p to close
at 318p.
The company said that recent announcements by its largest US customer, US
Surgical, had prompted the board to warn that group profits for the first
six months to October would be half the comparative figure of Pounds 5.01m.
Bespak said a decrease in business with US Surgical which accounts for about
a quarter of the company's sales, together with uncertainties among other
healthcare customers, meant that sales in dollar terms were lower than in
the first half in the previous period.
The company said its cost base had been built up in anticipation of
increased activity.
US Surgical has 85 per cent of the market for laparoscopic devices for use
in keyhole surgery. Mr Bob King, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The
board is totally confident that its overall strategy is right. We had to be
bigger in the US.
'There is a one-off situation relating to our major customer in the states
which is reducing stocks considerably. This comes at a time when one or two
other people, in response to the Clinton healthcare reforms, are also
de-stocking.'
Analysts cut pre-tax profit forecasts to roughly Pounds 6m for the year from
Pounds 13.5m having already shaved about Pounds 1m off earlier predictions.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Birth of the world's biggest paints group: Paul Abrahams and
Christopher Brown-Humes report on a Pounds 1.38bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's merger between Akzo of the Netherlands and Nobel of Sweden is
the largest transaction in the European chemicals industry for a decade.
The industrial and financial logic of the complex deal, effectively a
takeover of Nobel by Akzo, is impeccable. Akzo assumes Nobel's crippling
debts of SKr10.7bn (Pounds 880m) and refinances them at far lower cost. At
the same time the Dutch group acquires Nobel's chemicals and coatings
operations, creating the largest paints group in the world.
The financial aspects of the deal are elegant. Securum, the state-owned
Swedish investment vehicle, is paying Akzo SKr4.1bn for parts of Nobel,
including the biotechnology division and Spectra-Physics, its
electrical-optical instruments operation. Securum will also take on SKr1.2bn
debt, reducing Akzo's difficulties in financing the acquisition's
borrowings.
The Dutch group also intends to redeem Nobel's high-yield preference shares
which had proved burdensome. To pay for the preference shares and reduce
debts further, Akzo is issuing stock to raise Fl 1.3bn. Mr Aarnout Loudon,
Akzo's chairman, said he expected Akzo-Nobel, the new company, to have
gearing of about 50 per cent.
Mr Lars Thunell, Securum chief executive, said: 'Today's agreement means
that industrial operations which had been damaged through connections with
real estate and finance companies will now be financially sound and in the
proper industrial environment.'
As for industrial logic, Mr Loudon explained: 'The two businesses are really
an excellent fit. We're wondering why we did not arrive at the conclusion
earlier. When you take out the financial charges and financial hedging
problems Nobel has been having, these are well run businesses. Some are
better run than divisions at Akzo.'
Nobel made operating profits after depreciation last year of SKr1.28bn, but
after financial expenses, profit only amounted to SKr237m.
The driving force behind the deal is the benefit to be derived from
combining the companies' coatings operations. On 1992 figures, the new group
would have annual coatings sales of about Fl 6.3bn (Pounds 2.2bn), making it
the world's largest coatings concern, bigger than Imperial Chemical
Industries' operations which last year had sales of Pounds 1.58bn.
Akzo-Nobel will be one of the strongest forces in the European decorative
paints market with annual sales of Fl 2.5bn.
The chemicals operations should also benefit from the merger, according to
Mr Loudon. Nobel is the world leader in pulp bleaching and second in paper
chemicals. By combining the two businesses, Akzo-Nobel will also have a good
position in the manufacture of monochloro acetic acid. Some rationalisation
of the combined detergent surfactants operations, particularly fatty amines
production, would be required, he said. 'There are plenty of opportunities
for the chemicals operations to prove that the sum of one plus one is more
than two.'
Akzo-Nobel will continue to rationalise businesses from both companies, he
said. However, as neither company had significant operations in the other's
home country, there should be few job losses in either the Netherlands of
Sweden. Apart from fatty amine production no plants would be closed, he
added.
The merger still has hurdles to overcome. The deal requires 90 per cent
acceptance from Nobel shareholders, as well as the approval of Akzo
shareholders.
Potentially the biggest obstacle is the EC's competition directorate. The
combined paints operations in Belgium and the UK could cause some concern.
However, Akzo said yesterday that even if the EC decided to investigate the
merger, it would not halt the integration of the non-affected businesses.
Mr Loudon said he did not underestimate the difficulties of merging the two
cultures, although he added there were likely to be fewer difficulties
between the Swedes and Dutch than, say, the Swedes and French.
The Dutch company has been at pains to take into account the feelings of the
Swedes who are clearly junior partners. Two members of the 11-strong
supervisory board will be Swedish, Mr Ove Mattsson, Nobel chief executive,
will join the new company's board of management and run the European
coatings oper-ations. The group has also undertaken to continue R&amp;D in
Sweden and to maintain a number of units, including the paper chemicals and
interior coatings.
Meanwhile, Securum will continue to exert influence on the new group through
a 20 per cent stake. Mr Loudon expected Securum to dispose of some of its
stake in a year's time when a stand-still agreement ends.
Akzo-Nobel's next challenge is to generate the synergies it has promised. Mr
Loudon pointed out that Akzo's last quarter indicated that the European
economy may have bottomed out. If so, he added, the merger could have been
perfectly timed.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Akzo to take over Nobel Industries: Paul Abrahams and
Christopher Brown-Humes report on a pounds 1.38bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AKZO and Nobel Industries, two leading European specialty chemicals groups,
yesterday announced a deal under which Akzo will pay SKr16.6bn (Pounds
1.38bn) to take control of Nobel, creating the world's biggest paints group.
Akzo of the Netherlands is making an agreed all-share offer for Nobel,
valuing the Swedish company at SKr29.6 per share, 35 per cent above the
SKr22 level at which its shares were suspended last week.
The combined group, Akzo- Nobel, will have revenues of more than Fl 20bn
(Pounds 7bn) and around 75,000 employees.
It will be bigger than Imperial Chemical Industries, of the UK, in the world
coatings market, and become the second biggest pulp and paper chemicals
producer. The groups say their operations complement each other industrially
and geographically, enabling them to boost market share and profitability.
The deal is a neat solution for the Swedish state, which owns 72.9 per cent
of Nobel through a bad debt unit called Securum. It enables Securum to sell
Nobel as a package for a SKr5.4bn capital gain, while offloading much of the
group's debt on to Akzo. It will gain a 20 per cent stake in Akzo-Nobel.
Nobel's interests in Spectra-Physics, biotechnology and the defence group
Celsius will be acquired by Securum for SKr5.3bn, including debt.
Akzo is offering two new shares for every 57 Nobel A or B shares, and a cash
alternative worth SKr26.5 per share. It has also agreed to take over the
group's preference stock for cash and shares. The Dutch group plans to raise
Fl 1.3bn through an institutional placement to fund the cash parts of the
deal.
Akzo said the merger would dilute earnings by less than 10 per cent in the
first year. Synergy benefits, estimated at Fl 180m, are expected to enhance
earnings thereafter.
Akzo shares closed at Fl 186.50, down from the Fl 197.20 close last Friday.
Some analysts in Amsterdam said Akzo was paying a high premium but others
noted the decline follows the stock's all-time high last week, after the
announcement of strong third-quarter results.
Mr Aarnout Loudon, Akzo chairman, said the group's dependence on the
European market would grow to more than 60 per cent.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Fisons' inducements inquiry focuses on West Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR managers at Fisons, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific
equipment group, were yesterday interviewing a regional sales director as
part of an investigation into alleged illegal marketing practices.
Fisons said its early inquiries suggested there was a possibility that some
offers of inducement had been made to doctors to prescribe the company's
products. However, it believed no money had been paid to general
practitioners.
The company admitted a scheme had existed involving patient treatment cards,
which could have led to payments to GPs. The programme had been withdrawn
and had never been authorised by senior management, said the company.
Such inducements are against the industry's code of practice and could lead
to expulsion from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and
prosecution by the government's Medicines Control Agency.
Mr Rick Tiller, West Midlands regional sales manager, was interviewed
yesterday by Mr Brian Higginson, managing director of UK pharmaceuticals
operations, and Mr George Battersby, the personnel director. A decision
about whether to suspend Mr Tiller had not been taken last night, according
to the company.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, and Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals
division managing director, are directing the investigation.
Fisons said it would like to conclude its inquiry as soon as possible.
The company said it was initially concentrating on the seven-strong west
Midlands sales force, but would then ensure its country-wide sales forces
had been behaving ethically.
Fisons is undergoing a cost-cutting exercise called 'FFF' - 'funding Fisons'
future' - designed to cut 15 per cent from costs. The programme, assisted by
consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is understood to have damaged morale.
Fisons' complicated organisational structure may also have contributed to
the ability of the 'rogue elements' to practise illegal marketing
techniques. There are up to six layers of management between Mr Scroggs and
individual members of the sales forces.
Fisons' UK drugs sales represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the
division's turnover of Pounds 410m last year.

FT  09 NOV 93 / BZW to control Barclays loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, the biggest UK bank, is to move control of large corporate lending
in Europe to its BZW investment bank and curtail some lower-margin
syndicated loans to raise earnings.
Commercial banks are aiming to sell a wider range of services to big
companies to make up for narrow lending margins. Barclays' move will be
followed by a review of large corporate business in the UK next year.
The bank said yesterday the review might lead to some large British
customers being moved to the overall control of a BZW account executive
rather than being handled by its retail and corporate banking division.
The initiative follows the transfer of large corporate lending in the US to
BZW at the start of this year. The bank is already transferring its Asian
business to BZW, but retail banking in Europe will remain within the banking
division.
Mr David Band, BZW chief executive, said the division would review large
corporate contracts in Europe and whittle away those in which it could not
add services to lending. It expected to retain 300 customers.
Mr Band said BZW hoped to sell corporate finance advice, securities
underwriting, risk management, and pension fund management to European
clients. Contracts were at risk where it was only part of a loan syndicate.
The transfer follows a joint BZW/banking division review. Mr Band said it
had decided against wholesale transfer of 'immensely more complex'
relationships with large British companies.
Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the banking division, said Barclays wanted to
ensure that big UK companies could choose which part of the bank suited
their needs. He did not anticipate a 'mammoth change'.
National Westminster already handles relationships with large corporate
clients under its NatWest Markets corporate and investment banking arm. Its
branch banking division handles small and medium-sized companies. Mr
Robinson said there was no disagreement between BZW and banking divisions
over control of large corporate clients and the bank was evolving with the
market. 'I do not see this as a battleground. It is a matter of logic,' he
said.
BZW announced the appointment of Mr Patrick O'Sullivan, currently general
manager Europe for GE Capital's Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, to the
new post of head of bank finance as a result of the moves.

FT  09 NOV 93 / ABF hit by lower baking profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF ever fiercer competition in the UK bread market, Associated
British Foods, the leading UK baker, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds
267m to Pounds 338m in the year to September 18.
However, operating profits were only Pounds 4m higher at Pounds 273m
although sales rose 10.9 per cent to Pounds 4.39bn. Mr Garry Weston,
chairman, said the fall in operating margins from 6.8 to 6.2 per cent was
entirely because of lower baking profits.
An attempt to increase prices halfway through the year had failed, he said.
'A lot of bread is being sold below cost. The only hope is that the public
will get tired of eating cheap and nasty bread.'
He said that Ranks Hovis McDougall, the number two in the market, had been
aggressive on market share since its takeover by Tomkins, the conglomerate,
late last year. However, ABF is believed to have won back some market share.
Mr Weston said: 'Someone's gain is someone else's loss. There has to be a
degree of retaliation. They have a right to my market share like I have a
right to theirs.'
There was no sign of any of the big independent bakers - many of which focus
on a limited range of bread and retailers - going out of business.
On the milling side, which is largely inseparable from baking, ABF had also
suffered lower by-product prices because of lower EC intervention prices. A
poor wheat harvest this autumn had led to a 5 per cent rise in flour prices,
he said. Analysts said it was vital that this rise be passed on in higher
bread prices.
As well as milling and baking, ABF makes a range of grocery products.
Responding to the latest escalation of a supermarket price war, he said food
retailers were putting ever more pressure on manufacturers. 'It has always
been there, it always seems exceptional and it always gets worse. There is
very little left for retailers to try and grab from food manufacturers.'
Rising bond markets meant returns on the group's net cash of more than
Pounds 500m at the year end, net of interest, rose from Pounds 26m to Pounds
43m. Profits also included a Pounds 12m rise in the value of the group's
stake in Berisford International, compared with a Pounds 22m fall in 1992.
The shares rose 4p to 479p.

FT  09 NOV 93 / United EC puts blame on US for delay in trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A UNITED European Community yesterday put the US in the dock for holding up
progress in the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, and rallied behind
European Commission efforts to seize the high ground in the last weeks of
the seven-year-old talks.
Foreign ministers of the 12 closed ranks behind a toughly worded summary of
the state of the talks from Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator,
which described US and Japanese failure to match the EC's offer on market
access and cutting industrial tariffs as the barrier to concluding the
Uruguay Round by its December 15 deadline.
France had been expected to raise the temperature. It is insisting on better
terms on subsidised farm trade and wants to keep cinema and broadcasting out
of any Gatt settlement.
Instead, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, endorsed the Commission
report, falling in with Brussels' tactics of turning France's aggression
outwards. The Commission wants at all costs to avoid more intra-Community
wrangling over Gatt, and to be able to negotiate flexibly on Europe's
behalf.
'My optimism is enhanced by today,' Sir Leon said, 'in so far as there are
no divisions in the Community. The Community is supporting what I'm doing.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, praised Sir Leon's tactics, and
said: 'We're coming towards the end, I hope, I believe.' He estimated a deal
was 85 per cent done.
Sir Leon added that 'the EC has an enormous amount to gain from a Gatt
agreement. We should therefore seize the initiative and keep the
initiative'. He also conceded that a final European decision would, in
political terms, require unanimity, although in Community treaty terms trade
affairs need only a majority under the EC voting system.
He was to have had talks tomorrow with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative. But Washington has withdrawn from high-level contact with
the EC until after the November 17 vote in Congress on the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
Sir Leon attributed lack of progress in the talks 'essentially to the
American preoccupation with Nafta', which also enabled Japan to delay
opening its markets for processed foods and financial services. But the EC
offer to cut industrial tariffs by about half had already elicited positive
responses from many other Gatt signatories, he said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Euro-bank chief vowsto attack policies which threaten Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEXANDRE Lamfalussy, president-elect of the European Monetary Institute,
has promised to be a strong critic of 'unbalanced' economic policies which
threaten the European Community's objective of monetary union.
In the first public indication of how he sees his role - contained in
written answers to members of the European Parliament - Mr Lamfalussy also
cast doubt on a return to the old European exchange rate mechanism, saying
he was not sure it was 'a realistic objective'.
Mr Lamfalussy is due to appear tomorrow before the parliament's committee on
economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy. MEPs must deliver an
opinion on his candidacy before he can be formally confirmed as president of
the Frankfurt-based forerunner of a European central bank. He is currently
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. His
written replies to the committee's questions were obtained yesterday by the
Financial Times.
The EMI will supervise the second stage of Emu, beginning on January 1 1994,
and advise EC members on monetary and exchange rate policy leading up to
full currency union by 1999.
In his reply to the parliament's questionnaire, Mr Lamfalussy said the EMI
would be more than just a passive observer of EC economic and monetary
policy.
In particular, he said he would be prepared to highlight any imbalances
between monetary and fiscal and other economic policies which could
jeopardise the Emu aims. 'I shall make it my duty to draw attention to the
risks arising from an unbalanced policy mix,' he said.
He indicated he would be ready to act decisively if monetary and economic
policies appeared to be contradictory, and make full use of the EMI's power
to encourage dialogue between central banks and governments.
'At a certain point . . . if and when divergencies persist, public opinion
should be made aware of potential conflicts and of their possible
consequences,' he said.
Referring to August's decision to allow ERM currencies to fluctuate more
widely, Mr Lamfalussy said the currency crises of the past 18 months had
removed the 'disciplinary framework' which had helped promote convergence of
monetary policies.
He said co-ordinating monetary policies effectively in such a situation
would be one of the EMI's main challenges.
The EMI 'should spare no effort' to prevent exchange rate fluctuations
undermining the single market, he said. But he added: 'I am sure that it
would not be advisable to set any precise timetable for re-establishing a
more constraining exchange rate mechanism.' Member states should wait until
the business cycle had improved and renewed progress could be made towards
'broadly based convergence'.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Deregulation for London buses dropped: Manifesto pledge
scrapped after pressure from MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has for the first time pulled out of a manifesto commitment
made at the last election by abandoning plans to deregulate the London bus
service in the lifetime of this parliament.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday the government would
proceed with new reforms of the capital's bus system, opening up more routes
operated by London Buses Ltd to competition.
But more radical legislation - which would have allowed any private company
to operate a bus service in London - has been dropped after a summer-long
campaign against deregulation by Conservative backbenchers and local
councillors.
Backbenchers, including Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North and a
former minister, had claimed deregulation would have led to road congestion
and fare rises in the capital. The abandonment of deregulation is one of the
clearest indications yet that the government will avoid introducing
legislation in next week's Queen's Speech which lacks the support of a broad
cross-section of Tory MPs.
In the last parliamentary session, several key areas of the government's
legislative programme, including the ratification of the Maastricht treaty,
were threatened by its thin majority of 17 in the House of Commons and the
activities of backbench Conservative rebels.
Several controversial pieces of legislation have already been postponed.
These include the Pensions Equalisation Bill, which contained politically
sensitive plans to raise the state retirement age for women, and the
privatisation of the Post Office, which was delayed partly because of
backbench fears over the impact on the postal service in Tory-held rural
constituencies.
Both pieces of legislation will not appear until the 1994-95 session at the
earliest.
Mr MacGregor yesterday announced plans to push ahead next year with
privatisation of the 10 London Buses subsidiaries and the tendering of the
bus routes. This could mean more private companies operating services in
colours other than the traditional red.
The transport secretary also said London Transport would move from the
previous system of 'gross cost' contracts to 'net cost' tendering, which
gives operators an incentive to attract more passengers and improve
efficiency.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, approved the government's
decision to drop the 'crackpot idea' of bus deregulation.
'They simply dare not face the electors of London with traffic gridlocked
from Stratford to Ealing. Every sensible person will welcome this decision,'
he said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In glaring contrast to Air France's equivocations, Lufthansa is resolutely
attacking its cost base. Although passengers remain few and far between,
Lufthansa has been able to record a rare third-quarter profit after cutting
operating expenses by 4.5 per cent over the first nine months of the year.
The financial stringency is continuing, promising further margin
improvements. Demand should also begin to pick up next year while the
link-up with United Airlines holds out considerable promise over the longer
term. The German stock market has been quick to scent recovery. Lufthansa's
shares have risen almost 70 per cent over the past year, even though the
company is unlikely to record an annual profit until 1995.
This seemingly provides an encouraging backdrop for the German state to
reduce its 54 per cent holding further. But with a weighty deficit hanging
round its neck, the government can ill-afford to take on Lufthansa's DM4bn
pension fund obligations. A consummation of the Alcazar alliance would give
Lufthansa another cause for concern. The four airlines, which rim Germany,
could well develop into a formidable force in European aviation. However,
the clash between KLM and Swissair over which US carrier should be chosen as
the alliance's transatlantic partner threatens to scupper the whole deal.
That would be doubly good news for Lufthansa if it cleared the way to it
securing an alliance with Austrian Airlines.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Foods, the UK's biggest manufacturer of daily bread, must
be praying for a miracle to deliver it from the evil of price competition.
Yet, if anything, the market is about to deteriorate some more. Following J.
Sainsbury's price offensive last week, Kwik Save has sliced the price of
bread again. Although retailers are mainly absorbing the pain, such
competitive pressures will prevent bakers from raising the price of branded
breads. With continuing over-capacity and flour and wage costs pressing
upwards, the industry's margins can only suffer more.
ABF's cast iron balance sheet will allow it to endure the misery better than
the likes of Tomkins. Nevertheless, ABF's prospects look decidedly dull,
especially considering the declining income on its Pounds 500m cash pile.
Perhaps the only way to stimulate a re-rating would be to spend this cash.
Despite his oft-professed dislike for wheeling and dealing, Mr Garry Weston
has proved a dab hand at acquisitions and disposals. Comfort can be drawn
from the cautious way Mr Weston treats ABF's money as his own - which is
perhaps not surprising since he remains the company's biggest shareholder.
If only he could repeat his trick of selling the Fine Fare grocery chain and
recycling the funds into British Sugar - which has just lifted profits 17
per cent - shareholders would be best pleased.

FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The initial impression from yesterday's producer price and consumer credit
figures is that both demand and price pressures are strengthening. On closer
inspection, though, this conclusion looks flawed. Consumers are shedding
some of their aversion to debt, but such a development follows naturally
from the previously-reported recovery in retail sales. Besides, part of
September's Pounds 489m increase in consumer credit reflects building
society lending in connection with business expansion schemes as well as the
stronger car market.
Of more consequence is whether the momentum can be maintained. In the short
run, the CBI's October distributive trades survey is disappointing. One
interpretation of the flatter trend is that consumer appetites will only
really be titillated by the kind of discounting which was prevalent in the
summer but has since died away. That does not suggest a level of confidence
able to shrug off the fiscal tightening which is already in train, let alone
any further tax increases in the budget.
But consumers' caution makes inflation less threatening. True, there is an
upward drift to the annual rate of output price rises adjusted to exclude
food, tobacco and petroleum. At the retail level, though, food price
inflation should be dampened by competition among the supermarkets, while
manufacturers' input prices are still falling. There would be room for rate
cuts, if the chancellor has the courage to risk the blow to consumer
confidence by raising taxes in the budget.

FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Akzo's Nobel prize
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another commanding height of the Swedish economy is falling into foreign
hands. Yet Akzo's takeover of Nobel Industries is likely to prove far less
emotive than the marriage of Renault and Volvo. The financial plight of
Nobel - arising from adventures in real estate rather than lack of
competence in chemicals - always demanded an overseas partner. Akzo looks as
good an industrial fit as the company was likely to find. The Swedish
government must welcome the prospect of a tidy exit from its unwanted 70 per
cent stake in Nobel at a healthy premium to the market price.
Akzo shareholders might be forgiven a few qualms. The deal will dilute
earnings per share next year. It brings a large share placing now and the
prospect of additional supply later, assuming the Swedish government moves
to reduce its stake in the merged company. The immediate financial benefits
 -such as refinancing Nobel's punitively expensive preference stock with
low-yielding Akzo shares - will limit the initial damage to earnings.
Writing off Nobel's acquired goodwill to the balance sheet in the Dutch
manner, rather than amortising through the profit and loss, will also help.
But lasting benefits depend on the promised industrial synergies and cost
savings being delivered.
Fortunately there is room for optimism on that score. Having started the
process of cost cutting earlier than most of its continental European
rivals, Akzo's management mind-set should be well adjusted to the task. If
the competition authorities do not object, the merged company will overtake
ICI to become top dog in European paints. That should yield easy
rationalisation in marketing and distribution. With so many shares being
issued to fulfil its ambition, though, Akzo will have to come up with more
than a fresh lick of paint.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mirror, mirror
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHYSICAL fitness regime of the Princess of Wales would not normally be a
subject of concern to this newspaper. It has been made so by the decision of
two titles in the Mirror group to publish photographs of the princess, taken
in a London gymnasium with a concealed camera. The subsequent decision by
the Mirror group's national titles to pull out of the Press Complaints
Commission throws the future of self regulation of the UK press into doubt.
In publishing the pictures, the Mirror flagrantly flouted the commission's
code, of which it is a signatory. This bars intrusion into private lives
except when the public interest dictates otherwise. The newspapers' defence,
that they have exposed a security risk, is worth mentioning only for its
brazen disingenuity.
Inevitably, the incident has led to renewed calls for action to curb press
intrusions, a subject the government intends to address shortly in a white
paper. Newspapers have argued that instead of legislating, the government
should give the PCC more time to show its value.
Set up in 1991, the PCC has speeded up its complaints procedure and this
year acted to make itself more robust, giving non-press members a majority
voice and strengthening its code.
The grandiose hypocrisy of the Mirror undermines these efforts and exposes
the fact that the commission has no sanctions save harsh words. We know what
the papers' editors think about the propriety of breaking the newspaper
industry's agreed code of conduct. It would now be proper to hear the views
of the board of the Mirror Group, in particular the chairman Sir Robert
Clark and his non-executive directors, Mr Alan Clements, Sir Gordon Borrie
and Mr James McColgan.
Legislators, however, should note another point. This spy camera was
installed not by a journalist, but by the gym's owner, in order to make
money at the expense of a famous customer.
That underlines the most important point in the debate about press law.
Electronic eavesdropping, of which this is an example, should be banned by
law. But journalists should be neither above the law nor subject to
discrimination by it.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: Whitwam's path
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes more than a few jitters on world stock markets to knock burly Dave
Whitwam off his stride. The chairman and chief executive of Whirlpool, the
world's largest white goods company, passed through London yesterday on a
whistle-stop European tour to drum up interest in his company's shares.
Not the best of timing, one might have thought. But Whitwam is unabashed.
Having bought the Philips white goods business in 1989 and established
Whirlpool's brand name in Europe, he is now intent on building up a
following among European investors.
His target is for 10-15 per cent of Whirlpool's shares to be held in Europe
eventually. At the moment the figure is around 3 per cent.
Like hundreds of US executives before him, he hopes to attract that much
sought-after species, the patient long-term continental investor. The
species, whose natural habitat is Germany and Switzerland, has suffered a
few knocks recently. But Whitwam reports that it is still alive and well.
Indeed, at the Zurich meeting, one potential investor even had the temerity
to ask a question about Whirlpool's latest quarterly results.
He was nearly attacked by fellow investors for asking such a short-term
question.

Reverting to the subject of the peculiar ways of UN agencies, could the
United Nations Environment Programme not have looked a little further before
awarding its annual Dollars 200,000 environment prize to Mostafa Tolba,
UNEP's executive director from 1976 until his retirement last year?
Tolba's successor, Canadian Elizabeth Dowdeswell, apparently expressed
reservations about the choice of this year's prize-winner. However, she was
unable to persuade the selection committee, nominated during Tolba's reign,
to reverse its decision.
A UNEP press release said Tolba had been honoured for going 'far beyond the
call of duty in his commitment, dedication and contributions to the
environment'. Tolba does have some feathers in his cap - notably the
Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer.
Back in his native Cairo, Tolba expressed neither surprise nor embarrassment
at UNEP's decision to top up his pension with such a generous award. He
plans to use the money to establish a National Centre for Environment and
Development in Egypt.
No prizes for guessing who is likely to be president.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: Pohl in person
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president who quit in 1991 after a row
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and who these days runs pukka private bank Sal
Oppenheim, likes to keep his head below the parapet.
Today and tomorrow, however, he has been persuaded to air a 'personal view'
of international monetary policy in two Lionel Robbins memorial lectures at
the London School of Economics.
Diplomacy will probably prevent Pohl dwelling on two of the more prescient
warnings of his Buba presidency. In his dispute with Kohl over the costs of
German reunification, Pohl's forebodings have proved all too correct -
something which still rankles with Kohl. Again, when Britain joined the ERM,
Pohl personally told John Major (then chancellor of the exchequer) that the
chosen exchange rate for sterling against the D-Mark was too high - a
forecast in which he has also been vindicated.
But the former central banker hardly needs to blow his own trumpet anyway,
for he is already viewed with a degree of awe in London, not least at the
Bank of England. Andrew Crockett, the Bank's international director, due to
be officially confirmed today as the new general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, once even thought aloud that Pohl could take a
seat on the future board of an independent UK central bank.
A pipe dream, perhaps, but two years after he stepped down from the
Bundesbank hot seat, the City has probably not seen the last of Karl Otto.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: FAO's food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spare a thought for Patrick Cunningham, one of the unsuccessful candidates
for the top job at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Cunningham got
knocked out in the first round of voting yesterday after collecting just one
of the 163 votes.
So how come 59-year-old Cunningham is so unpopular? The man from Ireland has
an impressive record as director of FAO's animal production and health
division. Last year, he headed a successful campaign in North Africa to
eradicate a deadly animal disease known as New World Screw-worm.
But in an election campaign pamphlet, FAO - The Issues, Cunningham was rash
enough to suggest certain reforms that he believed were necessary at FAO.
And there is scarcely anyone with even a passing knowledge of FAO who does
not believe that reforms are necessary. So this seemed nothing new.
But the present FAO boss, Edouard Saouma, took a dim view. He promptly
cancelled Cunningham's travel budget, thus rather restricting his
campaigning. Worse still, he did not renew the Irishman's three-year
contract when it expired in August this year. Given his successful attack on
the New World Screw-worm, renewal would normally have been automatic.
Seems a funny way to run an election.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Leaner EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THIS year's criticism of its leadership style and finances, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development needed a fresh start.
Changes announced yesterday by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the new president,
will make the bank more effective in helping the economic regeneration of
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Mr de Larosiere cuts a less dashing figure than Mr Jacques Attali, who
resigned in July. But while no less attached to the integration of east and
west Europe, he can also point to valuable experience and organisational
aptitude. Measures to streamline operations, cut out unnecessary duplication
and deploy more specialised bankers on direct project work are a useful
answer to complaints that the EBRD, in only two years, had become a wasteful
and cumbersome bureaucracy.
More controversial, though still on the whole sensible, is the abolition of
the merchant and development banking departments which previously handled
separately private and state sector projects. Some of the boundaries between
the bank's two new 'north' and 'south' geographical zones look a little
arbitrary. In some of the 25 countries in the bank's purview there are
severe limits on the private sector activities it was set up to nurture, so
the bank will need at times to place greater emphasis on public sector
projects. But Mr de Larosiere must ensure that the EBRD does not look ever
more like the European arm of the public sector-orientated World Bank. That
would raise afresh the question of why it was set up in the first place.
Mr de Larosiere will have to manage a new phase of both competition and
co-operation with other international development institutions active in the
same field. He is also launching an effort to discover from EBRD
shareholders and outside experts more precise answers on what the bank
should do and how it should do it. Vagueness over the EBRD's objectives,
coupled with lack of proper controls by member governments, contributed to
management failings. So Mr de Larosiere's spirit of inquiry, like his drive
for efficiency, is welcome. His task of firmly defining a role for the bank,
and then fulfilling it, is a difficult one. But his first steps are in the
right direction.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Foothold on cliff of opportunity: Foreign investors are
using Hong Kong's stock market as a way into China, say Simon Holberton and
Patrick Harverson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, prepares for tomorrow's UK cabinet
meeting to discuss the latest twists and turns in the battle with China over
the colony's political future, the local stock market is showing no signs of
shell-shock.
While the past seven months have stretched to breaking point the patience of
Mr Patten, as he campaigns for political reform ahead of the 1997 transfer
of sovereignty to China, Hong Kong's money men have done more than break
even - the colony's Hang Seng index has risen 20 per cent in the past five
weeks.
This remarkable rise in share prices has happened since a visit to China by
a group of US fund managers - who collectively manage Dollars 400bn in
assets - organised by Morgan Stanley, the US securities firm, in September.
At the end of that month, Mr Barton Biggs, the company's chief equities
strategist, set the tone when he said: 'After eight days in China I'm tuned
in, overfed and maximum bullish.'
Less colourfully, Mr Biggs argued that investing in China would be 'the
world's most profitable investment opportunity for the next 10 years'. With
much of the country's stock market off-limits to foreign investors, he said:
'The best way into the China restructuring story is through Hong Kong.'
This judgment will prove either one of the most prescient of the decade  -
or the most misguided. Hong Kong is undoubtedly the best gateway to China,
but its stock market is vulnerable to internal Chinese politics and to
China's worsening relations with the western world, notably the US and
Britain.
Whatever the long-term outcome for equities, Mr Biggs's remarks have had a
startling impact in Hong Kong. A wave of US money has hit the colony this
autumn as investors have switched away from unexciting US and European
markets towards Asia.
Morgan Stanley, for instance, has increased the weighting of the Hong Kong
stock market in its global equity model, a theoretical portfolio watched by
investors, by tenfold, to 3 per cent from 0.3 per cent; Mr Biggs increased
Hong Kong's weighting in his Dollars 1bn 'emerging markets' fund by 45 per
cent to 16 per cent of total assets. Warburg Securities in Hong Kong expects
a 95 per cent rise - to Dollars 5.5bn from Dollars 2.8bn in 1992 - in US
investors' net purchases of Hong Kong equities this year.
The love affair with Asian equities as a whole may not be limited to US
funds. Nomura Securities, the leading Japanese stockbroker, recently raised
Dollars 1bn for investment in Asian equities. According to Mr Robert
Rowntree, head of Nomura's regional research team in Hong Kong, most recent
Japanese investment in the colony has come from private clients acting
through investment trusts. But he, and others, believe that the large
investment institutions in Japan may, for the first time, be on the verge of
committing large sums to Asian, especially to Hong Kong, equities.
'The conditions are good for Japanese investment in Asian equities,' Mr
Rowntree says. 'The yen has peaked, and Japanese securities houses are in a
position to service clients. Nomura has 60 salesmen now who know the Hong
Kong and Singapore markets. By the end of 1994 we will have 200.'
The Hang Seng's 20 per cent rise since the end of September has helped to
make Hong Kong the best-performing mature market in Asia this year. The
overall increase takes into account the market's poorer performance last
week - when it fell by 3.6 per cent, in common with many markets around the
world - and its 181-point rally yesterday.
The colony has a large, liquid market, which appeals to the large US
investment institutions with millions at their disposal. It also attracts
foreign investors, because it has more listed companies than any other stock
market in the world involved in China, the region's fastest-growing economy.
It is the one, in short, most highly geared to the rapid economic growth
being experienced on the mainland. In the latest buying wave, investors have
been targeting Hong Kong companies with a strong exposure to the Chinese
economy.
This is especially so for the heavily capitalised companies such as China
Light &amp; Power, which sells electricity to China, Hongkong Telecom, the
telephone monopoly in the colony with growing business opportunities on the
mainland, Hongkong Electric, the power generator on Hong Kong island which
is expected to become involved in power station construction in China, and
HSBC Holdings, Hong Kong's biggest bank.
These stocks have performed especially well. Since September, China Light
has risen 10 per cent to close at HKDollars 49.50 yesterday, HSBC 6.7 per
cent to HKDollars 87, Hongkong Telecom 27.6 per cent to HKDollars 16.20, and
Hong Kong Electric 15 per cent to HKDollars 24.40. As Mr John Hickling, the
Boston-based manager of the Fidelity Overseas Fund, put it: 'US institutions
just piled in.'
However, the speed with which share prices have risen has unsettled some
investors and observers. They think the Hong Kong market is overvalued and
vulnerable to a political or economic setback which, if it comes, could be
severe.
Mr Doug Johnson, senior international investment strategist at Merrill
Lynch, the US securities house, says some US investors may have mistaken
Morgan Stanley's forecast of a positive economic outlook in China for a
forecast of a pos-itive short-term outlook for the Hong Kong market.
'There is a good deal of indiscriminate buying taking place based on the
long-term Chinese economic story,' he says. 'That story is very robust now,
but there is a distinction between what is a good economic story and what is
a good market story. They are not always consistent with each other, and it
is a differentiation that a lot of investors are not making.'
Mr Hickling of Fidelity is also cautious about the short-term prospects for
Hong Kong stocks. In 1992, as much as 15 per cent of his Dollars 1.5bn fund
was invested in the market, but since then he has cut his holdings to just 1
per cent. 'To me, it seems closer to the end of an opportunity, rather than
the beginning. I'm very cautious and don't have a lot of money there.'
Many European investors share this view. According to Mr Archie Hart, head
of research at Crosby Securities, a Hong Kong stockbroker, the Europeans,
having been bitten more than once, are now more than twice shy. 'They have
seen the property crash of 1982-83, the stock market crash of 1987 when the
market closed for a week, and they are a bit too hard-bitten to swallow it.
A lot of the latest investors are new to the market. At the moment there are
two views: either they are in for the long term and are buying the China
concept; or they are the last people in and are due for a shock.'
Underlining such concerns are several indications that, enticing though
China may appear, the Hong Kong market is showing some signs of greed
outstripping its natural ally, fear.
The market rise has happened as analysts have downgraded their earnings
forecasts for the colony's corporate sector. At the beginning of the year a
20 per cent rise in 1994 earnings was forecast; a disappointing first half
and economic tightening in China suggest 15 per cent growth might be closer
to the mark.
Some deals hint that investors may have their heads in the clouds. For
example, Henderson, a large property developer, raised Dollars 460m from
foreign investors last month in the form of a loan convertible into equity
in a company which does not yet exist. Henderson planned to list the
company, Henderson China, on the stock exchange, but withdrew, after the
exchange's listing division expressed doubts about the way Henderson's
advisers had valued development property in China.
Observers lured by the deal say that, even if Henderson China is not set up,
bond holders - primarily US fixed income funds - will receive a handsome
yield of 6.6 per cent from Henderson over three years. To others, however,
the deal is symbolic of investors buying a 'concept' and not worrying about
fundamentals.
Another concern is politics. Since 1984, when Britain agreed to transfer
Hong Kong to China, the local market has suffered what is known as a
'political discount'. This is shown up in the difference between Hong Kong's
'rating' relative to other Asian markets.
Investors are currently prepared to pay prices equal to 19 and 24 times
future corporate earnings in Asian markets such as Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. In spite of the recent rise in prices in Hong Kong they are
prepared to pay only about 14 times future earnings. This level is above the
historical trend, suggesting that either the market is in the process of
being re-rated upwards to south-east Asian levels, or that a savage
correction downwards could be in the offing.
By the end of the year Hong Kong could be coming to terms with a rupture in
Anglo-Chinese relations brought about by the inability of London and Beijing
to agree a way forward for Hong Kong's political system. But even though Mr
Patten is discussing scenarios for the endgame of the talks in London this
week, the optimism generated by the rising market has led many to maintain
that the governor and his political reforms are irrelevant.
In the words of Mr Peter Churchouse, Morgan Stanley's chief strategist in
Hong Kong: 'Even if the talks break down, so what? Is that going to cause
any blow-up in the China story? I don't think so.' Others are not so sure.
Says Mr Hart of Crosby: 'Ultimately, a breakdown in talks must have some
effect. A lame-duck government for three and a half years cannot be
interpreted as good news.'
More seriously, US-China relations are strained. The US wants to see an
improvement in China's human rights record - which it has linked to further
renewal of China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status. It also wants
it to honour agreements to open the Chinese market to US goods and services.
As one broker observed: 'The big political event this month is not Patten in
London but Clinton and Jiang (Zemin, China's president) in Seattle', where
it is hoped that more workable relations can be established.
The loss of MFN for China would hit Hong Kong in several important ways. As
the main processor of China's external trade, Hong Kong's domestic economy
would suffer a loss of income by virtue of reduced trade between China and
the US. Additionally, it would lose from the knock-on effects of slower
growth in China feeding through to lower incomes for Hong Kong's companies
on the mainland.
However, in spite of this uncertainty, the flow of US money into Hong Kong
is unlikely to be stemmed immediately by concerns about politics or warnings
of corrections. The amount of money flowing into US mutual funds (equivalent
to UK unit trusts) - possibly as much as Dollars 200bn this year - is huge;
it has to go somewhere, and a chunk of it will be dedicated to buying China
through Hong Kong.
In a world starved of investment opportunities, Asia holds promising
rewards: Hong Kong the most promising. 'Hong Kong might be a bit frothy, but
you come back to it by a process of elimination,' says Mr Hart. 'Hong Kong
still beats most (other Asian markets) on the basis of valuation.'
Says Ms Wai Chin, south-east Asian analyst at the US investment group,
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark: 'Essentially, an investment in Hong Kong today is
an investment in the growth potential of China because the economies are so
linked . . . If you believe the economic reforms will continue in China,
Hong Kong can only benefit.'
That is the 'if' with which investors have to grapple. For the time being,
at least, it is one which an increasing number of foreign fund managers have
responded to in the affirmative. As to who is the 'greater fool' - those now
buying or those now selling - the next 12 months should prove decisive.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Portillo's mini-pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Mr Michael Portillo proceeds with his review of public spending, he shows
every sign of relishing the opportunity to spread alarm and despondency
among those who wish to preserve the welfare state. The Treasury chief
secretary's declaration at the weekend that he favours greater personal
provision for pensions in the 21st century looks like one more case in
point. Yet this provocative kite-flying does at least have the merit of
ensuring that the assumptions behind spending priorities are discussed. And
in the case of pensions, the assumptions that lie behind government policy
look highly questionable.
Mr Portillo and his fellow ministers appear to believe that social security,
including pensions, takes an unsustainable share of national income.
Certainly there are grounds for worrying about the recent surge in spending,
which reflects the combined impact of pre-electoral promises and the extent
of the recession. But over a longer time span, total welfare spending has
been relatively stable, even if there has been a change in composition away
from housing and education in favour of social security and health. And the
effect of demography on long-run pension costs has been wildly exaggerated.
As John Hills of the London School of Economics points out in an admirable
new study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on the future of welfare, the
so-called demographic time bomb is relatively unthreatening. Applying
today's level of welfare spending per member of the population to the age
structure in the year 2041 would produce an increase equivalent to no more
than 3.8 per cent of GDP at 1991-92 spending levels. To put the British
welfare state in a wider context, the ratio of working people to retired
people in Britain in 50 years will be higher than in any other developed
country apart from Ireland.
In the specific case of pensions, the Department of Social Security's own
central projections show that pensions spending will fall as a percentage of
GDP by the year 2000. Over the next 50 years, costs will rise. Yet the Hills
study points out that the net effect on the public finances of an ageing
population, the increasing cost of the state earnings-related pension and
higher basic pensions would add up to 5 per cent of GDP if benefit levels
were to keep up with living standards  - all of one-tenth of 1 per cent of
GDP per year. The bill will actually be less, whatever the outcome of Mr
Portillo's review, because the government decided in the 1980s to link
benefits to prices rather than earnings, claiming that demographic pressure
made the present system untenable.
The fact is that the present share of welfare in national income is
perfectly tenable; but it may not be compatible with the aspiration of
successive chancellors to reduce the share of taxation in national income.
Even without reductions in taxation there must be serious doubts whether
personal pensions can fill the gap that is being left by the state, as the
state basic pension falls to trivial levels in relation to contemporary
incomes.
Most reputable insurance companies are reluctant to provide personal
pensions to those on much under Pounds 10,000 a year because they are simply
not an economic proposition for the lower paid. This is because the average
cost of a personal pension is high, at about 20 per cent of total
contributions spread over a working lifetime. For the many who do not pay
over a full working life, the expenses - chiefly the cost of maintaining an
army of salesmen - will be higher. And because many insurance companies make
a fixed charge, the costs rise hugely on smaller policies.
Since a majority of those who are not in occupational pension schemes earn
less than Pounds 10,000 a year, personal pensions cannot provide a remotely
adequate alternative to the state scheme. Yet the government appears to have
no alternative to this non-alternative. Perhaps the social security
secretary Mr Peter Lilley should come up with one before Mr Portillo creates
an even bigger gap in the system. While it makes obvious sense to have the
private sector play a growing part in pension provision as incomes increase,
the government cannot continue to ignore the practical shortcomings of its
present pensions policy.

<BYLINE>
   From Prof ARTHUR FRANCIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I realise that your omission of Scottish schools from your Top 1,000
schools ('Britain's (sic) state schools have been gaining ground
academically . . .', October 30/31) was probably because many of them offer
Highers rather than A-levels, though fortunately most British universities
seem able to calculate equivalencies. But not to mention that you had
excluded 10 per cent of the population from your survey looks very like the
'And finally to Scotland . . .' syndrome - the felicitous phrase that can be
heard nearly every morning on the Radio 4 weather forecasts.
I am, however, grateful for your omission. We moved from Oxford last year.
Had you included Scottish data I would have wasted part of my weekend trying
to work out how much of any difference in score between Bearsden Academy,
Glasgow, and the Cherwell School, Oxford, was due to the schools themselves
or to some difference in, for example, the ability of the academics'
children in the respective cities.
Might I ask when you propose to publish a similar ranking of the Top 1,000
UK companies based on a single output measure? Profits per employee would do
nicely. This would provide a strong incentive for firms to liquidate all
non-capital-intensive activities. Never mind that this would distort
industrial output and diminish our national economic welfare. At least we
would all think we knew which were our best companies.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Finer balance of power: Michael Smith on a possible MMC
referral and repercussions for the electricity sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, publishes its
half-year results tomorrow, the numbers will be examined with more than the
usual scrutiny by industry and Westminster.
The results are the last before Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and PowerGen, the other
large generator in England and Wales, to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission over criticism that they have abused their market position. A
referral would have widespread repercussions.
One potential casualty would be government finances. Treasury estimates of
raising Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation sales in 1994-95 would be more
difficult to achieve. More than Pounds 3bn of the total is expected to come
from the sale of the government's 40 per cent stakes in National Power and
PowerGen. But a referral, and the ensuing lengthy inquiry, could postpone
the sale until 1995-96.
A referral would also cast another cloud over the government's privatising
strategy: this year the commission has recommended widespread changes to the
structure of British Gas, another privatised utility, and the gas market to
which it is the main supplier.
Within the electricity industry, many executives believe a referral would
trigger a wider inquiry by the commission into the entire power market. This
could include the regional electricity companies, which, like the
generators, were privatised in 1990, and the National Grid, which transmits
power in England and Wales.
The prospect of a wider investigation is unsettling both for the industry
and for the government. The industry will be looking today for some
reassurance from National Power that it is doing all it can to avoid a
referral; for example, by demonstrating a willingness to compromise with
Prof Littlechild on issues such as prices.
Prof Littlechild's public pledge to make a final decision on a referral by
the end of this year, rather than by the 1995 deadline he had previously
set, was prompted by rises in the spring of more than 10 per cent in the
prices of electricity in the wholesale trading pool.
The pool, set up before privatisation, sets a wholesale price for
electricity for each half-hour of the day after matching expected demand
with supply. The price is determined by the most expensive generating
station needed to meet the expected demand.
The generators acknowledge they are responsible for at least some of the
price increase but deny that they are making excessive profits as a result.
Most consumers have been unaffected by the spring rises because the price of
their electricity is determined by inter-related fix-priced contracts,
agreed in advance, between electricity companies. But the increases badly
hit many industrial consumers whose electricity bills are determined
directly by the pool. Companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries, which
has seen its electricity bill rise by 70 per cent at some plants in the past
two years, have demanded action from both the government and Prof
Littlechild.
Satisfying this chorus of complaints from industry is likely to be one of
Prof Littlechild's most difficult tasks since he became regulator three
years ago. He has grown increasingly suspicious of the generators and their
pricing policies. When announcing his investigation into a possible referral
in August he said the generators' ability to raise prices in the pool was a
matter of widespread concern.
Prof Littlechild is a strong believer in competition and, like many others,
including ministers, believes the market is too dependent on National Power
and PowerGen for supplies: at their peak two years ago the two generators
accounted for about 80 per cent of the market, though their share has since
slipped to less the 60 per cent.
'He (Prof Littlechild) is pathologically ill-disposed to the market
structure, and will be until our share is well down,' says an executive of
one generator. However, in three previous inquiries into pool prices in the
past two years, Prof Littlechild has found no evidence to support claims
that the generators have abused their market power to a significant extent.
To critics, such as the big consumers, the generators' profits growth since
privatisation is confirmation that their prices are excessive. National
Power increased pre-tax profits by 13 per cent last year to Pounds 580m, and
PowerGen by 18 per cent to Pounds 425m; both companies are expected to
record significant growth this year.
'These are very high increases for companies that are providing an
oversupplied market,' says an executive at a non-generator power company.
'The problem is that generators decide what profits they want to make, and
can, because of the lack of competition, arrange their prices accordingly.'
The generators say their profit rises are partly the result of improved
efficiency and job cuts. They point out that their rate of return on capital
is less than that for regional electricity companies on their distribution
businesses, which are monopolies.
'The issue is not whether we exercise market power but how we do so,'
according to National Power. 'To the extent that we do possess market power
we exercise it in a transparent and principled way.'
In determining whether he accepts this statement Prof Littlechild has been
provided with confidential figures by the generators. Unless the figures
reveal overwhelming price abuse, most City observers believe he will try to
force change on the generators that falls short of a referral.
A referral would set in motion a process over which the regulator would have
limited control. The danger is that the commission could reject his
recommendations, which could include splitting up the generators or limiting
their powers in other ways.
The two most obvious options for Prof Littlechild are the imposition of
price controls, or asking the generators to sell some of their generating
plant in an attempt to reduce their market power. Both are fraught with
difficulty.
National Power and PowerGen may baulk at price controls and forced sales of
generating plant. They have said publicly that they are willing to discuss
disposals but potential buyers have their doubts.
In the circumstances, Prof Littlechild could be attracted to a third option:
doing nothing. However, having conducted his review he has raised
expectations, not least among heavy industrial users, that he is going to do
something.
'Prof Littlechild has huffed and puffed so often now,' says one broker.
'Having teed it all up he is going to look a right Charlie if he does
nothing.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail support vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON G SPERRYN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was most concerned to read in your article 'Clarke wins battle over
spending' (November 2) that 'among the projects facing delay or cancellation
were the London CrossRail link and the Channel tunnel rail link'.
The government's innovative approach towards attracting private sector
finance into public sector projects loses credibility with every swing of
the pendulum. Potential investors cannot be expected to express an interest
in such major projects as CrossRail while this stop-go cycle continues. We
support the principle of private sector investment; within the current
financial constraints the government's imaginative search for workable
solutions to develop major infrastructure projects is applauded by business.
Since the Central London Rail Study of 1989 the London Chamber has
consistently campaigned for CrossRail as an essential tenet of London's
transport network serving business commuters, the tourist industry, and the
indigenous community. Recent independent reports suggest the project would
lead to the creation of about 60,000 jobs in central London, a boost which
Britain's capital urgently needs as the recovery is not yet assured, and the
illogical political compromise over the sighting of the European Monetary
Institute requires a renewed government commitment to London's future.
We would urge the government to confirm its complete commitment to
CrossRail; the result in terms of investor confidence and the government's
credibility in the eyes of London's business community of further delays
would be seriously damaging.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Better way of managing than cults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz still cannot make up his mind whether the religion
of business re-engineering and the arrival of the 'horizontal' organisation
are good things. (Management, November 5).
It is undoubtedly of consummate interest to those 'high priests' to whom Mr
Lorenz refers, who occupy themselves by writing or talking about how other
people's businesses should change. However, is it really of interest to the
stakeholders in a 'staid' building society?
Our customers (as consumers) care about decently priced products backed by
professional and friendly service. As members, they expect
cost-effectiveness and financial strength. Employees want challenging and
rewarding jobs and like to be kept informed about the business. Our
regulators insist on prudent management and clear controls. The government
enjoys the tax derived from our increasing profits, and that 'bottom line'
is important to credit rating agencies too.
So does it matter what adjective is used to describe organisational
structure? I suspect big businesses end up with a 'mixed bag' which adapts
over time, but that is uninspiring phraseology for anybody trying to justify
a new religion.
However, quietly managing that 'mixed bag' to deliver improved business
results will perhaps attract more believers in the long run than some of the
new management cults which are strong on hype but patently unproven in
performance terms.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Nanny's desperate smacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sorry about this. I had thought that Mr John Major's 'back to basics' speech
of a few weeks ago was a clever piece of party conference nonsense, well
suited to soothing his audience, but nothing to do with running the country.
That has now been contradicted by weekend reports that the prime minister
really meant it - that he has, indeed, sent a round-robin to his cabinet
telling it so.
Mr Major's purpose, we are informed, is to switch the focus of political
debate from the economy to social policy. In the 1980s the Conservatives
challenged economic orthodoxy. Now, in the 1990s, they will tackle the areas
of social policy in which, it is noted in tones of horror, 'theorists' have
dragged professionals and administrators away from common sense. The
government will act. It will reduce crime, weed out 'trendy' teachers,
re-train social workers, light a bonfire of regulations, make divorce more
difficult for parents with children, and, as to unmarried mothers, stand at
the council house doorway, arm outstretched, index finger pointing back into
the snow.
It is hilarious. Downing Street works late and out come these teaspoonsful
of populism, served up as the long-awaited warm draught of long-term
strategy. Let us sip a spoon at a time.
The forthcoming deregulation bill will remove many small irritants, but that
is overdue tidying up, not a philosophy of governance. Most Tory
administrations slash away at old regulations, although some wait too long
for heavy agglomerations to build up. I spent an hour on Sunday cutting
accumulated ivy from a strangulated tree-trunk. This does not make me a
landscape gardener. We are also promised two criminal justice bills. Voters
know, or will discover, that nothing the home secretary has yet announced is
likely to prevent a single criminal outside the ranks of those temporarily
detained from doing his or her bit of mischief.
I have fulminated as much as anyone against the 'child-centred' teaching
methods of the 1960s, but, as the national curriculum takes hold, loony
classroom practice is becoming yesterday's issue. If not, what have the
Tories been doing about education these 14 years? True, social workers are
unpopular. For this they have themselves to blame. Their fault is their
unwillingness or inability to make a case for their profession, or at least
one that outsiders can understand. We may be mildly encouraged by the news
that the government plans to modify teacher and social worker training. It
would be more apposite to write these long-suffering professionals down as
convenient scapegoats.
The most curious items in the list are those relating to divorce and lone
parenthood, two elements in every package of policies for 'the family'. Like
the autumn rains, pamphlets and speeches on this eternal subject patter
ceaselessly down upon my desk. 'The traditional nuclear family - breadwinner
father married to the full-time mother of their dependent children - is a
minority pursuit,' said Ms Patricia Hewitt, the deputy director of the
left-inclined Institute for Public Policy Research, in a thoughtful lecture
delivered in May. 'Reports of the death of the nuclear family are
exaggerated,' writes Mr David Willetts, the Conservative MP for Havant, in a
'Contemporary Paper' (available from W H Smith, 7 Holbein Place, London SW1
8NR). First elected in April 1992, Mr Willetts was quickly made a member of
the select committee on social security. He carries the bags of Sir Norman
Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party.
Ms Hewitt and Mr Willetts could prove their apparently contradictory
assertions by the judicious use of statistics. The former's definition of
'nuclear' alludes to families in which the mother is not working; the latter
includes all households headed by a married couple. Confused? En-ter Mr Ian
Lang, secretary for Scotland. 'It is important to recognise that the family
unit is not always what it was 30 or 40 years ago,' he told Conservative
women in Perth on Saturday. When the smelling-salts had been applied, he
added: 'We can wish it was not so. But we cannot just wish it away . . . the
situation today appears to be less stable than before, but are people on the
whole less happy? I doubt it . . .' Another doubter, one suspects, is the
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
Mr Lang has given the game away, although probably without meaning to. 'In
going back to basics,' he said on Saturday, 'we should not pretend that the
only family values worthy of the name are to be found in the traditional
nuclear family.' He has surely been reading Ms Hewitt. My own view is that
this is a field in which the government should tread extremely carefully, if
at all. There may be a case for altering the divorce laws so that couples
with children are obliged to go through various hoops before splitting up.
The relationship between single-parent allowances, the availability of
council housing, and the propensity of some young girls in deprived areas to
become pregnant is a complicated one. There may be an argument in favour of
tightening housing and social security rules, but it should be deployed with
care, and kept well away from the Treasury.
That, however, is about as far as our political servants should go. Personal
relationships should not be the province of any government, least of all a
Conservative one that has elevated the cult of the individual to the status
of a new religion. The logic of it beats me. Free market prophets recoil
from the idea of a national transport policy, on the ground that officials
cannot allocate resources as well as the market. An energy strategy is
likewise rejected, for the same reason. Social engineering, which is what
'back to basics' means if it means anything at all, is apparently the
exception. In the most directly private spheres of life Conservative right
wingers aspire to be nannies.
They need not be taken seriously. Mr Major's repackaging of familiar
policies under a 'back to basics' label is a cry for help. Like so many
western politicians, he needs an enemy. The European Commission is not
sufficiently threatening. The trade unions have been vanquished. Socialism
has gone. The Soviet threat is no more. This explains why the prime minister
has put up tired old targets like 'Hampstead' and 'progressives' and 'trendy
liberals'. It smacks of desperation.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Another champion of sanity on Radio 3
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was so pleased to read ('From 'good morning' to 'hello matey',
October 30) that Clement Crisp has not surrendered in the battle to restore
sanity to Radio 3. Like him, I abhor chit-chat on the radio and one could
always rely on this third programme to offer a haven of word-free, musical
quality amidst a world changing too fast, in directions which no one seems
fully to comprehend. Much of this has now become adulterated by news,
reviews and interviews, already the staple diet of Radios 1, 2, 4 and 5.
Mercy, mercy] Are Mr Crisp and I the only people in the land who want to
listen to music and not drown in a torrent of trivia about music? Frankly, I
am not too interested in the life and times of the glockenspiel understudy
in the Liechtenstein Philharmonic.
When will the controllers of Radio 3 come to realise that, for them, Classic
FM is the most fortunate radio development of recent years? We live in an
age of instant gratification where the media moguls presume and continuously
affirm that our maximum span of attention is about 10 minutes. However, as
we mature intellectually and emotionally we reject this affront to our
humanity and gradually turn to more demanding, more satisfying newspapers
and radio and television programmes. Classic FM is in the process of
cultivating a whole new audience for Radio 3; that is, if Radio 3 will
return to its roots as the premier broadcasting station of consistently rich
and varied, non-ephemeral music. To achieve this it must renounce its stable
of critics, reviewers and interviewers who contribute not one whit to our
enjoyment of the music itself, who, indeed, seriously detract from it.
If Radio 3 can find its way back on to the tracks of musical goodness and,
in the short-term at least, set aside the irrelevance of audience figures,
then it will again deserve to appear in the top 10 list of 'things most
missed' by many expatriates. It will again stand as a beacon of British
broadcasting quality in a confused world.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: US lawyers victims of their own
efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN SINCLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a wonderful irony in Robert Rice's article ('Tied up in claims
for damages', October 19) about the concern of US lawyers at their
increasing vulnerability to large damages claims. The US legal profession
has encouraged changes in law and procedures over many years which resulted
in a litigation system grossly weighted in favour of the plaintiff. The
effect of this has been to encourage litigation where it was not merited,
and proliferate the imposition of punitive damages far outweighing
compensation for loss.
Perhaps this new trend giving the legal profession a taste of its own
medicine will at last promote changes which will moderate the worst excess,
not only for the benefit of the lawyers, but also for other professionals,
corporations, and citizens who have suffered under the present system for
too long.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Tchaikovsky's 'Cherevichki' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsea Opera Group's concert performance of Cherevichki at the Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Sunday was an imaginative contribution to a Tchaikovsky
commemoration otherwise largely lacking in enterprise. The centenary of the
composer's death (which fell the day before) has been duly marked, but few
audiences will have gained fresh insights into Tchaikovsky's work.
Opportunities to explore the neglected byways of the composer's output have
been missed, familiar music has been aired over and over again.
This year opera houses around the world have seen a proliferation of
Onegins. No Western company seems to have ventured Mazeppa or The Maid of
Orleans. Chelsea Opera Group, which in the past has given memorable concert
versions of both, might this time have dusted off The Enchantress or The
Oprichnik. But Cherevichki ('The Tsarina's Slippers') was still a good
choice: last month (as David Murray reported on this page) it was the hit of
the Wexford Festival - anyone who encountered it there will have welcomed
another chance to hear it - and, importantly, Tchaikovsky himself thought
highly of it, calling it 'musically well-nigh my best opera'.
The neglect of Cherevichki is unjust. Tchaikovsky laboured hard at it (the
opera as premiered at the Bolshoy in 1887 was an extensive revision of his
1874 Vakula the Smith), producing a score of uniformly high inspiration.
Deeply influenced by folklore - it is a setting of Gogol's Christmas Eve -
the work is full of colourful, lyrical earthy music. It remained the
composer's only comic opera. The fantastic plot, familiar to London
opera-goers through the recent ENO staging of Rimsky-Korsakov's later
setting of the story, was clarified at the QEH in Arthur Jacobs's lively
translation.
Three singers stood out. With a husky mezzo, Ann Atkinson was delightful as
the witch Solokha, and Jonathan Veira sang robustly and with relish as the
Devil. Peter Sidhom was a splendid, solemn Potemkin. Though taxed by the
demanding role of Oxana, Alice Hyde made a credible heroine - and the slight
edge to her voice suggested authentic Russian tone.
Both the Vakula and Chub, roles requiring larger-than-life singers, were
undercharacterised. The conductor, Martyn Brabbins, welded his forces -
including a ragged chorus - with flair and Tchaikovskian feeling.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Miller's 'Falstaff' - Andrew Clark finds the doctor
back on form in Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a string of dud opera productions around Europe over the past year,
Jonathan Miller has come up with a fleet-footed, funny and affectionate
Falstaff in Zurich. The key to his success lies not so much in the
homogeneous cast or the intimate scale of the Zurich Opera House - though
each play a part. No, the chief distinction is Miller's faithfulness to the
spirit of Verdi. He preserves the period setting, keeps the humour alive and
paces each scene with the same sleight of hand that characterises Verdi's
musicking of Shakespeare.
The result brings to mind Miller's landmark staging of Le nozze di Figaro
for the 1991 Vienna Festival. Falstaff may not reach quite that exalted
level, but it too is the product of second thoughts (he first staged
Falstaff for Kent Opera in the 1970s) and enjoys clear dramatic lines.
Without being untrue to Elizabethan England, Miller has turned to the
paintings of 16th century Dutch masters for his visual inspiration. Peter
Davison's sets - a succession of simple, spacious interiors against a
backdrop of oak trees and matchbox townhouses - have the light and depth of
a Bruegel landscape, in which the characters are at one with their natural
environment. Bardolph and Pistol are Gothic bumpkins straight out of
Hieronymus Bosch, and Clare Mitchell's authentic costumes look comfortably
lived-in.
Miller's view of Falstaff is refreshingly benign. He listens to the music
and takes Sir John at face value - an incorrigible optimist, a
personification of the life-force, a figure of fun whose ageing girth houses
an equally large appetite for wine and women. The boastful interviews at the
Garter Inn with a flirtatious Quickly and the disguised Ford are sprinkled
with wit, while the hunt in Ford's house develops a farcical momentum of
which Brian Rix would be proud - Falstaff's first instinct is to take cover
under Alice's dress, and it is only with great effort that he can be
squeezed into the laundry basket. Even 'Mondo ladro' has its amusing side,
as Falstaff hobbles around barefoot under a moth-eaten blanket. Miller's
imagination occasionally gets the better of him - Dr Caius spends much of
the evening swotting flies, and one of Ford's retinue turns up with a
field-telephone - but never enough to compromise the evening's uncluttered
appeal.
Falstaff is sung by the Spanish baritone Juan Pons, who is now experienced
enough in the part to have the timing and physical mannerisms exactly right.
His voice is handsome and reliable. He wears the paunch, the balding ginger
wig and outrageous plumed red cloak convincingly. All he needs is the
larger-than-life personality that distinguishes the finest interpreters.
Alice, sung by Gabriele Lechner with charm and femininity, has a girth
almost as big as Falstaff's and a sense of humour to match. Birgit Remmert's
Quickly is tall and sexy - no wonder Falstaff welcomes her advances - and
the voice has star quality. Rodney Gilfry struggles with Ford; Laszlo Polgar
and Volker Vogel make a scene-stealing pair of rogues. Fenton and Nannetta,
roles which always find their interpreters in first blossom, are sung by
Reinaldo Macias and Isabel Rey.
After 35 years in Zurich, it was about time Nello Santi conducted Falstaff
there, but his experience proves double-edged. The music is beautifully
paced, the dynamics kept admirably low - but the mercurial spirit of late
Verdi eludes him, and the reading is inexplicably short on swagger. No
matter: this is a worthy addition to Zurich's Verdi repertory, and - with
his ENO Rosenkavalier less than three months away - a timely return to form
for Miller.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Whitbread finalists announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the book prize season. Tonight the winner of the
Esquire-Volvo-Waterstone Non Fiction Award will receive Pounds 5,000. Next
Tuesday the Sunday Express Book of the Year will make one writer Pounds
20,000 richer.
Yesterday the finalists were annnounced for the Whitbread. Each of the five
nominated authors received Pounds 2,000. On January 25 1994, one of them
will get another Pounds 21,000 as winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year.
The Whitbread covers the literary field, with a candidate for each section.
They were: for biography, Andrew Motion for Philip Larkin, A Writer's Life;
for a children's novel, Flour Babies by Anne Fine; for a first novel, Saving
Agnes by Rachel Rusk; for a novel, Theory of War by Joan Brady; and for
poetry, Carol Ann Duffy for her collection, Mean Time.

<TEXT>
Tuesday is proving to be one of television's best nights this season. From
its launch BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment has been one of the
better Birtist additions to the corporation's current affairs empire.
Today (7.45), South African expatriate Donald Woods considers what role
television might play in his homeland's future.
Six programmes on the subject of talking might seem daunting, but since The
Talking Show (C4, 8.00) is presented by comedian Sandi Toksvig, womankind's
answer to the pocket battleship, they should at least be worth sampling. The
series begins with consideration of the voice and regional accents
C4's excellent culture series Without Walls features art critic Brian Sewell
in its 'J'accuse' slot (9.30), putting the boot into Leonardo da Vinci.
In the best police series for years, Between The Lines (BBC1, 9.30), the
police hierarchy closes ranks to protect a chief constable.
Omnibus (BBC1, 10.25) considers a Russian 'sex boom' following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Toytown comes to the Hayward - Reviewing Julian Opie
and Richard Wentworth, William Packer challenges the 'It is Art if I say so'
syndrome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We expect a retrospective exhibition at a major public gallery to be
something of an honour, an accolade, a celebration of a life's work. And
when the happy artist is but ten years into his career, still in his early
thirties, by how much more should his distinction match our astonishment and
applause. What new Raphael, after all, what Van Gogh, what Modigliani has
swum into our ken? The reality is rather different.
Julian Opie is 35, a product of the Goldsmiths' College, was picked up by
the Lisson Gallery upon his graduation in 1982. Within a year he had enjoyed
his first one-man show in London and taken part in group exhibitions at the
Tate, Riverside and the Serpentine in London, and in Rotterdam. Only a year
later he had exhibited in London again, and Cologne, Quebec, Basel, Paris
and Tokyo, the next year Sydney, Paris, Ravenna, Jerusalem, and so on ever
since. This year it has been Oslo, Copenhagen, Milan, 'Machines for Peace'
at the Venice Biennale, and now this.
His luck was to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right
people, at just the moment when the great self-fulfilling curatorial
imperative of modern British art was again, well, self-fulfilling. The world
is so interested in our young sculptors, we tell ourselves as we offer it
nothing else. Moore and Hepworth, Paolozzi and Turnbull, Caro and King,
Flanagan and Long, each generation has had its turn. The British Council has
shown no young painter in its pavilion at Venice for more than 20 years.
Asked why the Turner Prize should have favoured sculpture so heavily in
recent years, Nicholas Serota, of the Tate, said with disarming
ingenuousness: 'Oh, but we are so strong in sculpture at the moment.' It has
become a reflex.
Opie's work has always been idea-led, founded in conceits and double-takes,
which has accorded well with the spirit of the times, for all that the wit
was ever somewhat heavy-handed. He began by folding metal sheet into various
illustrative configurations, painting them in a jokily perfunctory manner. A
pile of books totters and falls - 'Incident in a Library': a row of bags and
cases sits on the floor - 'Project for Heathrow': a stack of outsize
pencils, protractors and rulers leans wonkily together - 'Broken Rules'.
His interest then turned to more abstracted exercises in which simple steel
elements, painted with all the subtle invention of the Smartie tube, were
combined in ambiguous shelf or bench-like relation, as of ultra-modern
furniture. The work then indeed became ultra-modern furniture, that of the
office and factory - ventilator grills, cabinets, shelves, light-boxes. Here
indeed was the conceptual double-take with a vengeance; Duchamp, with his
'Urinal', had got there years ago. 'It is Art if I say it is Art: a
ventilator grill if you say it is a ventilator grill. Heads I win, tails you
lose.'
Latterly Opie has turned to making model houses, churches, farms and
castles, all realistic in the sense that a doll's house is realistic, with
anonymous cream walls and grey roofs. Or he disposes outsize sets of
children's building blocks as though they were office blocks in city
centres. Latest of all come the outsize toy motorway sets with their loops
and arches in solid grey concrete. We are to 'Imagine we can order these',
'Imagine it is raining' or 'Imagine we are driving'. A computer graphic
display takes us round the bend and on for ever through a wide, featureless,
mindless landscape, signifying nothing.
Richard Wentworth, ten years older, is from the same conceptual stable,
though a long-time teacher at Goldsmiths' rather than its product. His work
too is that of the visual pun and the test of the object in its everyday
self. He produces no image or reproduction, no suggestion that the plate or
broom or redundant desk of his tableau is anything but what it is. It is
only in its redisposition, its imaginative displacement, that it becomes a
thing anew. The aesthetic is one of elegant playfulness, often mannered and
self-indulgent to a fault, yet redeemed by the sharpness of the wit and the
fastidious rigour of its formal presentation. His has been art on a knife's
edge, teetering now to the trivial, now to the banal or obvious, but keeping
its balance, just.
But just how long can Wentworth go on playing the same old tricks? Elegant
variation is quite as much a visual as a literary fault and there are few,
as Fowler tells us, so widely prevalent. 'It is the second-rate writers,
those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying
their meaning clearly . . . that are chiefly open to (its) allurements'. It
would be unkind, yet, to condemn Wentworth as second-rate, but is a certain
desperation setting in? This is not a full retrospective, but the ideas
already repeat themselves and only the scale develops.
The pun gets no funnier in endless repetition, least of all in being shouted
louder. Bigger is not better. Wentworth's 'Cumulus', a clutch of china
plates on a glass shelf held precarious and high by an upturned ladder, had
its proper and persuasive sculptural presence, the more so for being so
delicately put. Now at the Serpentine, another high shelf slopes down the
length of the gallery with its fragile burden: 'Lips and Fingertips'. So
what? Large and twisted sheets of corrugated metal lie together on the
gallery floor, punctured only by house-like boxes on their underside. His
'Toy' sardine-tin, of 1983, let into its solid steel bath, was somewhat more
succinct a statement of the same device. A proper retrospective would have
told him so.
Julian Opie: Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre, SE1, until February 6, then
to the Kuntsverein, Hannover.
Richard Wentworth: Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens, W2, until January
3, then to Bristol, 's-Hertogenbosch and Calais; sponsored by Principles and
the Expanded Metal Company.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Telecoms across the borders - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In three recent decisions, the European Court of Justice has interpreted
Rome treaty provisions relevant to cross-border trade and competition in the
French and Belgian markets for telephone equipment, cordless telephones and
walkie-talkie radiocommunication equipment.
The cases involved prosecutions for possession or marketing of telephone and
radiocommunication equipment without the requisite national authorisations
or type approval.
The court has confined its rulings to confirming that the European
Commission's 1988 directive on competition in the telecommunications
terminals market will be infringed only when such prosecutions are brought
in the situation where national standards-fixing authorities also compete as
providers of services or equipment.
The competition rules applicable to public undertakings granted special or
exclusive rights by a member country may also be infringed in these
circumstances, but not if the body fixing, rather than enforcing, the
technical standards in issue is genuinely independent of any public or
private undertaking competing in the relevant equipment or service market.
The court said that approval of equipment by the competent authority of
another member country made no difference. In the absence of EC level
harmonisation of telecommunication and radiocommunication systems, the
approval by one member country did not guarantee that the equipment in
question would not interfere with the operation of the systems in other
countries with different technical standards.
Where authorisations are required to be obtained from a minister responsible
for government radio frequency supervision, the treaty ban on import
restrictions does not apply if there is a right to seek judicial review of
any refusal. Moreover, the rules on state commercial monopolies do not
apply, since there is no discrimination against imports.
In the French cases, the rulings were given in the context of criminal
proceedings enforcing the French law regulating equipment permitted to be
connected to the French state telecoms network which prohibits the marketing
of telecoms terminals without the appropriate type approval.
The defendants argued that French law infringed EC directive 88/301/EEC on
competition in the telecoms terminals market on the grounds that the French
authority responsible for fixing technical standards was not independent of
the body operating the public telecoms network and which itself marketed
terminal equipment.
The court said that the 1988 directive required member countries from July 1
1989 to ensure that the fixing of technical standards, their supervision and
type approval of equipment were carried out by bodies independent from
public or private undertakings involved in the commercialisation of
telecommunications equipment or services.
This requirement was infringed as, at the relevant time, different
departments of the French ministry of posts and telecommunications were
simultaneously responsible for the commercial exploitation of the public
network, the fixing of technical standards, supervision of conformity and
the approval of terminal equipment.
With regard to the position before July 1 1989, the court confirmed that the
EC competition rules applicable to public undertakings were infringed when a
member country grants the undertaking operating the public telecoms network
the power to fix the standards for telephone equipment and to supervise the
conformity with those standards by operators with which it competed.
In two Belgian cases, the court said the treaty rules on free movement of
goods and commercial monopolies were not applicable in the context of the
Belgian law applicable to radiocommunication equipment. However, the Belgian
government admitted that the 1988 directive's requirement of independence
between regulator and commercial operators was not satisfied by the law
after July 1 1989.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: When worker turns poacher - Robert
Rice explains the confusion over restrictions on ex-employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restrictions imposed by businesses on employees, preventing them from
poaching clients and staff after they have left the company, have produced a
steady stream of court battles. But two recent, conflicting decisions by the
Court of Appeal have thrown this area of the law into confusion.
In October last year, the court gave a judgment in J A Mont (UK) v Mills
that appeared to tighten further the accepted approach to interpreting
restrictive covenants. The court ruled that where a restrictive covenant
imposed by an employer on an ex-employee was clearly too wide and was
therefore unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade, the court
would not attempt to find within it some narrower and more reasonable
restriction that could be enforced.
But in August this year, in the case of Hanover Insurance Brokers v Shapiro
and others, a differently constituted court appeared to cast doubt on what
it called the 'unsympathetic approach' adopted by the court in the Mont
case.
On this occasion, the judges indicated there were circumstances where the
court could legitimately look behind what appeared on the surface to be an
unenforceable and unreasonable restraint, to find the true intention of the
parties. The court also raised questions over the enforceability of clauses
that seek to prevent the poaching of staff by ex-employees, in the most
detailed treatment of the subject by the courts since 1959.
While the HIB case does not create a precedent, it does make the law of
restraint of trade less certain.
According to Mr Peter Frost of Herbert Smith, HIB's solicitors, lawyers had
always advised their corporate clients that restraint clauses had to be
drafted very carefully, because any ambiguity would be interpreted by the
court in the employee's favour. After the HIB decision, that may no longer
be the case. In particular, where the clause has been inexpertly drafted,
the courts may now be prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the
employer.
The HIB case concerned four ex-employees: Mr Monty Shapiro, the chairman and
a consultant, Mr Paul Anscombe, managing director, Mr Peter Rose, a
director, and Mr David Knowles, a manager. Each of the defendants had a
service agreement with HIB, which contained provisions restricting their
activities for 12 months after the termination of their employment.
The action was brought by HIB to enforce those restrictions. The four
defendants were trying to carry on a business of insurance broking through
another company.
Although the service agreements were not identical, they were broadly
similar. The thrust of the restraints was that, for 12 months after leaving
HIB, the four men should not canvass, solicit or endeavour to take away from
the company the business of any of its customers or clients who had been
customers or clients in the 12 months prior to their leaving. They were also
banned for 12 months from poaching any of HIB's staff.
HIB obtained an ex parte injunction, which the defendants unsuccessfully
attempted to have set aside, first in the High Court and then in the Court
of Appeal.
The High Court did, however, reject the injunction insofar as it related to
poaching HIB staff, and so the Court of Appeal also had to deal with a
cross-appeal by HIB, which sought to have the restriction on poaching staff
reinstated.
The issue of the proper approach to the construction of restrictive
covenants arose in relation to the appeal by Mr Rose and Mr Knowles. They
had argued that the restraint on canvassing and soliciting was unreasonably
wide and therefore unenforceable. This was because the reference in their
service agreements was not to soliciting or taking away from HIB the
business of HIB's customers, but to soliciting or taking away from Hanover,
HIB's parent, or its subsidiaries the business of Hanover's or its
subsidiaries' customers. Hanover, the court said, could be described as a
conglomerate.
It was conceded by counsel for Mr Rose and Mr Knowles that the 'business'
referred to in the phrase 'canvass, solicit or endeavour to take away the
business' was meant to refer to the business of insurance brokerage and not
to any other business carried on by Hanover or its subsidiaries.
This was plainly right, the court said, and it followed that the ban on
canvassing and soliciting was only meant to apply to HIB's, or Hanover's,
insurance broking clients.
Yet at first sight, Lord Justice Nolan said, the covenant was written so as
to protect the Hanover group and all its businesses. As such, it was plainly
too wide and unenforceable, he said.
To allow the restriction to stand, therefore, would involve the court
adopting a more flexible and supportive approach to the interpretation of
the restriction than the court had shown in the earlier Mont case.
According to Mr Frost, the message sent by the court in allowing the Rose
and Knowles canvassing restriction to stand was that, where the type of
restriction was appropriate, the clause had not been drafted by lawyers and,
in all the circumstances of the case, it was clear that both sides knew what
the clause was meant to mean, then the court might be prepared to give the
employer the benefit of the doubt.
But the court was not prepared to adopt the same liberal approach to the
construction of the restriction on poaching HIB staff. The judges said the
restriction as drafted would have applied to all employees of HIB
irrespective of their expertise or seniority and would have applied to those
who were employees at the time they were poached even if they had only
become employees after all the defendants had left.
As such it was much too wide and amounted to 'a mere covenant against
competition on the defendants', which the court would not enforce.
The court was not prepared to accept HIB's argument that an insurance
brokerage and the goodwill of its business depended on its staff and that
this was a legitimate business interest meriting protection. The court was
not even prepared to entertain that HIB had a seriously arguable case on
this point sufficient to grant an injunction until the issue could be argued
in full at trial.
Having taken a liberal approach on the interpretation of the Rose and
Knowles canvassing clause, the court's position on the cross-appeal appeared
somewhat contradictory. But according to Mr Frost, the real reason for
rejecting the cross-appeal was that the court simply did not like this form
of restriction.
Citing a 1959 case, the judges said: 'An employee has the right to work for
the employer he wants to work for if that employer is willing to employ
him.'
That must cast doubt on the validity of any clause against the poaching of
staff, Mr Frost said. Until now it had been thought that employers had a
legitimate interest in maintaining the stability of their workforce,
particularly where they had invested considerable time and money in
training, and that this legitimate interest could be protected.
From now on lawyers would have to advise employers that there was little
they could do to stop employees from working for anyone they wanted to work
for, he said. Indeed, the HIB judgment as a whole will necessitate a
reassessment by business of its strategy towards restraints of trade.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Law Society calls for end to tribunal
limits - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice, forcing the UK to
remove the statutory Pounds 11,000 cap on compensation in sex and race
discrimination cases, has prompted the Law Society to call for limits to be
lifted in all industrial tribunal cases.
Mrs Janet Gaymer, a partner of City solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons and head of
the society's Employment Law Committee, says tribunals cannot offer justice
if they cannot offer proper compensation. The present Pounds 11,000 limit in
non-discrimination cases should be more than Pounds 30,000 just to keep pace
with wage inflation since 1975, she says.
The society believes tribunals should be able to compensate people in full,
whatever the nature of their claim. But if the government is not prepared to
change the law, it should at least increase the maximum award levels to take
account of inflation.
Industrial tribunals are also hampered, says Mrs Gaymer, because they cannot
take account of a person's earnings over Pounds 205 a week, so anyone
earning more than Pounds 10,670 a year is likely to lose out. The only
correct course for the government is to remove all limits, she says.

FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Lee comes out of retirement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Lee is back in business. One of those who can reasonably lay claim to
having spotted the onset of recession, Lee presided, in 1990, over the
highly successful sale of Bricom, a two-year-old MBO from British &amp;
Commonwealth, and subsequently retreated to his working farm in Sussex.
Lee then spent a year at agricultural college, and, apart from picking up
the non-executive chairmanship of Carpet-land at the beginning of last year,
the 48-year-old chartered accountant had stayed out of business. Around six
months ago, he started attempting a comeback, and, through an introduction
from merchant bankers Charterhouse, eventually found the Hollas Group, a
small Manchester clothing and textiles company.
Tony Lawson, who had been chairman and chief executive, says that, at the
age of 62, and after 42 years with the business, he had been considering
bringing in a new chief executive, but he had intended to stay as executive
chairman. When Lee came on the scene, however, 'it was obvious that he was
going to be number one. After some thought, I agreed to become non-executive
(chairman).'
Roger Wallwork, 60, the finance director, is also retiring and is replaced
by Paul Baddiley, 41, who was Lee's finance director at Bricom, and had
previously held a number of financial posts at BTR.
In Hollas, Lee has a group with 'nil gearing that makes profits in every
company', Lawson says, and hence a suitable vehicle for acquisition-led
growth. Lee, who is setting up the bare bones of a head office in London,
will reveal the substance of his strategy when Hollas reports its interims
at the beginning of January.

FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Lady Thatcher takes unpaid job at chamber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister who tends to be held in
higher regard overseas than at home, has underlined her special relationship
with America by joining the international advisory board of the
British-American chamber of commerce.
There are plenty of chambers of commerce which are bigger than the
British-American Chamber (founded in 1920) but its relatively small size is
overshadowed by the composition of its advisory board, which is chaired by
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan.
The membership of the 36-strong board ranges from Sir Dennis Weatherstone,
president of JP Morgan, and Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate-Palmolive, to
Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, and Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks
and Spencer.
Apart from being the first ex-prime minister to join the board, Lady
Thatcher is also the first woman. Thomas Wyman (right), executive chairman
of SG Warburg &amp; Co Inc, has also joined the board.
Members of the advisory board are not paid, but the responsibilities are not
particularly onerous. The board only meets twice a year, once in London and
once in New York.
Although some 500 US companies are members of the British-American chamber
of commerce, roughly twice the number of British corporate members, there
are more British members on the advisory board. Given Lady Thatcher's strong
following in the US, her arrival there may help the chamber of commerce
achieve its ambition of getting an equal balance on the board.

FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Dick boards National Express
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coaches tend to get treated as an afterthought when the planners sit down to
devise or tinker with transport networks. One proposal currently being
studied is to ban coaches from the overtaking lane of motorways, an idea
which would have a disastrous effect on their journey times.
Alastair Dick, newly appointed director of group planning at National
Express, Britain's largest scheduled coach operator, hopes to change all
that. He wants to see the needs of coach operators taken more into account
and an early task will be to fight the overtaking proposal.
Dick, 57, has worked as an external consultant to National Express for some
time but has now been brought on board to implement his ideas.
He moves to National Express at an interesting time for the company. It was
floated on the London Stock Exchange last December and has since been
expanding, acquiring its Dutch partner in a pan-European coach consortium
and taking over the operation of East Midland International Airport last
August.
Dick has a background of more than 35 years in transport planning and has
worked for the past 18 years as an independent consultant. He was involved
from the outset in the passenger and revenue forecasts made for the Channel
Tunnel project and has also worked on the planning of a network of toll
motorways for the Hungarian government.
He sees his main task in bringing together the different specialists
involved in big transport projects.
The technical side is often the easiest part but, as the British government
has recently found to its cost, making sure a project will generate
sufficient revenues and finding financial backers is trickier, he says.

Towry Law, one of the UK's largest chains of independent financial advisers,
has moved to strengthen its board by appointing two extra non-executive
directors: Bill Stuttaford and Clive Gilchrist.
The appointments come in the context of the firm's plans to join the market:
until now, Lord Ellenborough has been the only non-executive director.
Stuttaford, 64, is a director of Invesco, General Portfolio Group and
several investment trusts. He has, however, given up his role with Brown
Shipley since the investment management side was sold to Capital House.
Gilchrist, 43, has a background in pensions and investments and is a vice
president of the National Association of Pension Funds.
Alan Wesley, chief executive of Towry Law, says it is important to the
company to be 'Cadbury compliant' and have the right numbers of executive
and non-executive directors, but emphasises also that both appointments had
areas of expertise which would bring 'added value' to the board.
He highlights particularly Stuttaford's European knowledge, and says that
Gilchrist's experience will be important because the company wants to
increase the pensions part of its business. Stuttaford says he is keen to
take an active role in offering comments and ideas: 'I don't see myself just
as a monitor'.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Going solo with business
advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A damn good idea, but one that has been slow to get off the ground, is how
Geoff Smith, chairman of the Keighley Business Forum in West Yorkshire,
describes the government's 'one-stop shop' initiative.
So, he says, with northern candour: 'We decided we would just get on with
our own version.'
One-stop shops, recently given the brand name Business Link by the
government, seek to bring together under one umbrella the array of local
business advice organisations. They are generally set up by Training and
Enterprise Councils in partnership with local bodies such as chambers of
commerce.
Birmingham and Leicester are among 11 shops which have so far received
formal approval, but Keighley is not one of them.
History might have been different if nearby Bradford Tec and its chamber of
commerce had been able to unite the local partners last year in time to make
a bid. It was then that the Keighley Business Forum decided to go it alone.
An important consideration was that many services and information sources
available 12 miles away in Bradford were not accessible in Keighley.
Bolstered by a report into the economic requirements of the town, the forum
established the centre, which opened last month, using contributions
totalling Pounds 30,000 from its 85 member companies and Pounds 48,000 from
Bradford Tec.
Full-time director Iain Copping, who used to work for Scottish &amp; Newcastle
Breweries, can direct callers to the relevant experts in the chamber of
commerce, Bradford Tec, the local Asian business forum or the local
authority's Economic Development Unit.
The ambition of the forum extends beyond providing advice in a centre. 'We
want to persuade those companies considering leaving Keighley to stay and
persuade companies thinking of relocation to consider us,' says Copping.
Not having much spare cash the forum's members have done a lot of unpaid
footwork. A small delegation recently visited the South African embassy to
discuss possible joint ventures and trade opportunities between the two.
Keighley's is a brave effort, but public funding is unlikely until the forum
can demonstrate to the Department of Trade and Industry that there is an
equal partnership with the other players, such as Bradford Tec and the
chamber of commerce.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Dependent on the
overdraft - Companies must rethink long-term financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owner-managed businesses in the UK are still 'depressingly dependent' on the
overdraft as a means of financing their long-term development, according to
a survey* carried out by the accountancy firm Touche Ross.
This reliance increases with the size of the business, the survey of 264
companies with sales of Pounds 5m to Pounds 150m shows.
The report, however, suggests that banks are becoming more interested in
taking an active lending stance. It also shows them becoming more
professional in their assessment of risk, increasingly using computer models
to test profit projections and demanding more evidence of sound planning.
On the whole, owner-managed businesses appear to be reducing their external
borrowing but they remain constrained by high gearing. Peter Morgan, Touche
Ross partner responsible for owner-managed businesses in London, says he is
pessimistic about the chances of many raising money as the economy recovers.
'Banks are often criticised,' he says. 'But many businesses are being run by
people who lack management skills. Someone with a reasonable proposition,
decent management and good advice will get a hearing from banks.'
During the year under review - most of the companies in the survey had March
1993 or December year-ends - all but the largest owner-managed businesses
reduced their gearing ratios. The smallest companies remained most heavily
dependent on external finance and also found new funds harder to raise.
All sizes of companies increased their level of trade creditors - on average
by 10 per cent - but not because they were growing.
While squeezing creditors provided some cashflow relief, interest costs were
still eating on average a hefty 44 per cent of operating profits.
Perhaps the most revealing section of the report is the list of the methods
companies least like to choose to raise money. Businesses most want to avoid
factoring, followed by venture and development capital. Leasing and hire
purchase came next, with the sale of equity and commercial mortgages 'least
disliked' apart from the bank overdraft.
Equally alarming for Touche Ross is the apparent lack of professionalism it
found. Only a third of companies said they planned to raise new money over
the next two years. Yet nearly half expected to grow at between 6 and 15 per
cent over three years. Touche Ross believes this is unrealistic. For every
Pounds 100 increase in sales, it says, an average manufacturing company will
need Pounds 25 of extra working capital (stock and debtors less creditors),
even before increases in capital spending.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Now's the time to buy
German - As prices for Mittelstand companies tumble, David Waller offers
advice for potential buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now may be the best time in decades to buy a small or medium-sized German
company.
Recent research* published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that the market for
corporate acquisitions has turned dramatically in favour of the buyer. The
report suggests that the number of deals in the German mergers and
acquisitions market shrank by 12 per cent last year, as the number of
companies for sale increased substantially.
According to Peter von Windau, head of DGM, a large consultancy firm
specialising in advising the German medium-sized company sector, prices for
companies have dropped between 20 and 40 per cent over the past year.
This reflects the severity of the economic downturn, which has forced many
owner-managers of Mittelstand (medium-sized) companies to consider selling
up.
Potential buyers are thin on the ground; bigger German groups, which in
better times might have been natural purchasers, have had to pull in their
acquisition horns, whilst foreign companies have been put off by Germany's
economic problems. Buying a company is not easy and the first piece of
advice for a potential buyer is to hire an adviser, preferably one who
speaks fluent German or is German.
The key to opening successful negotiations is to understand the mentality of
the seller. As David Young of Deutsche Bank merchant banking subsidiary
Morgan Grenfell pointed out at a recent conference, this is likely to be
very different from that of the typical buyer, an Anglo-American manager
working for a stock-market listed company.
The most important thing to know is that money is not everything for the
owner of a German private company. 'A third- or fourth-generation owner
often does not need the money and it can be an insult to try to persuade him
to talk by promising an excellent price,' explains Young.
Loyalty to the company he has built up over decades, to the community in
which it is based and in which he lives and to the workforce are likely to
be more important.
Any proposal with an opportunistic, asset-stripping flavour is likely to be
given short shrift. As Young puts it, the owner will feel the company is
likely to be destroyed, with disastrous consequences for his standing in the
local community. 'This view is strongest in respect of English and American
purchasers who are famed (in Germany) for their short-termism,' he adds.
Often, the owner will speak perfect English - but do not on that account
imagine he thinks like an Anglo-American businessman. The best tactic is not
to suggest a deal at all, Young recommends. An initial meeting should focus
on a more limited objective, such as exploring joint-venture possibilities
in a certain segment of the market.
Make sure the agenda for the meeting is established in advance; that whoever
attends from the buyer's side is senior enough - and old enough - not to
deal a blow to the owner's sense of self-esteem; never cancel. Cancellation
at the last minute would be considered an irreparable breach of business
etiquette.
Aim to develop a relationship with the target company over the medium-term.
'How and where you raise the issue of whether the owner wishes to sell is
very like a marriage proposal and very much depends on how the relationship
is progressing,' he says. 'The advantage of discussions about co-operation
is that it is a fairly short step to suggesting that this is backed up with
an equity shareholding.'
Having taken the plunge and received a favourable reply, the would-be buyer
will encounter new problems.
The key issue is to obtain the elementary financial information which can be
used to establish a basis for an offer price. German companies are required
to file a copy of their audited profit and loss account with the German
equivalent of the UK's Companies House. According to the Coopers &amp; Lybrand
report, though, most companies, particularly the smaller ones, pay no heed
to these requirements. Probably 90 per cent of companies do not bother with
the filing.
Having persuaded the vendor to part with his accounts, the purchaser will
have to adjust the accounts to reflect commercial reality. German accounts
are driven primarily by tax considerations and are likely to understate the
company's true profitability. 'It is therefore important in price
discussions that both foreign buyers and German vendors ensure that they are
referring to the same figures,' Coopers counsels. 'This is best achieved by
normalising the results and by both parties agreeing to the adjustments that
have been made.
Perhaps the most sensitive issue is the owner's tax position. Morgan
Grenfell's Young explains, many owners of Mittelstand companies have 'an
obsession with taxes which only comes with living in a country with high
nominal tax rates'.
Under German tax rules, selling a business outright can give rise to a
substantial 'wealth tax'. But Young says tax considerations may drive many
entrepreneurs to sell their businesses next year in the hope of avoiding an
extra 7.5 per cent solidarity tax which is to be imposed for one year from
January 1, 1995.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: Video with chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the infant world of multimedia - where sound, vision, and computing data
are converging to create a new branch of electronics - there are plenty of
technological hurdles to be overcome before the products are relevant for
most consumers.
VideoLogic, a UK company, said yesterday that it had removed one by
developing computer chips to speed up and enhance films in software form so
their quality on a computer screen is equal to that on television. This is
aimed at helping move multimedia from a niche to a mass market including
small business and home users as well as big companies and organisations.
'At present,' says Trevor Wing, marketing executive of VideoLogic (owned by
Avesco), 'software video can only play movies at small postage-stamp size.
The demand is for full motion and full screen.'
A video shot at 30 frames a second drops to only three a second when blown
up to computer-screen size. The new chips, Powerplay and Powerstream -
designed with IBM - can be built straight into personal computers' graphic
systems to accelerate video speed.
'Publishers will introduce thousands of CD titles during the next 12 months
and many of these will include software movies,' says Wing.
The multimedia chips, which will be shown at next week's Comdex computer
show in Las Vegas, have stimulated interest among PC makers worldwide, he
adds. They will be priced low enough for manufacturers to be able to
incorporate them into new PCs cheaply. Powerplay will be marketed at Dollars
25 each for batches of 1,000, though companies can negotiate lower prices
for mass use.
Most multimedia applications are in the training and retail areas; new ones
will be in computer games, education and publishing. 'These new products
really fit fairly and squarely in the everyday user category,' adds Wing.
Deliveries will start at the end of January.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: New objective for software - Claire Gooding
looks at a flexible program, geared to clients' needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Software 2000, a US company, tried to assess the evolving needs of
customers four years ago, it was faced with a problem. Users wanted constant
improvements to their existing packages, while prospective buyers were
looking for something new.
To solve the dilemma, Software 2000 decided to rewrite its entire package
using the latest programming techniques of object-oriented software. This
would offer companies a more flexible and simple system.
With the recent launch of its new accounting and software product based on
this technology, Software 2000 has become the first software house to bring
such a package to the market.
Software programs based on object-orientated design are easy to use, with
on-screen icons and windows like most personal computer software of the
1990s. But a big difference is that such programs can be used in many
different hardware situations, from mainframe to PC.
In software terms, 'objects' are prefabricated chunks of software that can
be used again and again, making programs easier to write and maintain. An
object view presumes that any transaction or business operation starts with
an object and gives a choice of related activities. An object can be any
item used by anyone in their everyday work. Activities to do with that
object - information, an invoice, even a diary date for a customer - are all
options attached to that object. A user simply picks the relevant activity.
All the information about one object is stored in one place. This contrasts
with the usual practice in which each application, such as purchasing, sales
and forecasting, is handled separately.
Most object-oriented products on the market are software tools: systems
components such as databases and development aids. Many big corporations
have adopted the technique to bring disparate applications into line.
Before rewriting its package, Software 2000 asked people at all levels of
responsibility what they sought from such a system. Everyone wanted
immediate access to information, speed and the ability to interact with
people on the telephone and deliver information wherever it was needed. 'We
put our software through its paces in a 'usability lab',' says Michael Hunt,
Software 2000's chief executive.
Accessibility to information was the feature that convinced Baxter
International, the US healthcare group, to spend an initial Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 331,125) on Software 2000's revamped personnel package. Baxter's
reorganisation in 1992 emphasised European rather than local control for
operations in the region. Managers in its five business lines became
responsible for profit and loss, which made information about salaries and
other employment costs a critical part of the European picture.
'We call it a human resources system, but it's really a business system
because line managers will have access to it,' says Bert den Breejen,
Baxter's Netherlands-based director of human resources. Typically of
Baxter's new structure, he also has responsibility for pan-European systems.
Den Breejen argues for a devolution of personnel responsibilities to line
managers. The Software 2000 implementation at Baxter will give up to 1,000
managers easy access to the European-wide information they need to assess
and react to the ever-changing deployment of staff. Previously, the 16
national offices in Europe, all using different personnel systems to manage
the 7,000 regional employees, could not supply information to fill
vacancies, estimated at between 700 and 1,000 annually. Now, personnel staff
will spend less time on administration and more on problem-solving.
The object-orientated software not only capitalised on Baxter's use of
existing IBM AS400 computers and PCs, but also allowed for local tailoring
for national regulations. No other software supplier, says den Breejen,
could satisfy that need with easy-to-use software.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: Rising up from Dresden's rubble - German
engineers are rebuilding a 250-year-old church destroyed by allied bombing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hans-Joachim Jager leads the way through the piles of sandstone rubble
wedged between the remains of the wall anchor which once supported the high
altar of Dresden's Frauenkirche and a solitary column. 'I promise you, we
will rebuild the Frauenkirche,' he says determinedly.
Jager, an engineer from the east German state of Saxony - the capital of
which is Dresden - heads the team charged with restoring the Frauenkirche
(Church of Our Lady) to its former glory. Construction took 21 years and was
completed in 1743. Allied bombing destroyed it on February 13, 1945.
That night, the inner city of Dresden was destroyed. Yet the Frauenkirche,
designed by George Bahr, survived the impact of the bombs. It was only when
fire engulfed its interior, causing the steel supports in the construction
to expand and the stone surfaces of the columns to chip that the 97m-high
edifice caved in.
The former East German communist regime decided not to restore the
Protestant church or remove the remaining rubble, to symbolise the futility
of war. But after unification, the people of Dresden decided to rebuild the
baroque church. 'It symbolises a new beginning,' says Jager.
The task of rebuilding the Frauenkirche appears immense. Jager and his 80
engineers and construction workers intend to rebuild the eight columns in
the interior and the remaining 16 columns flanking the aisles and sides of
the church. The columns were structurally connected to the walls of the
portals and corner towers by wrought-iron anchors.
Bahr, who left copious notes on the construction and design of the church,
wanted to distribute the load across the 24 columns, with the four corner
towers absorbing the weight from the dome. The dome, carved in sandstone and
weighing 12,200 tonnes, was Bahr's crowning engineering and architectural
feat. With the dome in place, Bahr wrote that the church would have the
effect of 'a single stone right from the bottom to the top', like the
structure of a pyramid.
The weight of the stone dome had caused problems. When the cupola had been
first mounted, cracks appeared in the masonry of the supporting structure
and modifications were made. Further efforts to strengthen the columns and
stone work were carried out in the inter-war period when damp and cracks
were discovered. Between 1939 and 1942, significant reconstruction work was
undertaken to reinforce the columns with flat rolled steel hoops.
Jager betrays no anxiety about the challenge of hoisting the dome on to the
reconstructed pillars. He says the church will be stronger and more stable
than the original, thanks to modern technology. Reinforced steel girders,
stronger than the wrought-iron anchors, will support the dome.
The reconstruction of the church will be carried out in phases. Initially,
all archive material on the original design and construction of the
Frauenkirche is being gathered. 'We have many of the original plans and
designs, as well as numerous photos,' says Eberhard Burger, director of the
site.
Once this material has been collected, the team will move to the second
phase which involves removing 21,200sq m of rubble spread over 3,220sq m.
This will take several months. Jager reckons about a third of the rubble
(about 210,000 pieces) can still be used. The rest is too badly burned or
reduced to small stones or dust. As each stone is removed, it is measured,
numbered, described and its location recorded. The information is then fed
into a computer. 'Slowly, we build up a picture of what stone fits where,'
explains Burger. One of the many computer print-outs depicts how a column
will be partly reconstructed with the stones pulled out of the rubble. Any
missing stones can be replaced by local sandstone quarries.
Many stones, however, are chipped, if not badly damaged by the fire. Again,
Jager says this problem can be overcome. 'There is a great craft tradition
in Germany. Indeed, I believe the craftsmanship tradition has survived
longer in eastern Germany because we did not have access to modern
technology.' He and Burger have been involved in restoring churches in
Saxony since the early 1980s. Both engineers say they will not restore any
blackened stone to its former light colour. 'These burnt scars will serve as
a memory,' says Burger.
Some of the stones and beautiful ornate work on the Corinthian columns and
vases which served as stabilisers and decoration are repaired on site or in
workshops throughout Saxony. The craftsmen rely on photographs and designs
of the Baroque period on which the Frauenkirche was modelled. They also rely
on extensive diagrams from the inter-war years, when repairs were
undertaken. Jager points to some finished sandstone vases. 'Depending on the
complex nature of the restoration, we can complete some of these repairs
within two days.'
Once the rubble has been cleared and catalogued, the team will know what is
missing and the extent of the damage. The engineers will have a clear idea
about the technological problems involved in rebuilding the structure. 'The
aim is to secure as much original material as possible so that we can
reconstruct nearly an exact replica,' says Burger. The team will then start
rebuilding, financed, he hopes, by a worldwide fund-raising campaign to
collect DM300m (Pounds 122m). Jager says work should be completed by 2002,
four years ahead of Dresden's 800th anniversary.
But there are still decisions to be made, particularly for the interior. The
organ, played by JS Bach when it was installed in 1736, cannot be replaced.
The planners think they will reduce seating accommodation from 2,500 places
(in addition to 2,000 for standing) to about 2,000.
They dismiss any idea it will be difficult to fill the seats given the fall
in attendances. 'The people of Dresden will come,' says Jager. 'That is the
least of our problems.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / More rail link tunnels urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTRA TUNNELS and other route changes that would add Pounds 125m, or 5 per
cent, to the Pounds 2.5bn cost of the Channel tunnel rail link are proposed
in a Kent County Council report which was published yesterday.
The 90-page report will be put to a special meeting of the council on
Thursday and, if approved, will be submitted to the Department of Transport.
The department is considering a study by Union Rail, the company set up to
develop the high-speed rail link.
The Kent study confirms the county's support in principle for the 70-mile
link - 45 miles of which will be in the county - but calls for changes to
reduce its environmental impact. Mr Allan Mowatt, the county's director of
highways and transportation, said: 'This is not an enormous extra amount in
relation to the total sum of money to be spent.'
The report supports only half of the improvement proposals that were
suggested by local environmental and residents' groups, but could conflict
with Union Rail's desire to keep costly tunnelling to a minimum.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Accountants offer to fill tax returns by phone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL Luton-based firm of chartered accountants has created a national
network to process personal tax returns by telephone.
Fryer &amp; Co has created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Direct Line Tax
Service, which will offer to complete callers' annual tax returns for a fee
of Pounds 150. It has no connection with Direct Line, the telephone
insurance service owned by Royal Bank of Scotland.
The move represents a shift towards the widespread use of tax consultants
and high street advice centres such as H and R Block in the US. It comes
when the Inland Revenue is planning a shift by 1996 towards self-assessment,
which will require individuals to calculate how much tax they should pay and
send a cheque with their annual return.
Mr Ganesh Aiyer, a partner with Fryer &amp; Co, said 100 people had used the
service since it opened at the start of November. He estimated he would have
2,000 customers by the end of the tax year in March.
He said he could ultimately have a total capacity of 200,000 tax returns a
year 'if the market is there', and that he was considering opening a series
of high street tax shops.
Direct Line Tax Service at present has four staff with plans to expand to
20. It uses a nationwide telephone number that charges calls at local rates.
Mr Aiyer said the typical call would last 30 minutes.
Mr Malcolm Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation and a partner with
lawyers Linklater &amp; Paine, said: 'Developments of this type of service will
be a feature of the next few years.'
Mr Peter Wyman, chairman of the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England, dismissed suggestions that the service would present
a threat to existing accountancy firms.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Vocational standards will be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT for Education is to tighten standards for new vocational
qualifications after a school inspectors' report found standards in the
pilot examinations for 16-year-olds unsatisfactory in some cases.
The Office for Standards in Education found in its report on the pilot
examinations last year that intermediate level General National Vocational
Qualifications, each intended to be equivalent to four old O-level passes,
were 'variable and in some instances unsatisfactory'. Advanced GNVQs for
18-year-olds, 'vocational A-levels', were 'satisfactory and sometimes good'.
The inspectors listed shortcomings including documents loaded with too much
technical language and imprecise assessment and grading criteria that were
difficult to interpret. Course requirements arrived late, so some schools
did not allocate enough time.
External verifiers appointed by the awarding bodies had to check standards
of work in vocational areas in which they had no specific expertise.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Minewater studied following closures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, will this week
begin studying the movement of underground minewater as British Coal starts
to scale down its pumping operations in County Durham.
British Coal spends Pounds 1m a year operating nine pumping stations in the
centre of the county, but the recent closure of County Durham's last pits
means there is no operational reason to continue pumping.
The NRA warned British Coal, which is obliged to give only 14 days' notice
if it intends to cease pumping, that it could face legal action should
pollution occur.
The prospect that the pumping of almost 8bn gallons a year may be halted has
raised concern that water might rise through abandoned mine workings.

THE NATIONAL Health Service spends more than Pounds 610m a year treating
smoking-related health problems in England and Wales, the Health Education
Authority said yesterday.
It said in a report that about Pounds 1m a week was spent on prescriptions
from GPs for smoking-related illnesses, while GPs received 8m visits each
year by patients who were ill because they smoke.
It said children in households with a smoker visited their doctors more
often and needed more prescriptions.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Reform of counties is revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOCAL Government Commission yesterday moved closer to conflict with the
government by announcing drastically revised plans to restructure councils
in Derbyshire and Durham.
In the commission's final recommendations for both counties urban areas have
been split off to form all-purpose 'unitary' authorities, with the two-tier
structure of counties and districts retained for the 'doughnut-shaped' rural
areas remaining.
Plans announced by the commission in May called for the two-tier structure
to be abandoned in both counties.
Original proposals to abolish Cleveland county council and split it into
four unitary districts have been retained, however.
Sir John Banham, commission chairman, tried to avert a split with the
Department of the Environment, which has called for unitary authorities,
even if they create greater expense.
He told Mr David Curry, local government minister, that district councils
could make new joint proposals for unitary authorities in the areas where he
had called for the status quo to be retained. He ruled out creating unitary
authorities on existing district boundaries. The government has six weeks to
respond to the proposals.
The Association of District Councils, which is opposed to the proposals for
both Derbyshire and Durham, said districts would be producing options for
merged councils.
Employers gave the proposals a frosty reception. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth,
northern region chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, said the
proposals for Cleveland were 'a complete mess'.
He said: 'It's going to be a greater burden of cost, and a greater burden of
bureaucracy on the businesses of the area.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Kent wants extra tunnels for Channel rail link

<TEXT>
EXTRA TUNNELS and other route changes that would add Pounds 125m, or 5 per
cent, to the Pounds 2.5bn cost of the Channel tunnel rail link are proposed
in a Kent County Council report published yesterday.
The 90-page report will be put to a special meeting of the council on

relation to the total sum of money to be spent.'
The report supports only half of the improvement proposals suggested by
local environmental and residents' groups, but could conflict with Union
Rail's desire to keep costly tunnelling to a minimum.
The three main proposed changes are:
A longer tunnel under the North Downs to spare an area of outstanding
natural beauty between Bluebell Hill and Detling at a cost of Pounds 60m.
The link to go through the centre of Ashford rather than to the north.
A small diversion to avoid building a shallow tunnel under housing at Pepper
Hill on the edge of Northfleet.
The report says the environment is one of 'six key tests' by which the
proposed link should be judged. It criticises the government on two -
environment and freight transport - but is happy with the proposals in terms
of passenger services, the economic impact on the county and the proposed
international rail links.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Public 'puts high value' on landscape
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE rate environmental protection of the countryside as good value for
money, the government said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes.
The public is prepared to pay five times the current cost of conservation
schemes to save traditional English landscapes, said a report commissioned
by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Publication of the study follows calls by ministers for the costs and
benefits of environmental protection to be weighed more carefully.
The Centre for Rural Economy at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne asked
3,000 people about the value they put on the countryside and compared it
with the cost of the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme under which
farmers and landowners are paid to conserve some landscapes and habitats.
The overall cost of the ESA scheme in England last year was about Pounds 20m
 -approximately Pounds 1 per household.
Residents of the South Downs area of southern England indicated that they
would be prepared to pay an additional Pounds 27.52 a year in taxes to
conserve the appearance of the countryside. People from other parts of
England indicated that they would pay Pounds 1.98 per household for
conservation of the downs, even if they never visited them.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Entertainment yet to emulate Christmas puddings: Emma Tucker
on which items are bucking the deflationary trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent wave of price cuts initiated by Britain's biggest and boldest
retailers is good news for consumers whose pay packages have grown only
slightly since last year.
But although a Christmas pudding at Gateway is a third cheaper than a week
ago, not all of the things consumers buy are bowing to the economy's
deflationary pressures. Anyone who recently had their legs waxed, or ate in
a restaurant, will testify to that.
In the year to September, prices of restaurant meals rose by 5 per cent,
considerably faster than the actual inflation rate of 1.8 per cent. Personal
services - hairdressing, beauty treatments, medical, dental and nursing fees
 -were also 5 per cent dearer in September than they were a year ago.
Apart from one or two quirks - egg prices rose by 16 per cent in the year to
September - the most intransigent prices are in the services sector.
Inflation for entertainment and other recreation, for example, was 7 per
cent in the year to September, while motoring expenditure prices rose 6.1
per cent over the same period.
This compares with impressive performances in the traded goods sector where
low increases have encouraged fairly buoyant sales.
The good news is that inflation in the services sector is likely to fall
into line with traded goods inflation during the year ahead. Indeed, the
latest data indicates that this is already happening.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets, argues that
providers of services have realised that by raising their prices they are
'missing out' on the recovery. Only by adopting the price-cutting tactics of
their retailing counterparts will they be able to boost business.
Leisure services inflation has dropped from 4 per cent in the spring to 3.3
per cent in September, while inflation for personal goods and services is
gradually coming down.
This trend should be assisted by the continued downward pressure on labour
market costs, which in turn squeezes personal incomes and encourages
consumers to be ever more discerning about how much they are prepared to pay
for things.
'The search for good value will become ever more intense and widespread,'
says Mr Shepherdson.
But even if service-sector inflation drops into line with traded goods,
there will still be areas that do not succumb to the deflationary momentum.
The government itself will be putting upwards pressure on prices when it
imposes value added tax on domestic fuel next April. Its decision to
restrict tax relief on mortgage interest will also inflate the retail prices
index as will other government-influenced price rises, such as excise duties
on alcohol and cigarettes, postal services and utilities.
So in a year from now, barring external shocks, washing-up liquid should
cost little more than now, a dental check-up should be roughly the same
price, but fuel bills, petrol, cigarettes and whisky will resolutely defy
the trend.

FT  09 NOV 93 / 'Third age' population to rise 9%: Spending power and tastes
of older people highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS AGED over 50 exhibit different tastes, social values, shopping
habits and leisure pursuits from younger people, according to a study by
Mintel, the market research company.
The number of people in Britain in the over-50 age group will increase by 9
per cent in the 1990s, it says, and those in their early 50s will rise
almost a third, as the 'baby boom' generation grows older.
As a result, a new group of 'third age' consumers is emerging, which
embraces people born during the baby boom.
Older consumers eat out and go out drinking more than young ones, rate
quality above fashion in clothing, are more cautious about buying on credit
and value retailers' efficiency above their friendliness, the study says.
The trend is likely to have important economic effects because many 'third
age' consumers are affluent. Those aged between 50 and 64 have the highest
weekly expenditure in the country - Pounds 124 last year.
They also spend more of their income than younger people on food, household
goods and motoring, and less on housing, fares and clothing. Their spending
plans are less likely than those of younger people to have been affected by
recession.
The study says, however, that those in the 'third age' divide sharply
between white collar and professional people in well-paid jobs, who are
cushioned by occupational pensions and early retirement schemes, and manual
workers and the long-term unemployed, many of whom suffer real hardship.
But many more men than women over 50 say they find life more satisfying than
ever before, particularly if they are employed.
People aged more than 50 become less concerned with being seen as
successful, stylish or streetwise, emphasising instead qualities such as
being trustworthy, responsible and sensible.
More employed people in their fifties than in their sixties say they look
forward to retirement.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Amec Offshore faces full strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC OFFSHORE, the Tyne-side offshore fabrication company, faces a strike
over new terms and conditions.
In a secret postal ballot, the result of which was declared yesterday, the
company's 900 manual workers voted for strike action over its attempt to
make night-shift employees work seven hours a week longer for their present
pay rates.
The company, which recently said union 'intransigence and shortsightedness'
was threatening its future, said it was only asking the night shift to work
'gift hours' currently paid but not worked. It said it had to reduce costs
to remain competitive.
The unions said the seven hours, which would bring the basic weekly night
shift to 47.5 hours, were part of the premium rate for working overnight and
arose in compensation for breaks forfeited to give continuity of production.
The ballot, among members of the GMB general union and the AEEU engineers
and electricians union, backed strike action by more than two to one.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said there would be discussion with members on the next
move, which 'could be all-out strike action'.
Amec Offshore said it was disappointed at the ballot and had tried, up to
national union official level, for a resolution.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Loans rise lifts hopes of recovery: Consumer borrowing at
highest for 3 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES THAT the economy is on course for recovery were boosted yesterday by
government figures showing a sharp rise in consumer loans.
Net borrowing by consumers from building societies, finance houses and on
credit cards operated by the Visa and Mastercard systems rose to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 489m in September, the highest figure for more
than 3 1/2 years and the second successive monthly rise. It came after
consumers took out Pounds 225m in new loans in August. Lending on credit
cards and for cars and consumer durables such as carpets was particularly
high in September.
The result underlines how consumers appear to be spending more after a long
period of muted activity during the recession.
In the third quarter of this year new consumer loans, which do not include
mortgage debt but are a good indicator of demand for borrowing, came to a
net Pounds 918m after Pounds 525m in the second quarter and Pounds 400m in
the first three months. The third quarter figure - which takes into account
repayments of past loans - was the highest since mid-1990.
Net borrowing on Visa and Mastercard came to Pounds 106m in September, after
a net repayment of Pounds 89m in August. Loans taken out through specialist
finance houses, mainly for cars and other high-price items such as house
furnishings, totalled Pounds 336m in September. In August the comparable
number was Pounds 298m.
Signs that consumers are increasing their interest in new loans were
supported by another, broader, series of figures from the Central
Statistical Office. These figures include borrowing taken on bank cards
outside the Visa and Mastercard systems and extra debt from bank loans.
The series, available only on a quarterly basis, showed total net loans in
the third quarter at Pounds 737m, after Pounds 393m in the second quarter.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Welfare costs 'exaggerated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAIMS THAT the cost of the welfare state is rising to levels the UK cannot
afford are countered in a report published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, the social research organisation.
The report appears a day after Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury, said further increases in welfare spending could take government
spending to unsustainable levels.
The foundation says that while Britain's welfare spending has risen sharply
over the past three years, it has been stable as a share of national income
over the medium term. That share - about a quarter of GDP - is below the
level in most other European countries, according to the foundation.
The report, based on research by the Welfare State Programme at the London
School of Economics, says that claims about upward pressure on welfare costs
have been exaggerated.
Even with an ageing population and higher pension costs, the share of GDP
taken by the welfare state will grow slowly, the report says. If benefit
levels were again linked to earnings, the cost of the welfare state would
rise by 5 per cent of GDP over the next 50 years.
This is no more than the increase in welfare spending in the last three
years, according to Mr John Hills, the report's author. 'There is still a
wide range of policy options open to ministers,' he said.
Scaling down the welfare state would hit more than just the poorest in
society, the report says. Many relatively well-off people depend on the
health service and social security system during times when their income is
lowest.
Mr Hills said: 'If the aim of policy remains one of holding down welfare
spending as a percentage of GDP, hard choices may have to be made about
entitlement to benefits.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Warehouse club status limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAREHOUSE shopping clubs will be given planning permission only as
retailers, Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, insisted yesterday. This is
in spite of a High Court judgment last month that a local authority was
right to treat the UK's first such club as a wholesaler.
Mr Baldry also said the government was committed to encouraging retail
investment in town centres, and that the age of giant out-of-town shopping
centres was over.
He was speaking at the launch of a report on the Merry Hill retail park near
Dudley, West Midlands, which found the centre had 'severely affected' the
vitality and viability of two town centres and harmed five other towns.
Mr Baldry sought to end confusion over how councils should assess warehouse
clubs - which sell goods at low prices to fee-paying members  - after the
High Court ruled that Thurrock Borough Council in Essex was justified in
considering US company Costco as a wholesaler when Costco made a warehouse
club application.
He said the government's planning policy guidance, PPG6, issued after Costco
was first given consent, made it clear that clubs should be treated as
retailers. 'Let there be no shadow of a scintilla of doubt that no warehouse
club will ever be able to get planning permission in the future except as a
retailer,' he said. Planning applications contravening guidelines would be
called in by the Department of the Environment.
Mr Baldry said PPG6's main aim was to swing the pendulum in retail
development away from out-of-town and back towards city-centre sites.
'We expect people to look first at town centres. If they can't find a town
centre location, we would expect them to look at edge-of-town. Only if all
that fails would we expect people to look at out-of-town locations.'
He said yesterday's report on Merry Hill provided a 'clear indication' of
the impact of out-of-town shopping centres. It found Dudley town centre's
share of the region's retail market had dropped to one-third of its level
when Merry Hill was completed in 1989, leading to the departure of large
retail chains, an increase in vacancies, and a fall in rents. The centre
also caused a 'marked reduction' in the quality of retailing at nearby
Stourbridge.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Killings and firm dollar hit bookings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKINGS TO Florida for next summer are running at about the same level as
last year, suggesting the state is failing to maintain its share of the
growing UK holiday market, travel agents said yesterday.
Airtours, which owns travel chains Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson, said
about 1.2m summer 1994 holidays to all destinations had been booked through
UK agents - nearly 500,000 more than at the same time last year. Lunn Poly,
the biggest chain of travel agents, said that the figure could be closer to
1.7m.
Both chains said the recent murders of tourists in Florida and the strong
dollar appeared to have hit bookings. Nevertheless, fears of a sharp fall in
UK visitors to the state did not appear to have materialised, they said.
Mr Kevin Welch, marketing director of Pickfords and Hogg Robinson, said that
Spain appeared to be benefiting most from the increase in bookings.
More than half of summer 1994 bookings were to Spain or the Canary Islands.
He added that Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and Turkey appeared to be losing
market share.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Machine tool chiefs lobby for industry finance agency: Loans
body for small manufacturers demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MACHINE tool industry is urging the government to set up a lending
institution for small and medium-sized manufacturers as part of a package of
Budget measures to bolster competitiveness.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the Machine Tool
Technologies Association said financing of small and medium-sized companies
required attention because they were vital to jobs, innovation and growth.
'We would suggest creation of an institution similar to the KFW in Germany
dedicated to industrial lending or the instigation of a national investment
bond, similar to that in operation in France,' it said.
Yesterday at a press conference in London for next April's Metcut '94
exhibition in Birmingham industry leaders joined Mr Neil Johnson, the
director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, in calling for the
return of 100 per cent capital allowances.
Mr Stan Vaughan, association president, said the UK had suffered persistent
under-investment, especially by small and medium-sized companies. 'The time
has come for the government to back its encouraging words with action.'
Next year's Metcut show is being seen by the industry as a focus for its
efforts to show it has weathered the recession.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Lenders 'must look at debtor problems': Mortgage sector
warned on arrears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE lenders should be more sensitive to other debt-related problems a
borrower may face and should consider paying for advice from external
agencies, says a report published today.
It argues that a more relaxed approach among borrowers towards falling into
arrears means lenders must change their practices to be effective.
Interviews with members of 46 households in and around London revealed sharp
differences from attitudes expressed in previous research. People in arrears
were less likely to blame themselves rather than, for example, the
government, and were more likely to become used to living with debts.
Many of those questioned also felt that lenders' options were limited
because of the state of the housing market and the extent of arrears.
The London Research Centre, which carried out the study for the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation and the Building Societies' Trust, recommends that
lenders should:
Ensure that, where possible, borrowers deal with the same member of staff to
improve the chances of establishing a good relationship.
Assure borrowers that information they provide will not be used against
them.
Consider funding external advice agencies, which may be better placed to get
a full picture of a borrower's circumstances.
Involve both partners in a relationship in discussions about repayment.
Give advice to young borrowers who have little experience of managing money.
Provide more information about options available.
Recognise that repaying arrears is not always the borrowers' first priority.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Retail sales show thin and patchy recovery: CBI survey shows
wholesale trade buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME sales in the high streets registered a marginally higher annual rate
of growth last month, but they disappointed retailers who said that sales
were below normal for the time of year, and growing less fast than in the
summer.
As the accompanying table shows, the Confederation of British Industry's
latest distributive trades survey uncovered a marked variation in
performance in the various retail sectors. It also highlighted differing
fortunes for the wholesale trade, where sales were buoyant, and the motor
trades, where rising sales were considered low for the time of year and
where sales growth was only in the parts and accessories area.
Among retailers, grocers and chemists experienced a marked slow-down in
year-on-year sales growth between September and October, while furniture and
carpet stores, booksellers and clothing outlets reported big jumps in sales
volumes. Off-licences, which in September had reported a return to growth
after 12 months of year-on-year declines in sales, again reported falling
sales.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of economic surveys at the CBI, said the variations
reflected the end of discounting in some sectors and highlighted the uneven
nature of Britain's economic recovery. He said the survey, which polled 500
companies with 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the motor trades
between October 18 and November 1, was 'a sign that retail sales are not too
solidly based'.
The CBI also reported 'stark differences' in the growth of sales volumes
among the different categories of retailers. All mail order companies
reported higher sales volumes compared with October last year. The large
multiples continued to boost their sales, as evidenced by a strong positive
balance reporting higher volume sales last month.
The number of large multiples reporting a year-on-year growth in sales in
October exceeded the number reporting a decrease by 31 percentage points,
unchanged from September. Small multiples, with a positive balance of 11
percentage points last month against 12 per cent in September, also reported
increased sales. But single outlet retailers reported an accelerating fall
in sales with the number reporting lower sales volumes compared with October
last year outstripping those with higher sales by 20 percentage points.
Retailers, wholesalers and motor traders placed more orders with suppliers
last month, although in the retail sector the increase came entirely from
mail order companies and the large multiple stores.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Labour steps up attack on fuel VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's plans to impose
value added tax on domestic fuel next year by starting a campaign against
the measure in 22 marginal Tory constituencies.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the taxation
of domestic fuel was an unpopular measure which would cause deep concern to
Tory MPs who had been elected by slim majorities.
She said these Conservatives were under pressure to save either their seats
or their chancellor. 'I challenge the chancellor to accept that his majority
in the House of Commons on this issue is disappearing.'
Ms Harman said the campaign would take the form of 'constituency action'.
Her party was unwilling to debate the question of adequate compensation for
pensioners and poorer social groups on this issue - it was against the whole
principle of the tax.
VAT will be imposed on domestic fuel from April, and the chancellor will
announce in his November 30 Budget whether it will be at the rate of 8 per
cent or 17.5 per cent. Negotiations are still going on in Whitehall over the
size of the compensation package for pensioners.
Apart from the 22 constituencies where the campaign would be mounted, Ms
Harman said there were a further 60 where Tory MPs had a majority of less
than 5,000.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Advertiser calls Mirror 'sleazy and stupid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY, DIANE SUMMERS and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of Daily Mirror advertisers yesterday reacted sharply to the
paper's publication of surreptitious gym pictures of the Princess of Wales.
Britannia Building Society, which had an advertisement in yesterday's
Mirror, described the paper's actions as 'sleazy and incredibly stupid', and
said it would review its advertising policy when its present series came to
an end.
The Royal Automobile Club, which was dismayed to find its advertisement
yesterday opposite a picture of the Princess in a leotard, was the first to
cancel advertising.
Mr Jeffrey Rose, RAC chairman, said: 'The RAC does not condone, much less
support, this unwarranted intrusion, and, in consequence, advertising with
Mirror Group Newspapers has been discontinued.'
The action was in line with advice given yesterday by Lord McGregor,
chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. Partly because the PCC has no
power other than the power of censure Lord McGregor suggested that the Daily
Mirror and the Sunday Mirror should be regarded as 'outlaws' and treated
accordingly by readers and advertisers.
Autoglass, the windscreen replacement company, said it would be dropping
advertisements from the Mirror 'for the foreseeable future'. It added: 'It
is important for our ads to be carried in papers that people respect and
admire.'
But WH Smith said it would be 'taking things to extremes to consider
withdrawing advertising', and HMV and Vauxhall said they did not take
advertising decisions based on the editorial policy of newspapers.
At the LA Fitness Club in Isleworth, west London, where the pictures were
taken, none of the 1,000 Pounds 500-a-year members had resigned, according
to Mr Max Clifford, the public relations consultant.
'There have been a couple of irate phone calls but nobody has resigned,'
said Mr Clifford, who is acting for Mr Bryce Taylor, the 39-year-old New
Zealander who owns a majority stake in the club. Mr Taylor admits setting up
the concealed camera which took the pictures, for which he is believed to
have received Pounds 100,000 from the Sunday and Daily Mirror.
'With my contacts these pictures will sell for Pounds 1m worldwide,' said Mr
Clifford.
The decision to publish the pictures in yesterday's Daily Mirror did not
pass unchallenged by the newspaper's management.
On Sunday, after the first batch of photographs was published in the Sunday
Mirror, and the condemnations were starting to come in, Mr David Montgomery,
chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, asked Mr David Banks if he had
any doubts about publishing. The Daily Mirror editor replied he had none -
at MGN the editor's word is final while he is editor.
As the Daily Mirror put it yesterday: 'Our motto always was: Publish and be
damned.' Last night it seemed everyone, from the Princess to the rest of the
British press - which now fears legislation - was ready to oblige.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Water cut-offs fall by 42%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER COMPANIES are cutting off far fewer households than last year for
failing to pay bills, figures published yesterday by the water industry
show.
The number of customers disconnected by the big 10 water and sewerage
companies in the six months to September was 3,362, a 42 per cent fall on
the corresponding period of 1992, the water industry said.
Disconnections by Anglian Water leapt from 87 last year to 410, however. The
company said it had tried last year to reach compromises with people who had
difficulties in paying. 'Now we are left with a hard core who won't pay at
all.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / TUC chief attacks manager 'fads'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOO MANY British companies slavishly follow the latest management fads which
come from the US, instead of developing models appropriate to Britain,
according to Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC.
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Involvement and Participation
Association in London he said: 'While the United States has many good
qualities, these do not include an economy whose competitiveness is
increasing. With some spectacular exceptions the American economy has
suffered the same trends as Britain's'
He added that British and American companies used redundancy as an option of
'first resort'. A better example was set by Japan and western European
economies, which tried to use it as a last resort.

EXPECTED BUDGET cuts have led Birmingham city council, the biggest local

they would be prepared to take redundancy, John Authers writes.
The council said it feared it could lose Pounds 30m in the 1994-95 budget
allocation, but stressed it did not have a target number of staff
reductions.

<TEXT>
A WELSH broadcaster, the BBC and a Russian film company aim to benefit from
the market for cultural cartoons.
Operavox, a series of six animated classic operas condensed to 30 minutes,
is the result of a collaboration between the Welsh-language channel S4C,
BBC2, and the Russian production company Christmas Films.
The group's previous venture, Shakespeare - The Animated Tales, has been
sold to 50 countries and recently won two Emmy awards in the US.
A second series of Shakespeare films is in production for next autumn.
Two of the operatic films, The Magic Flute and The Barber of of Seville,
were produced in Moscow and the other four - Carmen, Rigoletto, Turandot and
Rhinegold - were made in the UK.
Music for the films, which are aimed at a non opera-going audience, has been
recorded in Welsh and English by the orchestra and chorus of the Welsh
National Opera.
Transmission in the UK is set for next Easter.
The group also announced that it had begun pre-production work on six
half-hour episodes for a series called The Old Testament - The Animated
Tales, which is expected to be ready for transmission in autumn 1995.
Mr Chris Grace, director of animation at S4C, said: 'European and American
broadcasters are attracted by our commitment to using the art of animation
in the European vein to explore our common cultural heritage.'

<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is expected to signal the closure of its Frickley colliery and
the rationalisation and possible closure of at least one other today as it
takes its pre-privatisation closures programme to the heart of Yorkshire.
The announcement that it wants further talks with unions on Frickley and
Bentley later in the week will provide a significant test for the
rationalisation programme which started last week with the proposed closure
of Calverton, Nottinghamshire.
Today's announcement would follow the disclosure by British Coal yesterday
that it had agreed in principle for the first time for a private sector
operator to lease one of 20 pits which have been offered for licence in
recent months.
RJB Mining is expected to start operating Clipstone colliery in
Nottinghamshire in the next two months. A price and the division of
liabilities have been agreed, but not disclosed.
RJB believes Clipstone has potential to be mined for at least five years.
Initially the company will be unable to employ more than 150 men
underground, because of legal restrictions, but could employ at least 200 in
total.
Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, said he had started recruiting at
Clipstone, aided by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
Today's announcements on Frickley and Bentley are expected as unions and
management discuss prospects for all pits in the Yorkshire region. Union
leaders believe the Hatfield and Prince of Wales pits are vulnerable, but it
was unclear last night whether they would be named for further discussions.
The trustees of the 570,000-member Mineworkers Pension Scheme yesterday
called for legislation requiring that they be included in discussions about
how the scheme's assets are to be divided following privatisation.
The trustees want the legislation to include specific promises about
index-linking and government solvency guarantees for a new scheme for
existing and deferred pensioners.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Scott probes discrepancy in evidence on Iraq deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCOTT arms-for-Iraq inquiry is investigating a contradiction in evidence
between a Foreign Office official and his MI6 contact, it emerged yesterday.
The official, Mr Simon Sherrington, told the inquiry that he had not been
aware of key intelligence reports when, in October 1989, he advised Mr
William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, on sensitive exports.
He advised that lathes made by the Midlands company Matrix Churchill were
not necessarily defence-related and could be justified under the
government's guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he based his advice on
information provided by MI6. But he said he had not seen earlier MI6 reports
which warned that Matrix-Churchill machine tools were being used by Iraq to
produce ballistic missiles.
Mr Sherrington identified his MI6 contact as a Mr O and said he could not
recall any 'adverse comment' from the secret service about his briefing to
the minister.
Mr O's written evidence has not been made available by the Scott inquiry.
But it is said by inquiry officials to suggest that Mr Sherrington
misrepresented the advice given by MI6.
Mr O is to be questioned by Lord Justice Scott in a private hearing later
this week. The dispute between Mr Sherrington and Mr O has renewed the
attention of the Scott inquiry on earlier evidence given by Mr Waldegrave
and the role of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the civil service who as
cabinet secretary is the government official with responsibility for
intelligence and security.
Mr Waldegrave told the inquiry last month that he approved the export of
defence-related machine tools to Iraq in November 1989 because he had not
seen items of key intelligence.
The public hearings have been adjourned until November 22.

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: BA 'needs 600-seat superjumbo'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is putting increasing pressure on commercial aircraft
manufacturers, including Boeing of the US and the European Airbus partners,
to develop a new 600-seater superjumbo aircraft for delivery around the turn
of the century.
Mr Alistair Cumming, BA's director of engineering, told a Financial Times
aerospace conference at the Dubai Airshow that BA needed such a large
aircraft to reinforce its global strategy. Increasing airport congestion,
especially at BA's home base of London Heathrow, could severely handicap the
airline's future, Mr Cumming warned.
'So much so that we have concluded that we will only be able to satisfy
future traffic demands and maintain market share on intercontinental routes
with larger aircraft,' he explained.
Boeing is currently studying with the four Airbus partners, British
Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain,
possible joint development of a superjumbo. Both the US company and Airbus
are also conducting separate studies of their own for a large aircraft.
But in the worst post-war recession in the airline market, manufacturers are
reluctant to commit themselves on a programme expecting to cost well over
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in research and development.
However, Mr Cumming said manufacturers 'had to listen' to their customers
and their future equipment requirements. The consolidation of the airline
industry around a number of giant airline groups was likely to change the
relationship between airlines and manufacturers, giving a few big airlines a
much greater voice in future product decisions than in the past. 'If you put
BA and all its airline partners together you are talking of. . . about 1,000
aircraft of 40 different types,' he said.
There was likely to be some rationalisation of this global fleet in the
shorter term but in the longer term, as BA develops its integrated global
airline system, there would be a huge aircraft re-equipment need for the
group which could potentially involve as much as Dollars 50bn of
procurement, he said.
BA is building up its integrated global system through its equity
partnership in US Air, Qantas and some smaller European carriers.
Other airlines are also forming global groups expected to seek to
rationalise their fleets and eventually re-equip them on a more integrated
basis.
BA has already established a special study team to work with airframe
manufacturers to help design a superjumbo.
Initial designs envisage a 600-seat multi-deck aircraft in which the
different levels, including the underfloor belly, could be used by
passengers.
'Designs also allow for a quick change of cabin configurations because, in a
global airline, an aircraft travelling predominantly westbound re-quires a
daytime atmosphere, while one flying eastwards requires a configuration more
suited to rest and sleep,' Mr Cumming explained.
With the new large aircraft BA is seeking a 20 per cent cut in operating
costs compared with the Boeing 747 through better fuel efficiency, longer
service life and reduced downtime.

HYUNDAI, South Korea's largest business group, plans to produce passenger
aircraft using Russian technology in the second Korean civilian aerospace
project to be announced within the month.
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, which manufactures railway and other transport
equipment, will establish a joint venture aerospace company with Yakovlev of
Russia in which the Koreans will have a 51 per cent stake.
Yakovlev will be responsible for the design and development of the passenger
aircraft based on 150-seat Yak42H and the 30-seat Yak40H. They will be
assembled by Hyundai in South Korea.
Hyundai will also establish a global marketing and after-sales network for
both the Korean-made airliners and other aircraft produced by Yakovlev.
It is the first civilian aircraft venture for Hyundai Precision, which
already assembles military helicopters.
It follows last month's announcement by Daewoo Heavy Industries that it
plans to manufacture medium-sized airliners in co-operation with Aviation
Industries of China and Korean Air, the country's main airline.
Daewoo is also negotiating with Hindustan Aeronautics of India and Singapore
Aerospace to participate in the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) project to develop
and produce the airliner that is scheduled to enter service in 1998.
The Hyundai and Daewoo civilian aircraft programmes represent a new
departure for the Korean aerospace industry, which now largely consists of
assembling US military aircraft, such as the F-16, and the production of
civilian airliner components.
The Korean government wants the country to become one of the world's ten
leading aerospace producers by the year 2020 and has budgeted some won250bn
(Pounds 209m) for the development of a medium-sized passenger aircraft.

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japanese oil refiners pull out of Saudi
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S three leading oil refiners yesterday announced the cancellation of a
Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.27bn) joint venture with Saudi Arabia.
Nippon Oil, Nikko Kyodo and Arabian Oil said they were pulling out of the
proposed oil refining project with Aramco, the Saudi-owned oil company, and
Caltex Petroleum of the US, due to a sharp fall in demand triggered by
Japan's economic slowdown.
The decision is a blow to the Japanese government, which had hoped to
establish a stable oil procurement route through the joint venture.
Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and industry,
yesterday said the government regretted the cancellation.
Saudi officials in Riyadh had no immediate comment on the cancellation of
the proposed joint venture, feasibility studies for which began last year.
The joint venture had planned to buy two existing oil refineries from Nikko
Kyodo and Nippon Oil. It also planned to build a new refinery in southern
Japan, but the Japanese refiners decided they could not afford to build a
new plant which was expected to become profitable only after 12 to 14 years.
Japanese oil refiners and distributors have been hit by the economic
downturn, and Nikko Kyodo faces Y90bn in extraordinary losses caused by the
liquidation of its US affiliate. The loss of expected income from the sale
of the oil refineries to the joint venture may force the companies to
implement cost-cutting measures.
The Japanese joint venture was expected to cement Saudi Aramco's Asian
presence. However, it is understood that the company has not abandoned plans
to expand its downstream operations in Asia and is exploring possible
alternative joint ventures in the region.
The Saudi state oil group, which recently merged with the state refining and
marketing arm, Samarec, is understood to have begun negotiations with other
potential partners in Asia. No details have so far been made public, but the
search for alternative deals would fit in with Aramco's long-standing plans
to guarantee market access for its crude oil through participatory ventures.
Saudi Aramco's moves to bind supplies of crude to joint venture refineries
in its main markets began with the 1988 deal to supply about 600,000 barrels
a day of Saudi crude to Star Enterprises, a 50-50 refining and marketing
venture with Texaco, the US oil company. Three years later Aramco bought a
35 per cent stake in Ssangyong Oil of South Korea - the country's third
biggest refiner. It has explored a similar such deal in Europe - though here
again Saudi officials have refused to confirm any specific approaches to
European refiners.

FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan relives dream of cheap electronics -
China's demand for electronics is greater than Japan's was in the 1960s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Konnosuke Matsushita, the late founder of the electronics company which
bears his name, dreamed of making consumer electronics products available in
Japan as cheaply and abundantly as tap water.
With Japanese markets for TV sets and video recorders at saturation point,
Matsushita is now gearing up to relive its founder's dream in neighbouring
China.
Last week, Matsushita announced it would set up a joint venture facility to
produce core components for video tape recorders in the high tech industrial
complex of Dalian. The venture with the China Hualu Electron Company, which
will manufacture 1.5m VTR components a year, will be Matsushita's 12th
facility in China. Ten of those, including the VTR venture above, will be
making products for the Chinese market itself, making Matsushita unusual
even among Japanese manufacturers.
Many Japanese companies have invested in southern China as a manufacturing
base for export but Matsushita is looking to the future of the Chinese
market itself, says Mr Katsumi Tametani at Matsushita's corporate management
division for Asia, Oceania and the Middle East.
Already, China produces 10m TV sets, most of which go to meet domestic
demand. In volume terms that is larger than the entire European market, not
to mention the Japanese market itself, which is about 800m-900m sets.
Meanwhile, penetration of colour TVs is estimated to be as low as 5-6 per
cent in rural areas and 7 per cent in the cities. The potential for growth
in demand looks far more promising than in the west and Japan, where demand
is mainly for replacements.
Mr Tametani says that China, in some ways, is like Japan 30 years ago, when
Matsushita saw its business expand as Japanese consumer spending began to
increase. Just over 30 years ago, sales of colour TVs rose strongly in
Japan, spurred by the marriage in 1959 of the current Emperor and Empress.
But the rate at which Chinese consumers are buying electronics products
today is even faster than that seen in Japan in the 1960s.
'If the market develops at this rate it could outstrip Japan in value terms
as well,' Mr Tametani says.
Matsushita is also looking for growth in demand for washing machines and
pagers which are in wide demand as there is on average only one telephone
per 100 people.
The speed at which the Chinese markets for consumer products are advancing
to ever-more sophisticated technology and the rapid development of the
domestic industry mean that Japanese companies need to offer greater value
to compete in China.
Matushita's VTR joint venture signals a major development in the Chinese
video industry, which has long been dependent on Japan for the key
components that go into the sets assembled in China.
By joining hands with Matsushita, the Chinese aim to replace some of those
imports from Japan with locally produced components. With a 20-year stake in
the joint venture, Matsushita appears to have ensured itself a role in the
development of what could become the world's largest VTR market.

FT  09 NOV 93 / New Zealand bank moves to assure markets: Currency eases,
equity market closes 6% down, bond market under close scrutiny

DR DON BRASH, governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, moved quickly to
reassure financial markets yesterday that it was 'business as usual' in
spite of the unexpected political upheavals of the weekend general election
in which no clear winner emerged.
Dr Brash said the bank would intervene if the dollar fell so far as to
effect its anti-inflation targets. However, yesterday the dollar, which
initially fell sharply, recovered ground against the US currency. The equity
market closed down more than 6 per cent, recovering from a 10 per cent fall
at the opening. Analysts commented that the market would remain nervous over
the next few days and the bond market would be watched closely.
The leaders of the four parties now represented in parliament emphasised
yesterday that the financial markets had nothing to fear from the minority
government The National party won 49 seats on Saturday night, while the
opposition Labour and two minor parties the Alliance and New Zealand First
have 50 between them.
Mr Mike Moore, Labour party leader, who has 46 seats and refuses to concede
defeat, made a highly publicised pilgrimage with his finance spokesman, Dr
Michael Cullen, to the Reserve Bank yesterday to emphasise that his party
would not change the act which gives Dr Brash independence in setting
monetary policy, with the aim of securing low inflation.
Mr Jim Anderton, leader of the two-seat left-wing Alliance party, yesterday
reaffirmed his support that National should continue in office as it had won
most seats on Saturday.
He also praised Prime Minister Jim Bolger's handling of the post election
situation, while sharply criticising Mr Moore, ruling out any early
discussions with his group.
Commentators now expect that the Alliance party will allow National to
continue to govern, if the present state of the parties remains unchanged
after 200,000 special votes are counted and following any recounts.
Financial markets were waiting the response from US markets overnight to the
changed New Zealand political situation. Some investors fear that the US may
react negatively to the possibility that the country's economic reform
programme has stalled, perhaps permanently. However, others noted that most
of the US investment was in the form of long term investments.
Dealers and brokers expect the nervousness to continue over the next few
days as the Americans assess what will be a changed political scene in New
Zealand. Even if National increases its majority after special votes are
counted, it is considered unlikely that it will press ahead with the next
round of reforms.
Key players in the financial markets last night said investors in Australia
and Asia had accepted that nothing really had changed, and that it would pay
to wait at least until the final outcome of the election is known in 10 days
or so. C S First Boston dealer Mr Chris West said that Australian and Asian
investors were happy to watch developments.
'Several said they still liked the New Zealand economic story. However we
are very nervous over the way the Americans might react.'
Americans have invested heavily in New Zealand over the past four years.
They have made no secret of their support for the radical economic reforms
instituted by the previous Labour government and extended over the past
three years by National.
The reforms have received widespread favourable press in the US where they
have been enthusiastically endorsed by the economist Professor Milton
Friedman and industrialist Dr Tony O'Reilly, whose company Heinz last year
paid NZDollars 600m (Pounds 226.5m) for food processor Wattie Industries.
Other companies such as Bell Atlantic, Ameritech, Bell South and
International Paper have invested millions in New Zealand over the past four
years on the assumption that the reforms will continue.
Early trading in the bond, fixed interest and equity markets was dominated
by fears of what offshore investors might do.
Bond yields rose by nearly 1 per cent, the dollar plunged and the share
market fell by 216 points on the NZ Top 40 capital index, as small investors
panicked. By midday after the governor's statement the selling pressure
eased as offshore investors remained on the sidelines.

THE FRAGILITY of Japan's ruling coalition was underlined at the weekend when
it lost a local election to a candidate backed by the Liberal Democratic
party, the former governing party.
The seven-party coalition, the most popular Japanese government on record,
lost the election for the governorship of Hiroshima Prefecture because it
failed to agree on a joint candidate.
Only three coalition parties managed to agree on a name, while the remaining
four refused to back anybody. As a result, an independent supported by the
LDP, Mr Yuzan Fujita, a former member of the upper house of parliament for
Hiroshima, won the election by a big margin. He got 392,842 votes to 280,531
for the three-party candidate.
This adds weight to indications that the coalition government will lose the
next general election if it fails to put up a field of joint candidates.
An election is likely towards mid-1994, assuming the government succeeds in
getting agreement on plans to reform the political system. The LDP's failure
to achieve political reform contributed to its defeat last June.
The next test of the coalition's electoral fortunes is due on December 5,
when Hiroshima holds a parliamentary by-election to fill the seat vacated by
Mr Fujita on his election as governor.

FT  09 NOV 93 / State urged to scrap controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STATE CONTROLS on Japan's economic activity must become the exception rather
than the rule, with 'no sanctuaries' from deregulation, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa,
chairman of the Keidanren business federation, said yesterday.
He heads a government-inspired panel that has called for a central body to
carry out a five-year economic deregulation plan. The panel's report follows
government departments' resistance to reductions in extensive powers they
apply through regulations. It aims to deliver a more concrete report by the
end of the year.
All of Japan's more than 10,000 official regulations should be reviewed or
considered for abolition, the report says.
It singles out as urgent examples 500 rules, on top of the 94 proposals put
forward by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the first steps of his
deregulation drive in September. They include the rice import ban and the
resale price system, which requires some products such as books and
cosmetics to be sold at producers' recommended prices.
Regulations in several sectors where public interest or safety is at stake
should be relaxed and clarified, rather than considered for abolition, the
report says. These include public utilities and oil supply, finance,
securities and insurance, land and housing. The tradition of 'administrative
guidance', used by bureaucrats to wield wide informal powers, should only be
applied in a clear manner within the law, the panel added.
The proposals would be enacted by a deregulation office, to be set up by
next April under control of the prime minister, whose efforts would be
supervised by a powerful independent watchdog. The establishment of such a
body would place the success or failure of deregulation directly in the
hands of Mr Hosokawa and his successors, rather than in the government
departments concerned.
Even at this interim stage, the report has been rewritten after Mr Hosokawa
and Mr Hiraiwa rejected a first draft. Mr Hosokawa has told the panel to
halve the deregulation timetable from the 10 years advocated by some members
of the 15-strong panel of business leaders, economists and former officials.
Mr Jiro Saito, vice-finance minister, gave the report a lukewarm reception.
He had no 'fundamental philosophical objections' and hoped to implement it
'sincerely'.

<TEXT>
AN AFRICAN has been chosen to head the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation for the first time in its 48-year history after a Chilean rival
withdrew and urged his backers to keep the post 'in the developing world'.
Mr Jacques Diouf of Senegal was elected as director-general of the FAO,
which is the largest of the UN's specialised agencies. He won an
eight-cornered contest on the sixth ballot of FAO-member countries at the
organisation's general conference after a marathon session of nine hours'
balloting.
Mr Diouf, 55, takes up his post on January 1 to succeed Mr Edouard Saouma of
Lebanon, director-general for the past 18 years.
Mr Diouf defeated Australia's former secretary of industries and energy, Mr
Geoffrey Miller, who had been backed by the US and other industrial powers.
Before the sixth and final ballot was held, Mr Juan Figueroa Yavar, the
Chilean minister of agriculture, announced that Chile and Senegal had made
an agreement to support each other's candidates if necessary to ensure that
the new FAO director-general came from the Third World.
Mr Diouf has been Senegal's ambassador to the UN in New York since May 1991
and was previously secretary-general of the Central Bank for West African
States.
A UK government official said that Britain had supported Mr Miller in the
voting because it believed he was the best candidate to reform the FAO and
restore credibility dented by the personal style of Mr Saouma who
manipulated the rules to get himself re-elected for three consecutive terms
amid mounting criticism of his leadership.
But he felt there were benefits in having an African at the head of FAO at a
time when Africa faced the most serious problems.

ISRAEL'S prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, launched a scathing attack on the
EC yesterday, demanding better access for Israeli exports to European
markets and more vigorous support for the peace process.
'The unjustified discrimination against Israel by the EC cannot be tolerated
any longer,' he said. 'We do not need sympathy, we need deeds and acts to
support those who have taken risks for peace.'
Speaking to the Institute for European Studies at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, he contrasted EC attitudes with those of the US. While the US
provided generous aid and its trade with Israel was roughly in balance, the
EC was running a trade surplus of about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn). He did
not expect the EC to match the US, but it should let Israel compete.
The Israeli leader also wanted a more emphatic European stance against the
continuing Arab boycott.
The US said it had asked the International Trade Commission to investigate
how the Arab boycott of Israel has affected US companies, Reuter reports
from Washington.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Coca-Cola invasion starts to worry businessmen: Stefan
Wagstyl reports that much of industry will be hard-pressed to compete with
rising imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appearance of Coca-Cola bottles in Indian shops makes Mr Rahul Bajaj, a
leading Indian businessman, feel nervous.
The US drinks group last month muscled its way into India by buying out
Parle, the country's top cola company, for Dollars 40m. Mr Bajaj, chairman
of Bajaj Auto, the world's largest scooter maker, is concerned that other
Indian companies may suffer Parle's fate. He says: 'There's no level playing
field between Indian companies and foreigners. In one stroke, Parle as a
company has disappeared. If this happens to several companies, will it be
good for India?'
Mr Bajaj is not alone. At a meeting last month of the Indian Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Mr Fredie Mehta, an economist and senior executive of
Tata, the diversified steel and engineering-based grouping, said in a speech
that the 'critical question before a number of captains of industry is: 'How
long will Indian industry remain Indian?''
The question has a wide resonance in India, which until a decade ago made
national self-sufficiency its guiding light. The liberalisation which
started in the 1980s and gathered pace in 1991 has long provoked opposition
from those who feel threatened by the change - trade unionists, junior-level
bureaucrats, and left-wing intellectuals.
The Bharatiya Janata party, the right-wing Hindu opposition party, has tried
to capitalise on these sentiments by accusing the government of being
favouring foreigners at the expense of Indians.
However, until this summer, top industrialists generally publicly supported
reform, including moves to open the Indian economy to foreign trade and
investment. Whatever reservations existed largely remained unspoken.
But, in the last few months, some leading industrialists have begun to
question publicly the pace of liberalisation. The true impact of increasing
competition from imports is beginning to dawn. Even though the flow of
foreign-made goods is still very slow, because of continuing tariffs and
restructurings, the business studies commissioned by virtually every large
group point to one conclusion - that much of industry will be hard-pushed to
compete with imports when the barriers come down.
Moreover, some business families, which typically run their corporate
empires holding 20 per cent or less of listed stock, are seriously concerned
about retaining control of their businesses as liberalisation spreads. As
one Delhi-based economist says: 'The most acute pain is a fear that they
cannot pass their business on to their sons and grandsons.'
Prominent among those questioning the pace of reform are the heads of some
of India's older family-owned groups, including Mr Bajaj, Mr Govind Hari
Singhania, who controls the Delhi-based J K Organisation with interests in
tyres and other products, and Mr Lalit Thapar, president of Ballarpur
Industries, flagship of a diversified papermaking group.
These men insist they do not oppose reform. Their arguments are couched in
careful language to maximise support and avoid causing unnecessary offence.
Their watchword is a demand for 'a level playing field'.
They argue that foreign companies entering India come with all the
advantages of operating in the international economy - such as access to the
best technology, economies of scale and low-cost capital. Indian companies,
by contrast, have been kept locked up in an uncompetitive environment.
Pre-1991 restrictions on private enterprise prevented them from developing
world-class plants and products.
These arguments have a political dimension because they echo parts of the
economic manifesto of the BJP, which is broadly sympathetic to promoting
Indian-made goods at the expense of foreign products.
Businessmen with greater faith in liberalisation scorn the thought that
Indian industry is about to be swamped by multinationals. The most
enthusiastic supporters of reform tend to be younger executives, often
managers at more recently-established companies, such as Reliance
Industries, the textiles and chemicals group. These men argue that India
needs foreign companies now to help up-grade skills and technology and bring
much-needed capital. They accept that competition will cause casualties.
These progressives have no complaints about the decision of Mr Ramesh
Chauhan, the owner of the Parle group, to sell out to Coca Cola. Mr Onkar
Kanwar, managing director of Apollo Tyres, a rapidly-expanding manufacturer,
says: 'He is a wise man. He saw the writing on the wall. He saw he could not
compete.'
However, even the strongest supporters of liberalisation acknowledge that
the conservative lobby has highlighted some genuine grievances.
One is a permission granted to foreign companies with part-owned Indian
listed subsidiaries to increase stakes at a discount to the stock market
price. Indian institutions, which dominate the share registers, are mostly
happy to do this because an increased investment by a foreign group brings
growth prospects. Indian entrepreneurs are annoyed because they too would
like to raise funds without losing control.
Another frequent complaint concerns import tariffs. Recent tariff cuts
created anomalies. In some industries, duties on components are higher than
those on finished goods: the idea is to protect domestic component makers
but the effect is sometimes to benefit the foreign producer of finished
goods.
Businessmen are also irritated with the country's state-dominated banking
system, which channels low-cost funds to politically-favoured borrowers such
as farmers at the expense of large-scale industry. Few foreign companies
borrow in India so they do not face the same problems.
Proponents of reform argue that, while these complaints are fair, it is
quite wrong to use them to build a case for slowing liberalisation. They
also say that India's problem is not attracting too much foreign investment
but too little.
Nevertheless, Mr Mehta of Tata believes that unless the concerns of the
conservatives are taken into account there is a risk of 'some sort of
possible backlash against the economic reforms from certain sectors of
industry'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, launched a scathing attack on the
EC yesterday, demanding better access for Israeli exports to European
markets and more vigorous support for the peace process.
'The unjustified discrimination against Israel by the EC cannot be tolerated
any longer,' he said. 'We do not need sympathy, we need deeds and acts to
support those who have taken risks for peace'.
Speaking to the Institute for European Studies at the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, Mr Rabin contrasted the economic and political attitudes of the
EC with those of the US. While the US provided generous aid and its trade
with Israel was roughly in balance, the EC was running a trade surplus of
about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn).
He did not expect the EC to match the US, but at least it should give Israel
the chance to compete.
'Even after a year of talks with the EC, we are still not allowed to begin
formal negotiations,' he complained.
Bilateral talks on replacing the obsolete 1975 free trade agreement are
expected to be completed next year and will concentrate on Israel's demands
for improved access for agricultural and high-technology products.
The Israeli leader also wanted a more emphatic European stance against the
continuing Arab boycott. 'We do not look to Europe as we do to the US, but
we do at least ask them to do the minimum,' he said. This meant putting real
pressure on the Arab League to call off the boycott of Israel, and also
doing more to mute Arab criticism of the peace deal with the PLO.
Mr Rabin stressed the calculated risks that Israel was taking for peace, and
thanked Egypt for providing a venue in Cairo yesterday for the resumption of
talks between the PLO and Israel. The negotiations, which are due to be
completed by December 13, were broken off last week by the Palestinians in
protest at Israel's proposals for a redeployment of troops in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank town of Jericho.
Defending the Israeli proposals, Mr Rabin said that, if they were
implemented, 90 per cent of Palestinians in the Gaza strip would not see an
Israeli soldier from sunrise to sunset. The latest round of talks are being
held at a secret venue in Cairo in order to avoid media attention.

<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE of Jordan voted yesterday in the kingdom's first multi-party
elections since 1956. A total of 534 candidates, including three women and
more than 15 political parties, were standing for the 80-member Lower House
of Parliament which along with the Senate, whose members are appointed by
the king, forms Jordan's national legislature.
Government officials reported a lower-than-expected turnout. Results are
expected today.
Moslem fundamentalists are tipped to take the largest bloc of seats in the
new parliament as they did in the 1989 elections. The Islamic Action Front
is the biggest and best-organised party. It has 36 candidates standing in 16
out of 20 voting districts and has conducted its campaign on the slogan:
'Islam, the solution'. Most other parties from Communists to Nationalists
have preferred to field candidates as individuals rather than on ideologies.
The outcome of the elections has important implications on the Middle East
peace process since the new parliament, which constitutionally has a term of
four years, may be asked to ratify a future peace agreement between Jordan
and Israel.
The fundamentalists are unlikely to win enough seats to threaten
ratification, but their rejectionist stance is a cause of concern to the
king. In the last parliament, their opposition to the peace process helped
bring down the government of Mr Taher Masri.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government has approved foreign investments totalling Rs10.2bn
(Pounds 220m), including plans for two oil refineries, a steel mill, a
cement works and a tyre factory.
The decisions take to about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn), the total amount
of foreign investment approved by the authorities since the launch of
reforms by Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, in mid-1991.
This compares with less than Dollars 1bn in the previous decade, but is
still well short of the much larger sums invested each year in China,
Indonesia and other fast-growing east Asian economies.
The actual flow of direct investment has been smaller than the total
approved - about Dollars 400m from mid-1991 to the end of May 1993. Final
decisions on some larger projects - such as power stations and oil
refineries - take time to complete.
The latest batch of approvals, cleared by the cabinet committee on foreign
investment on Friday, include two proposals by the Oman Oil Company, owned
by the Omani government, to take 26 per cent stakes in two 6m-tonnes-a-year
oil refineries - one in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, where the
partner is Bharat Petroleum, and the second in the western state of
Maharashtra, in partnership with Hindustan Petroleum. The Indian partners,
both state enterprises, will hold 26 per cent stakes, with the rest of the
capital to be offered to the public. Oman is considering investing Rs3.47bn
in the Madhya Pradesh refinery, which will cost a total of Rs45bn, and Rs2bn
in the Rs30bn Maharashtra project.
The other projects approved were a Rs16.5bn steel mill, in which a group of
Indians living in Dubai plan to invest Rs4bn, a Rs5.25bn cement plant, which
will be built with support from F L Smidth, a leading Danish cement maker;
and a Rs4bn tyre factory in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where the
investor is Mr Frederick Harrison, an American lawyer.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Clinton tries to heal union row on Nafta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WHITE HOUSE yesterday chose to characterise as 'merely a difference of
opinion' President Bill Clinton's criticism of strong-arm trade union
tactics to persuade members of Congress to vote against the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
Towards the end of his Sunday television interview, the president himself
had qualified his attack.
Advised during a commercial break of the initial news agency headlines of
his earlier comments, Mr Clinton said: 'These guys are my friends. I just
don't agree with them on Nafta.'
Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, went on television
yesterday to deliver the same message. The president and the unions 'shared
a lot of common ground,' he said, although Nafta was an exception.
Nevertheless, Mr Thomas Donahue, general secretary of the AFL-CIO, the
umbrella union organisation, had on Sunday evening accused Mr Clinton of 'a
cheap shot', one which was 'part of a desperate effort to capture votes'.
Only a tiny fraction of organised labour has come out in favour of Nafta,
though opposition to it from some white-collar and federal employee unions
has been muted.
More typical was a comment to the Washington Post yesterday by Mr William
Bywater, head of the electrical workers union: 'I tell any Democrat
(preparing to vote for Nafta) I am not going to support any of them, period.
I will try to get a candidate to run against them in the primary,' even if
it meant a seat falling to the Republican party.
Meanwhile, one employer with a heavily unionised workforce did come off the
fence yesterday in Nafta's favour. United Parcel Service, the country's
largest employer of members of the Teamsters union (165,000 out of the
company's payroll of 240,000), said that 'the trade boom from Nafta will
result in hundreds of new UPS jobs', most of them for union members.
Mr Clinton was critical on Sunday of US corporations for not lobbying hard
enough in favour of the agreement, though the shift in the UPS position had
been decided on Friday. Some substantial business political contributors
have also privately threatened to withhold funds from those who vote
against.
The president himself was fully engaged in the lobbying effort yesterday,
with three White House meetings and a dinner for 15-20 undecided members of
Congress on his schedule.
But most attention was focused on tonight's televised debate between
Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and last
year's independent presidential candidate.
The Justice Department yesterday confirmed that the FBI had passed on to Mr
Perot a death threat which, he said, came from a 'Mafia-like' group working
for Nafta approval.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fidel Castro of Cuba has said that efforts by the US to isolate
the country through an economic embargo are instead isolating US business,
which is missing investment opportunities in the Caribbean island.
In several weekend statements, Mr Castro also said that Cuban workers were
not efficient enough and praised foreign investors in Cuba for increasing
productivity in several sectors, including tourism.
He told a group of foreign businessmen investment opportunities in Cuba were
worth many billions of dollars and that tourism alone had the potential for
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in new foreign business.
Opportunities for foreign investment in Cuba were growing so quickly that
there would be 'not one square metre of beach' left for US companies.
'Those who impose a blockade impose a blockade on themselves,' he said.
Speaking to a conference of Communist party delegates, Mr Castro said his
government was committed to expanding the tourism sector, as it was the only
economy activity which could ease Cuba's economic problems.
The Cuban economy has been under severe strain following the break-up of the
Soviet Union, the island's former benefactor, and a poor sugar harvest.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Chile overshoots inflation target
</HEADLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHILEAN government has strongly denied suggestions that it is losing the
battle against inflation after a 2.6 per cent jump in prices last month, the
biggest in two years.
The sharp rise - dubbed the 'pumpkin' because of the Finance Ministry's
insistence that seasonal factors, such as high prices for certain fruit and
vegetables, are to blame - brings accumulated inflation for the first 10
months to 11.9 per cent.
The government is now certain to overshoot its revised 1993 inflation target
of 12 per cent. Its original intention was to bring the rate down to 11 per
cent from 12.7 per cent last year. Its failure to smother inflation in 1993
also raises questions about next year's target of 10 per cent.
Mr Roberto Zahler, governor of the independent central bank, called
October's rise 'unsatisfactory' and urged the government to moderate public
spending. In particular he criticised the 15 per cent pay rise to 450,000
public sector workers.
Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, budget director, rejected the governor's arguments.
All government spending, including the public sector pay rise, had been
fully financed from existing resources, he said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Thrashing out a high-tech funding policy: Louise Kehoe
reports on a new US partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEELING their way towards a new collaborative relationship between
government and industry, senior Clinton administration officials and Silicon
Valley high-tech executives gathered in California last week for a
'Technology Summit'.
This first-of-its-kind event 'could not have happened under any previous US
administration,' said Mr Ronald Brown, the US commerce secretary. 'We have
wasted three decades on ideological debate about the appropriate role of
government (in commerce) while our international competitors figured that
out a long time ago.'
The emerging US flavour of industrial policy is, however, quite distinct
from that in Europe and Asia, with their large-scale, government-directed
technology projects.
'Technology is the engine of economic growth. It is the private sector that
fuels the engine that pulls the train,' Mr Brown said. However, the US
government had a new role to play by creating an environment for
international competitiveness and priming the pumps with research funds
aimed at accelerating development and commercialisation of promising,
high-risk technologies likely to spur US growth.
In the past, US government technology spending was primarily defined by
military goals, said Mr Stephen Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley
Roundtable on the International Economy, the influential think tank that
organised the technology summit. 'In the post-Cold War era,' he said, 'the
US faces the challenge of realigning government research and development
spending to support economic goals.'
About 41 per cent of the US government's Dollars 76bn research and
development budget is spent on civilian or dual-use projects, with the
majority going to defence-related research. President Bill Clinton aims to
balance the research budget more evenly between defence and industry.
'We can no longer rely on serendipitous spin-offs from defence spending to
spawn innovation in the commercial sector,' said Mr John Gibbons, the White
House science and technology adviser.
Yet even as US government spending on commercial research and development
programmes is increasing, practical questions remain about how to implement
this new 'partnership' between the US public and private sectors.
'As soon as you start shifting funds from defence research to commercially
relevant projects, two questions arise,' said Mr John Young, retired chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard. 'What are you going to fund, and who is going
to be accountable? How are we going to measure results to ensure that the
American people are getting good value?'
The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is operating a
programme of commercial research and development matching grants, will
concentrate funding on strategic areas identified by industry groups, said
Ms Arati Prabhaker, the institute's director.
Last week, the institute disbursed most of its Dollars 68m funds to 29
companies and corporate alliances. Next year, the Advanced Technology
Program (ATP) will have Dollars 200m to spend, and President Clinton aims to
raise funding to Dollars 750m by 1997.
Identifying areas of technology that will be critical to the future
competitiveness of US high technology industries has not been difficult.
Several industry groups have drawn up lists of technology areas they
consider critical to competitiveness.
Yet, in such fast changing fields, it may prove hard to ensure that the
focus of government-funded research remains current and that government
programmes keep pace with changing industry views, Mr Young warned.
A big concern is that the ATP will become a high-tech pork barrel programme,
says Ms Prabhaker. To avoid this, she is establishing a review system that
mirrors the peer-review process of academic research. A committee of private
sector experts will review grant proposals for technical and commercial
feasibility.
Other industry speakers at the summit expressed concern that the Clinton
administration's efforts to move research spending closer to the commercial
sector might disrupt the funding of university research. 'We have a
university research system that is the envy of the world. Don't screw it
up]' warned Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel, the big US semiconductor
manufacturer.
Despite their words of caution, industry executives were generally impressed
with the new 'Tech Team' from Washington, who showed a thorough knowledge of
industry issues. 'This is a far cry from the Bush administration that saw no
difference between potato chips and computer chips,' one industry
representative said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Optimism is clouded by jobs outlook: EC business survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in the European Community has picked up as companies
become more hopeful about an end to recession. But this has not improved the
gloomy outlook for jobs, with nearly half of companies expecting to cut
their labour forces during the next 12 months.
These are the main conclusions of a survey, published today, of business
opinion in the seven main EC countries. The survey - the UPS Business
Monitor, conducted for the US-based United Parcel Service by Harris Research
 -points to widespread disillusionment with the effects of the single market
programme. However, there is relative confidence that plans to create a
single currency will eventually produce results, despite the exchange rate
mechanism upsets of the past two years.
A total of 58 per cent of respondents believed at least three EC states
would create a single currency by 1999, with a further 25 per cent expecting
it to happen after that date.
On economic prospects, 56 per cent of executives saw their companies'
economic position improving over the next 12 months, up from 38 per cent
when the survey was last carried out in autumn 1992. Only 7 per cent
expected a worse position, against 19 per cent a year ago.
The survey indicates that the short-term employment outlook is bleakest in
Germany and the Netherlands. Across the seven countries, 43 per cent of
companies forecast staff cuts during the next 12 months. The same percentage
expected to keep numbers unchanged and only 12 per cent reckoned to take on
extra labour.
In Germany, 60 per cent of companies expected to reduce staff, a course of
action planned by 57 per cent of Dutch companies, and 47 per cent of Belgian
ones. In the UK, where the corporate outlook has shown the sharpest
improvement compared with a year ago, 22 per cent expected an increase and
30 per cent a cut.
Employers delivered a rigorous assessment of the effect of the EC's social
chapter: 27 per cent thought it would reduce employment, and only 19 per
cent thought it would create jobs. Pessimism was highest in the UK and
Germany, with Italy and Spain relatively hopeful.
Only 5 per cent of respondents blamed EC policies for the Community's
economic problems over the past year.
At the same time, underlining disappointment with EC single market policies,
87 per cent saw no noticeable benefits to their companies. Asked about
improvements in the movements of goods following the ending of border
controls, only 25 per cent of companies said they have lived up to
expectations, compared with 67 per cent expecting improvement a year ago.
A total of 65 per cent of companies pointed to high German interest rates as
causing problems for the rest of Europe, although most conceded that the
Bundesbank was correct to take action to keep down German inflation.
Criticism of German monetary policy appeared greatest in Spain, Britain,
France and Belgium. By contrast, 55 per cent of German respondents
exonerated the Bundesbank from blame for Europe's difficulties.
Perhaps surprisingly, 88 per cent of respondents thought German unification
brought benefits to Europe, up from 76 per cent a year ago. The approval
rating was higher in the Netherlands (99 per cent) than in Germany (98) and
was lowest in Italy (77).

FT  09 NOV 93 / Britain favoured for manufacturing investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is reckoned by European business leaders to offer the best potential
in the European Community for manufacturing investment, narrowly pushing
Germany into second place, according to the survey.
Eighteen per cent of respondents put the UK in first place, compared with 17
per cent for Germany, 14 per cent for Spain, and 12 per cent for France.
Illustrating how European business is focusing on Germany's economic
problems as well as its potential, 19 per cent of companies surveyed gave
the Federal Republic the worst rating among EC investment sites.
The favourable impression of the UK contrasts with the country's position at
the bottom of last year's survey. The jump appears closely linked to the
improvement in Britain's economic outlook since it left the European
exchange rate mechanism in September of last year.
UK respondents in the survey were the most confident about economic
conditions, with 77 per cent expecting an improvement in their company's
position over the next 12 months. This compares with an average of 56 per
cent across the seven countries.
Medium-term confidence in the UK economy seems to have greatly increased.
Germany still leads countries expected to show the strongest economic growth
in the next few years, although its position has deteriorated compared with
the autumn 1992 survey.
Britain, by contrast, has risen strongly in the medium-term prospects league
table, now taking second place. Among executives taking part in the poll, 43
per cent put the UK among countries with the best three-year outlook,
against 51 per cent for Germany. A year ago, 71 per cent of respondents
thought Germany had the best prospects, with only 12 per cent saying the
same for the UK.
As far as currency stability is concerned, Germany retains the highest
confidence by a wide margin - 78 per cent believed the D-Mark would be the
strongest currency during the next 12 months and next three years. Only 7
per cent favoured sterling, a percentage shared with the Dutch guilder.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Foreign banks face new curbs in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is considering further curbs on the expansion of
foreign banks into the Russian market after the granting of operating
licences by the Central Bank of Russia to five non-Russian banks, bringing
the total to 12.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy economics minister, has warned of 'further
regulation' of the activities of the foreign banks - which are only just
beginning to open for business.
In a decision taken two weeks ago and confirmed in the last few days, three
foreign banks - Citibank, Chase Manhattan and ABN-Amro - and two
Russo-Turkish joint venture banks have all received licences to operate. The
licences allow the banks to open accounts for Russians and foreigners in
both roubles and in hard currency.
Mr Steven Fullenkamp, vice-president of Chase Manhattan in Moscow, said last
night: 'I was surprised that the central bank licensed five all together. I
believe there will now be a pause, for perhaps as long as a year, while the
central bank sees how the foreign banks perform on the Russian market.'
Of the 12 banks with operating licences, only three - Credit Lyonnais (in St
Petersburg), Bank of Austria and the Banque Nationale de Paris/Dresdner Bank
joint venture in Moscow - have opened their doors for accounts.
'The pie is certainly increasing here, and there are a dozen or two of the
Russian banks which are attracting a lot of business as well as the foreign
banks,' Mr Fullenkamp said.
The main ministers for the economy and finance have voiced strong doubts
about the competition offered by the foreign banks.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy minister for finance, issued a press release
last Friday saying that 'while in general the government welcomes the
creation of foreign bank branches as long as they promote competition', the
ministry intended to maintain strict limits to the operations of the banks.
He added that the government would not support the 'increasingly evident
course' of the central bank in granting licences to a large number of
non-Russian banks. Under the central bank's own rules, the total fixed
assets in Russia of the foreign banks must not exceed 12 per cent of the
total fixed assets of Russian commercial banks.
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank's chairman, said recently that the
total assets of foreign banks in the Russian market were no more than 5 per
cent.
Mr Gaidar said in an interview with the daily newspaper Izvestiya last
Saturday that over-hasty granting of licences could lead to 'dangerous and
far-reaching consequences' for the Russian banking sector.
'Competition in this sphere is absolutely essential, but we must be very
careful that it does not lead to a rapid collapse of the native banking
sector.
'Most countries open their doors to foreign banks very slowly.
'We will likely have to take measures for the further regulation of the
activities of foreign banks in the transitional period,' Mr Gaidar said.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Franco-German plan to end Bosnia conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday launched a fresh diplomatic initiative to end
the civil war in Bosnia with a plan to lift sanctions gradually against
Serbia in return for extra land for Bosnian Moslems.
The Franco-German plan marks the first evidence of a shift in European
tactics away from total isolation of Serbia and more toward incentives for
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to end the war.
The proposal was given a guarded reception at a meeting of European foreign
ministers who remained torn between the need to take action to head off a
humanitarian disaster, and the danger of becoming embroiled in the civil
war.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said it was important to
keep as many aid routes open as possible, but 'not by rocketing aid through,
and not by using force'.
Britain has around 3,000 troops in Bosnia, second in number only to France.
Though Mr Hurd predicted that more United Nations forces could be sent in
the coming months, Britain would stick to its present contingent, he
indicated.
At Mr Hurd's suggestion, ministers agreed to consider the plan at a meeting
of the Western European Union on November 22 in Luxembourg. British
officials said senior military experts would be present. 'We think this is a
good context to discuss the real issues and difficulties,' said one.
A copy of the Franco-German letter, obtained by Reuters news agency,
suggested the creation of UN-protected 'aid corridors' and the reopening of
the vital airport of Tuzla to fly in relief this winter.
It also proposes that Serbs should cede a further 3 per cent of territory
they control in Bosnia, which the Moslems have been claiming and which led
to the collapse of the most recent peace plan. In return, the international
community should offer Belgrade the promise that UN sanctions would be
lifted gradually.
Laura Silber in Belgrade adds: Moslem forces yesterday fired two shells on a
Croat-held munitions factory in Vitez, central Bosnia, as Croat officials

FT  09 NOV 93 / Poland makes policy pledge to IMF

<TEXT>
POLAND is set on maintaining good relations with the International Monetary
Fund with a view to achieving further reductions in its Dollars 47.2bn
foreign debt, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, head of the new centre-left government,
said yesterday, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
His statement to parliament commits the government to following stringent
monetary policies acceptable to the IMF, which is unlikely to agree to any
big increase in next year's budget deficit over this year's target of 5 per
cent of GDP. Mr Pawlak said policies would aim 'at reducing inflation'.
The government elected on September 19, and formed out of the post-communist
Left Democratic Alliance and Mr Pawlak's Polish Peasant party, needs IMF
approval for a 20 per cent cut in the Dollars 30.6bn debt owed to the Paris
Club. This was promised as part of a 50 per cent debt reduction package
agreed on condition that Poland remained in favour with the IMF.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Ukraine fears economic collapse
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian parliament meets today to discuss an electoral law to allow
early parliamentary elections next March, in the wake of a series of
draconian presidential decrees.
However, the real issue of debate, and the impetus behind the new elections,
is the economic crisis. Ukraine is reeling under hyper-inflation of more
than 100 per cent a month and a worthless currency which has lost more than
80 per cent of its value in the last three months.
Fearing monetary collapse and potential social unrest, the Ukrainian
president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, signed a series of decrees last week to
establish authoritarian control, throwing the economy back into the
communist era and overturning the few new economic freedoms granted to
Ukrainians over the past year.
These included:
closing the Kiev currency auction, which determines the market rate for the
Ukrainian currency, the karbovanets;
shutting down money exchange bureaux throughout the country;
permitting currency exchange transactions only for government-authorised
imports and exports at fixed central bank exchange rate;
setting wholesale and retail price controls. Prices are to rise with energy
cost increases only. Profits are strictly limited;
re-instituting the state order system, which requires most enterprises to
sell a portion of their production to the state at fixed prices.
But, in defiance of the president's decrees, the Kiev currency auction took
place every day last week. Businessmen and currency traders have privately
vowed to continue their work even if it is illegal. Unlike Russia, Ukraine
has not begun to institute market reforms. There is no large-scale
privatisation programme. With the lack of market incentives, widespread
industrial shortages and severed trading links, GDP is falling at about 20
per cent annually.
Nor has Ukraine begun to practise budgetary or fiscal discipline. Unable to
establish priorities, Ukraine's government of Soviet-style industrialists
continues to subsidise ailing industries and welfare programmes. The budget
deficit, about 40 per cent of GDP, is financed by the printing presses.

workers' hours

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French Senate yesterday approved a conditional form of state aid to
reward companies which agree to cut the working hours of existing employees
in order to reduce the country's lengthening dole queues, writes David
Buchan in Paris. The Senate amendment to a new five-year employment bill
must return to the national assembly, which rebuffed a not dissimilar plan
last month. Since then, however, the government has swung behind the
workshare scheme, making full parliamentary approval likely.
Worksharing as a palliative to unemployment is increasingly in vogue, both
in the EC Commission where it is expected to figure in the white paper on
jobs, and in France, where unemployment reached 11.8 per cent in September
and is forecast to hit 12 per cent by the year's end.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Balladur takes partners for chairmen's waltz: John Ridding
reports on the big reshuffle at the top of France's public sector financial
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS described in France as the waltz of the chairmen. The latest steps,
which are due to be completed tomorrow, involve a sweeping reshuffle at the
top of French public sector financial companies.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, a close associate of the prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, will take over as chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, one
of France's most powerful institutional investors. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the
current head of UAP, is to move to loss-making Credit Lyonnais, displacing
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer who moves to Credit National, a small private sector
bank.
When the music stops, the country's largest insurance group and one of the
largest banks will have new chairmen to guide them through privatisation.
Mr Balladur will be left with a stronger grip on the pillars of the French
economic establishment. In August he installed Mr Philippe Jaffre as head of
Elf Aquitaine, the oil group and France's largest industrial concern.
In May he chose Mr Michel Pebereau, another trusted associate as head of
Banque Nationale de Paris, France's third biggest bank. Mr Friedmann's move
would place a Balladur appointee into a third key post.
Mr Balladur's reshuffle is as much pragmatic as politically motivated.
'He has taken a tighter hold of the top of French business and finance,'
says one Paris-based merchant banker. 'But he has done it with a velvet
glove.'
Nonetheless, the grip will leave an imprint on the management at the top of
French finance and industry and forms a central element of the government's
plan to privatise 21 publicly-owned groups.
Mr Balladur's smooth approach marks a contrast to the 'witch hunts' which
characterised the change of power between Socialist and conservative
governments in the 1970s and early 1980s.
He has taken a gradual approach to changing the heads of public sector
groups, leaving Socialist appointees at the head of many companies, and even
appointing Socialist business leaders to new posts. The latest round
provides a case in point.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade has been entrusted with the task of preparing Credit
Lyonnais for privatisation, despite the Socialist credentials he earned as
adviser to the government of Mr Pierre Mauroy in the early 1980s.
The respect he earned as head of the Suez group and at UAP encouraged a
pragmatic approach by Mr Balladur.
At Air France, presently the most troublesome of France's public sector
groups, the government appointed Mr Christian Blanc, a close associate of Mr
Michel Rocard, the leader of the Socialist party.
Attractive posts for outgoing Socialist appointees are necessary to avoid
conflict with President Francois Mitterrand and to prevent upsetting the
peaceful co-habitation between the centre-right government and the Socialist
head of state.
But if the chairmen's waltz has been relatively smooth, the implications are
profound.
In addition to the domino effect of the changes, the appointments at UAP,
BNP and Elf-Aquitaine will leave an enduring stamp on these groups after
privatisation. Along with Mr Jaffre and Mr Pebereau, also close to Mr
Balladur, Mr Friedmann will play a central role in the government's
privatisation plans. He will prepare the insurance group for sale, with an
expected target date of next year. By then, Elf-Aquitaine should also be in
the private sector, along with BNP which was sold last month under Mr
Pebereau's chairmanship.
As chairmen of private groups, the three will enjoy stability of tenure.
'Unlike the public sector where mandates are just for three years, it is
very hard to remove chairmen of private companies in France,' says one
French banker.
'Mr Balladur is ensuring that he has trusted men in key posts for a long
time.'
In addition to removing their own groups from the public sector, the new
chairmen are likely to provide an important part of a system of
cross-shareholdings in privatised groups. Elf-Aquitaine bought just over 2
per cent of BNP when it was privatised and forms part of the bank's bloc of
stable, long-term investors.
UAP is expected to be one of the principal institutional investors in
forthcoming privatisations, helping to compensate for the lack of powerful
pension funds to help absorb the sale of shares in public sector groups.
The main challenge for Mr Balladur's appointees, however, is going to be the
management of their own groups. Mr Friedmann has not previously worked in an
insurance company, although Mr Didier Pfeiffer, his respected deputy, is
expected to ensure a smooth transition. Mr Jaffre at Elf, has not previously
worked in industry.
It is the Socialists, however, who face the more daunting task.
Mr Peyrelevade must try to redress the situation at Credit Lyonnais, which
suffered losses of FFr1.85bn (Pounds 210m) in 1992 and which is exposed to
problem loans in property and industrial investment.
In stepping into Mr Haberer's shoes he may feel he drew the trickiest hand
in Mr Balladur's reshuffle.

FT  09 NOV 93 / EBRD board approves reforms: De Larosiere hopes to put the
problem bank back on an even keel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL reorganisation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), the aid bank for eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, was yesterday approved by its board of directors.
After the board meeting, the EBRD's new president, Mr Jacques de Larosiere,
announced the changes with a bluntness he made famous from his spells
running the International Monetary Fund and more latterly the Banque de
France.
'I could not go on one week more with the problems we had,' he said.
These problems were spelled out by Mr de Larosiere in a document he prepared
for the board of directors, who represent the countries and agencies which
own the bank: 'It has been stated that the current organisation leads to
confusion among our clients and interested business partners.
'It is perceived as being bureaucratic, leading to conflicting approaches,
procedural delays and lacking focus in terms of operations and country
needs,' the document said.
However, in his first press briefing since arriving at the bank on October
4, Mr de Larosiere stressed: 'I think the calibre of the staff is
exemplary.'
The most important changes are the abolition of the two main operational
departments, for development banking and merchant banking respectively.
Development banking was responsible for financing infrastructure projects in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, while merchant banking was in
charge of encouraging privatisation.
Their functions are being absorbed by two new 'banking' departments, one
covering southern-based countries and the other for the more northerly
countries.
Most of the southern economies are less developed and will therefore require
greater investment in their infrastructures.
In the short term, the EBRD is more hopeful of encouraging the growth of the
private sector in the northern economies.
'I think this reorganisation addresses the concern that the bank had
insufficient country focus,' Mr de Larosiere said. However, he insisted that
there would be no retreat from the EBRD's aim of encouraging the private
sector, despite the abolition of the merchant banking division, which was a
unique department among the international aid banks in working exclusively
on privatisation projects.
The bank is not abolishing its sectoral specialist teams altogether.
'We could have followed the World Bank model and had only country
specialists,' he said. Instead, each department will contain teams
specialising on individual countries and other teams concentrating on
sectors which cross geographical boundaries.
Some of these sectoral teams, covering agribusiness, power and energy,
transport and privatisation, will be directly attached to the two banking
departments.
However separate teams, covering natural resources, financial institutions,
nuclear safety, telecommunications and tourism, will be part of a new
operations support group, which will feed in to both banking departments.
What this means is that the elimination of duplicated functions has freed
some staff for redeployment, while others will be made redundant.
These moves will help him in his aim of preparing a 'lean budget for 1994'.
He said: 'The first thing I did on arrival here to was institute a hiring
freeze.'
Subsequently he has asked each head of department to ensure that their
groups are 'as lean and effective as possible'.
Mr de Larosiere's contribution to this process has been to eliminate the
presidential cabinet and the political department, both much favoured by his
predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali, who resigned in the summer after widespread
criticism of the bank's extravagance and poor management.
In total, there will be fewer than 50 redundancies at the bank, possibly as
few as 25, though the process of identifying jobs to eliminate has not
finished.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Germans plan to shift production abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN three German companies intends to transfer part of its production
outside the country in the next three years, compared with one in four that
planned to do so in the past three years, according to a survey conducted by
the German chamber of trade and industry, the DIHT.
The survey, which polled 10,000 large and medium-sized companies in western
Germany, says the favourite relocation site is eastern Europe, followed by
Asia. The European Community, which swallows the bulk of German investment
abroad, is gradually diminishing as a favoured manufacturing base, it notes.
DIHT regularly polls its member companies, but this is the first time it has
done so on the subject of relocation.
One in four said it had planned partially to move production sites abroad in
the last three years. Those that did so created an estimated 210,000 jobs.
The sharpest rise in planned relocations is among manufacturers, with 36 per
cent now saying they will partly move abroad in the next three years. In the
last three years, 28 per cent of them planned to do so.
Companies cite high domestic labour costs as the primary reason for plans to
move production abroad. They also point to shorter working weeks and
machine-running times as factors hindering domestic productivity.
Companies also blame strict environmental legislation, saying it is forcing
them to invest in non-productive assets in Germany. They also say long
waiting periods for permission to build new plants or conduct certain types
of research, such as biotechnology, are pushing them beyond their national
borders.
Eastern Europe is named by nearly all as a favourite region to develop new
manufacturing bases. They say the region combines a labour force with low
wages. Poland, former Czechoslovakia and Hungary have an average hourly wage
of DM5 to DM7, compared with DM42 in Germany.
'German companies have to reduce total costs by 20 to 30 per cent to remain
competitive in global markets. Eastern Europe, which is on their doorstep,
offers them a chance to do this,' says Mr Siegfried Utzig, senior economist
at the German industry federation, the BDI.
The opening up of the former communist bloc is also offering new
opportunities for the small and medium-sized enterprises which form
Germany's industrial backbone.
'Large German companies have always moved production sites abroad as part of
their growth strategies. But what we see now is smaller companies going
abroad. This contributes to the growing unemployment in Germany,' says Mr
Michael Fuchs, head of the German association of exporters, BGA.
In Baden-Wurttemberg, the southern state with the highest number of
medium-sized enterprises, 40 per cent of the companies said they planned to
move some of their production abroad in the next three years. This compares
with 27 per cent of them having partially relocated in the last three years.
A second favourite region is Asia, where larger companies are opening
production sites to compete on local markets, in particular with Japanese
groups.

German M3 money supply grew at a revised annualised rate of 6.8 per cent in
September after a 7.2 per cent rise in August, according to the Bundesbank,
Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The central bank had initially reported that M3 grew at an annualised rate
of 7.0 per cent in September. The rise is calculated by comparing annualised
M3 growth with the average level of the last quarter of 1992. The
Bundesbank's target range for M3 money supply growth this year is 4.5-6.5
per cent.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Beijing ready to soften line in talks on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has indicated a willingness to agree to some of the plans of Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor, for the colony's political development but
London and Beijing remain far apart on his proposals to increase democracy.
It was understood yesterday that Chinese officials had suggested at a
meeting with Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador in Beijing, that they
might be ready to accept Mr Patten's proposals on voting age and methods,
and possibly on local government election procedures.
The suggestion, which could be seen as the first sign of movement by Beijing
towards an agreement, was communicated to Sir Robin last week after the 15th
round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong's political development. Sir Robin
is leading the British side in the talks which have dragged on for six
months with little sign of progress.
The latest Chinese offer has not been formally made and Hong Kong officials
fear it may be designed simply to muddy the waters ahead of tomorrow's
meeting in London of British ministers and officials to decide UK policy on
Hong Kong.
According to one Hong Kong official: 'It is chicken feed. It has been
dangled before us. They have not given anything yet.'
A cabinet sub-committee will be chaired by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Patten and
Sir Robin. Mr Patten said that the meeting would be a stock-taking exercise
which would plot strategy and tactics for future talks with China.
Details of China's latest suggestion have not been disclosed but it is
understood to include Chinese agreement to reduce the voting age in the
colony to 18 from 21 and possible agreement to dispense with appointed
officials at local government level.
Mr Patten's proposals for political development include direct election of
all members of district boards from next year.
The Chinese also hinted to Sir Robin that the 20 Legislative Council (LegCo)
seats which are to be decided by popular vote could be elected on the basis
of one-person-one-vote in single-member constituencies, in line with Mr
Patten's proposals.
However, the Chinese government is implacably opposed to Britain's attempt
to broaden the franchise for the other 40 seats which will constitute the
1995 LegCo.
For 30 of these seats, known as 'functional constituencies' which represent
business and professional groups, Britain wants to expand the franchise by
changing the method of election. It wants the individuals who constitute the
groups to vote rather than corporate bodies. China wants to retain corporate
voting which it calls a matter of 'principle'.
The remaining 10 seats will be selected by an electoral college. Britain has
compromised by agreeing a structure to the electoral college similar to that
set down in Beijing's Basic Law - its constitution for Hong Kong after
sovereignty passes from Britain to China in 1997 - but wants the members of
the electoral college to be themselves elected.
Beijing favours a form of election close to that used in China where 12
specially selected candidates are offered for election and the college
chooses 10.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Debate over IRA ceasefire puts peace plan under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Major-Reynolds Northern Ireland peace initiative was under strain last
night after fundamental differences emerged between London and Dublin on the
timing of a permanent IRA ceasefire.
Downing Street responded sharply to suggestions by Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister, that peace could be achieved by Christmas if the two
governments focused on a cessation of violence followed by talks with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Officials said Mr John Major had ruled out 'secret agreements on a ceasefire
with violent organisations', and was 'wary of false optimism' in Dublin. Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested the timetable
outlined by Mr Reynolds could hinder the peace process.
'I don't think that this is a process that will benefit from governments
saying that this must be achieved in a fortnight, or that must be achieved
in a month,' he said. Sir Patrick tried to minimise the significance of the
differences between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major by insisting that it was 'a
mistake to look for evidence of disagreement between the two governments.
There is none'.
Mr Reynolds responded swiftly to the British comments. He said in a
statement that 'peace cannot wait'. He added: 'Time is not on our side.'
The exchanges reflect simmering differences between London and Dublin over
the framework for the peace process, which was launched by the two
governments in Brussels two weeks ago.
Britain wants round-table discussions involving the two governments and
Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties, which are in the
middle of bilateral talks with Mr Major.
The British government insists that Sinn Fe'in should be included in the
talks only after a permanent and unconditional cessation of IRA violence.
The Irish government favours a separate peace process in which talks would
focus on achieving an IRA ceasefire, followed by the inclusion of Sinn Fein
in talks.
Irish support for this strategy has hardened since the annual conference of
the governing Fianna Fail party at the weekend revealed strong grass roots
support for peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, SDLP leader, and Mr
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
However, the Hume-Adams proposals, which called for a ceasefire followed by
talks with Sinn Fein, have been rejected by the British government.
Sir Patrick repeated the British approach yesterday in the House Magazine, a
journal produced for MPs, saying: 'The government will never negotiate with
those who support threaten or perpetrate violence, or who fail to show their
disavowal of such evil is for real.'
Three men were remanded in custody by a special court in Limavady, Co
Londonderry, charged with the murders of seven people shot dead 10 days ago
in the Rising Sun bar in nearby Greysteel. They were also charged with
membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters and with possession of firearms.
One was further charged with the murder of four Catholic workmen at
Castlerock, Co Londonderry, in March.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Consumer demand fuels economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING EVIDENCE that consumer demand is proving the main prop of economic
growth in Britain was supported yesterday by news that net lending to
consumers more than doubled in September to the highest figure for more than
3 1/2 years.
But a survey today by the Confederation of British Industry of trading
conditions in UK high streets does nothing to alleviate the picture of a
patchy and hesitant recovery.
In the first of a series of official figures to be published in the three
weeks to the November 30 Budget, the Central Statistical Office said net
borrowing by consumers from building societies, finance houses and on credit
cards operated by the Visa and Mastercard systems jumped to a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 489m in September from Pounds 225m in August.
The increase was partly the result of higher net lending to consumers by
finance houses, which analysts believe reflected aggressive credit sales
campaigns by car manufacturers. In addition, there was a turnround in credit
card borrowing, with a net Pounds 89m repayment by consumers in August
followed by net borrowing of Pounds 106m in September.
The Treasury welcomed the figures as 'consistent with the continued upward
trend in consumer spending'. But the CBI, in its October survey of the
retail, wholesale and motor trades warned that sales in the high street,
while growing, were below normal for the time of the year, falling short of
expectations.
The CBI reported that while sales in Britain's shops and department stores
increased last month, the growth rate was below rates recorded during the
summer. The survey suggests that retailers expect sales to grow more
strongly in the year to November, but Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of
the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'Consumer uncertainty about the
impact of the forthcoming Budget could dampen high street trade over the
coming weeks.'
The absence of a strong upturn was underlined by producer price data
released yesterday which showed that inflationary pressures in Britain's
factories remained subdued last month.
The CSO reported that the increase in the price index for sales in the UK of
manufactured goods dropped to 4 per cent in the 12 months to October from
4.2 per cent in the year to September.
Prices for raw materials and fuel purchased by industry fell by a seasonally
adjusted 1.1 per cent between September and October.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The figures
indicate the recovery is continuing, without the appearance of undue cost
pressures.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Mirror row may prompt curbs: Threat of controls on press -
Princess to sue / MGN quits watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY, KEVIN BROWN and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of press self-regulation was in doubt last night after the three
national titles of Mirror Group Newspapers pulled out of the Press
Complaints Commission over the growing row caused by pictures of the
Princess of Wales taken secretly in a fitness club.
Mr David Montgomery, MGN's chief executive, said the commission, the
industry regulatory body, was finished. He accused its chairman, Lord
McGregor of Durris, of exceeding his powers and behaving unfairly.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, gave a warning that the
publication by MGN of the photographs demonstrated the shortcomings of
self-regulation and increased the likelihood of statutory controls on press
freedom.
'Given the regularity with which we have been told that the press can sort
out these matters for themselves, I think this will have given a very nasty
jolt to everybody, and I think that makes it that amount more likely that
the legislation will come forward,' said Mr Brooke, who is expected to
produce a white paper on the press in January.
MGN said even though its editors would withdraw from the commission, 'they
will continue to abide by its code of conduct'.
The MGN withdrawal, which could fatally undermine the commission, came as
lawyers for the Princess of Wales said a writ would be issued today alleging
breach of confidence and breach of contract against the LA Fitness Club in
west London where the pictures were taken and against MGN which published
them in the Sunday Mirror and the Daily Mirror.
Lawyers for the princess won an injunction in the High Court preventing
further publication of pictures. MGN contested the injunction on the grounds
that it had 'done nothing unlawful'.
Mr Montgomery said the Daily Mirror decided yesterday not to publish any
more of the photographs after the Princess of Wales had issued a statement
through her solicitors declaring her 'distress and deep sense of outrage'
over the pictures taken by a hidden camera at the fitness club while she was
working out.
It is believed Mr Bryce Taylor, the main owner of the gym, arranged for the
pictures to be taken and sold them to Mirror newspapers for about Pounds
100,000.
Earlier, Lord McGregor had condemned the action of the Daily Mirror in
publishing the photographs. He said advertisers should show their
displeasure at an 'outlaw' newspaper by withdrawing advertising.
The Royal Automobile Club and Autoglass, the windscreen replacement company,
said they were dropping the Daily Mirror from their schedules but Mr Andrew
Brown, chairman of the Advertising Association, rejected the call for a
general boycott.
Mr David Banks, editor of the Daily Mirror, attacked Lord McGregor for
criticising his newspaper 'before he had even read our editorial'.
In an editorial comment in today's Mirror the paper says its commercial
rivals have 'played judge, jury and hangman'.
The commission will meet tomorrow to consider the issue of the pictures.
Sir David Calcutt, whose committee report on the press in January this year
called for statutory controls, said the Daily Mirror's attitude to the
commission amounted to 'total contempt'.
He said if the commission was treated in this way by an 'important
significant journal, then you have a real problem as I see it for
self-regulation'.

FT  08 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) Budget 1993: Direct attack on indirect taxation
 -The growing lobby opposing extensions of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 9th November 1993) appended to this article.
RAISING taxes on consumer goods and services is firmly on the agenda for
discussion as a way to narrow the gap between public spending and revenues,
but a range of arguments linked to the fragile recovery may stop Mr Kenneth
Clarke in his tracks.
For his first Budget on November 30 the chancellor is considering whether to
increase Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax rate. He could also widen
the scope of the tax to cover exempt items including newspapers, children's
clothing and food. Other options are to raise excise duties on items such as
cigarettes, wine and beer.
These moves would fit in with the government's aim during the 1980s to push
the fiscal burden towards indirect taxes on goods and services and away from
direct taxes on incomes. According to Treasury orthodoxy tax changes of this
type provide the opportunity to raise extra cash without unduly weakening
people's incentive to work.
On Treasury calculations a 1 percentage point increase in the VAT rate could
bring Pounds 1.7bn extra revenues in the next financial year, while
extending VAT to food would raise Pounds 7bn.
Any new increases in consumer taxes would come on top of the imposition of
VAT on domestic fuel and higher petrol duties already announced for next
April.
In recent weeks, however, the Treasury has been bombarded with advice from
economists and lobby groups that - with demand still weak after the
recession - higher consumer taxes could deal a blow to growth prospects. A
secondary argument is that higher taxes on consumer goods and services would
push up the retail prices index, increasing the possibility that underlying
inflation would exceed the government target of 4 per cent.
The Henley Centre, a consultancy specialising in consumer spending, has
worked out how higher taxes would affect demand for a range of goods, shown
in the accompanying table. Factors such as the incomes of the people who
mainly buy the items listed and to the degree to which they are considered
non-essential 'luxury' items, mean that for a set rise in taxation, demand
for soft drinks would fall by a bigger amount than would breakfast cereals.
Professor Doug McWilliams, head of the Centre for Economic and Business
Research, another consultancy, said a rise in VAT or in excise duties could
translate into a shock effect that could hold back economic growth.
He added: 'Apart from putting up inflation, a rise in consumer taxes might
be an inefficient way of trying to raise money on the grounds that people
could decide to shift their spending away from newly taxed goods towards
cheaper products.'
If the chancellor ignores such warnings and decides indirect taxes must be
raised in the Budget he has had no shortage of views from lobbying groups.
Executives from about 20 of Britain's biggest retailers took Mr Clarke for
lunch at a London hotel last month to ram home the message about how tax
increases could hit them.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the Dixons electrical goods retailer, pointed
out how any 'messing about' with VAT in the Budget could affect the crucial
pre-Christmas period.
Mr Robin Simpson, director of the Brewers' Society, representing the beer
industry, said that by increasing excise duties on beer Mr Clarke would be
risking 'killing the goose that lays the golden egg' by stifling demand
causing tax revenues to go down.
Mr John Wilson, director-general of the British Apparel and Textile
Federation, said the imposition of VAT on children's clothes would cause
'considerable harm' to the clothing industry. The exemption from the tax for
these items of clothing costs the Treasury some Pounds 600m a year.
If Mr Clarke decides that higher VAT or excise duties are required, he will
need all his legendary toughness to shrug off special pleading.

the Budget referred to the effects on specific products of a 1 per cent

FT  08 NOV 93 / Renault in Chinese minibus venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT has announced a joint venture agreement with China's state-owned
Sanjiang Space Group to start making minibus and other versions of the
French company's Trafic light commercial vehicle from next year.
The deal, still subject to approval from the Chinese foreign trade ministry,
provides for an initial investment of Dollars 100m to upgrade Sanjiang's
existing car plant near the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.
Production of Trafic vehicles at this plant is planned to rise to 40,000 a
year by 1997, employing 2,500 people there.
From mid-1995 the joint venture, in which Renault will have a 45 per cent
stake, will also embark on production of a top-of-the-range minibus designed
specially for China.
Renault said its interest in manufacturing in China lay in the fact that the
country was one of the fastest growing markets in the world, able to absorb
an estimated 165,000 minibuses annually by the year 2000. However, it was
also one of the most protected against imports.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Euro-socialists launch early poll campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN socialists have launched their campaign to remain the largest
political group in the European Parliament - a good seven months ahead of
the Euro-poll.
Delegates at Saturday's congress of socialist parties in Brussels voted
unanimously in favour of a framework election manifesto, apparently happy to
run the risk that after such an early start many potential voters may be fed
up with hearing about the Parliament by next June's elections.
The manifesto - a compromise document which emerged from months of debate
and more than 2,000 amendments proposed by the 24 member parties  - pledges
to find ways to ease the consequences of recession.
In his opening address at the congress, Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign
minister and president of the party of European socialists, told delegates
that the fight against unemployment was their 'number one challenge'. The
manifesto also proposes a broad campaign against war, social injustice,
environmental destruction, nationalism and racism.
It is the first time Europe's socialists have co-ordinated their electoral
campaign. The manifesto was drawn up with the help of socialists from
Norway, Sweden, Austria and Finland, which have applied for EC membership.
'Europe's (socialists) can no longer afford to be narrow-minded, with petty
national priorities,' said Mr Gerd Walter, European affairs minister for
Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, who drafted the manifesto.
But in spite of much friendly 'comrading' of one another in the corridors
and chamber of Brussels's brand new parliament building at the weekend, it
is already clear that some parties will put their own spin on the manifesto
once they launch their domestic campaigns.
For example, Mr John Smith, leader of the British Labour party, said the
Euro-manifesto's recommendation on cutting working time to maintain jobs
would not feature in his party's campaign. 'It conflicts with our belief
that these are matters for employers and employees,' he said.
Mr Claes said it was natural that 'national chapters' would be added
'alongside' the European manifesto. Mr Michel Rocard, the French socialist
leader, said he hoped the manifesto would provide a basis for 'convergence'
between different views of socialism around the Community.
The manifesto throws the full weight of European socialists behind the
week-old Maastricht treaty, which gives new powers to the European
Parliament, and its objectives of a single currency and a joint foreign and
security policy.
The manifesto also calls on member states to inject even greater democracy
into the new European Union when they consider revising the treaty in 1996.

FT  08 NOV 93 / US backs Yeltsin move to serve full term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN political groups yesterday denounced President Boris Yeltsin for
going back on his commitment to stand for re-election next June, but the US
pledged support for the Russian leader 'as long as he is promoting
democracy'.
Mr Yeltsin confirmed at the weekend that he intended to serve out his full
term until June 1996, but added, according to the Interfax news agency, that
he would not stand again. 'Everyone knows how many fateful blows I have
suffered. It's too much for one man,' he said.
Opponents and some supporters of Mr Yeltsin criticised the president's
decision, which he announced to media editors on Saturday. His supporters
conceded that Mr Yeltsin was now set to serve as a 'very strong' executive
president under a newly agreed constitution.
However, in a US television interview, President Bill Clinton said: 'As long
as he continues to promote human rights, democratic and economic reforms,
the US should still support him.' Mr Clinton expressed uncertainty as to
what Mr Yeltsin had said and meant on Saturday, but declined to criticise
his decision.
Mr Yeltsin understood, he added, 'that he is not the only source of
democratic power in Russia' - and next month's parliamentary elections
should demonstrate this.
The Russian president's decision, which appeared to take his closest aides
by surprise, was part of a series of important alterations to the
constitution agreed privately between Mr Yeltsin and regional leaders last
week. It means the reversal of a concession he made to opponents in
September when he dissolved parliament and called for fresh parliamentary
elections in December.
Criticism came from those in parties opposed to Mr Yeltsin, including Mr
Viktor Aksyuchits of the Christian Democratic Movement and Mr Mikhail
Lapshin of the Agrarian party - who described it as 'a real deception of the
people'.
Some of the president's supporters were also critical. Mr Konstantin
Borovoi, leader of the Party of Economic Freedom, said the president 'cannot
cancel his decision . . . because it is a commitment to the citizens of
Russia and to the world community'.
Mr Borovoi said the presidential elections could only be called off by the
parliament to be elected on December 12 - a point which Mr Yeltsin has
himself made in the past.
In defence of Mr Yeltsin, Mr Sergei Stankevich, a presidential adviser, said
a continuation of the presidency was essential if the 'substantial powers'
which the new constitution gives the president were to be effectively
implemented.
Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, conceded that the new
constitution, to be published on Wednesday and to be voted on in a
referendum at the same time as the parliamentary elections, would usher in
'a republic with a very strong executive power'.
In the past week, Mr Yeltsin has agreed with regional leaders that
parliament will serve for only two years in its first term, and that after
these two years the upper house, or Federation Council, will be appointed by
regional leaders rather than elected, as in these elections.
Twenty-one political parties and groups succeeded in gathering the 100,000
signatures needed to register for the December elections by Saturday's
deadline.
These included most of the main groups: the liberal groups Russia's Choice,
the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and the Party of Unity and Accord of Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, as well as the centrist Civic Union bloc of Mr Arkady
Volsky, Mr Sergei Baburin's Russian Peoples Union and the Russian Communist
party.
The Central electoral commission now has five days to check the list of
signatures, about which numerous allegations of bribery and forgery have
been made, before confirming which parties can run in the campaign.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Brazilian minister denies tax allegation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso last night strongly
denied allegations published in a weekly news magazine that he might have
avoided tax on the purchase of a farm.
However, the allegations threaten to add to the state of political paralysis
in the country, brought about by corruption hearings under way which involve
several leading politicians.
The magazine, Isto E, published documents which it said showed the farm was
greatly undervalued on official records, thereby subject to lower tax bills.
The minister denied all the magazine's charges and said in some cases it had
published false information for political reasons. Mr Cardoso is already
under fire from opponents because of his assumed ambitions in next year's
presidential elections.
The farm was bought in 1989, before Mr Cardoso became finance minister
earlier this year, and the amounts of money involved were small. Mr Cardoso
has been a vocal critic of Brazil's widespread tax avoidance. According to
some estimates, only half the country's eligible tax payers contribute, and
this is partly to blame for the government's budget deficit, likely to reach
Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) next year.
Despite Mr Cardoso's vehement denials, the allegations are likely to damage
his reputation and hinder the work of the finance ministry.
He and his team are preparing new privatisation measures as well as trying
to get enough political support in Congress for fiscal reforms as part of a
constitutional revision under way.
The revision has already been seriously held up by separate corruption
hearings.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (13): Technology provides
vital clues - Computer Fraud / Most computer fraud is committed by insiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD is said to cost the City of London as much as Pounds 600m a year. Many
cases are small-time petty thefts and are never reported by the banks. Few
reach the courts.
But computer fraud is different. The image of someone working stealthily to
alter computer files and transfer money to a Swiss bank account, somehow
captures the imagination. It is therefore the one type of fraud which will
guarantee a high level of unwelcome publicity for the bank which has been
hit. And it is the main reason why the banks spend millions of pounds on
computer security systems.
Computer fraud usually entails larger sums of money than other types of
theft - an average being a Pounds 1m per transaction, compared with a Pounds
10,000 average haul from an armed robbery. It also tends to involve people
who go to great lengths to beat the system. However, computer fraud is a
rare occurence, according to Mark Tantam , of Touche Ross management
consultants. Mr Tantam is a barrister who previously spent three years at
the serious fraud office. He believes that 'against other types of fraud,
computer fraud is very small.'
Most computer fraud is committed by insiders, with legitimate access to the
system, rather than by hackers getting in from the outside, says Mr Tantam.
In his experience, hackers are technology enthusiasts who want the
intellectual challenge of working through the system. They are a nuisance,
but are unlikely to start moving money around the banking system.
The typical pattern is one of a disgruntled employee, with some knowledge of
how to get into the system. He or she will work together with one or more
outsiders, who may be organised criminals - 'we've known it to happen that
people are approached in pubs, after they boasted that they could take their
employer for a fortune,' says Detective Chief Inspector Ken Farrow, of the
City of London police fraud department.
A recent case was that of Elaine Borg, a computer systems programmer at City
firm Henderson Financial Investment services. Her plan was devised together
with a male partner, who was a known criminal, based in Spain. She set up
dummy accounts on the computer system, into which stock could be transferred
and a fraudulent sale effected.
Elaine Borg was caught when police investigating her partner, discovered her
relationship with him. The City of London fraud department monitored her
telephone calls, and she was heard discussing the plan. She was convicted at
Snaresbrook Crown Court on March 17 this year. The charges were conspiracy
to steal, and unauthorised access to computer material with intent to commit
further offence.
In most cases, however, frauds are spotted by the banks through ordinary
banking procedures, such as reconciliation - 'accounting systems are
supposed to balance. If a fraud has been committed, this would show up as an
imbalance on the computer,' says Dr Paul Dorey, group information and
security director at Barclays Bank.
In 1986, a fraud attempt at Prudential Bache was discovered by a back-office
accounts clerk, attempting to reconcile international bonds transactions. A
young Eurobond trader was later found out and brought to trial.
Another safety option is to regularly check the security log. According to
Dr Dorey, the log would be checked for multiple attempts to access the
system, or for access using genuine ID at odd times, such as in the evening.
Any unusual items could be pursued further, by checking the audit trail
which shows details of all transactions that took place on the system - not
only which ID and which terminal was used, but where the money was
transferred.
The audit trail is part of the operating system, and is harder to tamper
with than other files. If an attempt was made, that action triggers an
alarm.
Mark Tantam says that monitoring systems can be set up to provide exception
reports from the audit trail. For example, if it is normal for the bank to
send Pounds 5,000 to a bank in the Lebanon, and suddenly Pounds 5m is
transferred, the system would throw up an exception. The report could be
checked to see if it was genuine.
However, fraudsters usually manage to cover their tracks, even if it is only
to use someone else's ID and to walk to a terminal that is not their own.
Where they have been identified, it was done by a combination of traditional
police detection methods and 'borrowed' computer expertise.
Det. Chief Insp. Farrow says that his usual procedure is to bring in a
crisis management team. The team would include someone with detailed
knowledge of the computer system in question, but who could not have been in
a position to commit the fraud.
In future, banks will increasingly use computer technology itself to track
down fraudsters. Some are already moving in the direction of artificial
intelligence systems, which can pinpoint unusual patterns in computer data.
In April this year, Barclays installed its Fraud 2000 system. Attached to
the Barclaycard main computer, it watches for radical changes in spending
patterns and raises the alarm at the point of sale.
If a purchase appears to be outside a card-holder's normal spending pattern,
the store which is trying to put through the transaction is alerted.
Barclays claims the system is detecting 20 frauds a day.
Artificial intelligence can also be used to 'drill down' into data produced
by security logs. For example, if it could go from a bland statement - such
as 'we had 20 per cent more failed log-ons than usual' - to then ask where
they occured and on which applications, the increased detail could lead to
the identification of a potential fraud or hacking incident.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (12): Lessons learned the
hard way - Advice on ways to get back to business after a disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN terrorist bombs first hit the City of London, few had contingency
plans. A second bomb in the past year made companies look more closely at
how they would operate if the computer centre was out of action for any
reason.
The Financial Times talked to some of the companies affected by these bombs
about the lessons they have learned. Below, we summarise their main
recommendations, along with advice from disaster recovery experts:
Store data off site:
Mary Jackson, head of technology support for National Westminster Bank in
the City, believes it is important to store data off site. Because the Bank
moved Friday night's Wang back-up tapes out of the NatWest Tower early the
following morning (as usual), it did not lose any data when the second City
bomb went off on the morning of Saturday, April 24.
Opt for smaller systems:
Ashley Duran, former data processing manager at the Baltic Exchange (which
was hard hit by the first bomb at St Mary Axe) says: 'The lesson I've
learned is that if you upgrade to (small) modern machines, you can pick them
up and move them in a crisis. They aren't site specific like mainframes.'
The Exchange's mainframe was 'eight years old and 18 foot long and would
have cost three times' more to move than it was worth,' he says.
Add telecom lines:
Brian Stacey, technical operations manager at stockbroker James Capel says
the first bomb 'made us realise just how vulnerable we are to telecoms
links. BT and Mercury were very helpful but getting a switched circuit is
one of the hardest things to turn round in less than 24 hours.
'One of the constraints at our Devonshire Square office, in which we set up
a temporary dealing room, was getting a link to the Stock Exchange. In
hindsight, we had under-provided for spare telecom circuits.' Since then,
the company has spent more money on spare capacity to invoke if and when
needed, and on alternate routing.
Allow time for access to buildings:
Andrew Hiles, chairman of the disaster recovery user group, Survive], says
it is important to allow time for access to company premises when designing
a contingency plan. After the City bombs, some companies could not get into
their premises for 24 hours or more because the police had cordoned off the
area for safety reasons.
Plan - and test the plan:
Carole Allen, marketing manager of IBM's Business Recovery Service, says:
'Testing disaster recovery plans is essential, but rarer than you might
think.' A 1993 IBM survey shows that only 57 per cent of UK organisations
have a formal written contingency plan and, of these, only 65 per cent had
bothered to test it.
Even then, only 22 per cent could be considered viable because they had been
regularly updated and tested (ie at least once a year). The survey also
shows that fewer than one-in-three organisations include personal computers
in their recovery plans, despite the fact that PCs are increasingly
integrated into the business and perform business-critical functions.
Buy as much contingency as you can afford:
Mr Stacey advises companies to 'have as much contingency in place as you can
afford.' James Capel did not have a contract with a disaster recovery
company when it was affected by the first bomb, but Mr Stacey says if it had
not had a second office a few hundred yards away (at the time) and a second
Tandem computer (for development work) located there, 'We'd have had to
consider that.' His view is that 'all contingency is a trade-off between
risk and cost.'
Arrange an alternative site:
Arranging alternative sites is a critical part of any disaster recovery
plan. Andrew Hiles says companies considering such a plan should draw up a
list of facilities available locally to each division including the
availability of 'hot sites' (sites fully-equipped with computers and
available at short notice) and 'cold sites' (empty rooms, perhaps with
air-conditioning, in which computers can be installed). They should also
look at the communications facilities available.
Once the list of resources has been drawn up they should consider ways in
which they can improve their resilience. For example, because of different
time zones it may be feasible to use the company's US computer centre as a
back-up if the UK computer centre is out of action (or vice versa). However,
a detailed plan for, say, making sure that the US centre always has a copy
of the latest back-up tapes and software would have to be worked out. If a
company cannot provide adequate back-up using in-house sites, it should
consider signing up with a third-party disaster recovery company, or a
computer company which has moved into the recovery business. Third-party
suppliers offer a range of services including: hot and cold stand-by sites,
back-up computers (sometimes provided on-site in a mobile articulated
lorry), help with designing and testing disaster recovery plans, and staff
training.
Suppliers include Comdisco, Datashield and CAP-RS (specialising in large
systems recovery) and SafetyNet and CDRS, which focus on the mid-range
market. Computer manufacturers, such as Digital Equipment, Hewlett Packard,
IBM and ICL, also offer these services for their own and, in some cases,
competitors' systems.
The cause of computer disasters varies. According to Survive], fraud, malice
and misuse account for 30 per cent of disasters; software and hardware
failures for another 30 per cent; 'acts of God,' such as fire, flood and
earthquake account for 20 per cent; user-error causes 11 per cent; and
power-loss, 9 per cent.

November 23. More information on (UK): 081-871 2546.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (8): The agony and the ecstasy - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE glass-making town of Marinha Grande in central Portugal workers
protest over the imminent closure of their factory, which has been near
bankruptcy since 1985. Some 500 jobs are at stake. But Mr Luis Mira Amaral,
minister for industry and energy, is not over-concerned.
Nearby, he has just opened a plastics factory that he is confident will be
competitive on European terms. 'We have to let companies that are non-viable
fall by the wayside and give our support to those that are going to be
successful in the single European market,' he says.
The incident sums up the agony and the ecstasy that industrial Portugal is
going through today. The government is letting non-viable, uncompetitive
companies die while it is saving its support, considerably bolstered by
European Community funds, for the success stories.
'We can't waste time or spend money on firms that are not going to be viable
in the new Europe,' says Mr Mira Amaral. 'We have to conserve our resources
for the companies that will be able to compete at an international level.'
It is not a question of Portugal's traditional industries such as textiles,
clothing, footwear, wine, ceramics and metallurgy fading away in the wake of
new industries and technologies, but of separating the obsolete from the
thriving. 'I don't believe there is such a thing as an obsolete sector or
industry,' says Mr Mira Amaral, 'only successful and non-successful
companies.'
Indeed, the initial findings of a study on Portugal's comparative advantages
commissioned by 40 Portuguese companies and institutes from Mr Michael
Porter, the famed Harvard economist, emphasise that Portugal needs its
traditional industries for new technologies and industrial sectors to evolve
from.
Portuguese industry is facing three principal problems: the international
recession has hit hard at a country strongly geared to exports; the older
generation of industries such as ship building, steel, fertilisers, textiles
and clothing are now open to competition for non-Community countries which,
Mr Mira Amaral insists, compete with unfair practices; and, finally, the
single European market has further opened up what has up to now been a
fairly protected sector.
Government policy for meeting these challenges is based on four principles:
using EC funds to support viable, modern companies in all sectors including
the country's traditional industries;
deriving the maximum industrial benefit possible from Portugal's natural
resources, particularly in the areas of forestry and mining;
making a special effort to modernise and develop the electro-mechanical
industries including vehicles, components, transport material and electrical
and non-electrical machinery; and
encouraging foreign investment.
But Mr Amaral emphasises that Portugal will be more and more selective with
the foreign investment it supports with incentives. 'I only want to back
foreign investment that contributes significantly to the improvement of
Portuguese industry,' he says. 'That means projects that improve our
capacity for management and organisation, develop our human resources,
contribute to diversifying our industrial base and lead to new markets.'
The minister points to the district of Setubal, south of Lisbon, as an area
that has been transformed by foreign investment. This is where the Es450bn
Ford-Volkswagen plant, the biggest foreign investment ever made in Portugal,
is sited amid a cluster of other big foreign projects. 'No other industrial
region in Europe offers the infrastructure, the closeness to the capital and
the climate of Setubal,' boasts Mr Mira Amaral.
But it is also true that the jobless rate in Setubal is higher than in then
rest of the country. Ship building, steel and heavy chemical industries have
been closing down and the workers aged over 45 that are made redundant find
themselves unemployable by the new industries that are springing up around
them.
'These men are too old to be recycled and will have to be absorbed by the
service sector or low-technology industries,' says Mr Mira Amaral. 'But it
is our hope that the new projects in the region will dynamise the growth of
services and basic technological firms to employ them.'
Officially, the unemployment rate in Portugal is a low 5.6 per cent. But
government opponents insist that statistics are not a true reflection of the
jobless rate and that a lot of unemployment is masked by part-time working
and unpaid wage arrears. Unemployment is forecast to rise to 8 per cent in
1994.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (10): Shops march to war - Retailers have
been hit hard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WAR has been raging in the Portuguese food retail sector. While the big
supermarket chains notch up record sales year after year, the thousands of
little corner shops have been deeply hit by the recession.
The latter are also complaining about the devastating effects of the
increasingly powerful and numerous super- and hypermarket giants and are
fighting passionately for Sunday shopping to be banned.
In Portugal, the modernisation of the retail market began much later than
elsewhere in Europe. The first hypermarket was opened as late as 1986, and
even today the sector's structure remains very traditional.
In 1992, only 25 of the more than 152,000 registered retail outlets (about
66,000 of which operate in the food sub-sector) were hypermarkets. The
number currently stands at 31, with a further 34 authorised. More than 80
per cent of all establishments have an area smaller than 200 square meters
and an average staff of 2.3.
There is one shop for every 250 Portuguese, but only one hypermarket for
every 400,000 inhabitants. Nevertheless, the 33 members of the National
Supermarket Association (ANS) accounted for Es396bn, or 40.2 per cent, of
last year's total turnover in the Portuguese retail sector.
Hypermarkets may have been late in arriving, but their expansion has been
very rapid. They increased their sales quota from 5.4 per cent in 1987 to an
estimated 31 per cent in 1992. Food retail figures for last year show a
quota of 23 per cent for the hypermarkets, 19 per cent for the supermarkets,
and 58 per cent for the traditional small shop.
The international recession has left the Portuguese, like most Europeans,
with less money to spend. That shoppers are now mainly going for low-price
consumer goods is good news for the super- and hypermarkets. But the corner
shops, unable to compete with low prices and long opening hours, are bitter
about the effects of the crisis.
'We are seeing serious sales drops in some sub-sectors, such as shoes,
clothes and even food,' says Mr Jose Manuel Mesquita, general secretary of
the Portuguese Federation of Retail Commerce (FCRP).' We estimate that in
food, sales have fallen between 25-30 per cent this year.
According to the FCRP, some 4,000 trade establishments went bankrupt over
the last 12 months. The Federation says the number of those unemployed in
the sector was around 40,000 in 1992 and could rise to 60,000 by the end of
this year.
But the small retail shops are not just blaming the recession. In their
view, the hypermarkets are also responsible for the difficult phase they are
going through. 'I don't know which of the two is the bigger plague: the
hypermarkets or the recession,' says Mr Mesquita.
The Federation says it is not opposed to the existence of hypermarkets, but
to the speed at which they are expanding. This summer, the government
decided temporarily to suspend granting new hypermarket licences.
The FCRP welcomes this move, but complains that there is no overall strategy
for the retail sector.
'If the government feels the right way is to turn the country into a
plantation of hypermarkets,' says Mr Mesquita, 'then it should go with that
option and admit it.'
One of the FCRP's main aims is to persuade the government to ban Sunday
opening, except in certain areas, such as amusement parks or the regions
bordering Spain, which rely heavily on Spanish weekend shoppers. It argues
that small shops, most of which are run by families, cannot be expected to
stay open seven days a week.
In 1993, the 33 ANS members expect to increase their sales by 36.3 per cent
compared with last year. While growth rates of private consumption are
expected to show a drop from 5.3 per cent in 1991 to between 1.7 per cent
and 2.5 per cent in 1993, the three largest supermarket chains, Sonae
Distribuicao, Supa and Jeronimo Martins, expect a total turnover of Es540bn
this year, a phenomenal 65 per cent increase on 1992.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (9): Pig war makes a point - Problems of
the agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE are not by nature a bellicose people, but there was no
doubting the anger of local farmers earlier this autumn as they attacked
Spanish trucks laden with pork from across the border.
The attack followed the Portuguese government's ban on the import of all EC
pork, in retaliation against the decision by the Commission's veterinary
committee to temporarily block all exports of Portuguese pork on health
grounds.
Portugal's pig war proved nowhere as dramatic or violent as other sectorial
wars within the Community, such as the clashes involving French farmers.
Nonetheless, it did bring into sharp relief the wider tensions facing the
Portuguese farming community as it is forced to knuckle down to the demands
of EC membership.
Traditionally protected from external competition, and operating in a small
market, Portuguese agriculture is facing competition from its European
partners at a time when it still has a long way to resolve its own deep
structural problems.
Portugal's agricultural minister, Arlindo Marques da Cunha, one of the
youngest members of the cabinet, nonetheless looks and speaks like a man
burdened by the demands of office. Portuguese agriculture represent 6 per
cent of GDP and 12 per cent of employment, and yet yields per hectare are
less than a third of the European average.
Five years ago, Mr Marques da Cunha interrupted his doctoral thesis on the
impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) on Portugal at Reading
University, in the UK, in order to take up his cabinet post. But there is
clearly more work than a thesis still undone, as he is the first to admit.
'We are finding it very difficult to explain to our farmers that
protectionism was never a solution, that it brought us nothing but
backwardness. They don't want to hear it,' he says.
In the transition period following Portuguese entry into the Community in
1986, EC aid has been used to improve irrigation and communications and to
train some of the younger farmers in alternative production methods. From
January 1, this year, a final transition period has been under way, which
involves phased reductions in beef and cereal prices, together with cuts in
subsidies and the dismantlement of import restrictions.
Mr Marques da Cunha believes the two-stage transition period had made things
worse rather than better. 'In the first period, the idea was created in the
minds of our farmers that the EC was good just for funds. They were less
aware of the need to become competitive,' he says.
Over at the the Portuguese Farmers Confederation, the president, Mr Raul
Rosado Fernandes, a classics professor by profession but a landowner by
inheritance, does not strike one as a man in a hurry.
'The average age of farmers is over 50. It's going to be very difficult to
change their habits and their education. An economist told me you need to
get rid of thousands of farmers. I asked him: what do you do with the
corpses?'
The minister Mr Marques da Cunha, is, however, aiming to bring about a
gradual phased reduction in employment in his sector - to 7 per cent of the
population within the next 10 years, hoping that the farms that remain will
be larger and more efficiently run.
As for the CAP, he takes comfort in the fact that its reform 'is not yet
ended'.
'We need to bring more help to farmers in remoter areas. We need to
strengthen the regional dimension of CAP,' he says. Portugal clearly still
has some fighting to do.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): An attack on paperwork -
Document management and business process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PAPER is a curse. At the best of times, information goes missing when it's
most needed. For a financial institution processing thousands of credit card
repayments or registering mortgage applications, paper is the link with its
customers. These customers want to know the progress of their case, and that
can only be established by locating the paperwork in question.
So why not take the whole bureaucracy and store and process it
electronically? Customer queries can answered instantly by calling up a
screen.
The technology in question is document image processing (DIP), also known as
document management. Systems differ in terms of software and precise
functions, but the basic technology relies on optical disks compressing and
storing data.
The visual image is scanned by a device that resembles a photo-copier.
Essentially a serious relative of the compact disc, the optical disks are
arranged in a jukebox. A 64-disk jukebox can hold up to 3.2m pages of
information.
A powerful desktop PC gives every member of staff the power to call up
images in under 10 seconds. Abolishing paperwork through DIP has meant
getting a response to the customer in less time while also cutting back on
staff. But the current wave of installations have fallen in with the far
grander fashion of Business Process Re-engineering (BPR). The latest in a
succession of management buzzwords to spring out of an information
technology industry keen to promote the concept that technology is
indispensable, BPR is now intertwined with DIP.
The argument runs that DIP follows a document throughout the business. So
implementing a technology that cuts a swath through bureaucracy should
invite a fundamental rethink of the entire organisation and its structure.
The alliance of BPR and DIP has the partial blessing of Dr David Best,
partner in information management at Touche Ross. But Dr Best notes that the
challenge of BPR has actually hindered technical progress - 'document image
processing is not as widespread as it could be, because people find it
difficult to redesign their processes.'
Unisys provides DIP in the form of InfoImage beginning at Pounds 75,000.
High-end price tags are in the multi-million pound bracket. DIP is not a
casual commitment. At Clerical Medical Investment Group, documents have been
been consigned to microfiche since the 1980s. Now a Pounds 500,000 project
in the annuities department has pointed the way to a wider application of
optical scanning and storage.
Ken Hawkes, manager of the annuities department, finds the new technology
has made a difference to his telephone manner - 'people call in and say they
wrote to us in January and I can say 'Yes - I've got the letter in front of
me.''
Pam Webb, information systems business development manager, agrees that DIP
improves customer service. But she is restrained about leaping on the BPR
bandwagon - 'the image-processing hardware and software amount to just one
of the tools we will use. They are very powerful, but they're not the
driver. That has to come from the business itself.'
Pressed on the motive for the Unisys contract, she notes: 'If I believe in
re-engineering, it's with a small r'
Mark Churchward, manager of Olivetti's document management division, sells
Filenet. Billed as an image management and workflow system, Filenet has
grown over the years to include features such as handwriting recognition.
The expansion of its technical brief has been accompanied by the rise of
BPR, a vogue term unheard of when DIP products first emerged. Filenet
systems begin at Pounds 50,000 and stretch into the millions depending on
size.
To his credit, Mr Churchward is quick to offer a no-nonsense definition of
the phrase on every consultant's lips: 'BPR means taking a clean-sheet
approach to looking at what the business activity should be.' And
realistically, he concedes that BPR does not mean a blank cheque for
technology - 'it means looking at the legacy of the past and deciding what
processes really add value, as opposed to automating everything.
'So DIP has become the jumping off point for more fundamental changes - the
only way to use the technology to eliminate paper is to analyse the
processes. There isn't one right way to do things. It's different for every
business,' he says. Mr Churchward and his colleagues have weathered the
healthy scepticism towards IT adopted by most companies since recession bit
hard - 'we measure the benefits after implementation. A successful project
will yield a substantial return on the investment in technology. Our
business is guaranteeing that return.'
Four years ago, NatWest Card Services began introducing a 130-workstation
Filenet system to process letters arriving at its Access and Visa centre at
Southend. The number of documents handled daily averages 4,500, but can peak
at 12,000 for boom periods like the January sales. Over 10,000 documents are
retrieved from two 'jukeboxes' every day. Credit card account details are
retained on an IBM mainframe host, with 250,000 statements downloaded each
day.
The DIP side of this operation cost Pounds 2.2m. DIP has done more than
speed up access to data at Southend. It has put every clerk directly in
touch with the public. And NatWest has been sufficiently impressed to embark
on its own DIP software project.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (10): Cautious view prevails
 -Technology investment slow-down in the insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE general insurance market starts to be shaken up by new technology,
older-established insurance companies in the UK are struggling to meet the
challenge.
A recent survey carried out for the Computer Management Group, CMG,
concluded that many of them were lacking in innovation and complacent about
customer service and competition.
CMG's senior consultant Mr Ian Bowen says that their attitude left them
exposed to an invasion of their market by banks and building societies as
well as by foreign competitors.
This view is supported by Ms Miranda Mayes, a senior business analyst at
International Data Corporation, IDC. In a study of computers in finance, she
found that insurance companies were putting relatively little investment
into new technology, partly because of the high levels of claims in recent
years caused by bad weather, increased crime and terrorism.
IDC found that 40 per cent of insurance companies expected to increase their
spending on computers this year, but only by 9.5 per cent on average. At the
same time, 28 per cent of them intended to cut their spending by an average
of 20.9 per cent. Insurance was the only area of finance in which spending
on IT was expected to fall over the next three years.
Many insurance firms saw profitability as a more important issue than
maintaining and increasing market share, the survey shows. Also rather
surprisingly, they put management information systems at the top of their
priorities for new applications, ahead of claims systems.
There are warning signs that they should be more concerned about market
share. Royal Bank of Scotland's subsidiary, Direct Line, set up in 1985, has
taken around 6 per cent of the private car insurance market in eight years
and is now challenging firms such as Norwich Union, Royal Insurance and Sun
Alliance for leadership in that field. It sells policies by phone, backed up
by a powerful computer system and marketed by TV advertising. The success of
the operation comes from giving customers a quick and easy way of getting
cheap cover.
The phone interview is based on a computer system which ensures that it
takes no more than five minutes on average. Then the caller can be covered
at once and a policy issued the next day.
Callers are asked to give their name, house number and post code; addresses
are then retrieved automatically to save time. Payment must be made by card,
not by cheque, which maximises the number of processed calls.
The range of insurables is limited somewhat arbitrarily but effectively to
exclude most apparent potential risks: sports cars and pop musicians are not
taken on.
The system cuts out the middlemen, enabling the business to be run more
efficiently and undercut its rivals. At the same time the culture of the
business has changed to Direct Line's advantage; people are far more
inclined to shop around for the best deal.
In 1987 the company branched out into household policies and it is now in
the top ten in that league. It has recently begun to diversify further into
personal loans, using data from car and domestic policies to assess the
risk.
Direct Line's system is run on a Comparex mainframe at its head office in
Croydon, claimed to be the largest online transaction processing operation
in Europe.
Mr Mike Flaherty, Direct Line's executive director, says that he and five
colleagues wrote the software in six months, using Computer Associates'
fourth generation language, Generol. It was based on IBM's CICS transaction
processing system and on flat files rather than a relational database in
order to get the highest possible speed of response. Direct Line's approach
has been followed in recent years by several firms including Churchill
Insurance, General Accident and Eagle Star. Mr Bowen expects that virtually
all the main insurers will have set up direct companies within a year.
The entry level cost for the computer system is probably around Pounds
500,000; a 200-user system might cost around Pounds 2m. New entrants are
mainly buying UNIX-based machines from companies such as Pyramid and
Sequent. Falling hardware prices have opened the business up to more
competitors.
The insurance industry is now asking itself how widely these techniques can
be applied. There is no reason to doubt that computers could handle it, but
would people accept it?
Sceptics argue that the motor policy market is an exceptionally simple one
and that what works there will not necessarily work in other fields.
Domestic insurance policies can be managed over the phone, although they
take slightly longer to set up than motor policies. But personal loans,
mortgages, pensions and life assurance may be a different sort of business.
Loans and mortgages, traditionally arranged by a half-hour chat with the
local bank manager, could prove less amenable to the direct selling
operation. People may be reluctant to take a decision which could affect the
rest of their lives on the basis of a short telephone conversation with
someone they have never met.
Undaunted, however, Direct Line launched a direct system for personal loans
in August, aimed at its 1.5m customers, after a successful pilot project
earlier in the year. Interviews are expected to take only take eight minutes
on average and a decision can be taken at the end of that time.
Next spring it will test a new system for mortgages and after that will move
on to a sickness benefit system.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (8): Nightmare of mismatched
systems - The problems of mergers and technology issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK AUSTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of UK building societies is dwindling year by year. Industry
analysts predict there will be fewer than 50 left at the end of the decade.
Although the Leeds Permanent and the National and Provincial building
societies last month called off their attempt to create the biggest-ever
society merger, after discovering a clash of management styles, the merger
aim was only the latest in a steady stream whereby many small-to-middle
ranking societies have joined together or been swallowed by the majors.
In any successful merger, the smooth integration of the two parties'
computer systems is essential. If mishandled, the technology mismatch
frustrates the business plan and drains away the anticipated cost benefits.
Indeed, incompatible technology has sometimes been cited as a reason for
calling off such mergers, although IT professionals tend to dismiss this as
a smokescreen to conceal other problems.
For all the talk of open systems, most building societies - and banks -
still have central computer systems that will prove incompatible. Open
systems have made inroads among the desktop/branch level applications, but
they are invariably backed up by a proprietary, mainframe system running
bespoke software. Yet the consensus of opinion is that such IT difficulties
should not obstruct a merger, if the business case adds up.
In a merger, larger societies will usually impose their own technical
procedures on a smaller group, junking the smaller society's system and
loading the data on to its own larger system. Technical problems are more
likely with a merger of two societies of similar size, where employees on
each side have a vested interest in fighting for retention of their own
systems and procedures. Then IT may become the battleground for the power
struggle as to who comes out on top after the merger.
Information technology 'reflects the whole business culture of the way an
organisation works,' comments Nigel Walsh, marketing director of electronic
banking specialists, the Software Partnership. 'IT isn't an appendage - it's
at the heart of the business.'
At the centre, he adds, the technology is still largely about the automation
of core processes, the software for which will more often than not have been
developed in-house. Building societies may share the same products, but each
will have evolved its own procedures for handling them. Even package systems
for mortgages or investment products will usually have been tailored to suit
that society's particular idiosyncrasies.
The best approach, suggests Mr Walsh, is to disentangle the systems
delivering services to the customer from the central systems behind them,
allowing the latter to be migrated or replaced after thorough evaluation.
The race to achieve 'transparency' (common service to customers in branches
of each society) from day one of the merger can distract attention from
longer-term planning, says a report, 'Maximising the success of mergers and
acquisitions in the building society industry' - published by Touche Ross
management consultants.
'There are unique circumstances in each merger process,' says John Rushden,
associate with Touche Ross. 'Societies which have grown through acquisition
may inherit a mixture of different procedures and systems that need to be
rationalised and re-engineered.
'In the short-term, it may be best to retain the 'best of breed' among the
systems used by each party, but that may add to the cost-base,' he says. In
the longer-term it may be better to replace them altogether, which is often
the most politically acceptable option if there are champions of existing
systems in each society.'
Networks, as well as central systems, can be a large source of compatibility
problems, notes Mr lain Davidson, director of financial systems division at
Unisys. But, he adds: 'Enforced change may not be a bad thing if it pushes
societies to replace systems that were outdated, anyway. Otherwise it is
best to standardise on the best of breed from each party as quickly as
possible.'
He is sceptical of suggestions that the costs of converging computer systems
may swallow up the expected cost-savings from a merger - 'the savings from
rationalisation, such as branch closures, should outweigh the short-term IT
costs. And in the longer-term, say five years, the merged society will have
significantly lower IT costs.'
One man with plenty of hands-on experience of building society mergers is
Brian Bonny, deputy chief executive of Portman Building Society, which was
itself formed by the merger of the Regency &amp; West of England with the then
Portman Wessex in 1990.
Before that, Mr Bonny reckons to have gone through a merger or acquisition
process with the Regency once every year since 1983.
'There have never been two cases the same,' he observes. 'But the objective
is always the same: to achieve full integration by the target date. So it's
vital very early in the merger process to set up an appropriately resourced
team to review the IT requirements.' It is at 'the detail level' that the
stumbling blocks occur, in the subtleties of operating procedures,' he adds.
There are different ways of crediting interest to an investment account, for
example, and such points have to be identified at an early stage to avoid
problems.
When the Portman Wessex merged with Regency &amp; West of England, the two
parties were near-equal in size. The former was based on Unisys while the
latter was already reviewing its IT strategy with a view to replacing its
NCR mainframe and associated software which dated from the 1970s.
'To achieve the merger by October 1, 1990 we had to make the best of the
systems we had, and decided to run all the investment products on the Unisys
system and mortgages on the NCR,' recalls Mr Bonny. The wider IT strategy
review was completed the following year and resulted in a decision to move
on to the ICL-Omnia VME system. In December, Portman will absorb the much
smaller St Pancras Building Society, and will load the latter's data on to
its Omnia system.
Starting next year, Portman's Omnia system will be migrated from VME to VME
Open, offering the prospect of putting its Unix sub-systems on the same
platform.
'Open systems are not in general use in any building societies I know of -
it's always just around the corner,' adds Mr Bonny. Migrating to VME Open
should be helpful in assisting any future merger process, but he insists
that present IT incompatibilities should not be a barrier to mergers - 'if
you are 'in IT' you should be able to face up to the challenge and find a
cost-effective solution,' he says.
'Mergers involve many considerations - market share, reserves, members . .
.IT is just one component and it shouldn't be the Achilles heel in the
decision.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (11): Aid to better decisions
 -Benefits of artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JUNK MAIL is a contemporary curse. It afflicts anyone whose address
qualifies for a marketing database, and that appears to include most of the
adult population. As they bin endless leaflets, few people can sympathise
with mailshot senders.
Some companies, like the Sun Alliance financial services group, are
seriously concerned to get right letter through the appropriate box.
Sun Alliance is a member of the Department of Trade and Industry's
Technology Transfer Club. With a budget of Pounds 5.75m, the club nurtures
advanced technology, bringing together users and industry players such as
systems house Logica. Sun Alliance has volunteered to test-drive Autonet
Workbench, a smart program developed by Recognition Research, in
collaboration with Logica.
Autonet is an example of neural computing, a branch of software development
where the computer is programmed to follow patterns and produce a result
that is consistent with previous examples. It could be said to learn by
these examples.
Unfortunately the language of advanced software can be very deceptive.
Neural computing was christened after the thought processes of the human
brain. But no program can really replicate the complexity of thought. The
most advanced systems still learn by rote, and are limited by the data fed
in to them.
Sun aims to improve the response rate from mailings, and in the course of
that, reduce the amount of junk mail emanating from its financial services
operation.
The name of the game is spotting the correlation between information about
customers and products they have bought in the past.
'We only want to mail information to the customer who'll buy our financial
products,' says Steve Lamb, systems manager at Sun. Before Autonet was
introduced, standard statistical techniques were used. If this program
produces a one per cent improvement in sales, then the technology will have
made a significant difference.
Mr Lamb is adamant that Sun Alliance's venture into neural computing is no
gimmick. His department has spent time assessing pure technology, but that
is in the past.
'We did all the 'pie in the sky' stuff two years ago. We want to get some
money out of this and we wouldn't be setting it up if we didn't think neural
computing would become a standard part of our technology,' he says.
Sun Alliance is already examining possible uses of neural computing for
claims analysis. Encouraged by official backing and the prospect of real
gains, it is willing to take ideas out of the laboratory and into practice.
But neural computing grew out of the murky field of artificial intelligence
(AI). Such terminology invited inaccurate comparisons with the users' own
mind and AI acquired a mixed reputation. This legacy puts prospective
customers on their guard.
Mercantile &amp; General is the largest specialist reinsurer in the UK
underwriting Pounds 1bn worth of life and general premiums per year. Jim
Dawson, information services manager, has used software from Neuron Data to
devise Magnum, a program that takes the abstract knowledge of the insurance
underwriter out into the field with the insurance salesman.
'The problem with life underwriting is that it requires a great deal of
expertise. To discriminate between good and bad risks needs an underwriter's
judgement.'
Underwriting data has traditionally been stored in bulky manuals detailing
the risks associated with occupations or sports or medical histories. The
underwriter added a considered judgement to this cold data. Neuron Data's
Nexpert software provided Jim Dawson with the appropriate guidelines to
transform this mix of daunting statistics and professional nous into a
practical program.
The end result fits on to a laptop computer - 'we put all this data and the
judgemental expertise together. Then we integrated it with a salesman's
toolkit and let him take that experience out on the road,' he says.
Each Nexpert licence costs Pounds 5,000, but the real development costs lay
in recruiting and retaining the right programmers. Specialists do not come
cheap - getting the Magnum package out on the PCs used by Mercantile and
General's insurance clients cost upwards of Pounds 200,000.
The key to implementing such a system lies in 'diehard experts,' as Jim
Dawson sees them, 'the people who are able to get to grips with the more
arcane parts of program development.'
He is refreshingly candid in his references to the dramatic language that
suppliers wrap around these smart software tools - 'tags like 'artificial
intelligence' are too exotic and usually overstate the capabilities of a
product. We use the term 'knowledge-based systems' or KBS. It's more
meaningful.'
Barclays Bank has turned to KBS in an effort to make its commerical lending
more consistent. Lending Advisor, a KBS that started life on large IBM
mainframes, is under trial at 30 Barclays branches.
Developed by Syntelligence at the behest of US banks in the 1980s, Lending
Advisor merges historical data about the client with judgements about the
viability of the loan. The loan is then classified into one of seven
categories, ranging from unacceptable to excellent.
Lending Advisor does not come cheap. Licences start at Pounds 600,000. But
Mr Rob Turner, European business manager at Syntelligence points out that
big provisions for bad debts have made it critical for banks to disseminate
lending expertise widely.
'Commercial lending is a problem. We're providing a security blanket,' he
says.
Whether or not the customer qualifies for a commercial loan is still a
decision taken by the bank. Clever software can only reflect the wisdom, or
otherwise, of the user. But products like Lending Advisor do promise to iron
out seemingly eccentric loan decisions.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (7): Santa Claus image slips - Portugal
and the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORTUGUESE love the EC logos on their new car number plates, and one of
Lisbon's newest office blocks is named after Jean Monnet in recognition of
the European ideal. Beyond the symbols, however, a sense of uncertainty
about the realities of Europe is disturbing a country that has spent most of
its history struggling with an inferiority complex.
From his office in the Monnet building, the EC's representative in Lisbon,
Mr Francisco Sarsfield Cabral, is disarmingly frank about the collective
mood.
Mr Sarsfield Cabral who is a former adviser to the prime minister comments:
'When we joined in 1986, the EC was seen very favourably . . . it was an
insurance against communism, it meant living better, democracy, joining the
club of civilised people. Europe was a state of mind. Now I'm afraid that
the EC, having once been seen as Santa Claus, is becoming an escape valve
for every evil. More and and more people are complaining ..'
Complaints stem from the mixed economic fortunes which continuing membership
of the EC under the umbrella of Maastricht are bringing to Portugal.
As the poorest member state of the EC when it joined, Portugal has found
itself in the last seven years as the recipient of massive amounts of EC
aid. Between 1986 and 1990, Portugal received Ecu 2.9bn, representing 1.6
per cent of its GDP, in structural funds alone. Recently, the EC agreed to a
doubling of its total economic aid to Portugal to Ecus 18bn between 1994 and
1999.
Portuguese officials pride themselves on their country's reasonably honest
record in using the funds, although allegations persist about the misuse of
training subsidies by companies and some trade union officials.
The total funds have had a dramatic impact on the country's infrastructure -
improvements have ranged from irrigation systems to motorways and airports -
on training, and on living standards generally. But they have also
contributed to a false sense of security. Over the last year, the majority
of Portuguese have found themselves unpleasantly surprised by the harsher
realities of EC membership, not least the difficulties of meeting the
Maastrich convergence rules.
Portuguese officials, who 18 months ago were proudly proclaiming their
country's joining of the ERM as a sign of their commitment to the Maastricht
rules and to joining EMU at its inception, are having to take a more
pragmatic view about the pace of political and economic integration. They
take some comfort in the fact that Maastricht itself allows a measure of
flexibility.
Mr Vitor Martins, Portugal's secretary of state for European affairs said in
a recent interview with the FT: 'Next year will be crucial for a
re-evaluation of the convergence criteria. If the European economy begins to
recover I think we can live with the present criteria. But if the situation
does not stabilise, we will push for a rewriting of Maastricht.'
That the Portuguese economy was far from on course to meet the convergence
criteria was made plain in October when the finance ministry had to admit
publicly that the budget deficit had doubled from the original forecast of
4.7 per cent of GDP, to 8 per cent. The target date for cutting the deficit
to three per cent of GDP was put off until 1999.
Subsequently Portugal's finance minister Jorge Braga de Macedo has tried to
put on a brave face, insisting that his country remains, 'at the forefront
of those which want to be integrated in economic and monetary union.' What
is unresolved is precisely on what terms.
The present government has declared its opposition to the idea of a
twin-track Europe, with different countries moving at different speeds
towards EMU, but its own domestic economic mismanagement has effectively
ensured that Portugal will go through the door later rather than sooner, and
limping.
Former socialist finance minister, Vitor Constancio, believes that policy
should be allowed to reflect changing circumstances more clearly. He
believes that the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo are irrevocably
linked. 'If Spain wants to be in the forefront, it is difficult for us not
to fall behind her,' he says. At the same time, he thinks that European
union is best served politically by two speeds.
'It is clearly not possible to go back to the old European monetary system.
If we really want to move ahead to EMU, let the others go ahead first. We
may not be ready but we will get there in the end.' he says.
The broad thrust of official thinking, however, appears to be essentially
cautious and conservative: that present EC structures should be consolidated
rather than subjected to any major upheaval. Portugal's membership is still
in its gestation and has no wish to be orphaned.
Mr Martins is in favour of enlargement, and believes that the Efta states
will make the community economically stronger, and better equipped to deal
with Eastern Europe. He wants the present 'balance within the EC' to be
maintained. 'I am not in favour of constitutional change,' he insists.
As for Portugal's most politically active Eurosceptic, the orthodox
Communist Party, it does not have enough votes to push for a referendum, but
its union arm is flexing its industrial muscle in a way that could make the
government's efforts to achieve nominal and real convergence that much more
difficult.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (5): Times are getting tough for
exporters - The economy is highly sensitive to recession in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE experience of a small cork company in northern Portugal is a telling
example of how times are getting tough for Portuguese exporters. Just to
land a contract with a UK importer the company was obliged to pay a
good-will fee of Pounds 100,000.
'That kind of sweetener will take a long time for a small firm to recover,'
says a Lisbon-based foreign consultant. 'It's a clear indication of the
length companies are being forced to just to keep in business.'
Portugal is a small, open economy based on imports and exports that is
highly sensitive to recession in Europe. 'The European Community is
experiencing its worst recession since it was established,' says Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, minister for finance. 'The recovery is proving so sluggish
that it is bound to produce extreme anxiety and insecurity.'
But recession is not the only thorn in the side of Portuguese exporters. For
the past three years the Social Democrat government has maintained a policy
of a strong escudo. This, combined with inflation considerably higher than
the European average, has significantly pushed up export prices, hitting the
export sector hard and sending up a cry of protest from industry.
'The strong escudo stance is the key flaw in the government's economic
policy,' according to Mr Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition
Socialist Party. But both the finance minister and Mr Miguel Beleza, the
governor of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank, defend the policy as key
to the health and recovery of the economy.
Portugal placed the escudo in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the
European monetary system in 1992 and from the beginning of this year lifted
capital controls, making the currency fully convertible for the first time
in more than a century.
The escudo has suffered speculative pressures, which have cost it dearly in
terms of foreign exchange. But since the realignment of the ERM bands in
August this year the currency has remained reasonably stable without the
need for massive central bank intervention.
'We are going to hold firmly to the course of a strong escudo,' says Mr
Braga de Macedo. 'It is absolutely essential for us to achieve convergence
with our European partners and to participate in economic and monetary union
(Emu) with the first group of countries.'
'A consequence of the strong escudo policy is that Portugal is not able to
have an independent interest rate policy,' points out Mr Beleza. The high
interest rates needed to keep the escudo strong are another point of
friction with many sectors of industry - in particular, the difference
between prime rates, now at about 14 per cent, and the much higher rates
that the small- and medium-sized companies that form the backbone of
Portuguese industry have to pay.
A key inflationary pressure that could help bring down interest rates is the
level of wage rises. The government is seeking a social pact for 1994 that
would hold public administrative sector wage rises to zero and other sectors
to 4 per cent. Tax credit incentives have been offered to companies as part
of the deal as well as an 8 per cent easing of income tax bands that
officials claim will increase average family income by 1 per cent.
But negotiations between trade unions, the government and employers appear
deadlocked over an extra half a percentage point that the unions are
insisting on. Mr Braga de Macedo believes that achieving the government's
terms in a national wage pact would mean the difference between gross
domestic product growing 1 per cent or 2 per cent in 1994.
Others feel that a formal deal would help but is not essential. 'Most
companies are going through a delicate time in terms of liquidity and
profits,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial
Portugues. 'This means they will not be in a position to give significant
wage rises.'
Another inflationary pressure is the budget deficit. After the embarrassment
of a massive overrun in 1993, the government hopes to bring the deficit back
towards convergence with the rest of the Community in 1994 with a deficit of
6.9 per cent of GDP compared with 8 per cent this year. The key to this
appears to be improving inefficient tax collection and clamping down on
widespread evasion.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Hard line approach -
Fresh realism in dealing room applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PASCAL BERTAUD is responsible for kitting-out the City of London dealing
room of Lloyds Bank. Over the past decade his professional colleagues might
have approached this task with an open chequebook and unbridled enthusiasm
for the latest technology on offer. This being 1993, Mr Bertaud has no
intention of flooding Lloyds' dealing floor with innovative technology.
His brief is to find a system that works at a price the bank can well
afford. It is a strategy based on experience.
The current Lloyds dealing room relies on data feeds from Reuters and Dow
Jones Telerate mixed through IBM's early implementation of the Unix
operating system AIX. IBM PS/2 PCs are backed up by Stratus computers
performing the heavier processing. Lloyds spent Pounds 3m to get this
120-position dealing room up and running. It was a successful project in its
time, but is due for replacement. Lloyds has surveyed the market and
rejected the obvious and costly solution of a large off-the-peg dealing room
system. In the boom days of the late 1980s, these systems were de rigeur. In
today's more cautious climate, the bank has refused to embark on any
solution that might run late and over budget.
'I just believe that the big bang approach is no longer viable,' says Mr
Bertaud, a veteran of computer programming at systems house Scicon and the
merchant banking arm of Lloyds Bank. As senior manager for front office
systems he must reconcile the users' needs with a controlled budget - 'they
want a dealing system. The challenge for me is to update it at a
cost-effective price.' His strategy is a rolling replacement of the PS/2s by
Compaq and Dell PCs. He defines it as an incremental approach that will take
place over three years.
Mr Bertaud takes an uncompromising line with the financial systems industry
 -'I'm constantly plagued by salesmen. I tell them what we're doing. If they
can't add to that, then we're getting it right.'
This hardline approach has introduced Lloyds to systems not immediately
associated with complex dealing rooms. PC software giant Microsoft has
emerged as a pivotal supplier. Mr Bertaud's team is using standard
programming utilities from Microsoft to link dealing terminals.
The best-selling Windows PC environment provides the back-drop. The current
generation of development software from Microsoft, retailing at between
Pounds 500 and Pounds 3,000 per copy, allows the user considerable autonomy
in devising an appropriate local system.
Lloyds have built a simple but effective application that links dealing
positions. A deal keyed into one terminal will automatically update the
spreadsheet on another screen. The proven Microsoft Excell spreadsheet will
be the prime tool for the new dealing room.
Mr Bertaud has looked at the possibility of installing high-powered
workstations from Sun. In the late 1980s these machines were touted as the
box to match the dealer's Porsche. But many dealing rooms wound up with
excess power at the dealer's fingertips. Foreign exchange staff were in fact
quite content to operate a conventional spreadsheet on a 'run of them mill'
PC. As PCs acquired more power, the workstation has reverted to its original
role as a specialist tool for engineers and scientists. And PCs are
familiar. If you agree with Mr Bertaud that 'the only thing that matters is
being able to use the thing,' then the more comfortable Lloyds' dealers
feel, the more successful the implementation.
Lloyds will spend Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m following this option. Going overboard
with a Big Bang era dealing room would have cost perhaps twice that sum.
Telerate was in the forefront of the dealing room systems boom. Before its
takeover by Dow Jones, described by European managing director Dan Casey as
'relatively painless,' Telerate interwove data feeds in a variety of
ambitious projects. It expanded from providing information feeds to
producing dealer workstations.
Telerate stumbled badly with the Telerate Trading System (TTS). This
attempted to challenge Reuters dominance in the foreign exchange field and
sank in the face of a user base weary with technical innovation. Now the
company has re-entered the dealer box fray with Minex, billed as a complete
electronic broking system. Minex has been developed hand in hand with a
consortium of banks. Telerate knows the climate has changed. The current
generation of powerful PCs have redressed the balance in the customer's
favour, allowing the user to return to basics.
Technology is no longer allowed to distract financial institutions from
their prime purpose. Dan Casey claims that today's Telerate wouldn't dream
of hoisting an over-elaborate system on a client - 'the market asks for the
information and the product separately. We try to stick to the financial
community and their wishes.'
Tony Coveney is the director of Lazard Brothers banking division. When
Telerate entered a three-cornered fight with Reuters and financial systems
house ACT to upgrade an 80 position dealing room for Lazard, it won out by
dropping technical jargon - 'I insisted the suppliers all speak plain
English and avoided acronyms so I could explain our system to my fellow
board members' says Mr Coveney.
Telerate is carrying out a Pounds 500,000 rewrite of Lazards' software. It
will provide a Unix workstation backbone while the dealers attend training
courses intended to make the most of the PC software packages that have
become their standard tools.
Microsoft features prominently. The project was triggered by a desire to
boost dealer productivity without hiring extra staff.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Push-button services -
Wider role emerges for new-style cash machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the UK, the Trustee Savings Bank communicates with 70-80 per cent of
customers through automated teller machines (ATMs) and Barclays says 200m
cash withdrawals - worth Pounds 10m in total - were made from its network of
machines last year.
Most ATMs only dispense cash, but they are starting to be put to new uses
and combined with emerging technologies, such as multimedia.
Since early October, Vienna-based customers of Creditanstalt Bankverein have
had access to five self-service machines from Digital Equipment which enable
them to:
Make giro payments.
Set up or update standing orders.
Get information on stock exchange rates.
Make deposit or account-balance enquiries.
Find information on other banking services.
The design of the terminal incorporates the latest multimedia technology.
For example, video clips describe the different services and when the
machine is used for payments or other transactions, a combination of video,
text and graphics guides the user through the system. The user responds
using touch-screen commands and a keyboard.
Norbert Cizek, retail banking manager for Digital Equipment in Austria,
says: 'In Austria, a money transfer usually costs the banks DM3; using the
machine it only costs DM1, because the customer is carrying out the
transfer.'
If, after a six-month pilot, the multimedia terminals prove popular with
customers, they will be used in the rest of Creditanstalt's 200 Austrian
branches.
At the Co-operative Bank in the UK, self-service machines are being used on
a pilot basis to encourage customers to open new accounts. At five of the
Bank's branches, customers can use IBM's Personal Financial Assistant (a
walk-in booth complete with self-service terminal) to open a current
account, savings account or credit-card account, or take out a personal
loan.
A telephone beside the terminal links them with a member of the bank's
Armchair Banking staff (in Skelmersdale) who can give them any additional
information they need. An application form can then be printed out in the
booth for the customer to sign. At 12 branches of Barclays, NCR Touchbank
machines are being used to allow customers to pay bills, transfer money
between accounts or find out about loans and mortgages. Similar services are
being offered on self-service machines used in the TSB Bank's Tyneside
banking pilot. Machines at 13 out of 18 Tyneside branches use graphics and
animation (eg a magpie to represent savings) to increase useability.
The National Westminster Bank is also testing self-service technology. At
its Surbiton branch, PC-based machines with touch screens give customers
details of travel, home contents, health insurance and mortgages.
Other uses for self-service machines include:
STATEMENT PRINTING
In Germany, dedicated statement printing machines are common, partly because
of regulatory requirements for customers to keep records of banking
transactions. The machines are also popular in Austria.
At the TSB, over a million statements a month are requested via ATMs This
has reduced the bank's administrative workload because most customers no
longer ask for monthly statements to be sent to them.
DEPOSIT-TAKING
Some ATMs allow customers to deposit money or cheques. But customers are
often reluctant to use them. Organisations such as the Abbey National and
the TSB encourage customers to make deposits by producing instant receipts.
The TSB has carried out customer training in the Tyneside area on how to
make deposits via a machine. ATMs are also available from IBM and NCR which
display an image of cheques fed into them.
ADVERTISING
Martin Hess, head of self-service banking at IBM UK, believes that UK ATMs
could one day be viewed as an advertising medium by large retailers. This is
already happening in the US, where some ATMs, typically those in shopping
malls, dispense money-off coupons along with cash.
So-called 'merchant couponing' has already begun in the UK. Customers of the
Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society get a message on their ATM receipts
entitling them to a discount at Burger King or, in some cases, a free
hamburger. Martin Hess says such schemes could turn ATMs into a valuable
asset for banks.
LIMITATIONS OF AUTOMATION
Paul Swainbank, director of channel marketing at TSB, believes that in
certain locations unmanned automated branches will replace the traditional
branch. But he does not believe they could be applied across the board,
although they are cheaper to run.
This is partly because many customers still want to be able to talk to bank
staff face to face. Jerry Whitmarsh, head of technology planning for
NatWest's branch network, says: 'Our feeling is that people do prefer
face-to-face discussions when they are thinking about a major item of
expenditure, such as a mortgage or a pension. But a machine that produces
quotes is a good starting point.'
Substitutes for face-to-face communication, such as video- conferencing
links to bank staff, have not proved themselves yet. The Co-operative Bank
plans to add video-conferencing to its PFA system and the TSB is testing a
couple of NCR machines with built-in video-conferencing in Watford and
Newcastle. The customer is given a choice between pressing one key for a
quotation or another for an interview.
If they press the 'interview' button, they see a live video image of a bank
employee. Paul Swainbank says: 'Some of our customers were rather startled
and, to be honest, some of our staff were, too.'
Today, however, non-cash uses of ATMs are still limited in the UK and it is
notable that many of the banks' pilot schemes have been extended without any
definite decisions being made about when the technology will be rolled out
to more locations.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (3): From militant Maoist to democrat -
Profile, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jose Manuel Durao Barroso has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Portuguese
politics to become number three in the government. Beginning as a militant
Maoist, he rose to become foreign minister, and brokered the 1991 Angolan
peace accords, perhaps Portugal's biggest diplomatic victory in recent
times.
At 37, Mr Durao Barroso is now the youngest foreign minister in the European
Community and, just a year after he took office, he is already one of the
most highly respected members of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's
cabinet. With a mixture of hauteur and natural timidity, he says the key
factor to success was being in the right place at the right time - and
facing challenges head on.
'Up until now, opportunities just came to me - and I took them,' he says.
When the Social Democrats swept to power with an absolute majority in 1987,
Mr Cavaco Silva invited him to become secretary of state for African affairs
and foreign cooperation, even though he had never set foot in Africa, a key
area for Portuguese foreign policy.
'The prime minister wanted somebody without prejudices,' he explains,
alluding to Portugal's numerous Africa veterans whose feelings often colour
their politics.
But it was more than that. His tact and ability to listen had already caught
the premier's attention. Later these qualities earned him the confidence of
Angola's two warring factions.
Mr Durao Barroso worked tirelessly to break the deadlock and bring the foes
together after 16 years of war. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi signed the peace accords in May 1991.
All excellent training for his current post. 'My experience made up for my
youth,' he says.
Ironically, though, he became foreign minister last November at the very
moment that his carefully-orchestrated peace accords were unravelling and
the Angolan civil war re-erupted more ferociously than ever.
With his youthful interest in politics, he was a law student when, in the
revolutionary fever of 1974, he began rallying Maoist rivals of the orthodox
Portuguese Communist Party. He now claims he was simply reflecting the
climate of the times rather than espousing any true leftist conviction.
'I was 18 years old and engaged in the first thing I liked,' he says. 'There
were only two political forces then. It was strange because I joined the
more radical.'
A stay in London in 1976 modified his views. He went to Geneva university to
take a post-graduate course in political science and European studies. The
sudden death of then Prime Minister, Francisco Sa Carneiro, in 1980 drove Mr
Durao Barroso back to Portugal and into the Social Democratic Party.
'The day after his funeral I joined the party. I never knew him, but greatly
admired him - he symbolised Portugal's struggle to become a Western-style
democracy.'
It was not until 1985 when Mr Cavaco Silva first became prime minister that
Mr Durao Barroso turned to the shaky politics of post-revolutionary
Portugal. 'But I felt the timing was right, and that Mr Cavaco Silva
deserved all our support.'
Somewhat philosophical about his present position now, he says: 'in
politics, even the best politician is never sure of controlling the
circumstances.'

Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THREE WEEKS after Mr Mario Soares, president of the republic, visited the
slum dwellings and shanty towns of Lisbon, amid massive media coverage, the
Social Democrat government of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister,
presented a multi-million-dollar package to abolish such degraded housing
forever.
To all appearances, the government move seemed like a hasty reaction to the
highlighting of a renowned failure of its social policy. The incident, like
many others, appeared to place Mr Soares in the role of leader of the
opposition instead of the independent political arbiter that he is supposed
to be.
The prime minister has never stooped to criticising Mr Soares for
interfering in party politics. But further down the Social Democrat
hierarchy there have been bitter accusations that the president does
everything in his power to block legislation he is opposed to and to lay the
government open to criticism over policies of which he disapproves.
The president has perfect credentials for being leader of the opposition
Socialists, who hold 72 seats in the 230-seat parliament, as opposed to the
Social Democrats' 136. He is a founder of the Socialist Party and three
times prime minister of Socialist-led governments.
But - now in his second and final five-year term - he was elected on a
platform of being 'president of all the Portuguese', committed to Portugal's
constitutional system of being a neutral referee of the political system.
Mr Soares is accused by many of taking on the role of a one-man opposition.
He has achieved this in various ways: by speaking out against social
injustice and poverty, which the government has taken as direct criticism of
its own policies, and, chiefly, by blocking legislation by vetoing it or
sending it to the constitutional court for vetting to decide whether it
contravenes the constitution.
Mr Soares has done this with a series of important laws and has been
vindicated by the decision of the court on most occasions.
The question arises: who is responsible for the open tension that often
arises between president and government? For the Social Democrat ranks, Mr
Soares is the clear protagonist, using his power to make up for a political
vacuum left by a weak and divided Socialist Party that has failed to take
advantage of the Social Democrats' weaknesses.
But for the Socialists, it is the government that has adopted a deliberate
policy of provoking Mr Soares. 'The president has fulfilled his roll with
absolute neutrality,' says Mr Antonio Guterres, leader of the Socialist
Party. 'But the government has adopted a systematic policy of seeking
confrontation with the president, with the aim of both undermining the role
of Mr Soares and at the same time denigrating the Socialist Party for
allegedly failing to be an adequate opposition.'
The two main parties are running neck-and-neck in the opinion polls. This
should be comforting for Mr Cavaco Silva, considering he is at mid-term, the
country has lapsed into recession and new independent television stations
and newspapers are revealing cases of alleged corruption at high levels.
But it also has to be remembered that the Socialists have caught up 20
percentage points in the polls since the last general election in 1991.
The poll of polls will take the form of nationwide municipal elections in
December. The Socialists inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Social
Democrats in the last local government poll in a backlash vote against the
government. To maintain any semblance of a firm opposition in this election
the Socialists will have to hold on to key cities such as Oporto and Lisbon,
where they are running in a coalition with the old-guard Communist Party.
Looking ahead to the next general election in 1995, the recessive economic
climate is likely to push unemployment and Portugal's degraded education,
health and social security systems to the fore as voting issues. This could
be enough to prevent the Social Democrats winning a third, consecutive
overall majority.
'In that climate,' forecasts Mr Guterres, 'Mr Cavaco Silva may decide to cut
his losses and give up a bid to be re-elected prime minister and instead run
for president in 1996.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (4): Naughty boy of television - Profile,
Francisco Pinto Balsemao
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGUESE Prime Ministers are not accustomed to being grilled by
broadcasters. But prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva was recently subjected
to a live mauling by three journalists on the country's private TV station
SIC, Sociedad Independente de Comunicacao.
The occasion confirmed the shake-up of Portuguese television since SIC first
hit the airwaves a year ago, thereby ending 35 years of state monopoly.
'People in government say we are an opposition channel but that's because
they are not used to it. We are simply professional,' says SIC's head
Francisco Pinto Balsemao.
At 55, Balsemao could be looking forward to retirement. Instead he still
gives the impression of being a bit of a naughty boy, trying out his latest
toy.
'The average age in SIC is under 30. Youth ensures a certain degree of
irreverence which I appreciate. It has contributed to forging a
personality,' he says.
Behind the frivolity lies a more serious background of experience which has
made Mr Balsemao one of Portugal's leading public figures. Born into a rich
banking family, Mr Balsemao has always used, rather than sat on, his
privileged status.
He trained as a journalist on the family-owned newspaper Diario Popular and
entered politics in his late twenties as a member of the moderate wing of
the old ruling fascist party.
Family privileges could have been drastically curtailed in the aftermath of
the Portuguese revolution of April 1974, but Mr Balsemao had by then founded
Expresso, a dynamic weekly which pushed back the boundaries of censorship
and served as a sounding board for the young revolutionary colonels. By
capturing the political spirit of the times, Expresso became an instant
commercial success.
Subsequently Mr Balsemao sensed correctly that what most Portuguese wanted
was not revolution but reform, a fact he reflected in his editorials and in
his founding of the country's Popular Democratic Party, later renamed Social
Democratic Party.
Perhaps the least happy period of his professional life, and one which makes
his sometimes muted candidacy for the future presidency seem an unlikely
option, was when he served as interim prime minister between 1981-1983, more
by default than ambition.( He succeeded Francisco Sa Carneiro who was killed
in an aircrash.)
'That was not an easy period,' he recalls. He helped curb the power of the
military and brought Portugal one step nearer to the EC, but he proved less
effectual in dealing with the opposition of politicians and the economy.
Now 20 years after founding Expresso, and an intervening period of mixed
political fortunes, Mr Balsemao has recovered his flair for the main chance.
'I am going for the multi-media option,' he says.
The granting of a franchise for a private TV channel to a former prime
minister who is a member of the ruling party would have been unthinkable in
Portugal until quite recently.
But SIC exemplifies the extent to which technological change has far
out-stripped regulatory thinking in the country, even if the government is
insisting on more home-grown productions.
Mr Balsemao seems determined to use SIC not only for his journalistic
pursuits but also as a platform for his seemingly ever expanding commercial
empire which ranges from magazines to electronic mailing.
He says that the first year of the station's life has proved 'more difficult
than we expected'. A deteriorating economic climate meant that advertising
was 25 per cent down on forecast, although costs generally were kept to
budget.
Audience figures have, however, proved encouraging and Soincom, Mr
Balsemao's investment company which is the largest single shareholder, and
the TV station's other main backers, which include Globo TV of Brazil, Jose
Manuel de Melo, Banco Totta y Acores, and Banco Espirito Santo have raised
an additional Es3bn to help SIC compete more aggressively with the state
networks next year.
The fact that the land bordering the site chosen for Portugal's Expo fair
(rising in value by the day) happens to be owned by his family could come in
handy if SIC encounters problems with the banks. 'You could say I've been
lucky,' says Mr Balsemao.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (2): Risk management a high
priority - How computers help the finance industry to understand more about
its customers / Updating large databases with account details is easier said
than done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY customer walking into a bank today has a distinct advantage over the
bank staff. When customers ask for a new account or a loan, they know
whether or not their account is in the red, or if they defaulted on the
mortgage payment. They also know if they have a large stock portfolio and
regular savings. The bank staff in the branch, do not.
Risk management in such situations is becoming a high priority for banks
which want to reduce their level of bad debt. Equally, the banks want to
keep the business of the high net worth customers, who are more likely to
move their accounts away, if they are not happy.
The obvious solution is to put personal computer terminals in the branches,
on which the customer's entire account details can be called up. When the
customer walks in, branch staff can call up all of their accounts on screen.
But implementing such a solution is not so easy.
According to Morley Holliday, principal consultant with Hoskyns financial
consultancy, it presents a technical challenge which most banks have not yet
solved - 'you are trying to link together old systems and new technology,'
he says.
The new branch systems use client-server computing techniques, which permit
the PCs to make database queries without overloading the system. However,
they need to link in to the existing databases, which run on proprietary
mainframe software, getting the two to work together is the crux of the
issue.
Mainframe systems are sequential - that is, one items is done after the
other, in strict order of occurence. Client-server systems operate on a
relational structure, which permits random queries - 'it is a major design
re-think to overlay client-server technology on to the old sequential
mainframe technology,' says Mr Holliday.
A second issue concerns the data. Most banks have moved some way towards a
customer-oriented environment by developing new database systems, which
store information under customer name rather than under account number. But
achieving a workable and accurate system for branch applications is proving
to be more problematic.
One of the problems relates the size the bank, according to Mervyn Kelly,
sales and marketing director for financial applications at computer vendor
Unisys - 'the larger the organisation, the more difficult it has proved to
do,' he observes. The big UK high street banks have on average six to ten
million customers each - 'they have set up the database infrastructure, but
populating it with the information has proved more difficult than it first
appeared,' he adds.
The UK banks operate mortgage, insurance, and stock broking businesses as
well as traditional branch banking. Each activity is recorded on a different
database, with the non-traditional activities typically running on a
Unix-based computer system rather than the proprietary mainframe which runs
the current accounts database. And each database uses a separate account
number for the same individual client. According to Mr Holliday, some banks
have got around the problem by copying the old accounts databases on to a
relational system such as IBM's DB2. However, the information cannot be
accurate unless the relational database is updated every night, and this
creates logistical difficulties.
'Do you want to trawl through 5m accounts every night? Timescales are tight
for banking transactions, and the computer will have little time to do this
additional work, which takes several hours,' says Mr Holliday. Updates are
usually done at week-ends, when there is more time. Don Lonsdale, an
independent banking consultant, says that most banks have solved the problem
by setting up a unique customer number, which operates across all databases:
'They start with a cheque account details, then they scan the other computer
records. Where they get a match of address, post code, name and initials,
they assume it is the same person.'
But obtaining the matches is not as simple as it sounds. Mike Healy, of
Innovative Systems, a specialist in information management, says that there
are 17,000 ways that two customer records can be different from each other
and still refer to the same person: the date of birth, national insurance
number, and name could be the same, but there could be a difference of one
character in the street name. For example, 'Lansdown' Road could be written
'Lansdowne' or 'Landsdown.'
The matching process is therefore prone to error, because unlike a human
being, the computer is not able to take a decision that 'Lansdown' is the
same as 'Lansdowne' in the context of the address given. It is normal to
find that a large percentage of entries are thrown out by the machine, for
manual checking.
To date, the banks have only used the unique customer number to enable the
database information to be extracted for direct marketing. The general view
taken is that if a customer gets three copies of the same mailshot, no harm
is done. However, they are aware of the need to improve the accuracy, in
order to use the data in branch office applications.
Abbey National has had a customer-oriented direct marketing database for two
years. Each of its 10m customers is identified by a unique internal customer
number, and the system records all products they have with the bank.
'We knew that if we took names and addresses from all accounts and compared
like-with-like, it would not be 100 per cent correct. But that did not
matter for direct marketing,' says Brian Leary, a director of Abbey
National. But now Abbey National wants to use the database for customer
service applications and Mr Leary is wrestling with the issue of improving
the accuracy - 'we have a residue of not particularly up-to-date data, which
we have to pull into shape. It's easy to see where we have to go, but it is
not easy to see how we get to it,' added Mr Leary.
He has tested software from Innovative Systems which aims to check the level
of accuracy by running the data through all possible permutations. But even
if Mr Leary goes ahead with a software check of the entire database, he
knows that further manual checks will be needed, in order to sort out the
finer differences with which the computer cannot cope.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Spoiled for choice - New
accounting systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the world of finance, company accounting and asset management accounting
systems are still the first and sometimes the only reason for investing in a
computer system. Those on their second, or even third generation of
accounting systems are suddenly facing a new set of problems, and have to
choose from a confusing range of products, writes Joia Shillingford.
Martin Cook, head of treasury administration and accounting at the
Nationwide Building Society, says: 'The main problem is an obvious one:
there are so many products to choose from; yet none covers all requirements.
Trying to find a system which will consolidate all positions and risks
globally is a big problem and systems which even approximate to this are
very complex.'
There are plenty of basic accounting systems, but few software houses have
the backing to develop software which provides the level of management
information companies now require. And because of the investment required,
it is hard for new companies to break into the market - 'typically, new
products only arrive on the scene after they have been developed by a user's
IT department or through close co-operation between a software house and a
user,' says Mr Cook.
Another problem is that accounting and asset management systems quickly go
out of date as more instruments become available for offsetting risk, credit
and cashflows globally. As a result, most people have a core accounting
system used in conjunction with a set of manual processes or add-on
software, sometimes developed in-house.
In Nationwide's treasury department, Ibis software running on an IBM AS/400
mid-range system provides basic accounting, reporting and settlement. A
system called Mica provides derivative pricing and risk management, while a
US product, Sandera, provides scenario modeling for the balance sheet. There
are electronic links between these systems, but most information is
delivered through Comshare's executive information system, Commander.
This provides senior managers with a graphical user interface through which
financial information is presented clearly. Commander gives managers the
ability to 'drill down' through additional screens to find out more about a
particular set of figures.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (4): Windows adds appeal -
Online Databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL recently, many users have rejected online information services as
time-consuming to learn and difficult to use. But this is starting to change
as suppliers add friendly interfaces to their products, or put them on
CD-ROM.
In this article, we look at some of the online information services on which
investors and analysts rely for their decision making, and their increasing
availability through graphical user interfaces and on compact discs:
The analyst
James Ross, telecoms analyst at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, has access to
several online databases from his desktop computer. He uses the Microsoft
Windows graphical user interface on his personal computer (PC) and can call
up the different services in separate Windows.
One of these is Reuter Company Newsyear, a newswire providing real-time
news. Stories can be selected, according to categories, such as telecoms.
Another is the London Stock Exchange's Topic database which gives the latest
share-price movements. Mr Ross also uses Reuter-Textline for background
information if he is researching a particular company, such as Cable &amp;
Wireless. This database provides articles from 300 titles.
He also uses Datastream, which provides share-price information; figures
from this can be loaded into a spreadsheet on his PC if he is producing a
financial model of a company.
However, if he is doing a very detailed search, Mr Ross will probably ask
Hoare Govett's library for assistance. They use a number of online databases
including, FT Profile, a business information database and online cuttings
library owned by the Financial Times, Perfect Information (press cuttings,
press releases and company news held as images of the original documents),
Dialog (a collection of databases with a US bias) and several CD-ROM
databases covering company financials.
The investor
Neil Sargent, an investment analyst at Sun Alliance, helps to manage funds
worth billions. He uses Topic and Reuter databases and the company's fund
management system takes feeds, such as Exshare securities and corporate
action data from Extel Financial.
The company library also provides access to a variety of other information
sources.
Merchant banker
Peter Kohl (son of German chancellor Helmut) works in corporate finance at
Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), specialising in deals which involve
German companies.
He uses the Hoppenstedt CD-ROM database which provides information on all
the large and medium-sized German companies which are relevant to his work.
Mr Kohl says: 'You can do a print out which gives you the company name,
products they make, subsidiaries and sales. The discs are updated four times
a year and east German companies are also covered. Lots of people here use
it.'
CSFB's library also uses a wide range of other online and CD-ROM databases
including Kompass (for company information).
Janet Matthews of database consultancy Janet Matthews Information Services,
believes that 'as younger executives move up the organisation, the number of
end-users (as opposed to librarians) using online databases, will improve.
This is partly because better interfaces to online databases are starting to
appear and partly because younger executives are used to computers.'
Windows interfaces
New Windows-based interfaces to online databases include Dow Vision on
Demand, the latest version of FT Profile Freeway, Reuters on demand and
Reuter Business Briefing. These products are designed to simplify the
process of connecting to a remote computer (which hosts the online
database); selecting publications, constructing searches; saving
information; transferring information into spreadsheet/WP files; and, in
some cases, repeating previously-used searches and monitoring and
controlling costs.
Janet Matthews says: 'One of their main benefits is that they help users
find the right sources, often by giving them a choice of subject areas.
Without such guidance, users tend to go for the sources they know, which
aren't always the best ones for what they want to find out.'
Databases on CD-ROM
A growing number of sources are now available on CD- ROM discs (like those
used for music) because of their vast storage capacity. These include
company financial information such as CD Europa, Lotus One Source,
Disclosure (information on US companies, SEC registrations, and so on) and
IDD Mergers &amp; Acquisitions.
CD-ROM titles have both advantages and drawbacks over linking up to an
online database hosted on a remote computer.
One advantage is that you don't have to dial up and spend money on the
telephone call - or rent a leased line if you use the database a lot.
Another advantage is that once you've paid for the discs, you can look up
information as often as you like without paying extra. You will, however,
need to add a CD-ROM drive to your PC to display the information.
The main drawback is that the information is not current.
However, it is possible to design a search using McCarthy (press cuttings),
the FT, The Economist, The Telegraph or The Independent on CD-ROM and
automatically transfer to FT Profile for the very latest information.
Another limitation is the difficulty of searching several publications at
once, although technology is starting to make this possible.
Despite the advent of the CD-ROM database and the graphical user interface,
Janet Matthews thinks database suppliers will still find it hard to win over
very busy people who haven't had to search through vast quantities of data
before.
These people won't be willing to take the time out or be forever dialing
into online databases. In the future there will be less call for dialing up
databases, she believes. People will log regular information requests with
database providers (eg 'send me everything on AT&amp;T and acquisitions') and
use the information that is downloaded to their PCs automatically to update
archival information.
Already companies, such as Individual Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, use
special 'relevance feedback' software to sift through mountains of articles,
delivering (by fax or electronic mail) only those which are of interest to
the user - 'in the end, the answer has to be in delivery rather than
interfaces,' says Janet Matthews.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): New dial-in services -
Big potential for 'smart phone' systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BANKS downsize their operations, they are turning to the telephone as a
way to provide a personal service without the overheads of a branch office.
On the surface, the telephone offers banks a means of providing more
customer services at relatively low cost. The technology is already in place
in people's homes, and all the bank has to do is develop the application.
And from the customer's viewpoint, it offers the convenience of dialling in
from home, at any time of day or night. Customers can do basic banking
functions just using the telephone keypad: by tapping in a password and
identity number, they can get access to several banking services, including
bill payment, money transfers and account balances.
Telephone banking today takes advantage of a technology known as computer
integrated telephony. One of the latest system is the Call Centre provided
by US manufacturer, Aspect Telecommunications. When a call comes in, the
Call Centre links to the bank's mainframe computer where account information
is stored. It checks the computer for the information requested by the
customer. The data bits are then converted to synthesised speech in order to
give the customer the answer.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is using the Call Centre in a trail service now
operating in three regions - Brighton, Preston and Dundee. It claims to have
10,000 customers signed up since the launch in February this year.
Take-up rates
Nigel Walsh, marketing director of electronic banking specialist, The
Software Partnership, claims that such high take-up rates are unusual. With
the exception of the Action Line service from Natwest Bank, which has
935,000 customers, few have developed to their full potential - 'most
systems in the UK have only attracted small numbers of customers, because
they were developed as trials only and were not promoted by the marketing
departments.'
There are technical reasons why this is so - 'in order to provide a
telephone banking service, the bank must do online processing in real time.
If there are large numbers of people accessing the system, that would
generate large numbers of transactions, and would require a lot of computing
power. The bank has to provide that at a high cost for no direct return,
unless the move is part of a wider strategy,' says Mr Walsh.
But he also points out that today's technology is restricted to a small
number of functions: ordering statements, paying bills, obtaining an account
balance. This is due to the limitations of the voice processing technology.
Services are presented to customers by means of an automated voice, which
asks them to press a number on the keypad relating to the service they want:
a long list of choices would baffle most customers.
However, the next generation of telephone banking systems will use a new
technology known as a smart phone. The smart phone looks like a phone with a
screen, but has a computer processor chip inside it. The phone can therefore
operate in the same way as a personal computer: information can be uploaded,
stored and downloaded, and the phone can even send faxes.
Smart phone products have been developed by the Dutch electronics company
Philips and by the Huntingdon Bank in the US. Another manufacturer known to
have product on the way is Canada's Northern Telecom. It is working closely
with software company Microsoft, which is keen to adapt its Windows graphic
user interface for telephony products.
The Huntingdon Bank phone, known as the SmarTel, was originally developed
jointly with US telephone company AT&amp;T, although AT&amp;T dropped out of the
project earlier this year. Based on an Intel-compatible 386 chip, it has a 4
x 6 ins. side-lit LCD touch-screen display. The touch screen is used to
manage all of the telephone transactions, using either icons or text
displays to provide a user-friendly interface. The firmware inside the phone
uses object oriented programming techniques to take the user logically
through the transaction.
The Philips product, called the Screen Phone has a small pop-up screen and
pull out key board. Inside is an NEC25 processor chip, compatible with the
Intel x86 family. This is less powerful than the 386 in the SmarTel, but
Philips is working on a 386-based design which will be ready in 1995. It
will also replace the key-board with a touch screen.
The on-screen menus on the smart phone will permit telephone banking
customers to to work through a range of services, which are limited only by
the imagination of the bank's marketing department - 'they will have
hundreds of menu screens to choose from,' says William Randle, director of
marketing and strategic planning at Huntingdon Bank.
Furthermore, the flexibility of the screen presentation will enable
customers to do much more than they can using today's voice response
systems. For example, they could view an entire statement and scroll through
it.
The Screen Phone will be marketed by Philips Home Services, a US subsidiary
of the Dutch company set up specifically for the project. The phone has been
on trial with the Post Bank in Holland, and with Citicorp in the US.
Citicorp is developing a range of services based on the product; the phone
is already on sale in US retail outlets for Dollars 639.
Philips quotes a UK retail price of Pounds 350, although the phone is still
pending BABT approvals.
The SmarTel, retailing at around Dollars 400, is being marketed directly by
the Huntingdon Bank to its customer base. One of the services offered is a
flexible form of bill payment, which lets customers make payments to anyone,
without needing to specify the payee's details in advance.
The bank will either pay electronically into the recipient's account, or it
can print out a cheque, depending on the instructions entered into the phone
by the customer.
'Today, 35 per cent of bills are typically paid electronically. We expect
that in four to five years from now, that number will rise to 70 per cent,'
says William Randle.

THE TIDE of euphoria that has buoyed Portugal since it joined the European
Community in 1986 is ebbing fast. The high growth rates of the late 1980s
have given way to recession, and the political stability which cemented
business confidence for more than a decade can no longer be taken for
granted.
The EC has lost its glitter as companies grapple with competition within a
single market. Unemployment is rising and foreign investors no longer find
the country almost irresistible.
'The pessimism that is gripping Portugal is a natural reaction to less
spectacular rates of growth,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based
partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'Portugal could not go on being
the star of European growth forever. The pace of economic development is
having to be reined in.'
One of the most telling signs of Portugal's economic slowdown was a massive
budgetary overrun in 1993.
This brought embarrassment for the centre-right Social Democrat government
of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and deep concern for the business
community.
In October, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, was forced to
announce a supplementary budget for 1993 because low tax revenue and higher
than forecast social security spending had almost doubled the budget deficit
compared with original forecasts.
This year's budget deficit is now forecast at Es1,000bn (Dollars 5.8bn), 8
per cent of gross domestic product, against an original forecast of Es576bn,
4.6 per cent of GDP.
The forecast deficit for 1994 is Es776 billion, 6.9 per cent of GDP. 'The
budget deficit is our most acute worry,' says Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of
the Bank of Portugal, the central bank. 'No governor can be happy with a 7
per cent deficit.'
Mr Beleza's dissatisfaction with budgetary performance appears to reflect a
sharp difference of opinion between the finance ministry and the central
bank over key areas of economic policy.
But Mr Braga de Macedo is far from bowed by the heavy deficit. He points out
that EC economies are forecast to contract by about 0.5 percentage point
this year - a far cry from earlier hopes that the 3 per cent growth rates of
the late 1980s could be maintained. Portugal will continue to out-perform
the Community as a whole, he points out, and the government remains
committed to the goal of economic convergence and to participation in
economic and monetary union (Emu), currently set for 1997 or 1999.
For the average Portuguese worker, there is a concrete goal behind the ideal
of convergence: wages moving towards the same level as those elsewhere in
Europe. In the heyday of Portuguese growth, the philosophy behind pay
negotiations was that wages could catch up with the rest of Europe, but that
objective has had to be put aside, at least temporarily, as the recession
bites.
'For our firms to remain competitive in the single market, we simply cannot
offer workers more than main trading partners such as Germany, Spain and
France,' says Mr Braga de Macedo.
In tense negotiations for a national wage pact in 1994, the government is
offering public administration employees a zero rise and others workers four
per cent.
The talks appear likely to collapse over a difference of half a percentage
point which is preventing unions, employers and government from reaching a
deal.
The convergence of wage levels is only one aspect of Portugal's relations
with the EC that is beginning to turn sour. The Portuguese have been fervent
Europeans since membership, and many vital new infrastructure projects bear
witness to the billions of Ecus that have poured in from Brussels since
1986.
But the opening of the single European market this year has brought industry
and, particularly, Portugal's backward agricultural sector face to face with
the reality of competition with far more advanced neighbours.
Trucks carrying Spanish pork have been attacked and fish, fruit and milk
dumped in the streets as farmers protest against cheaper, better quality
goods from abroad.
'The vast majority of the Portuguese are strongly pro-European,' says Mr
Antonio Guterres, the leader of the main opposition party, the Socialists.
'European policy is an area in which the two main parties are in basic
agreement.' But clearly Brussels is no longer seen only as the bountiful
provider it once used to be.
Socialist party policy differs only slightly from the Social Democrats in
other areas, too. This has undermined Mr Guterres' attempts to present the
Socialists as a clear alternative to the Social Democrats in government.
Critics say the Socialists are too fragmented and have failed to take
sufficient advantage of the Social Democrats' weaknesses to make a viable
bid for power.
The Socialist Party is also overshadowed by the figure of Mr Mario Soares,
the president of the republic and a former Socialist leader. The president
is often ironically referred to as the leader of the opposition.
As president Mr Soares is officially supposed to remain above party
politics. But in view of his capacity to veto government legislation, to
send laws to the constitutional court for vetting and to expose social ills
in his tours of the country, the president is often seen by the prime
minister as one of the forcas de bloqueio, or opposing forces, that are
supposedly hampering the government's reform programme.
By the time of the next general election in 1995, Mr Cavaco Silva will have
ruled Portugal with an overall parliamentary majority for a decade. The key
question is whether he can win a third consecutive majority, particularly in
a markedly less favourable economic climate.
In two recent television debates, the prime minister polled only a 45 per
cent approval rating against 80 per cent for Mr Guterres. The next real test
of the two main parties' standing will come in local elections in December,
when the Socialists will be fighting to hold on to Lisbon, Oporto, and other
cities which they won in a backlash vote against Mr Cavaco Silva in the last
election.
As voters face up to economic realities, their attention is likely to turn
away from new motorways, bridges, and shiny bank frontages, built during the
years of economic expansion, to the state of Portugal's health, education
and social security systems.
The lack of resources for improving these services will influence the
electorate, says Mr Cunningham.
Many analysts think it is unlikely the Social Democrats will win a third
overall majority, and believe they will be forced into coalition with a
small right-wing party.
But gloom and uncertainty are not universal sentiments in Portugal. A
thriving cultural scene has blossomed with economic development, led by a
younger generation less concerned with politics than their predecessors of
the 1970s and early 1980s.
Lisbon has been elected European Capital of Culture in 1994. Four years
later the city will stage a Universal Exhibition. If all goes to plan, Expo
'98 will transform derelict dock lands to the east of the city into a
thriving centre of the arts.
By then - provided the Portuguese and EC economies have attained higher
growth rates - the country should have something to celebrate.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): Cost-consciousness takes
control - The growth in investment in new technology tends to camouflage a
measure of disillusionment with the results of computerisation which may
curb budgets in future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE global financial services industry has continued to invest strongly in
computer technology despite deep recession and economic uncertainty in its
principal markets.
The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates that spending on information
technology by US banks had a compound annual growth rate of 8.4 per cent in
the decade between 1980 and 1990 with little sign of slackening in the early
1990s. Non-interest expenses on the other hand, grew at only 4.7 per cent.
Figures for the UK compiled by Price Waterhouse, the management consultants,
suggest a growth rate of 7.5 per cent between last year and this. These are
somewhat below the most aggressive growth rates of the 1980s, but the banks,
building societies, trusts and insurance companies remain the computer
industry's prime customers.
To some extent, financial services companies have little choice but to
continue to upgrade their computer systems. Their back office accounting
systems demand an annual increases in raw processing power of up to 40 per
cent. Add the newer, front office applications and the numbers become very
large indeed.
In the banks' favour, however, is the fact that the real cost of computing
power continues to fall rapidly. BCG estimates that over the decade of the
1980s, the cost per unit of capacity fell by 90 per cent.
The actual sums spent, however, can be very large amounting, in a big bank,
to four per cent or more of revenues. In 1992, according to Information Week
magazine, JP Morgan had an IT budget of Dollars 625m, some 6.1 per cent of
revenues. Banc One, the innovative Ohio-based bank, spent Dollars 390m, 6.5
per cent of its Dollars 5.9bn revenues. In Europe, Paribas spent Dollars
914m out of revenues of Dollars 21bn while in the UK National Westminster
spent Dollars 835m spent on revenues of Pounds 18bn.
The growth in investment, however, tends to camouflage a measure of
disillusionment with the results of computerisation which may curb budgets
in future. BCG earlier this year surveyed IT spending in 12 banks, six in
Europe, five in the US and one in Australasia. All were large, well-managed
institutions with a good record in information technology. Yet BCG concluded
that up to 40 per cent of the money they were spending on IT was of low
value.
Six of the banks, for example, gave examples of significant project failures
or disappointments which in total cost more than Dollars 100m. Eight of them
said that there were more successes than failures in 'leading edge' projects
where either the technology or the application was stretching the boundaries
of experience.
It is not surprising therefore than in the cost-conscious 1990s, Price
Waterhouse should conclude that new and emerging technologies are not at the
top of most IT directors' wish lists - 'rather, the cost-wary IT director of
1992/93 seems more concerned with providing a reliable, proven, flexible and
maintainable system solution to a business problem than in providing
'competitive advantage through leading-edge technology.' Competitive
advantage, the watch words of the eighties, have been tempered in favour of
cost-containment.'
Mr Simon Farmbrough and David Marsh of BCG have produced a list of 'golden
rules' to help financial services companies get better value from their IT
investments.
'Do not commission IT projects,' they warn, going on to explain that what
should be commissioned is a system to exploit a business opportunity. 'We
commissioned a customer database project - we should have commissioned a
cross-selling initiative,' bemoaned one bank's chief information officer.
They point to one bank which tried to develop a system to monitor
profitability at the level of individual customers. It required a new
mainframe-based, bank-wide information design: Dollars 50m and three years
later, it is still under development. Another bank, meanwhile, went for
segment profitability at the strategic level using personal computers. Its
initiative was implemented in 12 months at a cost of Dollars 1m and is
already bringing benefits.
FARMBROUGH and Marsh are especially hard on banks which neither attempt to
quantity the benefits from a project nor assign responsibility to managers
for faults and failures. They are in no doubt that the potential for benefit
from well-aligned IT investments is huge, but that profiting from them is a
management issue, not a technical one. Some technologies, however, seem
likely to confer significant benefits over the next few year. One of the
more important is object-oriented programming or OOP. In essence, it is a
technique which makes it possible to re-use pieces of computer code rather
than developing them from scratch each time.
OOP offers a way out of the trap of 'legacy' systems which imprison so many
companies. Legacy systems were developed in old technologies which are too
inflexible to adapt to modern market demands.
According to Price Waterhouse: 'IT directors feel hamstrung by the age,
complexity and poor integration of existing systems. These systems soak up
scarce resources and inhibit a fast response to business needs, but there is
little funding to replace them. A classic Catch-22 situation.'
Some companies are moving rapidly to solve the problem. There can be few
international bankers who have never encountered Midas, the venerable
banking system developed by BIS, now part of the ACT group. Written first in
the 1970s, it has had its face lifted a number of times. Now, however, the
latest additions to the system are being developed using object-oriented
programming methods developed by a small UK company Softwright Systems and
the computer giant International Business Machines. The idea is that, over
time, Midas will become in its entirety an object-oriented system, extending
its useful life beyond 2000.
A decade ago, financial institutions had to decide how to respond to the
challenge of the personal computer after years of centralised processing. In
retrospect, that was merely the thin edge of the wedge. Today, the situation
is more complex. Among the technologies such as object orientation which
have to be taken into account are client-server computing, graphical user
interfaces, opens systems and artificial intelligence.
All of these are essential to what is becoming known as business process
re-engineering, recreating new business infrastructures to meet business
needs of increasing flexibility and responsiveness.
Opening this year's Sibos conference, Mr Eric Chilton, newly appointed
chairman of Swift, the interbank payments messaging system, warned:
'Re-engineering is not adapting old methodologies to the changing
environment. It is rather a fundamental reappraisal of the whole end-to-end
process. This requires dramatic change and complete rethinking.'
Many the world's financial institutions are already rethinking their
strategies as they prepare for the business environment of the late 1990s.
In this process, technology is the means rather than the end. Technological
bravado is going out of fashion like winking lights on computer cabinets.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Monday Interview: Gaze fixed on the far horizon - Takashi
Imai, president of Nippon Steel, talks to Robert Thomson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Nippon Steel announced it was shedding 7,000 employees, the common
interpretation last week was that the world's leading steelmaker was
reacting to recession. As the architect of the plan, Mr Takashi Imai was
irritated that his company should be assumed to be thinking short term, when
he believes that Japan is in the middle of a far deeper restructuring, not
just a recession.
Mr Imai has spent his first few months as president scrutinising the
hierarchy of Nippon Steel, spotting the flaws and inefficiencies hindering
long-term profitability. Around him, Japan has acquired a new government;
some of the country's stronger companies, including his own, have slipped
into the red; and the yen has risen to nearly Y100 to the dollar - that is,
parity with the cent.
'For the steel industry, the present downturn is far more severe than seven
years ago. Then, it was the appreciation of the yen, but also the
depreciation of the dollar against most currencies,' says Mr Imai, referring
to exchange rate movements after the Plaza Accord of 1985. 'Now, the yen has
appreciated by 20 per cent against the dollar, but it has also appreciated
against the D-Mark, the Korean won and other currencies.'
The higher yen means that Japanese steel companies lose export market share,
and it also hurts two of their largest domestic customers, the electronics
and car industries. Meanwhile, says Mr Imai, the excesses of the late 1980s,
when stock prices rose to dizzy heights and companies expanded well beyond
their means and expertise, have added to the economic woes.
'We could see the signs of downturn from 1991, and we started an inventory
adjustment (or a reduction in stocks), but our customers were somewhat
delayed in adjusting their inventory,' says Mr Imai. The implication is that
other companies would be in a better position had they done the same as
Nippon Steel, which tends to see itself as the natural leader of industry.
There is a hint of the self-conscious industrial trend-setter when Mr Imai
describes his plans to revise the management structure of his company,
saying it needs to make 'crystal clear' its systems of responsibility and
decision making.
An emphasis within the company on reaching consensus means an endless round
of consultations at all levels of the corporate hierarchy, delaying
important decisions and diluting responsibility. Mr Imai does not want to
decide everything, but he wants to be able to identify who should take
responsibility for a decision.
'We have so many management levels that we must go through to make one
decision. When you look at the production side, the superintendent of the
steel works does not have concrete targets. And when you look at the sales
side, they should have concrete targets, but they do not,' he says.
'I want to minimise the size of head office, and I want to abolish the
tedious vertical system of decision making. Under the president, we have an
executive vice-president, managing director, general manager, deputy general
manager and so on, but authority is not clearly delegated.'
Mr Imai has experienced the complexity of the hierarchy, having taken 41
years to climb to the top, and serving previously as executive
vice-president. Nippon Steel was created when Fuji merged with Yawata Steel
in 1970, and executives from the two companies have since taken turns as
president.
Mergers are rarely seamless in Japan, and the alternating presidency is a
sign of how difficult it is to leave the past behind. The company has also
been criticised from within for devoting too much energy to acting on behalf
of Japan's steel industry, and not enough to expanding its own market share,
though it is expected to be more aggressive under Mr Imai.
He acquired experience of different management styles when he was in charge
of ordering raw materials in his early years at Nippon Steel, negotiating
iron ore deals in Australia, coal agreements in Siberia and mining ventures
in Brazil. To complete his education in management, he spent the last few
years overseeing the financial operations, corporate planning, and the
company's diversification into electronics.
His fondness for strategy is reflected in an enthusiasm for Go, a Chinese
board game in which players plot to surround their opponents' pieces, and he
has a reputation for loyalty to managers who have served with him.
Promises will be kept, he stresses, in dealing with the 7,000 workers in the
steel division who will lose their jobs. They will be transferred to
subsidiaries and affiliates - 'we have 200 companies in which we have a
stake' - and his company will pay the difference if these smaller companies
pay lower wages.
Nippon Steel cannot afford such benevolence indefinitely, as it is
forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y15bn for the first half from April to
September, and a similar annual loss. The figures have prompted Mr Imai not
only to reform the management structure, but also to look differently at the
core workforce. In good times, staff numbers have tended to expand rapidly,
and tradition has compelled the company to keep these workers. This has left
Nippon Steel with a 'bulge' that takes many years to be worked out of the
system.
Did you know, asks Mr Imai, clearly surprised himself by the figure, that
Nippon Steel took on 5,000 people in one good year, 1962 - equal to almost
10 per cent of the entire steel division? 'We hired so many people. When you
look at the structure of the company you can see quite a big bulge from that
year.' It is his intention to beat the bulges by halving the graduate
intake, and relying more on a new type of seasonal worker.
His theory is that the current drive to deregulate Japanese industry will
dislodge workers from inefficient sectors such as distribution, which have
layer upon layer of middlemen, each taking their cut. This new pool of
potential employees will be tapped by Nippon Steel and other companies when
needed, but there will be an understanding that, in tough times, they will
be laid off.
The core workers will receive the traditional treatment. They will be
rotated around the company to broaden experience, and a commitment to
lifetime employment will be made and kept.
Mr Imai's proposal would create a two-tier system of employment, and
presumes that unemployment in Japan will be higher than the present 2.6 per
cent. However, Mr Imai's past experiences in searching for natural resources
have given him a sense that the wealth of his resource-poor country is
fragile and deep reforms are needed to keep Japan competitive.
'In the US in the 1980s, it was presumed that jobs lost in production would
be found in the service sector, but that did not happen and we don't want to
repeat that pattern. In Japan, we can't supply ourselves with enough energy
and food, and we must earn enough through exports to cover import costs. We
have to make products that are competitive. We have to fill the gap of
jobs.'
In the shorter term, Japanese steel companies must confront a listless
domestic market. The automotive and electronics industries have matured, and
are now selling to saturated markets, reducing demand for steel: 'We are
looking for some other industries that will replace these industries as a
source of demand, but we haven't been able to find them.'
Political scandal has also shaken the steel industry, which relies on
construction companies for about 50 per cent of sales. Executives from five
large construction companies have been arrested for alleged involvement in
the bribery of provincial politicians, and building projects are being
suspended or shelved. Although construction accounts for only 30 per cent of
Nippon Steel's sales, it still hurts in a difficult year.
'I am confident that the Japanese economy will eventually recover from
recession,' says Mr Imai. But his longer-term proposals for Nippon Steel,
its management structure and workforce will set in motion changes from which
the old corporate structure may never recover.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If there is a fashionable new buzz idea these days, it is the globalisation
of the world economy. Ultra-liberals inevitably think it is an unmitigated
blessing; the rest of us may wonder at the political and social price we are
already paying.
Imperious reality is not in doubt, however. The internationalisation of
world finance is overwhelming the old demarcations between national
financial markets. The competition of low-cost, high-tech producers in Asia
is challenging the survival of slower-moving traditional producers in Europe
and the US. And global competitive pressures threaten to sweep away Europe's
costly social welfare systems.
The political implications are disturbing. Democracy is more or less
established in the west, and precariously foisted on other parts of the
world, apart from China. Yet the globalisation of economics undermines the
ability of democratic governments even to influence the essential conditions
affecting their voters.
Key factors are, in the short run, the interest rate policy of the
Bundesbank, in the long run, the harvesting of the rain forests of Brazil;
in neither case can democratically elected national governments affect the
outcome.
The answer to this mis-match between the traditional nation state and the
modern global economy, according to David Held*, professor of politics at
the Open University, is to extend active democracy up the international
hierarchy, from the nation state to the global system.
The starting point for what Mr Held terms 'the cosmopolitan model of
democracy' would be a far-reaching reform of the United Nations, including
the creation of a second UN chamber, compulsory jurisdiction for the
International Court, and the establishment of a small, accountable,
international police force.
Mr Held makes no attempt to deny the immense conceptual and practical
difficulties of such an internationalisation of democracy. But to say that
his ideas are utopian is not a serious objection: only a utopian would have
imagined the creation of the UN, the World Bank or the European Community,
only a utopian would have predicted the collapse of communism, and only a
utopian would have imagined the information revolution which is at the root
of the globalisation of the world economy.
The trouble with Mr Held's ideas is not that they are over-optimistic, but
that they are over-global. The nation state will remain for the foreseeable
future the fundamental building block of democratic politics. The problem he
identifies is a crisis of loss of national political effectiveness, and
therefore loss of democratic legitimacy. But only part of the solution lies
in the creation of new institutions at global or regional level: the more
urgent practical tasks are, first, to make national democracies work better
and, second, to improve co-operative democracy between local groups of
states.
In the EC, for example, there is a glaring problem of political legitimacy,
which showed up in the national ratification debates on Maastricht. But
contrary to the usual Euro-babble, it has virtually nothing to do with the
shortfall in the powers of the European Parliament, and everything to do
with the inadequate legitimacy of national political systems. Voters do not
trust national politicians, and above all they do not trust them to
safeguard the national interest in dealing with Europe.
With the politicians we have, there may be no way of regaining that trust.
But there is a sure way of forfeiting it: to persist in a voting system in
the European Council of Ministers that gives several times as much weight to
the interests of a Luxembourger as to those of an Italian or German.
No national democracy would tolerate such inequality in constituencies or
voting weights for national elections; and unless the Community starts to
think in terms of real voters, rather than in terms of artificially weighted
member states, the entire operation will be closed down by the German
constitutional court, and quite right too.
This is an indication of the Community's development. In 1958 it was
essential to protect the little member states; today it is essential to
protect the voters.
The same principle applies to Northern Ireland; but the solution is quite
the reverse. Britain and Ireland are both being held to ransom by two
infinitesimally tiny minorities. The power of these barbarous extremists
does not really come from bombs and guns, but from the belief, relentlessly
fostered by every British politician, that this is a political system where
the winner takes all. The IRA believes that one last murder will make Ulster
wholly and permanently Irish; the UDA that one last murder will keep Ulster
wholly and permanently British.
There is only one logical strategy for defeating the murderers; and that is
a treaty between Britain and Ireland, which would virtually amount to a
condominium over the province's future, and which would rule out, for ever,
the feasibility of winner-take-all.
Some people would say that proportionality and democracy should be extended
not just upwards to the UN and the EC, but downwards to the nation states;
for example, to Britain's national electoral system. But, of course, that is
just the absurd imagining of people who do not understand the deep beauty of
British democracy.

FT  08 NOV 93 / New Zealanders turn the tables: The electorate could take
only so much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
When choice comes down to the devil or the deep blue sea, it is time to
change the ground-rules. That, at any rate, was the message emanating from
New Zealand on Saturday night - and it should give 'free market' reformers
the world over pause for thought.
Throughout this election, New Zealanders have been in a bind. Nine years
ago, they voted in a Labour government which radically overhauled the
country's economic structures and institutions. It did away with decades of
heavy protectionism, deregulated financial markets, and began a stream of
privatisations. In 1990, the electorate switched allegiance to the National
Party, which attacked the country's cradle-to-grave welfare system,
replacing 'universalism' with targeted arrangements aimed at aiding the most
needy.
Both governments acted in the name of international competitiveness and
financial prudence, and the speed and extent of New Zealand's reforms won
widespread approbation overseas. But many New Zealanders view the results
differently. They see high unemployment; a rising crime rate which,
arguably, is associated with the teenage jobless figures; hospital
waiting-lists; and deteriorating access to decent education.
So, now that the politicians have changed everything else, New Zealanders
have decided to change the politicians.
Not just the faces, but the entire way of conducting politics. The one
decisive vote delivered on Saturday night was for a 'mixed member
proportional' electoral system to replace the British-style,
'first-past-the-post' arrangement. Under MMP, the single-chamber parliament
will be enlarged from 99 to 120 seats, but only half the incumbents will
represent specific electorates. The remainder will be drawn from party
lists, so that the composition of parliament overall reflects the popular
vote.
MMP was endorsed this weekend despite a massive advertising campaign by its
opponents. Virtually all parts of the country were supportive. Moreover, the
MMP decision came after an abnormally high voter turnout.
It is easy to see why MMP, for all its obvious frailties, has triumphed.
Under the new system, New Zealanders have been told, two things will happen.
First, minority parties who get a significant share of the popular vote will
find that they have corresponding representation in parliament. Second, and
largely because of this, a process of consensus politics will have to
evolve.
This, in turn, should prevent the high-handed behaviour displayed by the two
main parties over the past nine years. Both National and Labour pushed
through their reforms without having a majority of the popular vote.
Neither, moreover, had fully declared their intentions beforehand.
Unfortunately, by also delivering a hung parliament under the current
first-past-the-post rules, New Zealanders have ensured that consultative
government starts this morning, rather than with an MMP election in three
years' time. This will be messy - though quite how messy is hard to
determine at this stage.
For a start, the final count has yet to be established. Because of the
number of New Zealanders working overseas, 'special votes' account for about
10 per cent of the total cast. It will be another two weeks before these
results are added in. But some seats, held on wafer-thin margins at present,
could change hands as a result. A majority of under 400 votes pertains in
nine electorates, and in the case of Auckland's Birkenhead, it is just 34.
Second, it is unclear what structure of alliances - if any - will be worked
out between National and Labour, and the two minority parties which have a
couple of seats each. Jim Anderton, whose Alliance party won 18.7 per cent
of the popular vote, says that he will not 'frustrate the party that has the
most seats from governing'. Even so, given the party differences over
welfare issues and labour market reform, many pundits suspect that a
confidence vote is eventually inevitable.
The simplest solution would be to call another election under the new MMP
rules immediately. For practical reasons, this is not an option. Boundary
lines must be redrawn; rules drawn up to govern the party lists; Maori
voters re-enrolled and the number of Maori seats determined. All this, it is
estimated, will take at least 18 months - although some think the timetable
is unnecessarily long. So if New Zealanders were looking for stability, they
have shot themselves in the foot.
But the rest of the world, so envious of New Zealand's rapid reform process,
may like to reflect on the election's lessons. The situation was undoubtably
unusual, in that both of the main parties were responsible for jerking a
once-regulated economy into the 'free market' regime, and hence associated
in voters' minds with the less palatable aspects of this process.
Nevertheless, the message is clear: voters will stomach only so much
upheaval, before demanding results.
Mr Bolger, National's leader, plainly knew this. At one point during the
campaign he was asked what conclusions should be drawn from Kim Campbell's
swingeing defeat in the Canadian elections. 'If you don't deliver jobs and
growth, you're down the gurgler,' he replied. His party has delivered a
little of both - although the unemployment rate has only just moved into
single-digit figures, and the more commendable growth figures have centred
on the export sector, with domestic benefits being slow to follow through.
As a result, he is still hanging on to power. But only just.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Dollar in focus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING US employment figures at the end of last week are set to
underpin the dollar while the D-Mark could experience continued pressure.
The release of the non-farm payroll data for October resulted in a choppy
performance for the US currency on Friday. But the impact of investors
taking profits and squaring their book was exaggerated by thin volumes.
Several economists hope the improved job figures will be reinforced by this
week's data on producer and consumer prices tomorrow and Wednesday. Also,
Friday's retail sales statistics will show how much demand is picking up in
the nation's stores.
There is a growing feeling that the dollar could hold comfortably between
DM1.70 and DM1.7250, which is seen as the next significant resistance point
on the way up. It could also gain ground against the yen as the worries over
the Japanese economy percolate through to the currency.
In the UK, speculation on the Budget and its potential impact on financial
markets is likely to increase.
Sterling has performed well against the D-Mark and against the index of
leading currencies although it has slipped against the dollar. Its strength
stems partly from the weakness of the D-Mark as investors decide that the
Bundesbank is in rate cutting mood.
By contrast there has been a slight drop in expectations of an early UK
interest rate cut.
Last week there were conflicting signals from the government. On one hand,
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, attempted to dampen speculation of easier
monetary conditions.
However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, hinted at the the need for
increased taxes. Economists believe that any tax hike will have to be
complemented by lower interest rates.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Risk and Reward: Futures funds say art of people-picking
crucial to success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNOR MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSET allocation can have just as much to do with selecting the right money
manager as with picking the right assets. This is especially true of managed
futures funds, where the right mix of commodity trading advisers (CTAs) and
their trading strategies is considered crucial. Indeed, many see the CTA as
a fund manager's most important asset.
'The way a derivatives fund manager buys the skill level of a trading
adviser is analogous to a mutual fund manager buying the earnings growth
potential of a stock,' explained Mr Jeffrey Brown, a portfolio manager with
RefcoFund Holdings Corporation in New York.
But people-picking, like stock-picking, can be complex, involving in-depth
quantitative and qualitative research. The search for the optimal mix of
CTAs has spawned a variety of systems, detailing the advisers' trading
methodology, historic returns and losses, as well as their programmes'
volatility, to be used as an indication of their likely future performance.
Among the most widely used adviser selection tools are software packages,
such as LaPorte Asset Allocation from Burlington Hall Asset Management,
Refco's Derivative Adviser Database and Tass Management's TASS 2.
CTAs are professional managers who make trading or investment decisions for
managed futures funds. Their approach tends to be either systematic  - using
programmes and models that generate buy and sell signals - or discretionary,
relying mainly on CTAs' experience and judgment.
CTAs' strategies are based broadly on two types of analysis: fundamental
analysis - which takes account of external factors that may affect the
supply and demand for a particular security and its price - or technical
analysis, which studies market prices themselves.
There are diversified CTAs who trade a number of markets ranging from
livestock to interest-rate futures,and specialised CTAs who invest only in
specific sectors, say currencies or energy products.
(Advisers are typically paid a fixed management fee - usually between 2 and
4 per cent of the assets managed - and a so-called incentive fee, usually
some 20 per cent of the trading profits.)
Finding a good CTA is one thing; getting the mix right is another. To
minimise the volatility - and risk - of their portfolios, most futures fund
managers like to match CTAs whose past performances have a low or negative
correlation to each other. The idea is that traders who are making money
will offset those who are not, making for an overall steady, low-risk
performance.
'If there is a high correlation between traders, they'll all lose or win at
the same time,' said Mr Richard Wilkie, director of asset allocation at
Heinold Asset Management in Chicago, which uses some 35 CTAs to manage 28
futures funds. He employs LaPorte to select CTAs, but applies his own
software to find the 'final perfect mix'.
Some fund managers feel that analysing historical performance is not enough.
'Quantitative analysis only looks at what's happened in the past,' but does
not necessarily say much about the future, said Mr William Taki, co-chief
executive at the Chicago-based fund management firm MC Baldwin.
One of MC Baldwin's derivatives portfolios - a private offshore fund
totalling more than Dollars 100m - overweights the discretionary approach,
which is hard to quantify but allows a more dynamic strategy where traders
take views on changing markets. In addition, the fund is heavily
diversified, which helps spread the risk.
The fund was boosted this summer by its involvement in European and US
interest rate markets. Early in the year, it also increased its allocations
to diversified traders in the hope of gains in areas such as metals and
agriculture.
'We remained concerned about the possible impact that unexpected events
could have on the fund and we placed more emphasis on hands-on managers and
broadened the number of advisers in a further effort to reduce risk,' Taki
said.
The portfolio has produced an annual return of 22.65 per cent and a maximum
monthly draw-down - the decline in performance from peak to trough - of
roughly 2.5 per cent in the past 12 months.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Japanese Bonds: Yields reach six-year low after investors
switch out of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFUSION surrounding the listing of East Japan Railway and the
consequent fall in Japanese shares were good news for bond traders, as the
No 145 10-year benchmark yield fell to a six-year low of 3.44 per cent last
week supported by investors opting for bonds rather than stocks.
Pessimism on the Japanese economy was also fuelled by the failure of
Muramoto Construction, the largest bankruptcy in post-war history, and a
spate of weak corporate earnings reports.
The rally in Japanese government bonds is likely to receive further support
in the near term from bleak corporate interim results and a further
deterioration in confidence among stock-market investors.
The Bank of Japan is expected to allow short-term interest rates to remain
low to support share prices but profit-taking by investors looking to cover
losses on stock holdings may hamper a sharp rise in bond prices.
About 240 companies are scheduled to release half-year results this week,
including leading steel companies and video game makers. The results are
likely to confirm the bleak outlook on corporate profits. Ms Tomoko Fujii,
an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo believes such factors will support
the bond market and expects the benchmark yield to fall a further 10 basis
points in the near term.
Meanwhile, this week's negotiations over political reform between Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and opposition parties will be
crucial to the passing of the reform bill in parliament.
A large income tax cut is expected, aimed at helping to pull the Japanese
economy out of recession.
However, until the opposition parties and the government can come to an
agreement over the political reform bill, Mr Hosokawa will not be able to
make a decision over further fiscal stimulus.
Economists point out that a tax cut of more than Y5,000bn will help the
economy recover and may prompt profit-taking by bond traders.
Mr Geoffrey Barker of Baring Securities in Tokyo is urging investors to take
profits because he believes that factors such as the strong yen and the
surge in the US Treasury market, which have supported the recent rally, are
likely to disappear in the near future.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Weakness in US Treasuries starts a
flood of new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS investors were thinking about shutting up shop early as one of the
most profitable years in the Eurobond market draws to a close, they have
suddenly been faced with an avalanche of new issues as borrowers make a
last-minute dash to the market.
The weakness in the US Treasury market, which has also shaken investor
confidence in the European government bond markets, has prompted fears that
the time to raise funds at current low interest rates is running out fast.
However, since investors are increasingly reluctant to blot their copy-books
at such a late stage in the year, issuers may well have to pay a higher
yield than they planned to ensure a successful placement of their bonds.
Investors are likely to be able to take their pick of a wide range of
offerings this week. In the French franc sector, Electric Power Development
Co, the Japanese government-guaranteed agency, is expected to make a rare
appearance with a FFr1.1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds. The yield
spread on EPDC's bonds, which will mark the issuer's first deal in the
French franc sector since 1987, is likely to be in the high teens.
Depfa, the German mortgage bank which has been active in the Eurobond market
in recent weeks, is due to launch its well-flagged offering of 10-year
bonds, which should raise between FFr2bn and FFr3bn. The yield spread is
expected to be in the low 20s.
The Spanish autonomous region of Andalucia has had to lower its sights as a
result of the increased activity in the French franc sector. It had hoped to
achieve a yield spread of between 35 and 40 basis points for its forthcoming
FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds. But syndicate managers now expect
Andalucia to pay between 43 and 45 basis points over French government
bonds.
Other issues which should emerge this week include a Dollars 500m 10-year
offering from BAT Industries, an issue of the same amount but with a
five-year maturity from Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, and a Pounds 200m
credit-card securitisation from Standard Chartered Bank.
The market is also limbering up for a large yen offering from the Republic
of Italy, which could raise as much as Y300bn. The offering could be
launched in the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for
foreign borrowers.
There is strong demand among domestic Japanese investors for bonds offering
a margin over the Japanese bond market's current low yields. This has led to
a considerable erosion in the spreads which foreign borrowers have to pay.
For example, on Friday, the Republic of Turkey achieved relatively
aggressive pricing for its two Samurai deals, which raised a total of Y80bn.
It paid Libor plus 90 basis points for the Y30bn five-year tranche and Libor
plus 140 basis points for the Y50bn tranche, which has an eight-year
maturity.
The acceleration in new issue volume has taken the spotlight off the
high-quality Spanish borrowers scheduled to tap the Eurobond market in the
coming weeks. But these offerings are expected to be snapped up because of
the market's favourable perception of Spain and the relative low supply of
Spanish debt.
Andalucia's French franc offering could come early this week. The Basque
Country is hosting a presentation for investors in Zurich on November 15,
which is expected to be followed by an SFr150m - SFr200m offering with a
maturity of between seven and 10 years.
Instituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's state industrial holding company,
hopes for a spread of between 37 and 42 basis points on its pending Dollars
500m offering, which is likely to have a five-year maturity.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Investors take European
profits - The prospects for government bonds after last week's turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RETREAT in European bond prices triggered by last week's sell-off in the
US Treasuries market appears to have been prompted more by a desire to
realise profits than by a fundamental change of sentiment.
There was a valid case for selling US bonds because of stronger economic
data and expectations of rising short-term interest rates next year. But why
should Europe suffer? Further cuts in short-term rates are still expected
throughout Europe, and these are likely to pull bond yields down again.
Continued economic weakness is keeping inflationary pressures at bay. And,
apart from the UK, most European countries appear to be lagging the US
economic cycle by several years.
'There is still value in European bonds. Friday's sell-off was quite
dramatic and it may well be a chance to buy,' said Mr Jonathon Davies, a
bond analyst at UBS.
The main reason for selling European bonds last week seemed to be that
investors and traders want to lock in the phenomenal profits they have made
so far this year.
According to JP Morgan's government bond index, Spanish and Italian bonds
provided total returns of around 28 per cent for the first 10 months of the
year.
These markets suffered most severely in last week's sell off, which pushed
10-year Spanish bond yields up by about 30 basis points to 8 3/4 per cent
and 10-year Italian yields up by 40 basis points to 9.56 per cent.
Mr Rob Gambi, manager of international fixed interest and currencies at AMP
Asset Management in London, said that he had moved funds out of the Italian
bond market 'on the basis that it had hit our target for the whole year,'
and because the market can become illiquid when it starts to fall.
Looking ahead, however, he thinks that the Italian market is still a good
buy.
Even after last week's sell-off, most bond fund managers are still
overweight in European bonds.
'We would certainly see it as a temporary correction (in European bond
prices),' said Mr Gordon Ross, director of investments at Lombard Odier
Investment Management, the Swiss bank's London-based fund management arm.
Some markets, like Germany, ended the week only fractionally lower, as
investors switched into bunds in search of a safe haven.
Moreover, the decline in bond prices was frequently led by sales of futures
contracts, according to traders.
Nervous fund managers who sold futures contracts to protect themselves
against further price falls did not necessarily sell bonds.
'There have been a lot of hedging trades, so a lot of downward pressure has
come through the futures market,' said Mr Davies.
Price declines have also been concentrated in the longer maturities.
Because the most actively-traded bonds in most markets have maturities of 10
years or longer, these bonds tend to be the focus of attention. However, the
short end of the market fared much better.
For example, the yield on five-year gilts was unchanged at around 6.15 per
cent at the end of last week, while 10-year gilt yields backed up from 6.84
to 6.93 per cent.
This steepening of the yield curve was evident in most markets.
Many investors believe that in the last leg of the European bond market
rally, the short end of the market will benefit from any further rate cuts
more than the long end of the market, causing yield curves to steepen.
Shorter-dated bonds are seen also seen as more defensive in volatile market
conditions.
'We are approaching the end of the calendar year and there is a general
tendency to reduce risk,' said one fund manager. 'We are still very long
Europe, but we are looking at shortening duration in Denmark and France.'
However, it is not all plain-sailing. Further selling of US Treasuries would
continue to drag down European bond prices.
Low rates in the US have prompted a huge inflow of funds from US money
market and bond funds this year. Any reversal of that flow is undoubtedly
bad news for Europe's bond markets.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Gilts: Conflicting data to push yields sideways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH worries about UK inflation relatively muted over the past few weeks,
gilt investors will be watching for signs from data due later today that
price pressures are picking up.
According to City estimates, data about new credit being taken on by
consumers will indicate higher overall demand, which could push down gilt
prices at the long end of the yield curve.
Figures on how much manufacturers are increasing prices of finished products
at the wholesale level could, however, illustrate a continuation of economic
weakness.
The overall result is likely to push gilt prices sideways, after the
excitement of Friday when yields rose along the curve on the back of the
large sell-off in US Treasury bonds.
Over the week as a whole, yields of gilts maturing in seven years or less
eased on the belief that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut bank
base rates, held at 6 per cent since January, around the time of the Budget
on November 30.
While yields of these types of gilts came down by up to 10 basis points,
longer dated instruments saw a yield rise of about 5 basis points, largely
as a result of weaknesses in other important bond markets overseas.
On Friday night, 15-year gilts were yielding about 7 per cent. If
expectations about low UK inflation over the next year are to be believed,
yields of this sort make the instruments good value. This could stimulate
some buying pressure later this week.
City analysts are expecting new consumer credit in September to come out at
about Pounds 225m, a relatively high number which would be the same as the
one for August.
They are pencilling in a figure of 4 per cent for the year- on-year increase
to last month in prices of manufactured goods at the factory gate, after a
4.2 per cent rise in the 12 months to September.
Attention will also focus on figures coming out on Friday on the change in
manufacturing output in September. Economists are looking for a small rise
on the month, which would compensate for an unexpectedly high 0.4 per cent
decline in output in August.
A rise in output of 0.5 per cent or higher for September could trigger some
selling off of gilts. especially at the longer end of the curve.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Fear overcomes greed in the
US - The prospects for government bonds after last week's turmoil
</HEADLINE>

FEAR, at last, overcame greed in the US bond market last week. After a
fortnight of uncertainty about how much longer the bull run could last, the
bears emerged triumphant, triggering the biggest sell-off the bond market
had seen since prices began their climb a year ago.
By the end of the week the fall in prices had driven up the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond to 6.2 per cent, a level last seen in
August during its long journey downwards.
The blood-letting also spilled over into the equity markets, where worries
over the prospect of rising interest rates prompted a bout of heavy selling.
Warning signs of the bond market sell-off had been building up as government
figures increasingly pointed towards a strengthening of economic activity.
Investors typically regard such data as a threat of rising inflation, which
erodes the value of fixed-interest securities.
Already unnerved, the market last week gave up its resistance when
confronted by yet another barrage of figures pointing towards economic
growth.
The October index of manufacturing activity turned out to be higher than
expected; construction spending was up; new home sales showed the biggest
monthly increase in seven years; and strong October car sales confirmed that
consumers were in a spending mood.
The week ended with publication of data showing that payrolls expanded by
177,000 jobs last month - considerably more than the 150,000 or so that had
been expected - and that manufacturing employment had ended a seven-month
slide.
The result of all this good news was that, by Friday's close, the long bond
had shed nearly 3 1/2 points to 100 1/2 over the week - and investors were
looking anxiously ahead to key announcements to be made this week on the
October figures for inflation and retail sales.
Few are predicting any reversal in the bearish trend, at least in the short
term.
The spate of buoyant economic indicators has come as a sharp reminder that
inflation may not stay low for ever. Also, with the year-end looming,
portfolio managers are grappling with the inevitable temptation to realise
their gains by selling.
Meanwhile, the short end of the yield curve is being influenced by a heavy
supply of government debt: Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage
firm, estimates that Treasury issues of securities with maturities of three
years or less will gross nearly Dollars 175bn in November, raising Dollars
39bn in new cash.
In addition, the market is concerned that the Federal Reserve Board, mindful
of the economic pressures, will make its next interest rate move upwards
rather than downwards. Even so, nothing is forever - and in this case,
analysts do not believe the bond market bears will predominate for long.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities' New York office,
points out there is a distinct feeling of deja vu about all the good
economic news.
The US saw much the same pattern last year - a weak first half followed by a
strong second half - only for things to start slowing down again as the new
year began.
Mr Brusca thinks that bond yields will keep on edging upwards to reach 6.5
per cent by the end of the year. But he is not alone in the belief that the
bulls will be back. After all, there are still plenty of negative factors
threatening to restrain economic growth.
The decline in defence spending is not going to go away; the effects of the
Clinton administration's tax increases will begin to bite next year; and the
cost to employers of the planned reforms in the health care system could
suppress employment growth.
Many analysts believe it will not be long before yields are back below the 6
per cent mark.
The economic fundamentals have not fundamentally altered. 'The big picture
for inflation is still very favourable,' says Mr Brusca, 'but there are
going to be some bumps along the road.' Last week, it seems, was just one of
them.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Akzo eyes most of Nobel

WHEN AKZO of the Netherlands and Nobel Industries of Sweden unveil the
outcome of their 'merger' talks today, there is little doubt they will
effectively be disclosing a takeover by Akzo of all or parts of Nobel, write
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm and Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam
It could just involve coatings businesses of the two speciality chemicals
groups. But it could be something much broader, embracing all of Nobel's
operations, except possibly its high technology unit, Spectra-Physics.
Coatings is the obvious area of overlap. Akzo's coatings activities account
for Fl 4.1bn (Dollars 2.2bn), or 25 per cent of group sales, while Nobel
generates SKr6.7bn (Dollars 840m) of sales in paints, coatings and adhesives
out of total turnover of SKr21.5bn.
A merger would enable Akzo to rival ICI's world dominance in coatings and to
emerge clearly as the European number one. ICI and Akzo each have 6 per cent
of the fragmented European market, with Nobel just behind them at 5.5 per
cent.
The view that the merger could be more extensive is based on the fact that
Nobel is majority-owned by the Swedish state, through a 'bad bank' unit
called Securum which would like to sell off as much of the company as
possible
'I wouldn't be surprised if pretty well all of Nobel was involved in the
deal,' says Mr Alastair Kilgour, chemicals analyst with BNP Capital Markets
in London. 'Securum would rather sell it as a package, than bit by bit.'
At the very least Akzo could also be interested in buying Nobel's pulp and
paper chemicals unit, with annual sales of SKr4.3bn.
Ironically, Nobel was near to finalising a deal to buy Akzo's much smaller
paper chemicals operations before news of the broader merger talks emerged.
There are also possible synergies between the groups' biotechnology and
pharmaceutical activities.
Analysts say Nobel's main problem is its debt, amounting to some SKr16bn at
the end of last year, compared with shareholders equity of SKr8bn. Heavy
interest payments on the debt are the main reason the group was only able to
record a SKr237m profit last year, when its operating profit amounted to
SKr1.3bn.
Akzo's readiness to contemplate a full or partial takeover of Nobel marks
the Dutch company's return to the field of major acquisitions.
This follows an absence of several years in which it has concentrated on
digesting the big takeovers of the mid-1980s and on streamlining its
internal structure.
Since 1990, Akzo's acquisitions have been few, but have included two in the
coatings sector. It has swapped its engineering plastic business for the
powder coatings activities of fellow Dutch chemicals group DSM, and has
acquired the UK paint company Macpherson, challenging ICI in its home
market.
In the 1980s Akzo undertook big acquisitions in coatings in Europe and the
US, more than doubling the share in group sales from just 11 per cent in
1980.
It also reduced the importance of the fibre sector to below 25 per cent of
sales from 35 per cent in 1980, partly through divestments.
Some analysts believe Akzo may pay for the latest transaction with its own
shares. If so, the deal's timing would seem to be calculated to benefit from
the 60 per cent rise in its share price over the past 12 months.

MERGER TALKS between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines broke up at the weekend without
any agreement on the choice of a US partner.
Failure to achieve the breakthrough increased worries that the Alcazar
project linking four airlines might collapse.
Talk of a collapse was dismissed by the parties involved.
Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair chief executive, was quoted as saying: 'There will
be further negotiations. Alcazar is still open and not on the rocks.'
SAS, which hosted the talks in Stockholm, said progress had been made and
further talks were scheduled through to the end of the month.
The choice of the US airline has created difficulties because the European
carriers already have close links with US partners: KLM with Northwest
Airlines, Swissair with Delta Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines.
According to one view, Swissair and KLM would prefer to throw the ball into
the court of the US transportation department to get a view on whether KLM's
open-skies agreement with the US would be extended to the whole of Alcazar.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Franco-German talks lift telecom
stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TALKS between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom about merging their
international business and then possibly linking with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph are surprising only because of the size of the participants and
the potential scope of collaboration.
They are the world's three largest international telecommunications carriers
and an alliance could involve co-operation on ordinary international voice
traffic, data communications, video services and private networks.
The idea of telecoms operators trying to form global alliances or mergers is
not new. The industry has been a frenzy of matchmaking, as companies which
mostly grew up as protected national monopolies have sought to prepare for
the competitive global market.
Much of the focus has been on 'outsourcing' - the provision of global
services to multinational corporations. This year AT&amp;T established
Worldsource, an alliance linking it to Japan's KDD and Singapore Telecom.
The Swedish, Dutch and Swiss telecommunications carriers have created a
partnership called Unisource. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have
established Eunetcom.
But June's Dollars 5.3bn deal between British Telecommunications and MCI,
the second largest US carrier, involved not only a joint push into global
outsourcing but also BT's acquisition of 20 per cent of MCI, so preparing
the way for much deeper co-operation.
The Franco-German talks and discussions with AT&amp;T have been spurred by a
perceived need for a rival to BT/MCI. But before any alliance can be
consummated, it faces several hurdles.
On the commercial front, the partners will have to decide how much of their
business they wish to merge. They will also need to decide whether to
reinforce co-operation with equity stakes in one another and, if so, how
large.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom appear to want to merge all core
activities apart from domestic voice services, though even these might be
joined later. They also seem intent on bringing AT&amp;T in as a partner for
Eunetcom and perhaps co-operating with the US carrier on transatlantic
routes. But this could create strains with AT&amp;T, which appears to wish to be
a more equal partner and which could threaten to go it alone if not
satisfied.
On the regulatory front, much will depend on the details of any proposal.
The European Commission's competition authorities are likely to be concerned
at the potentially anti-competitive effect of a wide-ranging link between
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. It could compromise plans by the
competition directorate to require governments to open their telephone
markets to competition by 1998. A three-way link, bringing in AT&amp;T, could be
of even greater concern.
But other parts of the Commission might be more sympathetic. The French and
German operators would argue that by joining forces they would be in a good
position to create a pan-European 'intelligent network' - which would chime
in with the support in the Maastricht Treaty for pan-European networks.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italy's 30-year domestic bond
move well received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S first 30-year domestic government bond has been warmly greeted by
investors, in spite of political tensions which have depressed the lira and
bond prices.
The new bond, due later this month, takes Italy into the select group of
western industrialised states which have issued such long maturities. Until
the 1990s, most domestic bonds issued by the Rome government were either
short-term fixed-income treasury bills lasting up to a year or longer-term
floating-rate paper.
Although bankers had speculated last week that the Treasury was about to
break new ground, the 30-year bond was by no means certain in view of the
sudden upsurge in political tension over the future of President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Treasury
officials suggested the decision to issue remained finely poised until
virtually the last minute.
But the treasury was encouraged to take the plunge by investors' appetite
for relatively high coupon debt. Interest rates on bonds have fallen sharply
in the past 12 months, with that on 10-year fixed rate government
securities, hitherto the longest, falling by virtually half to about 7 per
cent.
The new bond remains something of an experiment. The initial issue size is a
relatively cautious L2,000bn, with a gross coupon of 9 per cent. If
successful, it is likely to be followed by further tranches to create the
sort of liquidity essential to international investors.
Italy has already dabbled with 30-year maturities. In September, it launched
a Dollars 5.5bn global dollar bond, the world's biggest, which had a 30-year
component.
The global bond was the most conspicuous example of the treasury's much more
ambitious borrowing policy and reflects recent successes in tackling the
chronic budget deficit and inflation.

<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, will find it very
difficult to raise operating income next year, according to Mr Robert
Studer, chief executive.
In an interview, he said he was not pessimistic about the outlook for 1994,
but he did not expect trading activity to be as buoyant as it has been this
year.
In the first half of 1993, UBS's net income jumped by 89 per cent to
SFr1.29bn (Dollars 865m), achieving a 13 per cent return on equity, well
above its medium-term target of 10 per cent, and Mr Studer said that the
second half has remained very strong.
The main contributor to the bank's profit growth this year has been trading
income, which soared by 144 per cent to SFr1.55bn in the first half, thanks
to very active bond and stock markets and frequent turmoil in the foreign
exchange markets.

COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French communications, energy and

chiefly to invest in electricity generation in the US, radiotelephones in
France and cable television in the UK, as well as to retire debt.
Giving details of the issue it announced last month, Generale des Eaux said
that it planned to issue 1,837,043 shares at FFr2,250 a share. Existing
shareholders will have the right to one new share for every 14 they hold.
The subscription period will be from November 15 to December 6.
The price of the new shares compares with Friday's Paris closing price of
FFr2,617 and reflects the fact that companies raising capital in the French
market are having to compete with the Balladur government's privatisation
programme.

FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Viacom raises Paramount offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BID battle for Paramount Communications, the US film and book publishing
group, intensified at the weekend when Viacom, the cable television company
which is Paramount's friendly suitor, increased its offer.
It appeared to have stolen the initiative over its rival, the QVC Network
home shopping group, by raising its bid by Dollars 5 in cash per share to
Dollars 85 a share, valuing Paramount at just over Dollars 10bn.
Paramount welcomed the move while QVC was silent.
Until the weekend, Viacom and QVC had offered the same price for Paramount:
Dollars 80 a share, valuing the company at just under Dollars 9.5bn.
Viacom's decision to increase its offer gives it a firm advantage and QVC
seems certain to have to increase the value of hostile bid significantly to
regain the initiative.
One possibility that emerged at the end of last week is that QVC will bring
in BellSouth, one of the US regional telephone companies, as a partner.
BellSouth would spend Dollars 500m buying the 22 per cent stake in QVC now
held by Liberty Media and would make a further Dollars 1bn available to QVC
to enable it to increase the value of its bid for Paramount.
Viacom's decision to increase its offer on Saturday seems to have been aimed
at pre-empting such a move, and will force QVC and BellSouth into fresh
calculations about how much money it will take to finance a winning bid.
The timing of Viacom's announcement appears to have been determined by
securities regulations which require a tender offer to be open for at least
20 business days and a revision to be open for at least 10 business days.
By announcing the revision yesterday, Viacom will still be able to close on
November 22, two days before QVC's bid.
That will force Paramount's shareholders to take a decision on Viacom's bid
in isolation, rather than choosing between two bids.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Osman Abdullah hits back at Starmin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER chief executive of Starmin claimed yesterday that the quarry
products company which is chaired by Lord Parkinson, the erstwhile Cabinet
Minister, had made 'iniquitous' accusations against him in the legal row
over the termination of his service contract.
Mr Osman Abdullah, who controlled the company from 1989 with his brother
Raschid, has now received a response from the company's lawyers to his legal
claim for more than Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office.
'If you did not know any different you would think that I was the biggest
dictator since Genghis Khan, the Mogul dictator,' said Mr Abdullah.
He said the company's case included accusations that he had not properly
consulted the board: 'I will be refuting these claims strongly and I will
expose what ever is necessary to fight my case.'
The action follows the announcement of his resignation from the Pounds
160,000-a-year executive post in July - a month before the company said
pre-tax losses were millions of pounds deeper than previously published.
Mr Raschid Abdullah also resigned as an executive in July but recently won
shareholders' backing to stay on the board as a non-executive director. He
speaks for about 30 per cent of the equity including his family interests
and allied shareholders.
Mr Osman Abdullah said he had seen 'no evidence' of any 'new deals' by the
four-month old new board and was therefore 'currently considering a package
with a view to realising maximum value for shareholders'.
The resignations by the brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates
company, coincided with Starmin's announcement of a review of accounting
policies which led to the company rescinding its dividend and announcing
1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to
Pounds 11.9m.
The review of accounting policies focused on profits booked on asset swaps.
Starmin, who refused to comment yesterday, said at the time that there was
no suggestion of fraud.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Securitised Endowment Contracts for USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITISED Endowment Contracts, a company which buys and sells second hand
with profits insurance policies, is to join the Unlisted Securities Market
via a placing.
SEC, which only started trading in August 1991, says it has already become
the second largest trader in endowment policies, with an 11 per cent market
share.
People who have taken out with profits endowment policies usually find it
more profitable to sell them to a market maker than to surrender them to the
insurance company. Market makers then sell them to other investors who are
attracted by the relative security of endowment policies and by the prospect
of capital gain, which can be attractive for tax planning purposes.
SEC was founded by three men; Mr Max Rosen, a former director of independent
financial advisers Investors Planning Associates, who is managing director;
Mr Jeffrey Pinnick, a chartered accountant who is finance director; and Mr
Bernard Klug, who is the executive director with responsibility for
corporate planning and development.
Mr Klug was formerly a non-executive director of a third market company
called Honorbilt which went into administrative receivership in 1990.
Pre-tax profits at SEC rose from Pounds 176,000 to Pounds 745,000 in the
year to September 30, 1993. Turnover in the two years was Pounds 4.15m and
Pounds 10.85m respectively.
The company is the second endowment policy market-maker to float this year
after Policy Portfolio, shares of which fell back on Friday night to the
issue price of 130p.
SEC is expected to have a market capitalisation of between Pounds 10 and
Pounds 11m, and will raise about Pounds 5m. Some Pounds 3.5m of this will be
new money and will be used to pay off bank debt and expand the capital base
of the company, allowing it to hold more policies in stock.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Genetically engineered promises -
Celltech's forthcoming Pounds 180m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CELLTECH, the biotechnology company, today issues a pathfinder prospectus
for a flotation that will value the group at over Pounds 180m.
The company is raising about Pounds 35m to fund existing projects and some
new products entering development.
The Slough-based company has no products ready for market and does not
expect any of its developments to get there before 1996 at the earliest.
Unlike other emerging companies, however, Celltech has been able to slow the
rate at which cash resources are depleted by the research and development
programme, not only by collaborations with large pharmaceuticals companies -
a fairly common practice - but through its contract manufacture of
monoclonal antibodies, notably for Roche.
The flotation will take Celltech ahead of British Bio-Technology Group in
terms of size among the emerging drug discovery and development businesses,
but leaves it smaller than many bio-tech companies already floated in the
more mature US market.
Celltech has unusual roots and parentage. Founded in 1980 by the National
Enterprise Board and the Medical Research Council, it developed technologies
to modify the structure of antibodies, the proteins produced by the body's
immune system.
Alongside this research base, Celltech commercialised its technology and
laid the foundations for its Celltech Biologics business, now one of the
world's largest contract manufacturers of antibodies for therapeutic use.
On the way, Celltech also picked up an unusual shareholder in the form of Mr
John Gunn's British &amp; Commonwealth, the failed conglomerate. Administrators
for B&amp;C will be the biggest seller among existing shareholders who
collectively are realising Pounds 35m in the float.
Celltech's most promising product is a genetically engineered human
antibody, CDP571, which aims to reduce septic shock, the life-threatening
condition that can lead to rapidly falling blood pressure and failure of
body organs.
Bayer, the German company, is most advanced in developing a mouse antibody,
BAY X1351, to deal with septic shock. But as part of a collaborative R&amp;D
alliance, Celltech has exclusive rights in some EC countries to market the
Bayer product.
What is unusual about the arrangement is that Bayer has exercised an option
to license the Celltech antibody but the British company has retained
substantial marketing rights in a number of European countries including the
UK and France. Bayer paid a second Pounds 4m milestone payment to Celltech
in October for the privilege.
Mr Peter Fellner, Celltech's chief executive who was research director and
then chief executive of Roche UK, says this link with Bayer is unusual and
encouraging. So are the results from trials.
'Bayer's results enhance the probability of our septic shock product
reaching registration,' he says.
Bayer's product is in the third phase of clinical trials and a larger phase
III study to gain regulatory approval is to be launched in the US 'shortly'.
Celltech's product would come onto the market a year after Bayer's.
Bayer's exercise of an option would suggest it expects Celltech's CDP571
product to be an improvement on its own antibody, which can only be
administered once.
Celltech's products further back in the development pipeline, include a
treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, also based on the CDP571 product,
an antibody to treat acute myeloid leukaemia and a treatment for rheumatoid
arthritis.
Like all the other new drug development companies, Celltech's lack of
products or profits make it a substantially riskier investment than many new
flotations. If the company were to be floated in the US, the cover of its
prospectus would carry prominently what amounts to a serious health warning.
The US experience, however, is that the rewards are commensurately large for
those biotechnology companies that do successfully bring new drugs to
market.
What's more, Mr Fellner argues with some justification that the risks in
Celltech are lower for a number of reasons:-
The company's cash burn rate is modest. In the last three years the
company's operations used Pounds 18.4m compared with an R&amp;D investment of
Pounds 37m. This is partly because Biologics has positive cash flow and in
the year to September 30, 1993 increased operating profit fourfold to Pounds
2m on sales up 15 per dent at Pounds 14.2m. (After R&amp;D, Celltech's loss for
the year fell from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 5.9m).
Collaborations have also brought in cash. Celltech has already received
Pounds 8m of Pounds 26m in milestone payments from Bayer; American Cyanamid,
which is jointly developing antibody-based cancer therapies subscribed
Pounds 3.5m in preference shares; and Roche, for whom Celltech Biologics is
manufacturing a series of antibodies, subscribed Pounds 5m in preference
shares in September.
As a result Celltech will emerge after the float with cash of Pounds 50m,
enough to keep current projects fully funded for substantially longer than
two years.
The slow cash burn may not reduce the risk inherent in any drug development,
nor the statistical probability that a programme will fail or produce a drug
that is no more effective than others available.
But it should be considerable comfort for those investors looking to select
a portfolio of the emerging drug companies, that Celltech is unlikely to be
knocking on their door for more funds before they have a strong new story to
tell.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Warburg director to retire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Wilmot-Sitwell is to retire as vice-chairman of SG Warburg and
chairman of Warburg Securities following the merchant bank's next annual
meeting, scheduled for June next year. He will, however, remain a
non-executive director at Warburg Securities. Mr Wilmot-Sitwell will be
succeeded by Mr Nick Verey.
Mr Wilmot-Sitwell is widely viewed as one of the architects of the few post
big-bang successes among UK merchant banks and broking firms. As senior
partner at Rowe &amp; Pitman, the stockbroker, he was instrumental in forging
the alliance between R&amp;P with Warburg, the merchant bank, Akroyd &amp; Smithers,
the stockjobber and Mullens, the gilt-edged specialist.

FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Survey reveals flotation pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 40 per cent of small companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange
believe the disadvantages of flotation outweigh the advantages, a survey
suggests.
The survey reveals that many companies have not realised the aims that
brought them to the market in the first place and some are now considering
going private. The survey covers companies with a market value of under
Pounds 30m.
The findings will fuel concern that recent highs achieved by the market have
prompted a large number of companies to float without properly thinking the
decision through.
'Being quoted does not always turn out as managements thought or were led to
believe. Although the majority of respondents thought being quoted
advantageous, the realisation of the nature of the associated disadvantages
seems to have been a shock,' the survey says.
A total of 44 companies, all with substantial directors' holdings, responded
to the survey commissioned by Rutherford Asset Management, which manages
Pilot Investment Trust set up to invest in small UK quoted companies.
It found that half of all respondents with a full listing want to reconsider
their quotations. Also, 23 per cent of USM-quoted companies will reconsider
the benefits of quotation, with half of these likely to go private.
Only two of the 'important motives' for floating were achieved by more than
50 per cent of respondents.

FT  08 NOV 93 / IBM replaces strategy chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM chairman Mr Lou Gerstner has replaced his chief strategist in a move
that signals accelerated change at the world's largest computer company, as
it struggles to regain profitability.
Mr Jim Cannavino, IBM executive vice president and head of the personal
computer business, will take the place of Mr Bernard Puckett, who had been
appointed to the post of strategy director just four months ago, shortly
after Mr Gerstner's arrival.
IBM said that Mr Puckett was leaving the company after 26 years of service
'to explore opportunities to go into business for himself'. Analysts noted
the IBM statement did not include the customary words of gratitude to a
long-serving employee.
Mr Cannavino describes himself as a 'change agent'. Colleagues say he is a
'strategist by nature', also known for his dislike of IBM's bureaucracy and
his irreverent wit.
'When Gerstner joined us he thought there needed to be a lot of changes. I
believe I can take some of his urgency and translate it into actions,' Mr
Cannavino said yesterday.
Mr Cannavino brings to the task 30 years' experience with IBM. He has
restructured the personal computer business, which is making a strong
comeback after losing ground to competitors for several years.
Like Mr Gerstner, he does not favour the break-up of IBM. However, Mr
Cannavino has strongly advocated change in the structure of the huge sales
force.
He has also pushed for IBM to use its Risc (Reduced Instruction Set
Computing) microprocessor technology, currently employed in workstations, as
the foundation for a new generation of products ranging from portable PCs to
mainframes.
Mr Cannavino will identify new directions and opportunities for IBM. 'We
have areas of technology in which we don't currently have initiatives, areas
that are not covered by any division, and I will have to figure out if they
are going to be important to our company.'
IBM must also make more of its technology resources, he said. 'We invented
Risc but we didn't initially identify it as a market opportunity.'
Mr Cannavino also acknowledges, however, that he must identify areas where
investment can be cut.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Signs of the weakening UK bulls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING UK institutional fund managers have turned less bullish about UK
equities, according to the latest Gallup survey for stockbrokers Smith New
Court, published today.
Questioning was carried out before Friday's sharp declines in US and
European bond and stock markets. The responses show that for the first time
since the monthly poll began in 1990, the managers are evenly divided on
whether to increase representation in UK equities, as opposed to the
majority being in favour.
There is increased interest in Japanese equities, and a continuation of the
balance of views expressed in the last couple of months' surveys in favour
of raising holdings in continental European equities and running down
representation in US equities.
While managers still express confidence in the outlook for the UK economy,
there are a few signs of increased caution compared with last month.
The balance between institutions that are positive and those that are
negative on UK equities over the next 12 months fell from 77 per cent in the
October survey to 65 per cent. The percentage of managers expecting the UK
economy to get a lot better in the next year has fallen from 21 per cent to
14 per cent.
There is also a small rise in the number expecting inflation to be going up
more rapidly in 12 months' time, and the first upward revision in six months
of the inflation forecast, which is put at 3.7 per cent at the end of 1994.
Some 93 institutions, handling funds totalling Pounds 732bn, took part in
the survey.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Reality plays tricks with Emu theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is, according to one old saw, better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
But as in so many things in life, the European Community is turning
conventional wisdom on its head. Increasingly, the transitional second stage
of economic and monetary union, which starts on January 1, is shaping up to
be an especially difficult venture with many incalculable problems.
By contrast, the third and final stage of Emu, with its planned single
currency and central bank, has been subject to so much analysis and
discussion over the past five years that its hazards, although real enough,
appear familiar and less daunting.
The second stage of Emu is supposed to pave the way for fully fledged
monetary union towards the end of the decade. In it, EC member states are to
strive for ever greater convergence of economic performance, particularly in
terms of price stability and sound public finance, and to step up policy
co-ordination.
Such far reaching changes are best attempted on a sound institutional basis
and against a favourable economic background. The past year's crises in the
European exchange rate mechanism and the continuing recession on the
continent mean neither condition applies at present. Compounding the
difficulties are policy inconsistencies, notably in France, and widely
divergent ideas among member states as to how far the EC should move down
the path of institutional integration in stage two.
With the community heading for yet another year of sub-optimal growth, the
economic background is especially bleak. Although Mr Henning Christophersen,
the EC's economic affairs commissioner, has suggested that EC growth could
be as high as 2 per cent next year, others are far less hopeful.
The commission's own forecasters have suggested that growth next year will
be about 0.9 per cent, largely because they believe Germany is heading for
another year of declining economic activity. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the
Belgian finance minister and current president of the EC economic and
finance ministers' council, noted last week that the commission was likely
to revise its growth forecasts upwards. But he added that many countries,
including Belgium, would not be following suit.
Low growth will make it more difficult for member states to control their
budget deficits and so will hamper progress towards meeting the Maastricht
Treaty's convergence criteria, which include a 60 per cent limit for the
ratio of government debt to gross domestic product.
In the absence of draconian public spending cuts, which would be politically
risky, public debt is bound to keep rising as a percentage of GDP in those
EC countries where economic growth rates are lower than real interest rates.
This condition applies in France and Belgium. In Belgium's case, where the
ratio of debt to GDP is around 130 per cent, the outlook is one of further
deterioration unless and until growth exceeds real interest rates. In spite
of last month's easing of Bundesbank monetary policy, that date is probably
some way off.
Doubts about convergence will make EC economies vulnerable to financial
market pressures in stage two. Belgium's debt problem has exposed its
currency the Belgian franc to selling pressure in recent weeks.
International investors have also been looking askance at other signs of
economic divergence that are not singled out in the Maastricht Treaty.
France's sharply rising unemployment rate was a key factor behind the loss
of confidence in the French franc ahead of the July and August currency
crisis that culminated in the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands to 15
per cent. Looking ahead, there is no early sign that French unemployment
will decline from its current 11.8 per cent level, while youth unemployment
at about twice that rate is especially disturbing.
The joint Franco-German convergence programme, unveiled on Tuesday, has
caused surprise among some European officials for its optimistic view that
French growth could be as much as 3.5 per cent after 1995. One non-official
view, expressed last week by Professor Christian de Boissieu of the Sorbonne
University in Paris, was that growth would be nearer 2.5 per cent.
As worrying to European monetary officials is an apparent lack of coherence
in French monetary policy. At a recent monetary conference in Amsterdam, Mr
Andre Icard, director general of research at the French central bank,
insisted that currency stability was the main plank of monetary policy, in
spite of the franc's decline against the D-Mark since August. But he also
said France would pay more attention to the M3 money supply measure than in
the past.
Those who took his remarks at face value were left wondering how the Bank of
France would react to conflicting signals from its chosen indicators. Others
concluded that France's current monetary policy was to shadow German
interest rates.
According to Mr Maystadt, the planned European Monetary Institute, which is
due to begin operating in Frankfurt in January, is the ideal institution to
iron out such wrinkles and demonstrate consistency of decisions among
national central banks in the run up to stage three.
But that presupposes that EC member states will have achieved a consensus on
what the EMI should do and on the technicalities and instruments of an
eventual Europe-wide monetary policy.
Although discussion on the role and functions of the EMI is just beginning,
it is already clear that there are wide divergences between authorities such
as the Belgian finance ministry that see it as an instrument to force
integration and the Bank of England and Bundesbank which think its role
should be mainly advisory.
It is too early to predict that the problems of stage two will prove so
great as to jeopardise the goal of monetary union. But they are much greater
than when the Maastricht Treaty was signed in February 1992 and throw an
unflattering light on the EC's habit of setting deadlines for policy change
without regard to economic developments.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Telling rebels to leave the past behind: Pehr Gyllenhammar,
of Volvo, explains his mission to Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man facing a powerful shareholder revolt, much of it directed against
himself, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, is surprisingly
unwilling to raise the stakes in the battle to push through the merger of
Volvo's car and truck operations with France's Renault.
No, he says, the survival of Volvo is not threatened if the deal does not go
through. No, he does not think rejection would make Renault suddenly abandon
Volvo. Yes, he takes seriously the often bitter criticism of his own role in
the affair.
But in an interview at Volvo's elegant headquarters outside Gothenburg, Mr
Gyllenhammar is unshaken in his belief that the conversion of the three-year
alliance into a full-blown merger is necessary for Volvo, and good for its
sceptical shareholders. He cites the 7 per cent average return on turnover
Renault and Volvo predict for the merged company - better than either has
averaged alone in recent years.
'If we stop the momentum in a time of very tough competition in the
industry, it would be a very serious mistake. There is little leeway these
days for not doing the things you believe are right.'
Opponents working to reject the merger at the rescheduled December 7
shareholders meeting argue that Volvo would be better to continue the
alliance with Renault. That way, they say, Volvo would retain its
independence and avoid the doubts about France's commitment to privatise,
and the government's plans to hold a golden share in Renault-Volvo after
privatisation.
But PG, as everyone in Sweden calls him, insists such a move would 'replace
momentum and dynamism with confusion and stagnation. You say 'you have the
alliance'. No] Things have changed in the meantime. You cannot go back to
something you have just mentally left. That's our concern and worry - that
this doesn't work backwards.
'The French disappointment could be such that it underlines what I have just
said, that there is not much to go back to. I shouldn't fear that they will
turn their backs on us, but they must ask themselves what is now the way
forward. If this which we believed in will not work, what then do we do?'
The Renault merger affair has re-awakened a long-simmering dispute in Sweden
about both the personality of Mr Gyllenhammar and the strategies he has
pursued since he took over as Volvo chief executive in 1971. This has led,
over the years, to interests acquired and sold in the energy business, a
failed attempt in the late 1970s to sell 40 per cent of Volvo to Norway in
exchange for oil concessions and, more recently, to the building of
interests in the pharmaceutical and food and drink industries.
A criticism now repeatedly voiced is that Volvo would never have reached the
point of having to seek a junior partnership with Renault if it had
concentrated its resources in its core businesses of cars and trucks. Why,
ask some Swedes, could Volvo not have been a Swedish BMW?
PG bristles. 'You could have said to me in the early 1970s, why don't you
become a Rover? Well you have the answer now. What did Jaguar do, if that
wasn't a BMW strategy? It has now disappeared. Or would we be an Alfa-Romeo,
or a Lancia? They have disappeared. Or a Citroen, which went bankrupt? And
why don't people compare us with Mercedes today? You know the answer.
Because they are now loss makers.'
BMW, says Mr Gyllenhammar, is cited because 'soon it will be the only one'.
Besides, it benefits from a huge home market which Volvo does not. 'We sell
more than 250,000 cars outside Sweden. Compare that to the others and you
will find we are at the same volume outside our home market.
'We have invested as much money as could usefully be converted into good
work and good results. It was money we could not have usefully invested in
our core business that has been used outside. If you look at the value of
our investments today they are not unattractive.'
These arguments, however, have yet to stem the tide of opposition, much of
which focuses on himself. Much given to making strong public statements,
particularly urging reticent, neutral Sweden to open itself up more readily
to the outside world, PG has frequently topped public popularity polls.
But he has long irritated many in the business community for what is seen as
his arrogance and cavalier attitude to shareholders. He is undoubtedly
paying for some of that now in opposition to the Renault deal.
He shrugs this off by remarking that although some dislike him - 'and I know
many people do' - he has always been unanimously re-elected as chairman.
What bothers him, he says, is that the personal criticism and nationalistic
elements in the debate confuse the issue. And he is 'amazed' by what he sees
as a lack of confidence in Volvo's ability to hold its own in the merger.
'That really upsets me,' he says.
After the merger, he says, 'We will have a parent company that will have a
good debt-equity ratio, be financially strong and therefore be a good and
credible partner and owner with Renault. There is no reason whatsoever why
we should be the losers.

FT  08 NOV 93 / QMH accounts show hidden deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of deals under which Queens Moat Houses sold some of its German
hotels to directors and senior management and leased them back are detailed
in the troubled hotel group's accounts. The deals pushed DM270m (Pounds
110m) debt off balance sheet and bolstered group profits.
This, and the fact that Pounds 33.1m had been paid in unlawful dividends,
are the main breaches of company law and Stock Exchange regulations which
the new management has reported to the authorities.
The accounts are heavily qualified by new auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which
said that as well as the group depending on a Pounds 1.1bn refinancing, the
present directors 'consider they do not have a sufficient understanding of
the 1991 property valuation to enable them to provide a full explanation for
the decline'. Property values fell by Pounds 1.34bn between the 1991 and
1992 balance sheet dates.
Also yesterday Mr Andrew Coppel, the new chief executive, responded to
suggestions by Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, that a report prepared by
accountants Grant Thornton at the request of QMH's banks should be
published. Mr Coppel said the report was 'a severe indictment of previous
management'.
According to the new management the German transactions should have been
notified to shareholders under Stock Exchange rules since they involved
directors. They included a deal concluded prior to the end of March 1993,
when the group's shares were suspended, backdated to midnight on December 31
1992. This involved selling shares in a subsidiary with assets of DM4.6m for
DM1m to Mr Jurgen Mannes, finance director of the German business.
This and other deals done in December, including the sale of five hotels for
DM146m, of which DM34m has yet to be received, could have added more than
Pounds 20m to group profits under its old accounting policies.
As well as Mr Mannes, the purchasers included Mr Gerald Bell, joint managing
director, and Mr Peter Bertholdt, another director of the German business.
QMH is attempting to amend the transactions and warns that it is 'not able
to quantify losses which might arise'.
The accounts also show that Mr John Williams, former property director,
received Pounds 1.2m in 1992 and Pounds 1.03m in 1991 including bonuses,
relating to the performance of a business he sold to QMH, and salary. The
1991 figure had not been disclosed in that year's accounts as the bonus of
Pounds 895,000 had been capitalised.
Mr Bairstow received a bonus of Pounds 128,400 in 1991. This was
consolidated into his remuneration in 1992 which rose from Pounds 208,800 to
Pounds 335,500, giving him total emoluments of Pounds 435,948, up from
Pounds 415,969.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Accountants press for limit on audit liability: Fears over
growing claims from company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's largest accountancy firms are lobbying the government to limit
their liability when sued after a company collapse to as little as 10 times
the audit fee.
The campaign to remove the requirement that all audits must be conducted
with unlimited liability comes as accountancy firms face a growing number of
potentially crippling legal claims.
The largest case in recent years is an Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) writ
against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, in
connection with their audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. The Polly Peck collapse and the Maxwell case are also likely
to trigger claims for substantial damages.
Ministers are being pressed to change company law to allow accountants to
introduce a negotiable limit on audit liability over company collapses or
financial mistatements.
Senior partners from the eight largest accountancy firms, including Coopers
&amp; Lybrand, Arthur Andersen and KPMG Peat Marwick met Mr Neil Hamilton,
minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, to
press their case in the summer. Since then they have had detailed
discussions with DTI officials.
Their ambitions are set out in a confidential briefing paper prepared by the
group earlier this year.
The paper suggests that without protection from unlimited liability, firms
might refuse to agree to their new obligations under the Cadbury code of
corporate governance. These would commit accountants to comment on internal
financial controls and whether a company is a going concern.
It favours calls for an amendment to section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act,
which forbids any limit on liability in an audit contract. Its outline
proposal is to limit liability as a multiple of the audit fee. The minimum
suggested in the draft is Pounds 50,000 for sole practitioners and Pounds
100,000 for all other accountants, but all the figures represent initial
bargaining positions.
It also wants to make it compulsory for directors and officers of companies
to have insurance cover, which would ensure they could pay any damages
awarded.
Having a statutory cap on damages - which exists in Germany - would be
desirable but concerns over fairness and the failure to introduce it in
other countries mean it is unlikely to gain sufficient political support to
lead to changes to the law, it says.
The eight firms' senior partners have agreed to provide the DTI with more
information on the financial costs of litigation and to make a stronger case
that no other groups such as shareholders would be disadvantaged by reform.
They are also attempting to win wider support from industry and from smaller
firms of chartered accountants before launching a public campaign for
reform.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Spending by British groups on takeovers in EC surges to
Pounds 5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies spent about Pounds 5bn acquiring continental European
groups in a surge of overseas investment in the first 10 months of this
year, according to government figures.
The figures from the UK's Central Statistical Office show that British
companies' spending on overseas acquisitions between January and October was
two-thirds higher than in the same period in 1992.
The statistics suggest that strengthening balance sheets, coupled with the
gradual emergence of the UK economy from recession, have encouraged the rise
in cross-border spending.
Continuing recession in most European Community countries may also have
helped UK companies acquire continental businesses on attractive terms.
Hostile takeovers remain rare, however, and most EC deals continue to be
struck on agreed terms.
While the number of acquisitions completed by UK companies in the rest of
the EC has fallen, the size of many individual deals has risen sharply.
In some cases the figures have been distorted by large individual
acquisitions - such as the Kingfisher takeover of Darty, the French
electrical retailer, and the purchase by PowerGen and a US partner of an
east German coal field. But UK companies have, nevertheless, added
significantly to corporate assets in France, Germany, Spain and Italy.
Last week, Siebe, the UK controls and engineering group, launched a Pounds
184m rights issue to acquire Eckardt, a German process automation and
controls systems specialist. In recent months, UK companies such as
Courtaulds, Rugby Group, Northern Foods, Midlands Electricity and Amstrad
have all acquired businesses elsewhere in the EC.
Some of the upsurge in spending has been offset by the disposal by companies
of earlier acquisitions. UK disposals, within the EC so far this year were
worth about Pounds 571.5m, about half the level of 1992.
Interest in North American companies has also been reviving, despite the
dollar's recent strength. The CSO calculates that UK companies so far this
year have undertaken merger and acquisition deals in the US and Canada
valued at more than Pounds 5bn, twice the level in the whole of 1992. Even
so, the value of transatlantic deals is only about half the level in the
mid-1980s.
Separate CSO figures suggest the UK has itself continued to attract high
volumes of inward investment. So far this year, other EC nations have
invested Pounds 1.4bn into the UK, suggesting a final annual figure in line
with 1992. The CSO puts the figure from around the world so far this year at
more than Pounds 5bn, up by more than a quarter on 1992.

FT  08 NOV 93 / US backs Yeltsin's decision to serve out full term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN political groups yesterday denounced President Boris Yeltsin for
going back on his commitment to stand for re-election next June, but the US
pledged support for the Russian leader 'as long as he is promoting
democracy'.
Mr Yeltsin confirmed at the weekend that he intended to serve out his full
term until June 1996, but added, according to the Interfax news agency, that
he would not stand again. 'Everyone knows how many fateful blows I have
suffered. It's too much for one man,' he said.
Opponents and some supporters of Mr Yeltsin criticised the president's
decision, which he announced to media editors on Saturday. His supporters
conceded that Mr Yeltsin was now set to serve as a 'very strong' executive
president under a newly agreed constitution.
However, in a US television interview, President Bill Clinton said: 'As long
as he continues to promote human rights, democratic and economic reforms,
the US should still support him.' Mr Clinton expressed uncertainty as to
what Mr Yeltsin had said and meant on Saturday, but declined to criticise
his decision.
Mr Yeltsin understood, he added, 'that he is not the only source of
democratic power in Russia' - and next month's parliamentary elections
should demonstrate this.
Mr Yeltsin also won strong backing from his prime minister, Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, who described the decision as 'absolutely correct'.
'This is the position of a highly decent and responsible man, conscious of
his civic duty,' said Mr Chernomyrdin.
Mr Yeltsin's move, which appeared to take his closest aides by surprise, was
part of a series of important alterations to the constitution agreed
privately between Mr Yeltsin and regional leaders last week.
It means the reversal of a concession he made to his opponents in September
when he dissolved parliament and called for fresh parliamentary elections in
December.
Criticism came from those in parties opposed to Mr Yeltsin, including Mr
Viktor Aksyuchits of the Christian Democratic Movement and Mr Mikhail
Lapshin of the Agrarian party, who described it as 'a real deception of the
people'.
Some of the president's supporters were also critical. Mr Konstantin
Borovoi, leader of the Party of Economic Freedom, said the president 'cannot
cancel his decision . . . because it is a commitment to the citizens of
Russia and to the world community'.

Having slid down the snakes during the recession, fund managers are now
desperately trying to shin back up the ladders as recovery takes hold of the
property market. Some estimates suggest up to Pounds 10bn of investment
money is now looking for a home in bricks and mortar. Not surprisingly,
yields on prime property have fallen sharply as a result. Demand has been
particularly strong for central London offices where initial yields have
dropped to 7 per cent. That represents only a small premium over the yield
on long-dated gilts, suggesting that some fund managers' spectacles are
steaming up about the outlook. Indeed, after taking account of the fact that
many tenants are currently paying well above market rents, the implied yield
may be as low as 5 per cent.
Property yields may nudge still lower, especially if interest rates continue
to fall. After all, returns available elsewhere may be particularly meagre
in the brave new world of low inflation. But the trouble with investment by
default is that it invariably results in faulty investment. The danger is
that funds will repeat the errors of the 1980s, either paying too much for
prime properties, with little prospect of income or capital growth, or
settling for secondary locations, which may perform poorly over the long run
once development activity begins again. If Friday's fall in the equity
market were to continue, some of the pent-up demand could be released. At
some point, asset allocation committees might be tempted to switch funds
earmarked for property back into 'cheap' equities.

FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: City salaries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The news that arbitrageurs are managing to collect million-pound salaries
once more caused a predictable kerfuffle among the excitable classes. It
will doubtless encourage those members of the worshipful company of
arbitrageurs who are still anonymous to keep their heads down from now on.
City salaries are high compared with other occupations. This is in part
because although the fees charged are small in relation to the quantity of
funds handled, they are large in relation to the small groups of
professionals required to handle the transactions. Individuals are also
often in a strong bargaining position since they can readily identify their
apparent contribution to profitability.
Yet the variance with other occupations is so great that there remains a
suspicion that institutions are mis-pricing even the most arcane skills
which they are buying. Part of that deviation may arise because the apparent
profitability is not properly costed to take into account the full support
functions.
Some of the particularly highly-paid individuals have relationships with
their employers which more closely resemble joint equity ventures. In bad
years, however, they do not cover a proportion of the losses. Mr Peter Wood
of Direct Line, by contrast, actually sold an equity interest in a business
to Royal Bank of Scotland in return for his service contract. Significantly,
even before the latest rumours concerning the flotation of Direct line, he
had been considering exchanging his large employee bonus for an equity
interest in RBS.

FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Renault/Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the breezy confidence of Volvo's chairman, there is a real risk that
the company's proposed merger with Renault may be blocked by dissident
shareholders. A failure to consummate the deal would come as a severe blow
to both companies. Renault would be mortified and devoid of obvious options.
Volvo's managers could perhaps stitch together an alternative alliance - a
partnership with Mitsubishi springs most obviously to mind. But, for both,
it would represent a huge loss of face and would delay essential
rationalisation.
The weight of necessity must make it probable that the merger will still be
effected, even if the terms have to be modified to appease the discontented.
An asset swap leaving Volvo with both truck businesses and Renault with all
the car operations represents one wild card option. But the industrial logic
of a full merger remains compelling: the geographical spread and product
ranges are highly complementary. Though Volvo's shareholders may quibble
about the valuation, the real issue boils down to whether they can trust the
French government. Mr Gyllenhammar, member of the Legion d'Honneur, clearly
has fewer doubts than many of his compatriots. But the recent ructions at
Air France add weight to shareholders' concerns.
At the very least, the French government will have to set a timetable for
privatising the merged company. That may be enough to win over Volvo's big
institutional shareholders, who could see an exit route. But the French
government's retention of a golden share seems to be non-negotiable.

FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Dredging the Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The case for an official inquiry into the affairs of Queens Moat is
strengthened considerably by publication of its 1992 accounts. While one
view is that its former management was simply naive in its approach to
finance, the accounts show an accelerating use of quite sophisticated
techniques to keep the ship afloat, even as the storm gathered force at the
end of last year. These included not only a large sale and leaseback
transaction in Germany on which the company is still owed DM34m. There was
also a substantial extension of its incentive scheme in that country which
would presumably have bolstered 1992 net profits substantially under the
company's old accounting methods.
Even after recent revelations, the reader is left gasping at the way in
which deals involving directors were not disclosed to the stock exchange and
at the capitalisation of one director's Pounds 900,000 bonus in 1991. It
must be galling for small shareholders, who are still trapped by the listing
suspension, to note the 5 per cent increase in the former chairman's
emoluments in 1992 despite the fact that no bonus was paid.
As for the future, particular uncertainty concerns the company's ability to
generate cash. A Pounds 38m net inflow from operations in the first half of
1993 looked paltry against borrowings of Pounds 1.2bn. That would have
necessitated a restructuring, however the assets were valued. But the new
management must also be concerned that it may face fresh problems on that
score if the value of the group's German hotels starts to erode.

Possibly not the best time to be associated with the blood giving business,
but Hartlepool brewer Camerons had the best of intentions when it launched
its latest marketing ploy, a pint of ruby red Strongarm Bitter for every new
blood donor on Teesside.
Managing director Derek Andrew's idea was warmly welcomed by the Blood
Transfusion Service, whose only condition was that the beer be drunk off the
premises. Sadly Andrew's invitation to tea and biscuit manufacturers' to
demonstrate similar spunk leaves a nasty taste in the mouth just at the
moment.

Meanwhile, 59-year-old Rudi Mueller, who stays on as chairman of UBS in
London, tells Observer that he has counted himself out as a candidate for
the chairmanship of the Stock Exchange when Sir Andrew Hugh Smith steps down
in just under a year. Planning to move back to Switzerland when he turns 62,
he considers two years to be far too short a time to devote to 'such an
important assignment'.
It would seem that the exchange has yet to identify Sir Andrew's successor,
which may be one reason why the headhunters had such difficulty in
recruiting a chief executive. Who would want to take on this already
daunting task whilst in the dark as to the identity of the next chairman?
After searching long and hard, and apparently even trying to persuade City
firms to second a senior figure for a couple of years, the exchange seems
finally to have struck lucky, and a chief executive, from outside the
current staff, is expected to be named at Thursday's council meeting. So now
what is called for is an imaginative choice of chairman.
Among those already on the board, one obvious candidate would be deputy
chairman Herschel Post, an American so anglicised that a fellow board member
had no idea Post was not English. Sir Michael Richardson has also been
mentioned, but the chairman of Smith New Court would have trouble
establishing his independence from the interests of the market-making
fraternity. Outside its own ranks, the board might consider Hoare Govett
chairman Peter Meinertzhagen. But why not cast the net far wider, outside
the membership of the exchange for once?
Out there, perhaps, is a fresh mind which would actually relish the
challenge.

The choice of David Robins, 44, as chief executive of UBS in London will, in
the very nature of things, put a number of noses out of joint. It must, for
instance, be somewhat galling for Hector Sants, vice chairman and head of
equities, who was made a partner at Phillips &amp; Drew at a particularly tender
age. Although Sants is Robins' junior by some six years, there is still
bound to be more than a little sibling rivalry between two men who cut their
teeth in the close-knit world of UK research at P&amp;D.
Leaving aside big fish elsewhere in the UBS network, there are quite enough
well-developed egos in the London office who could vote with their feet. It
remains to be seen, for instance, what Richard Briance, head of debt and
treasury, or corporate finance boss Stephen Brisby, will make of the new
generation of management that has just been signalled.

Gerald Hines, the Texas property developer spearheading a DM550m hotel,
office and residential complex in east Berlin, has long been prospecting
this side of the Atlantic. Progenitor of the 'galleria' concept in the US,
Houston-based Hines Interests has skilfully ridden out the worst ravages of
the American real estate slump. For the dapper, 68-year-old vegetarian is
that rare breed, a cautious developer. He abhors debt and building on spec
without big tenants lined up.
But, having developed some 92m square feet in America, he faces a period of
scant new construction. He is redoing a resort in Aspen, Colorado, but
otherwise the focus is mostly abroad - Mexico City, and now Europe.
Hines has plenty of connections with the old continent. The Royal
Dutch/Shell pension fund has invested in many a project. Twenty years ago
Deutsche Bank also identified his properties as sound homes for its clients'
funds - though ironically it is Commerzbank and Hypo Bank, as former owners
of part of the Berlin plot, who win the financing of Hines' first German
foray.
While Jeffrey Hines, a son from his first marriage, is now president of the
company, Gerald continues to take an active role in his favourite projects -
such as Berlin. With a young German second wife, whose father was born in
Berlin, Hines has thrown himself into the highly politicised negotiations of
buying land in Berlin. He also had a hand in selecting as one of the
architects Josef Kleihues, who has come to the attention of a wider
international audience with his design for the new Museum of Contemporary
Art in Chicago.
However astute and conservative he may be, it emerges that Hines was not all
that far off making his debut in Europe with a rather different project -
Canary Wharf, before Olympia &amp; York appeared on the scene. 'When we saw the
access problem, we decided to pass' is the official line from Houston.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin and democracy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE carte blanche which western leaders have given to President Boris
Yeltsin is increasingly under challenge from Russian parliamentarians and
press. This is right. Russia wishes to be accepted both as a democratic
state and as an economy at least approaching the market, so it must expect
to be judged by the prevailing norms of both as it prepares for
parliamentary elections.
They take place in the shadow of a parliament still bearing the scorch marks
of its suppression by the army last month. The end of the parliament means
that the constitution, which crucially deals with the division of powers
between the presidency and the legislature, is being framed without any
representation whatever from the latter.
The assault on parliament has been, as Mr Yeltsin slyly noted last week, a
lesson hastily taken by every locus of power in the country; all treat him
now with greater deference. Like the much bloodier and much less justifiable
suppression of dissent in Tiananmen Square, it has had the effect of
strengthening the centre and of encouraging foreign investment (in Russia's
case, this is still tentative); but it has also unmistakably inhibited
debate, and given the president nearly all the aces.
Compromises
Thus, in the construction of the new constitution, the compromises which Mr
Yeltsin's team had made in earlier drafts to the parliament, to the regions
and to political forces have largely been cancelled. When the constitution
is unveiled on Wednesday, it seems that parliament's first term will be
limited to two years and that, in the second term, the deputies of the upper
house who are to be elected in this December's polls will thereafter be
nominated by the regions and the republics. This is likely to result in the
senior chamber being dominated by regional placemen answerable to
presidentially-appointed governors rather than to the people.
Meanwhile, the conduct of the election has been uneven. The parties of the
far left and right have suffered significant problems in securing office
space and telephones, while those who have fielded candidates who were
deputies in the old parliament have seen their phones cut off and the
tenancy of their flats threatened.
The media has been unbalanced in favour of the pro-presidential parties.
Newspapers, especially the increasingly influential regional ones, are
largely for the Yeltsin parties; they are also supported by the state
budget. Some anti-Yeltsin voices, like the popular, far-right television
programme 600 Seconds, remain banned.
Trauma
Now, it appears, Mr Yeltsin has decided not to hold pre-term presidential
elections next June, as he had earlier insisted he would. What could have
been an opportunity for renewing his mandate after the trauma of the last
few months is to be forgone in favour of a continuation of his presidency
until its appointed end in June 1996.
All of this gives occasion for some alarm. The field is not level, the media
are not balanced, the rules are being made up on the hoof. The only source
of ultimate authority is the president.
But this does not yet amount to authoritarian rule. It is rather the product
of confusion, conflicting ambitions and lack of democratic experience. What
still shines through the twists and turns of the Yeltsin camp is the intense
desire to create the institutions of a functioning democratic state and of a
functioning market economy. The vacuum where a balance of powers should be
is due to the suicidal course taken by parliament in attempting to pit
itself uncompromisingly against the executive power, ultimately up to the
use of arms. Those who are left holding the instruments of the state can do
no other than construct a system in this vacuum.
Mr Yeltsin's decision to soldier on to 1996 is not alarming in itself; a
greater worry is that his health and energy will not stand it, and that the
parliament he is bringing to life will find itself too constrained in its
role to develop as a responsible legislature. But overall, the vigour of the
pre-election process and the diversity of view shown a mere five weeks after
the fate of the state itself was briefly in the balance, is impressive and
reassuring. Mr Yeltsin remains the best bet yet.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Forward to Tory basics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS BRITISH cabinet ministers prepare for a new session of parliament, they
have before them a document from their party leader which urges the virtues
of common sense and 'basic' Conservative values. It is described variously
as an aide-memoire and an interim manifesto.
Mr John Major's tract is in some respects an understandable reaction to the
difficulties of governing with a small majority at a time of continuing
economic uncertainty. Last week's fevered trimming on rail privatisation,
along with revisionism on issues such as police reform, has again put the
government in an unflattering light.
The prime minister, however, will make a serious mistake if he tries to set
his party's compass with reference to the past. Only some of his current
difficulties derive from his slender parliamentary majority; others are
caused by a lack of belief among ministers over what they are trying to
achieve. Nowhere is this more evident than in policies to privatise services
and cut the size of the public sector, a field which gave the Thatcher
administration of the 1980s much of its cutting edge.
Slimming the public sector has not been abandoned as a policy objective but
it is being pursued without strategy or vigour. Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary, has doggedly pressed ahead with rail privatisation but
done little to articulate the benefits that will flow from it. The result is
that the public fears that privatisation will lead to fare increases and
service cuts.
Similarly, Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, has failed
to inject dynamism into his programme of contracting out civil service work.
Last week he revealed a big shortfall in targeted savings. Contractors have
accused the civil service of dragging its feet. There have also been cases
of the government recoiling from controversial privatisations, notably that
of the Post Office.
Defensive
It is important that this defensive approach is not carried through into the
next session of parliament. Decisions will soon be needed on whether to
privatise nuclear power, London's buses and the Forestry Commission. There
is also unfinished work on gas privatisation. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, must decide whether to break up British Gas.
Similarly, work remains to be done on the government's initiative of
attracting private capital for public infrastructure projects. Currently, it
is moving at a snail's pace. A more radical approach to the civil service is
also needed. As well as market-testing Whitehall functions, full
privatisation should be more widely explored.
Determination
If ministers are to get their privatisation initiative back on track, they
will need to display four qualities that have been conspicuously lacking in
past months. First, determination will be needed to override the forces in
favour of maintaining the status quo. There will always be interest groups
with well-honed arguments for why things cannot be changed. While these
cannot be dismissed, ministers must cut through the special pleading and
isolate any genuine public interests that need to be protected.
Second, imagination will be needed in refining the details of policy where
genuine public interests are at stake. The gas industry is a good example.
Ways must be found to combine the benefits of competition while ensuring
that the subsequent erosion of cross-subsidies does not lead to higher bills
for the poorest customers.
Third, pragmatism is required if entrepreneurs are to invest in privatised
rail services, contracting-out opportunities or public infrastructure
projects. Government inflexibility in defining opportunities has been
highlighted as a principal reason why private-sector interest is waning.
Finally, better presentation will be needed to convince a doubting public of
the virtues, in terms of efficiency and choice, of more competition and a
reduced role for the state. It will not be good enough to state blind faith
in the power of competitive markets. Ministers will need to articulate
practical benefits.
All this requires a lead from the top. The perils of governing with a small
majority are bad enough. Mr Major should remember that the perils of
governing without direction are even worse.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Time to combat the rot: The initiatives of Stanley Kalms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the Dixons electrical goods retailer, is tired
of headlines about crime and the disintegration of UK urban life, and has
decided to do something about it.
He is planning to sponsor a school in Yorkshire with Pounds 100,000 of his
own money, and is thinking about setting up a private police force with
other British store chains. These moves underline Mr Kalm's belief that
business people should take on wider responsibilities to combat what he
describes as the 'nasty infection' taking root in Britain's social fabric.
Mr Kalms, a supporter of the Conservative party, is an unusual
industrialist. While acknowledging the economic growth brought about by the
unleashing of market forces in the 1980s, he stresses their role in helping
to create conditions for high unemployment, a growing crime wave and a
criminal justice system that he reckons has 'fallen asleep'.
At times sounding like Mr Tony Blair, the Labour home affairs spokesman, Mr
Kalms accuses the government of being slow to work out the link between
inadequacies in the education system and poorly trained young people who
turn to crime. He reckons industry has a vital job in helping schools
produce adaptable youngsters who will find productive employment.
The 61-year-old Mr Kalms points out that, ironically, many of the maxims of
Baroness Thatcher's 'enterprise culture' are being applied to breaking the
law. 'The crime industry is a major profession, turning out new products at
a rate of knots,' he says.
His interests in social regeneration have developed during a 45-year
business career spent entirely with Dixons - which he has built up from one
shop owned by his father to a 1,000-store business with annual sales of
nearly Pounds 2bn. Among his attributes are a gift for plain speaking and
good political connections: he is a member of the group of business
executives occasionally invited to Downing Street for informal discussions
with Mr John Major.
His non-business interests are illustrated by his scheme to sponsor a school
to help it specialise in science and computers. Dixons is already sponsoring
a school in Bradford, Yorkshire, as part of the government's city technology
college programme, designed to teach more youngsters about industry.
Mr Kalms says there is a direct connection between education - or lack of it
 -and crime. While he is keen to improve training for young people, he says
industrialists should not sit on their hands while their businesses suffer
through what he decribes as a breakdown of law and order. That explains why
he is talking to other big retailers about setting up joint security squads
to patrol high streets to protect property and shoppers from criminals. But
he stresses this does not mean behaving irresponsibly. Mr Kalms has seconded
one of his Dixons executives to the Home Office for six months to ensure any
new action by the private sector on security squads is co-ordinated with the
police.
Mr Kalms welcomes the results of government action in the 1980s to privatise
nationalised industries and reduce trade union power. But he links the
free-market approach - involving greater competition and fewer restrictions
on sacking people - to high unemployment. He reckons business has a role to
play in tackling social problems, partly because 'industry rode the tiger
and prospered' in the 1980s.
He also reckons companies are in a good position to impart skills to young
people by helping 'create a seamless system of education through to
employment'. He is enthusisatic, for example, about how Dixons' college in
Bradford asked its pupils to design a new plastic bag for the company's
shops. 'The people who worked on this have got a total understanding of
commercial culture. After they leave school they'll be snapped up.'
With public policy looming large in Mr Kalms's arguments, what advice does
he have for the chancellor ahead of the Budget due later this month? The
Dixons chairman acknowledges Mr Kenneth Clarke's need to bring down the
Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. But sounding emphatically unThatcherite,
he suggests the government should consider tax rises to curb the deficit, on
the grounds that public spending cuts could make social problems worse.
'The government's greatest priority should be safeguarding the community,'
he says.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Japan's battle for the back room: The new government is
wrestling the bureaucrats for control of the ministries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shirt-sleeved samurai of Tokyo's public administration are sharpening
their swords for a behind-the-scenes power struggle that is changing the way
Japan is governed.
Having spent most of the postwar years building up Japan's economic might
across the world, they are now engaged in a different battle, right in their
own corridors.
This time, the challenge comes from the new Japanese government, whose plans
to cut regulations and reform the political system have jolted the
traditionally cosy relationship between politicians and bureaucrats.
The upheaval triggered by the end of nearly four decades of rule by the
Liberal Democratic party, plus economic recession, has exposed weaknesses in
the old consensus, once seen as a strength.
An indication of just who is on top will come today with the publication of
an interim report from a government panel set up by Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa. The panel - under Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren
business federation - was asked to advise on how the existing deregulation
plans - which spell anathema to several departments and ministries - could
be beefed up.
So far, the early rounds of the struggle have left the strongest departments
on top. But in the long term, the bureaucrats look as if they will have to
get used to sharing more power with the politicians.
The bureaucrats' public image is poor, tainted by international trade rows,
foreign policy mishaps and construction industry scandals. The newly
appointed Socialist construction minister is trying, for the first time, to
hold officials publicly responsible for failing to prevent bribery.
The government's image, by contrast, has never been better, as testified by
Mr Hosokawa's record popularity ratings of just over 73 per cent. However,
Mr Hosokawa will need more than style to make up for the fact that he does
not have the LDP's formidable back-room power structure, which collapsed
after its July election defeat.
Mr Hosokawa's unstable seven-party coalition replaced a network of LDP
policy committees, which used to restrain individual ministries by
arbitrating between them and keeping tabs on new legislation from the
earliest drafts. Under the LDP system, politically appointed ministers were
frequently rotated, giving them little time to master their dossiers and
hence little chance to make trouble.
Many of the coalition government's ministers are even newer to their jobs
than their LDP predecessors, so creating a temporary vacuum that the public
administration is doing its best to fill before a more stable government
comes along.
To the worry of other government departments, the first victory in the
battle with the politicians went to the powerful finance ministry, which
succeeded in getting one of its former officials, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, chosen
as finance minister.
The finance ministry also succeeded in setting spending ceilings for all
other departments for next year's budget, a process formerly carried out
only after consultation with the LDP committees. The move is thought to have
limited the new government's freedom to draw up spending packages to
stimulate the flagging economy.
'The collapse of the dual structure that was composed of the LDP and
government organs . . . will inevitably strengthen the ministry's power. We
are worried about that,' says a senior official at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
Senior finance ministry officials do not see it that way. 'Only we have the
expertise . . . It is necessary to compensate for the weakness of political
leadership,' one says.
The next victory - which might prove short-lived - went to the ministries
which administer the bulk of Japan's more than 10,000 official regulations:
transport, construction, post and telecommunications. The ministries
successfully resisted LDP attempts to cut red tape and are trying to
continue that way. However, there is one sign that new ministers are getting
their way. The new transport and construction ministers meet often to try to
co-ordinate policy in areas like urban development and infrastructure
spending, where their departments were sometimes at loggerheads.
This co-operation is the exception at the moment. When Mr Hosokawa asked
ministries to come up with a package of deregulation measures in September,
they produced a mere 94 ideas. They are now striving to curb the
government's efforts to push deregulation further. Mr Hosokawa rejected as
too vague the government panel's draft proposals and sent it back to the
drawing board.
Early bureaucratic triumphs could prove merely tactical. One consequence of
reform - which is likely to be agreed by this government - will be to
encourage a breed of more competent politicians.
First, they will be elected more on policies than on their ability to
channel business opportunities and cash to supporters. And those policies
might not correspond with the public administration's ideas.
Second, bureaucratic influence in parliament will be curbed. Mr Hosokawa has
reduced the number of senior officials allowed to reply to parliamentary
questions on ministers' behalf, and aims eventually to throw them out of the
chamber.
The extent to which Japanese parliamentarians used to behave as if
government were in the hands of the public administration is illustrated by
a former director-general of the LDP defence agency (Japan's equivalent of a
defence ministry). He once referred a question to an official on the grounds
that 'the matter is important'. That should become a joke of the past.
The progress being made by the Hosokawa government in wearing down finance
ministry opposition to a cut in income taxes is another example of the
fragility of bureaucrats' initial victories.
Another area where the political class is on the offensive is over plans,
now in the early stages, to reduce the number of government ministries and
agencies from 21 to just six. That idea was put forward last week by a panel
on administrative reform, whose report is otherwise short on detail, an
indication of the extent to which bureaucrats have managed to water it down.
Nevertheless, the surviving recommendations were received with delight by Mr
Hosokawa, who promises to carry them out in full.
Japan's bureaucracy was already approaching a watershed before the emergence
of these latest pressures to surrender some of its power.
A prime example is Miti, admired worldwide as the planner of Japan's
industrial strength. Now that the car and electronics industries are near
maturity, Miti is looking for a new role and a new growth industry, so far
without success. Some believe the ministry has partly lost its touch by
being late to appreciate the importance of microcomputers.
'Miti's basic role was to encourage Japanese industry by deploying industry
policy. But now there is an export surplus and the market is saturated at
home, so there is very little for Miti to do,' says Mr Naohiro Amaya, a
former Miti vice-minister, the top bureaucratic job there.
The agriculture department is also looking for a fresh role. Its traditional
job of defending the rice industry and ensuring Japan's food
self-sufficiency is being fast eroded. The ministry appears paralysed by the
growing pressure on Japan to phase out its ban on rice imports, as a
condition of concluding the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
However, it would be wrong to undervalue the Japanese bureaucracy's skills.
A career serving national interests in the public administration is still
seen as the ideal for the majority of Japan's brightest and best young
people.
The heart of the problem is that the interest the bureaucrats are supposed
to serve, beyond defending their own ministries' power, is becoming less
clear.
'Until recently, their goal was clear cut, to catch up with and surpass
western economies. Now that the bureaucracy has carried out this target . .
. it is time for Japan to set new goals,' Mr Amaya says. 'This is not as
easy as making good cars. Nobody can tell you how to do it. There is no
blueprint.'
It is uncertain whether the outcome of the present power struggle will make
Japan any better at setting new goals for itself. Mr Hosokawa's government
clearly hopes that it will. As Mr Amaya says: 'It is the first move in a
long game of trial and error.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Ice cream tsar on the streets of Moscow: Michael Kadenacy of
Baskin Robbins demonstrates what it takes to succeed in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a Vietnam war veteran with 85 airborne missions under his belt, Michael
Kadenacy was not going to let a line of T-80 tanks stop him doing business
on the streets of Moscow.
Having spent a day in his large, luxurious apartment listening to the sound
of gunfire, he broke a promise to his wife Victoria to keep his head down
and ventured outside with Slava, his ever-ready driver.
The brief excursion, past the burning White House parliament building and
across the New Arbat bridge, was to check on the fate of one of the street
kiosks which Mr Kadenacy is opening across the Russian capital. Given the
limited extent of the fighting between parliamentary rebels and the army,
his kiosk was intact and still open for business.
The increasingly familiar, purple and white cabins are selling 'America's
favourite ice cream' to appreciative Moscovites now eager and able to buy an
expensive, creamy treat crammed with nuts or chunks of fruit.
Sunshine or snow, Russians have always liked ice cream; now they are buying
the 'real thing' from kiosks and stores on Peace Street and Pushkin Square.
The tasteless, iced-milk alternative manufactured locally is yesterday's
news.
'America's favourite' is made by Baskin Robbins, a subsidiary of
Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drink group. As managing director of Baskin
Robbins Eastern, Mr Kadenacy - 6ft 6in in his sable fur hat - is Moscow's
ice cream king.
Since March this year, the 55-year-old English-born, US-trained lawyer who
got bored after 20 years in the California fast-lane, has been based in the
city where it takes a month to get a delivery truck registered.
At present, 100,000 gallons a year of cherry jubilee, tiger tail, almond
fudge and three dozen other flavours are being flown in from Canada to be
sold from 70 kiosks and stores in Moscow, St Petersburg and Novgorod.
When Mr Kadenacy's mission is complete, 2m gallons of ice cream a year
should be slipping down the throats of customers at 800 outlets stretching
from St Petersburg to Rostov. Eventually, he expects sales of 8m gallons.
Since being appointed managing director of the Russian business in 1991, the
single-minded corporate lawyer with a passion for good food and baroque
music has been tackling a string of daunting logistical, commercial and
personal challenges.
Colleagues say he was made for the job. According to one: 'He's a tough son
of a bitch and hangs on like a bulldog. He gets things done.'
Anyone attempting to do business in a market without a commercial
infrastructure or the skills needed to create a consumer revolution is
likely to share Mr Kadenacy's frustrations.
Not all of them will agree with his upbeat philosophy: 'Every problem here
means an opportunity. The Russians are seriously under-estimated; the future
is going to be good.'
He has complaints: 'Most Russians live day-to-day and hope time will take
care of everything; it made sense in a country where no one knew what
tomorrow would bring but it means there is no long-term view.'
Of the countless bureaucrats who still make progress difficult, he adds:
'Some are learning fast but others are rigid and stupid; sorry, arbitrary
and capricious. A generation will pass before the bad old ways are
forgotten.'
Since abandoning efforts to run the business from London, a priority has
been the construction of a Dollars 30m ice cream factory close to the
Ostankino television centre. To help him he has a Moscow staff of 31,
predominantly Russian, although turnover is high because employees are
anxious to move on and advance themselves.
The ice cream plant - being built in a joint venture partnership with an arm
of the Russian ministry of trade, now reborn as the self-financing
enterprise Khladokombinat No 9 - is on schedule to open in summer 1995.
Local production will mean improved supplies and freedom from import duties,
which do not yet exist but which are seen as inevitable.
There have been many problems; building plans which failed to match a
picture of a state-approved ice-cream factory in a yellowing, official
manual were rejected. The joint venture partners ran out of money, leaving
Baskin Robbins to raise its investment stake from 50 to 70 per cent.
A 'topping out' ceremony took place two weeks ago in a blizzard, attracting
Allied-Lyons VIPs from London. Mr Kadenacy slips into expatriate vernacular
to dub them 'seagulls': 'They fly in, eat everything, shit on you and fly
out.' Not that he objects: 'The more they come, the more they realise what
we are up against.'
More than once, the 'seagulls' have wondered whether to call off the whole
project. But they have stuck with it and with Mr Kadenacy.
He has worked closely on the factory with Mr Yuri Abramyan, the stylish,
immaculately groomed general director of Khladokombinat No 9 who helped
guests demolish an extravagant celebratory lunch at the Rossia hotel. Later,
at the Bolshoi theatre for a performance of Giselle, they toasted each other
with champagne.
'We have a good working relationship, even though we sometimes shout at each
other. He has been invaluable in opening doors and helping us get on,' Mr
Kadenacy acknowledges.
Whatever the legal requirements, Baskin Robbins believes a significant
Russian component is essential if the venture is to succeed. 'It needs to be
seen as a partly Russian enterprise and not just a case of foreigners
plunging in. We are not here to dictate. The companies who arrive knowing it
all don't stand a chance. This is no place for hot-shots.'
Also on Mr Kadenacy's plate is the creation of a national sales network,
following the collapse of the state stores and distribution system. He has
been on regular, investigative visits across a 2,000km swathe of Russia, and
in January joins 'very supportive' British embassy officials on another
fact-finding tour.
Beyond Moscow, St Petersburg and Novgorod, the plan is to expand sales via a
franchise network, although much work is still needed on a distribution
network in a country where middlemen used to be regarded as criminals.
Another huge challenge is maintaining the quality of the product: 'We want
to exploit the fact this will be Russian-made ice cream but it must be up to
western standards,' Mr Kadenacy stresses.
The scale of the task is forcefully underlined by a visit to Mozhaisk, 130km
north-west of Moscow, where one of the three dairies which will supply milk
to the factory is located.
Mr Valery Kozlov, dairy manager, promises high-quality supplies from a
shabby, 35-year-old plant now contractually obliged to deliver sweet, clean
milk 'free from objectionable flavours and odours'.
He wants to keep his customers happy and to be profitable. But he knows his
own suppliers will have to alter their ways: 'They must change their
thinking, realise they are the owners and that they must help solve their
own problems.' He grins and adds: 'In the west, five people look after 500
cows. Here, 500 cows need 500 people.'
The farms chosen by Baskin Robbins can expect a 25 per cent premium on milk
supplied. Mr Mikhail Ashrapov, the ruddy-faced director of nearby Borisovo
farm, which in March converted from state-ownership to become a shareholding
society, wears a broad smile. His 3,600 cows have been chosen.
In a dark, foul-smelling barn, dozens of cows eat methodically from troughs
as women workers continuously clear away the by-product of their appetites.
The milking machinery is archaic; hygiene measures appear rudimentary.
But improvements are under way and Baskin Robbins is helping its selected
farms to win grants from wherever they are available. Bacteria control will
even extend to agreement on the maximum number of udders to be cleaned with
one rag.
Mr Ashrapov complains about lack of finance. Mr Kadenacy is unsympathetic:
'The farmers think the answer to everything lies in more foreign money. But
they also have to get off their butts and work.'
Is it all worth it?: 'Absolutely. We can take all the hassle because this is
going to be one hell of a market and eventually we can make very healthy
profits.'
One kiosk operator got the message early on. Mr Kadenacy recalls: 'We
couldn't work out why his sales were going through the roof. We checked up
and found him handing out condoms to customers. With that sort of
initiative, how can this place fail?'

Sir, Dr Dieter Helm calls for the Nuclear Review to have wide terms of
reference (Letters, November 4) involving a thorough investigation of costs
and benefits of nuclear power.
This is certainly welcome from the nuclear industry's point of view, but
Dieter Helm omits to point out the obvious, that the full costs and benefits
of all the alternative fuels have to be encompassed in such an examination.
The thorough work already carried out for the Department of Trade and
Industry by Professor David Pearce on the full costs of fuel cycles is
relevant here, showing as it does the huge external costs of many fossil
fuels. External costs identified in this study for nuclear are very modest
by comparison.
Dieter Helm also implies long-term insight into the future price of gas, in
his comments on future nuclear projects versus combined cycle gas turbines.
Such a sure insight into the future gas market will draw to his doors a
queue of people almost as long as that waiting for the better mousetrap. I
do hope that the traffic conditions in Oxford will bear the strain.

<TEXT>
Sir, Professors Fells and Lucas (Personal View, 2 November) make a very
positive start to the debate concerning the long awaited Nuclear Review.
Like them, I am concerned that the terms of reference may not include some
of the crucial questions such as:
While the dash for gas has introduced healthy competition, surely a strategy
which maintains diversity and security is essential?
Can we afford to ignore the major contribution made by nuclear power to
off-setting the emissions of carbon dioxide and acid rain gases from burning
fossil fuels?
Are we willing to sacrifice an energy source that will certainly be needed
by future generations as other energy sources become depleted and expensive?
Can the UK afford to let another major industry disappear?
These are real issues - and in our lifetimes we shall see the consequences
either of closing our eyes or of prudent action.
But what of nuclear economics and the matters rightly raised by Dr Dieter
Helm (Letters, November 4)? The facts are that over the past three years
both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have dramatically improved all
aspects of performance. Within England and Wales, nuclear now contributes
almost 25 per cent of all electricity needs and in Scotland close to 50 per
cent with those one-time much berated advanced gas reactors, both north and
south of the border, now achieving generation costs of less than 3p per
unit.
The economics of existing plants is now truly robust and in Scotland our
plans to construct dry fuel stores is an example of innovation arising from
commercial reality.
Dr Helm is correct to assert that the economic profile of new nuclear
investment is viewed by the private capital market as less attractive than
combined cycle gas turbine plant since the latter enjoy higher rates of
return and shorter pay-back periods.
In part this is because the environmental costs of nuclear are internalised
and those of fossil burn are not; also the City prefers the certainty of
short-termism and places little value on strategic issues such as diversity
and security. The gas prices of today are known - what will they be
tomorrow?
The Nuclear Review may spotlight the feasibility of privatisation to see
whether it makes sense to complete the process started through the
Electricity Act in 1990. However, whether privatisation forms part of the
review or not, Scottish Nuclear is committed to continue down the road of
commercialisation which means producing private-sector financial structures
and disciplines within the framework of state ownership.
