FT  08 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp and review intensify nuclear
debate (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From K KANEKO.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We refer to your article, 'Japanese MPs query Thorp deal' (October 28),
stating that some Japanese parliament members sent an open letter to British
MPs calling for a review of the reprocessing contracts between British
Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) and the Japanese utilities. On behalf of Japanese
utilities, I would like to express our comments on the news article as
follows.
It is a basic policy of the Japanese government that spent fuels generated
at nuclear power stations in Japan should be reprocessed, and that plutonium
recovered should be re-cycled only for civilian and peaceful use. All
plutonium recovered at the Thorp reprocessing facility will be utilised for
R&amp;D activities including FBR and in our own LWR reactors as MOX fuels.
The operation of the reprocessing plant will be undertaken such as to
maintain an efficient reprocessing programme. Thus, there will be some
difference in timing between plutonium recovery and its actual use. Storage
of such recovered plutonium at BNFL will be required for some time until it
is actually used, but this does not mean that such stored plutonium would be
kept in store as surplus plutonium forever.
We believe that plutonium stored at BNFL will be strictly controlled by the
British government, Euratom, and International Atomic Energy Authority, and
that such plutonium can never be used for purposes other than for civilian
and peaceful use.
It is stipulated in Japanese law that nuclear energy should be utilised only
for peaceful use, and Japan has ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty and
executed a Safeguards Agreement with IAEA. Nuclear material including
plutonium can never be used for purposes other than civilian and peaceful
use because the material is strictly controlled by the government and is
strictly inspected by IAEA. We assume that the Japanese parliament members'
perception that the commencement of Thorp operation increases the risk of
proliferation of nuclear materials comes from the fact that they do not
fully understand the above strict control of plutonium.
It should be noted that some Japanese parliament members' views are only
their personal views not representing the whole Japanese public opinion and
that the early commencement of Thorp operation is supported not only by the
Japanese utilities but also by the Japanese government.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions as a soft target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT J THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley ('Pension fund as financier to public sector deficit',
November 3) warns that pension funds may be in line for another fiscal raid
on November 30, partly because protest after the March Budget tax credit
reduction was mild. He says authorities will only respond to pension scheme
members on the march.
Pension scheme members or holders of personal pension plans do not make the
connection between future investment returns and the costs of their pensions
or the benefits they will ultimately receive. Nor does the pensions industry
want to communicate bad news to its customers. It is interesting that
concern about possible further erosion of tax privileges the pensions
industry takes for granted appears to be coming only from investment
managers, who fear a downward rating of the UK equity market. Pensions
schemes should also be warning not only about the immediate impact of new
measures on asset prices but mainly about the longer term consequences of
lower returns. This is because it is they and their members who are
threatened. If the government sees pensions as a soft target, the UK is at
risk of jeopardising the enormous asset of having much better occupational
pension provision that most other European countries.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Still waiting at the bus stop: The delay to London bus
deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the traveller hanging on for the bus that never comes, Clive Hodson,
managing director of London Buses, has been waiting for the government to
give the go-ahead for deregulation of the capital's bus routes.
News that the UK cabinet is expected to drop bus deregulation from its
legislative programme not only prolongs the uncertainty. It will also delay
plans to privatise the 10 bus companies owned by London Buses, and pose
difficulties for the management teams and private companies expected to bid
for bus companies.
The reason for the delay is the controversy surrounding bus deregulation. It
has achieved only partial success in the regions. In many cities competing
companies have swamped busy routes with fleets of buses, while ignoring less
popular destinations. The government is keen to avoid further upsets in the
wake of the difficulties it has faced in getting its rail privatisation bill
through parliament and ahead of local elections in May.
The difference between deregulation and privatisation might not be
immediately apparent to the man on the Clapham omnibus, but two separate
processes are involved. Deregulation would open up routes to competition
from any operator willing to provide a service. Privatisation, on the other
hand, involves the sale of the 10 subsidiaries of London Buses.
In preparation for both developments, London Buses began putting routes out
to tender in 1985. Half have been contracted out, with 20 per cent going to
private operators such as Kentish Bus, Grey Green and Metrobus and 30 per
cent kept by subsidiaries of London Buses. Companies belonging to London
Buses still run 4,000 of the 5,000 buses in the capital.
Mr Hodson had hoped to send out details of London Buses' subsidiary
companies to prospective purchasers in December, and to complete the
disposals by September 1994. Deregulation was to have taken effect the
following August. 'We were all psyched up to deliver in December, but if
deregulation is postponed or delayed I can't issue the sales prospectus,'
said Mr Hodson.
The private companies that may bid for the London Buses subsidiaries will
also need to rethink their positions. 'The potential for buses in a
deregulated environment would be very different from that in a regulated
one,' commented Mr Brian Hirst, general manager of Kentish Bus. At present
operators must obtain approval to run buses on a particular route, but this
would not be necessary after deregulation. 'There would be routes the
private bus companies would want to look at again. We do need to know
whether this is a delay or a U-turn.'
If deregulation went ahead, the companies running London's buses would be
'mature organisations, not cowboys', said Mr Hodson. But he is aware of the
danger of outsiders attempting to muscle in on popular routes, as has
happened in other cities: 'We might still need some regulation of, for
example, road space and the use of bus stations.'
In a study earlier this year, London First, a private-sector organisation
set up to promote the capital, called for safeguards to avoid a
free-for-all. It demanded, for example, more bus lanes, better passenger
information and limits to the number of operators on routes.
If deregulation suffers considerable delay, Mr Hodson believes he would be
asked to complete the contracting out of the remainder of London's bus
routes. In addition, to improve value for money, any new contracts, he
thinks, would impose tougher conditions on the operators and require them to
take greater responsibility for achieving revenue targets.
Tendering has proved its worth, reducing operating costs by 40 per cent over
eight years. Privatising the bus companies might achieve further
improvements but, for many of those involved, full-scale deregulation
represents a stage too far. The latest delay appears to confirm that the
government realises this too.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Escape at Sea - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just once in a while, a new work makes one say: 'I've never felt this way
before'. I cannot call Second Stride's 'Escape at Sea', performed last
weekend at the Place, a success. An excessively complex mixed-media polyglot
collage, it holds its audience much of the time at too great a distance.
Yet, in certain passages, it exerts a mysteriously absorbing power over our
sensations.
The starting-point of 'Escape at Sea' is exile. We hear chunks of the story
of 'The Sleeping Beauty' in French; and chunks of Chekhov's 'The Seagull' in
Russian. Only chunks; like several earlier Second Stride works, 'Escape at
Sea' is full of fragmentation. In this case, the fragmentation helps to
express the sense of exile. 'Escape at Sea' becomes, in part, a
contemplation of the transmigration of culture. Later, we watch parts of
'The Seagull' in English, by which time we have sensed that Chekhov - like
'The Sleeping Beauty' - is part untranslatable, part international.
But 'Escape at Sea' has a whole lot more going on in it than that. Part of
it is a deconstruction of male-female relationships in 'The Seagull', and
this part is sometimes highly poetic. We see the actress mother bandaging
the injured head of her playwright son, or competing with a younger girl for
the affections of the mature writer; the severe young woman taking snuff as
she converses with a male companion; and more. And we see some of their
gestures and situations being echoed (even by performers of the opposite
sex), multiplied, contrasted.
Also from 'The Seagull' we see images of a play-within-a-play. From Old
Russia harsh ceremonious behaviour; folk dance; and modernist poetry. All
stylised and set to music. The composer Orlando Gough does not write music
congenial to singing and his music is over-amplified. Another problem is
that several of the dances (co-choreographed by Ashley Page and Ian Spink)
contain some awkward transitions and failures of fluency.
But numerous little incidents have an uncanny potency in the theatre. Lynn
Seymour (as the actress Arkadina) fixing her make-up, or felling a man with
a slap; an array of women and men all applying perfume on their necks in
unison; Philippe Giraudeau stripping and lying, both bleak and vulnerable,
on a slab. These vignettes add up into a whole system of meanings, playing
off each other in our heads with strange irony; or they do when 'Escape at
Sea' succeeds. The rest of the time it becomes mere Babel.
Amid the cast, the four female actress-dancers are outstanding. Lynn
Seymour's voluptuousness, her force and her powers of big-theatre projection
all stand in marvellous contrast - how well she shows Arkadina's
self-dramatisings - against the cooler, more economical and objective
performing styles of Catherine Malone, Lauren Potter, and Lucy Burge.
Philippe Giraudeau, also exemplary, comes across as an intellectual who
painfully exposes his inner self. When 'Escape at Sea' works, we are made to
feel many separate layers of human nature - brainpower, will-power, nerves,
emotions, instincts, sensuality - all adjusting in relation to one another.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Argerich's Schumann - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the privilege of the very richest musical talents to be constantly
fresh, illuminating and, above all, surprising in their music-making. Martha
Argerich, who played the Schumann Piano Concerto in Saturday's Barbican Hall
concert by the visiting Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, under their Chief
Conductor Armin Jordan, is one of those talents. The first surprising thing
she did was to turn up at all (in recent seasons her last-minute
cancellation record for London concerts was threatening to match previously
unassailable ratings by Richter and Michelangeli).
The second was to transform a work this particular audience-member thought
he knew inside out into an adventure of entirely unsuspected dimensions,
bursting with fresh excitement, fantasy, daring and elemental brilliance.
Not for Argerich the familiarly gentle, inward-turned approach to the
concerto; not for her the 'domestic' scaling-down of dynamics, rhythmic
articulation or tone-colours. From the first entry, and without in the
slightest overstepping the bounds prescribed by the score-markings, she
seemed determined to mine the piano-writing for every ounce of its dramatic
potential.
There was natural electricity in her attack, spontaneous responsiveness in
her shaping of melodies, a constant sense of new vistas opening up; in the
last movement, the speed, energy and flashing agility of her playing proved
simply - jaw-droppingly - astonishing. In no way was the 'norm' for Schumann
performances re-produced, or even faintly adumbrated. Once again this
pianist placed herself among the most mercurial, most magical of re-creative
artists, with a power of touch, depth of tone and freedom of expression that
must be the envy and despair of even the most formidable of among
piano-virtuoso confreres.
After a slightly thin, unfocused start the Geneva orchestra did well to keep
abreast of Argerich's imaginative impulses and even, toward the end, to
match them. The concert opened with a modern (1985) Swiss composition, a
vapidly pretty piece of texture-making entitled 'Iris's Scarf' by Eric
Gaudibert, and closed with the Shostakovich Tenth Symphony. I apologise to
the orchestra most sincerely for funking their second half; but after a
concerto experience such as had been offered in their first, fresh air was
for me the only conceivable finale.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Encouraging but not earth-shattering - Opera in San
Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans are being made for the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco to
close for repairs in a few years. The earthquake of 1989 left some
structural faults which, though not dangerous, need to be rectified for the
long-term health of the building.
On the artistic side, too, a pragmatic decision has been taken for the
company's future well-being. Although the San Francisco Opera has long been
regarded as one of the leading American companies, its reputation has
traditionally rested on the singing, rather than on overall musical
standards. On a visit to the city one could often find an impressive array
of international singers being accompanied from the pit rather than a strong
musical director setting his sights on a unified musical vision.
Now the company has acted to strengthen this weak link in its artistic
structure. Two experienced operatic conductors, both with British
connections, have been appointed, the Scot Donald Runnicles as music
director and Charles Mackerras as principal guest conductor, their
complementary musical interests making them a well chosen pair. This autumn
season is the first under San Francisco's 'Dream Team'. Between them they
are conducting no less than six of the nine productions - a splendid chance
of getting to grips with orchestral standards.
To provide a showcase for Runnicles' widely acknowledged mastery as a
Wagnerian, the dust was blown off an old production of Die Meistersinger von
Nurnberg. The performance was not extreme in any way (Goodall's famously
magisterial breadth and Jochum's rebellious wit both stamped their
personality on this opera more forcefully) but it was always alive and
attentive, fairly swift, and by the end quite elating. Without knowing, one
might imagine the conductor was a German at the top level. For Runnicles
manages to combine the seemingly opposing virtues of being central to the
venerated Wagnerian tradition and, at the same time, youthful and fresh.
Unfortunately everything on stage was correspondingly stale. The production
was dated 1971 and only a cosmetic attempt had been made to cover its
wrinkles. Perhaps audiences then still delighted in seeing the inhabitants
of Nuremberg as cute little medieval people in funny costumes who spent
their time plaiting flowers and skipping around.
Even the principals largely remained picturebook characters, but there were
vocal compensations. Ben Heppner was deservedly a prizewinning tenor as
Walther, strong, clear and beautiful; for once it was worth waiting five
hours to hear the Prize Song. For his woman, he had a ravishingly beautiful
Eva in Karita Mattila. Bernd Weikl has added humour to his down-to-earth
Sachs, but there is not the wisdom or depth to make us believe this
character capable of uttering eternal truths.
For Mackerras the season has brought Verdi, Puccini and - naturally -
Janacek. With the leading authority on Janacek's operas now on its roster,
the San Francisco Opera has the best possible excuse to embark on an
authoritative Janacek cycle for the US in the 1990s - as long as this
revival of The Makropulos Case does not set the tone.
There is no reason to complain that an existing staging was pressed into
service. Janacek never depends on lavish sets and the money was no doubt
more urgently needed elsewhere. What his operas do require is a searching
ability to probe, to show sympathy for the human condition which was nowhere
evident in Lotfi Mansouri's production.
The thinking seems to be, 'the audience may find this opera difficult, so
let's play to the gallery'. An able cast of singers had been assembled,
including Graham Clark as Gregor, Tom Fox as Prus and the esteemed Czech
bass Dalibor Jedlicka as Kolenaty, but all had been asked to put on an act.
As the ageless Amelia Marty, Stephanie Sundine brought physical and vocal
glamour into play. Much was made of the fact that Elisabeth Sodestrom,
herself a renowned exponent of the role, was listed as joint producer, but
gestures that with Sodestrom had taken us deep within the character's
complex psyche - the wringing of the hands, the haughty toss of the head -
remained ideas applied externally here.
Again it was the musical performance which was a haven for all that was true
to the opera's spirit. The size of the War Memorial Opera House militates
somewhat against Janacek's detailed, incisive style, but no conductor has
his finger on its pulse more tellingly than Mackerras. The nervous
agitation, the determination to keep going at all costs which drive the
opera's 300-year-old heroine on has rarely tingled with more expressive
intensity. As his Edinburgh concert with the Czech Philharmonic showed,
Mackerras's Janacek gets better and better.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Nice voice, shame about the personality - Whitney
Houston/Earls Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitney Houston certainly has an amazing voice; a resonant, thrilling,
secure, tingling, megaton voice. She also has one of the flattest, most
unconvincing, and charmless personalities in the history of soul, a musical
form not known for the humour or modesty of its practitioners.
So a Whitney Houston concert is an irritating experience, snatches of great
joy when the lady sings; long moments of tedium when she talks. And she
likes talking, mainly about herself, sometimes about Jesus, but then only in
terms of His relationship with Her. With some justification - 23m sales for
her latest album; staggering receipts for her latest movie The Bodyguard;
sold out signs for her latest tour - she thinks the audience is fascinated
by her weight, her marriage, her religion.
What takes this self-obsession a step too far is that Whitney has just had a
baby. From my eyrie in Earls Court I caught sight of a large man sitting in
the wings dangling an infant. It was Bobby Brown, formerly a macho rap
singer, now nursemaid to Bobbi Kristina Brown, who at eight months and one
day is employed as the perfect prop. Mother and child enjoyed some quality
time and though baby Bobbi refused to perform on cue she will doubtless soon
join the Houston business.
The problem is that Whitney Houston peddles love and intimacy, muttering
'love you all' like a mantra, while actually dealing in detached
artificiality. Most performers with a good song like 'Wanna dance with
somebody' would have used it to drag an ecstatic member of the audience on
to the stage for some barrier-breaking bonding. Not Whitney.
She prepares for 'I have nothing' with a protracted pause, gathering herself
up as if for an attack on the world high jump record. You feel you are
sharing in musical history; yet you know she goes through the same routine
every night. The patronising is most blatant when she demands more applause
for the band: 'We're working our guts out up here.' Yes, for a substantial
percentage of the audience's weekly income.
Yet all the posturing, the vocal gymnastics, the bullshit, is just about
bearable for the voice. Near the end she readies herself for 'I will always
love you'. It is one of those 'worth the price of a ticket' moments, the
transformation of a simple love song into a work of art. While she sings you
lose yourself in her genius. When she finishes you realise that Whitney
Houston has removed all meaning, all genuine sentiment from what should be
an artless and heartfelt expression of quiet devotion. Tina Turner should
take her for a long talk.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Imagination and idiosyncrasy in Pittsburgh -
Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania may well become an important stopping-off place on
the itinerary of the architecturally curious traveller. Last week's opening
of the Heinz Architectural Centre at the Carnegie Museum of Art, made
possible by a gift of Dollars 10m from the Drue Heinz Foundation, revealed
an imaginative and idiosyncratic approach to the exposition of architecture.
Pittsburgh's business giants - Carnegie, Mellon, Frick, Heinz, Westinghouse,
Alcoa - pioneered the mass production of steel, oil, glass and aluminium as
well as astonishingly productive modern methods of food processing. It is
not surprising, then, that the rapid growth of this industrial city resulted
in an environment more renowned for pollution than beauty.
But the other side of this thunder of industrial activity is the continuing
generosity of business benefactors and their family foundations. The
standard was set by Andrew Carnegie, who had a great belief in the value of
universal literacy and education. His Carnegie Institute is a unique
combination of library, art museum, concert hall, and museum of natural
history and science, a living demonstration of his belief that 'it is the
mind that makes the body rich'.
A perambulation through the vast marble hall of the Carnegie reveals both
the overwhelming wealth of Pittsburgh's turn-of-the-century golden age and
the conviction that architecture should be queen of the arts.
The Great Hall of Architecture in Pittsburgh is one of the only three
significant collection of architectural casts left in the world. Carnegie
financed the making of 1,200 of the finest models in architecture and
sculpture, which he exhibited in a great hall based upon the ancient
mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The greatest triumph was the casting of the
whole of the west front of the abbey church of St Gilles-du-Gard in France.
This superb facade was the appropriate backdrop for the opening ceremony of
the Heinz Centre.
In planning for the new centre, curator Christopher Monkhouse and donor Drue
Heinz were right not to attempt to rival the scale of the existing
collections. The mission of the new centre is simple: 'To further the
appreciation and understanding of architecture.' With no specific
territorial or chronological limits, it has begun to collect and interpret
architectural drawings, photographs and models. The only area of particular
concentration is to be the architecture of Pittsburgh itself and Western
Pennsylvania.
In 1991 the New York firm Cicognani Kalla was chosen from a short list of
four architects to design the new centre inside the giant, empty shell of an
enormous old gallery space. The decision to create an intimate series of
small galleries around a high central entrance hall was clearly the right
one. As the visitor leaves the main museum's huge white marble hall of
sculpture, the first impression of the Heinz Centre is a high hall flooded
with golden light. This tall, narrow hall is crossed by bridges and was
designed as a place for the display of three-dimensional architectural
elements. The walls are bright yellow plaster created in the Italian
tradition of 'stucco-lustro', where the pigment is mixed into wet plaster to
create a more intense surface colour. Two green copper dormer windows from
the Carnegie New York mansion have been incorporated into the design, adding
a sense of outdoor architecture to the indoor space.
A domestic scale gives the whole centre an intimacy which is enhanced by the
use of dark wood and strong colours. Inevitably the inspiration of the Sir
John Soane Museum in London is cited by the architects - quite rightly as it
has the same eclectic selection of both objects and spaces.
An important acquisition for the centre has been the room that Frank Lloyd
Wright designed for his own office in San Francisco in 1951. It is a classic
example of Wright's ingenuity, creating three diverse areas within a modest
warehouse space. The office was dismantled in 1988 by Aaron Green, who had
worked with Wright and who personally supervised the recreation of the room
in Pittsburgh. It is at least as interesting a room as the Kauffmann office
on show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, but because it was Wright's own
office it has a more vivid and poignant atmosphere.
On the upper floors of the centre students will enjoy the new library, a
startlingly vivid pink room which will come to life when the fireplace is
installed. Its first major exhibition is called The Shock of the Old, a
display of architectural drawings from Robert Adam to Frank Lloyd Wright
that attempts to demonstrate that innovation in architectural design is
nothing new. The drawings are densely hung in three galleries on a
typological basis. Buildings for transportation include Frank Lloyd Wright's
twin bridge project for Pittsburgh as well as a range of designs for
airports, gas stations and American railways. In the second gallery the
commercial architecture is contrasted with ecclesiastical buildings; while
in the third small room the collection is concentrated upon domestic
architecture, both European and American.
A second, smaller exhibition displays work by Cicognani Kalla, an impressive
summary of the first eight years' work of this young New York practice. Much
of its work is domestic, which has clearly influenced the design of the
Heinz Centre. Visiting it is rather like paying a call on a colourful and
original collector in his own house and, unlike so many new museum
facilities, this one has colour, domestic scale and a strong sense of its
own personality. This is a great achievement in so new a venture; its
founders were carefully guided away from the surgical and anonymous
whiteness of so many new museums. There is an enjoyable and old-fashioned
eclecticism about the new Heinz Centre that will upset purists and delight
the curiousity of the public.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the day's most promising programmes is also one of the shortest.
Lasting just five minutes, American Trilogy (BBC2, 7.25) is the first in a
series running through the week, each programme featuring three works from
the Royal Academy exhibition 'American Art In The 20th Century'.
Will Fitz make love to his wife? Or to Det. Sgt. Penhaligon? Will his
brinkmanship finally lead to someone's death? It is an indication of the
rapid success of ITV's new crime series that millions of viewers will know
that these questions refer to Robbie Coltrane's weird police psychologist in
the excellent Cracker (ITV, 9.00).
Years ago a high ranking member of the fire service told me that more
arsonists worked in fire brigades than in any other job. It will be
interesting to see whether this comes out in C4's Cutting Edge (9.00),
devoted to the arson investigators of the London Fire Brigade.
If you don't enjoy the programme about fire you can switch over to one about
water in Panorama (BBC1, 9.30) which investigates water meters and rapidly
increasing water rates.

<TEXT>
Alan Baxter, who was chief executive at Scholes Group until earlier this
autumn, has been named chief executive of Wellman, the specialist engineer,
with immediate effect.
Baxter, aged 43, will be hoping for better luck at Wellman than at Scholes,
a much larger group which he ran for little more than a year. Its executive
chairman, Bill Riches, said in September that 'it just didn't work out'.
Yesterday Wellman said it was ready to embark on a new stage of development,
and Baxter had the qualities and experience to take it forward. He replaces
John Gilbert, who has successfully steered Wellman through the recession and
carried out a difficult restructuring.
West-Midlands based Wellman had turnover of Pounds 23.7m in the year ended
March, while Scholes, which makes electrical installation materials,
reported turnover of Pounds 62.7m for the year to June.

International from 1975 to 1989, has been appointed to the new post of
non-executive chairman at Boulton &amp; Paul, the leading UK joinery
manufacturer.
The appointment, which takes effect immediately, is a coup for Boulton &amp;
Paul, which was purchased from BET in February in a Pounds 14.5m management
buy-out.
David Chenery, Boulton &amp; Paul's chief executive, said: 'We know our
customers pretty well but what we wanted was to add another dimension.
Working with Sir Derek, we can capitalise on the progress we have made to
date and prepare for a possible flotation of the business three to four
years hence.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Union Bank of Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland has appointed a lawyer to head its European
securitisation group; the shift from lawyer to banker is common on Wall
Street, but is still seen as rather unusual in the City. David Bonsall, 37,
joins from Freshfields, the City law firm, where he was a partner and head
of the capital markets and securitisation group.
Bonsall (above right), a Cambridge golfing blue, has been involved in the
securitisation market since its inception in Europe. In 1986, he advised
Salomon Brothers on the setting up of The Mortgage Corporation, the
specialist mortgage lender which kick-started the sterling mortgage-backed
securities market.
These complex deals, which allow companies to remove assets from their
balance sheets, are characterised by their long and painful gestation - and
the high legal fees involved.
Bonsall is already well acquainted with the frustrations of the market,
having thought up a number of innovations which failed to come to fruition,
as well as some that did, such as bonds backed by mortgages in arrears.
Bonsall will be a managing director of UBS in London, and will spearhead the
bank's European securitisation efforts following the departure of Euan Lynes
and Bruce Gaitskell, who were responsible for different areas of the
asset-backed market.

FT  08 NOV 93 / People: David Robins steps up at UBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland's announcement that it is splitting the functions
of chairman and chief executive of UBS in the UK with effect from next year
is a clear indication that its London operation has at last come of age.
Rudolf Mueller, who has held both positions since 1989, will remain chairman
of UBS UK and will focus on the overall strategic direction of the group.
David Robins (above left), who becomes chief executive, will be responsible
for the day-to-day running of the London operation.
Mueller's main task since 1987 has been the integration of UBS Securities
and Phillips &amp; Drew, the London stockbroking firm which UBS bought in 1985.
The process has not been without its problems, thanks to the Blue Arrow
affair and the culture clash sparked by the efficiency of the Swiss bank and
the clubby atmosphere prevailing in the City around the time of Big Bang.
However, Mueller appears to have succeeded in getting his 2,000 staff to
pull together. He also has the satisfaction of handing on a profitable
operation to Robins.
At 59, Mueller is close to UBS's retirement age of 62. By contrast, Robins,
who is 44, faces the challenge of taking UBS UK into the next century. One
hopes that his 13 years at UBS in London, Tokyo, New York and Zurich will
stand him in good stead.

FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Gray joins Sutherland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Gray, one of the best known analysts of the Scotch whisky industry, has
shifted his berth within the Scottish stockbroking fraternity. He has joined
Sutherland &amp; Partners in Edinburgh, having left Charterhouse Tilney in
Glasgow which had absorbed his long-standing employer Campbell Neill.
Gray is probably the only analyst who concentrates purely on Scotch whisky.
Each year he puts out a 100-page annual whisky industry review, a
densely-printed volume covering not just quoted companies but also facts and
figures on distilleries, brand sales and industry trends, which costs Pounds
295. Gray, who has been following whisky for 25 years, prepares it
single-handed. He says it sells not just to investors but to companies
involved in the whisky industry, from bottle makers to PR firms.
Sutherland &amp; Partners is a small institutional agency broker founded in 1989
with clients in Britain and abroad. It employs about 25 people; it now has
four analysts.

Extensive foundation work on London's A406 North Circular Road, worth Pounds
9.5m, has been awarded to TAYLOR WOODROW CIVIL ENGINEERING.
The contract was placed by Edmund Nuttall, which is acting as the main

Finchley area.
Nuttall is to carry out the improvements, which involve increasing the
capacity of the A406 from two to six lanes.
For the new section of road, which will extend 2.3km from east of Falloden
Way up to east of Finchley High Road, Taylor Woodrow will build 2600 bored
piles up to 34m deep, together with more than 700m of 1m-thick diaphragm
wall at depths of up to 24m.
The foundation work has already started on site and is scheduled for
completion in May 1995.
Consulting engineers for the scheme are Gifford Graham and Partners.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: Tesco hires Costain for design and
build
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN ENGINEERING &amp; CONSTRUCTION is to design and build two new
superstores for Tesco Stores.
The first store, in Exeter, is a 60,000 sq ft superstore on the Exevale
development site with parking for 625 cars and a petrol filling station.
The construction will be of traditional steel frame, with external brickwork
and pitched roofs, clad in clay tiles. A mural for the store is also planned
as part of a local art competition.
The contract involves site infrastructure works, with 3km of access roads,
sewers and trunk main services for the Exevale development.
Already located on the Exevale site are several grade II listed buildings
which are to receive remedial weatherproofing work from Costain. The
buildings are being improved for possible conversion into residential flats.
Work has already started on site and is expected to complete in August 1994.
The Carlisle store is a 45,000 sq ft superstore and petrol filling station,
with associated works and landscaping.
This requires diverting a stream, at present running across site, and
raising the store level above the existing flood plain.
Work has started on site and is expected to complete in June 1994.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Management: The chance to strike it rich - Savings to be
made in the second stage of the UK electricity market's deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often that companies get the chance to save thousands of pounds a
year. Yet that is the opportunity which will shortly be on offer to managers
of a wide range of UK organisations from schools, hospitals and nursing
homes to ordinary, medium-sized businesses.
On April 1 next year the second stage of the government's deregulation of
the electricity market comes into operation. This will enable about 45,000
organisations to shop around between different power suppliers, rather than
purchasing exclusively from their regional electricity distributer as they
are required to do at the moment.
Since electricity privatisation three years ago, the freedom to choose has
only been available to managers of sites which use more than 1MW of
electricity. There are about 5,000 of these intensive energy users in the
country.
Contracts already being offered to the others suggest that price cuts of up
to 10 per cent are achievable. But at least some of them will suffer as they
struggle to get to grips with the complexities of electricity trading.
'People are inevitably going to be bamboozled,' says Ken Green, commercial
manager for electricity and water purchasing at Imperial Chemical
Industries, who has gained wide experience in shopping around for resources.
'There is a complicated pricing regime in electricity and some people may
end up paying more for their power than they need, or even more than they do
now. It is worth management putting in extra time to make sure that savings
are made and retained.'
To qualify for participation in the deregulated market next April, a site's
maximum demand must exceed 100kW, based on demand over a three-month period.
Nobody knows exactly how many sites are eligible; 45,000 is only an
estimate.
According to the executive of the electricity wholesale pool (through which
power is traded), any site with an annual bill exceeding Pounds 10,000 is
likely to qualify. Established businesses should be able to find out if they
are eligible from their regional electricity company, or they can hire a
portable meter.
New sites will be judged on energy consumption of similar premises, although
they may have to drop out of the competitive market if their demands prove
to be below the 100kW threshold.
If a site is eligible its managers have three options. They can:
Buy supplies directly from the wholesale market. The advantage of this is
that it can save money by cutting out the middleman. In addition, buying
from the pool enables a company to respond quickly to half-hourly changes in
the pool price, perhaps by cutting demand when prices are high. But buying
directly from the pool is inevitably risky. Pool prices are volatile; in
April this year they rose more than 10 per cent on average.
Stay with the local company, either on a contract negotiated to suit an
organisation's needs or on existing tariffs. Among the 5,000 already in the
deregulated market, only about a third have chosen suppliers other than
their local company, according to a survey by Offer, the industry regulator.
Nor does staying with the 'host company' necessarily suggest a lackadaisical
approach. Companies can elect to have a pool-related, rather than
fixed-price, contract and all the risks that go with that.
Brian Acott of the Inenco consultancy group says some companies eligible to
join the deregulated market in April have been offered contract terms which
would lead to them paying more than their current annual bills based on
existing tariffs.
In some cases this is because regional electricity companies have yet to
finalise their proposed contracts for medium to large customers.
But contract terms - that is, non-tariff arrangements - are not necessarily
suitable for all customers. Green says sites which need to buy all of their
power at times of peak demand may be better off staying on existing tariffs.
Purchase on contract from a power company other than the local monopoly
distributer, again either at a fixed price or one that is related to those
in the wholesale pool.
Early negotiations for the 100kW to 1MW market indicate that bigger
customers, particularly sites which are part of large, nationwide companies,
have the widest choice of terms for contracts.
In theory, the two generators in England and Wales, the two Scottish
companies and all of the regional electricity companies are among suppliers
eligible to offer contracts, but there is no uniform desire to do so.
Offer's survey found that in the 1MW-plus market in England and Wales,
Eastern, East Midlands, Northern, Seeboard, Southern and Yorkshire account
for almost the entire trading by regional companies outside their areas. The
remaining six have little or no involvement outside their areas.
Big sites tend to favour the generators and are more likely to have
pool-related contracts, according to Offer. The regional companies are more
likely to be found at smaller sites.
Unless a company is happy to stay on tariff terms with the local monopoly
distributer, it will need to start planning soon for next April's changes.
Participating in the deregulated market will necessitate the appointment of
an approved operator to install a meter capable of measuring half-hourly
electricity usage and recording it. This should be done by February 1.
In addition, enough time must be left between now and next April to
negotiate a deal with a new supplier and terminate existing agreements which
often have three-month notice clauses.
'Organisations need to start preparing now if they are to get the most out
of deregulation,' says Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive.
However, companies are being advised both by the pool and Offer to think
carefully before they sign their agreements. Some power companies have been
offering discounts on this year's power prices in exchange for long-term
contracts.
Offer says that such contracts may be anti-competitive. It has told
offending supply companies to amend the contracts, but is warning consumers
that it may not be able to help in other disputes once contracts are signed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SEVEN STEPS TO CHEAPER POWER
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Find out whether you qualify for the competitive market. If so, start
  negotiating as soon as possible.
 -Don't underestimate the complexity of the electricity wholesale pool.
 -Be persistent and don't just accept the first deal.
 -Don't forget to include meter and connection charges in your
  calculations.
 -Appoint a meter operator by February 1.
 -Sign a connection agreement to ensure a link with the local
  electricity distributer's system regardless of the power's source.
 -Take advice. Offer's regional offices (Tel: 021 456 2100) can
  provide a list of suppliers, meter operators and manufacturers; the
  pool chief executive (Tel: 071 831 4791) is running a one day course
  on December 3 to explain how the pool works; the 100KW Project Team
  (Tel: 071 775 3838) can help on metering and data collection.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Management: A clear mind and a planned itinerary - Tips from
the top / Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, offers advice on
how to cope with business trips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir COLIN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose one of the best ways of coping with a busy foreign business trip
is to be asked to contribute an article on the subject by the Financial
Times. The work of collecting some thoughts and committing them to paper for
this piece is occupying a pleasant slice of the flying time between London
and Washington DC.
I have to confess that I am travelling on one of our Concorde services
which, of course, is the only means by which commerce and industry can buy
time as a commodity.
Supersonic travel has, for 17 years, given businessmen the option of buying
personal comfort and business efficiency across the North Atlantic. Pity
that technical, environmental and economic constraints have not allowed a
wider spread of Concorde service for the business traveller.
Although modern aircraft have dramatically improved the quality of airborne
life - cabin pressure has been reduced, more space and light have been
incorporated into cabin design, improved products and service facilities
have been enabled - the potential for travel weariness remains with us.
Long, non-stop ranges of aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400 mean that we
can reach Asia and Australia more quickly than before. The result is that we
are generally spending much longer periods of time aloft; but less time at
our destinations.
A colleague recently needed to be in Sydney to sort out an urgent problem.
His schedule did not allow much time away from base, but the new, fast,
one-stop flights allowed him to complete the trip in three days, including a
good working day in Sydney. (On departure, the Australian immigration
official was heard to exclaim: 'Crikey, mate, did you get time for a beer?')
He was none the worse for the experience, principally because the trip was
sharply focused and he had used the flying time outbound to study the
background to the problem and to relax before setting out to tackle it. On
the way back, he wrote up reports and associated correspondence, before
pushing the seat recline button in an uncluttered frame of mind. For me,
therein lies the secret.
First, get the trip, however long, very carefully planned in advance and
have the itinerary committed as much to memory as possible. There is nothing
so debilitating as not knowing what is going to happen next when on the
road. I find, by the way, that it is best to get into the pace of a new
time-zone straightaway. Otherwise, you are forever in a catch-up situation.
Second, while there are no hero-grams for the workaholic, it does pay to
regard part of the flight as 'office' time to avoid departure panic
(outstanding, urgent work is quite capable of travelling with you); the
isolation of an aircraft cabin allows single-minded concentration on
business ahead.
Third, on long trips, always carry some clean laundry in the hand baggage -
changing into a fresh shirt a couple of hours from the destination is quite
rejuvenating.
Fourth - and this falls into the category of 'he would say that, wouldn't
he,' but it is meant genuinely - buy the best quality of travel and hotel
accommodation you can afford. It is as much an investment in business
development as your time overseas.
The usual, well-versed advice about airborne alcohol and inflight feasting
goes without saying, but that does not mean we should not enjoy a glass of
decent wine with a lightish meal.
To sum up, as I have already indicated the most important - probably the
vital - piece of travel equipment is a clean and clear mind. Every plan and
arrangement must, therefore, ensure it stays that way throughout.
And now, you will have to excuse me. I need to take my mandatory pre-descent
'cat-nap' so I am fresh for my arrival at Dulles International Airport and a
dinner appointment in Washington later.
Next Monday: Martin Broughton of BAT Industries on how to handle
communications with the City.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Economics: Markets focus on US inflation fears in wake of
share and bond price falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the big fall in US share and bond prices at the end of last week, a
spate of data over the next few days should indicate to what degree
inflationary pressures in the US are rising.
Investors will be particularly interested in news of producer and consumer
prices tomorrow and Wednesday, while Friday's retail sales statistics will
shed light on demand in shopping malls around the country.
Inflation will also figure in the minds of investors looking at the UK
economy, with data out later today on the extent to which manufacturers are
pushing up prices of their finished goods.
Other figures will indicate the rise in prices being paid by manufacturers
for raw materials and energy, and how much extra credit is being taken on by
consumers.
Any fresh signs that inflation is weak may stimulate new speculation about
an early cut in bank base rates, held at 6 per cent since January. Last week
the Bank of England was cautiously optimistic about price pressures in the
medium term in its quarterly inflation report.
Friday's data on UK manufacturing output in September will provide one of
the last chances before the Budget, just over three weeks away, for an
assessment of the strength of the UK recovery. The City is expecting a 0.3
per cent increase on the month in output, which would help to dispel some of
the disappointment linked to August's fall in production.
Statistics in Japan are thin on the ground, while Spain and Finland are
likely to publish some gloomy unemployment numbers, underlining worries
about weak economic activity across Europe.
France's inflation figures on Friday are likely to show continuing weak
price pressures. They could spur a decision to cut interest rates to
stimulate demand.
The main economic statistics and other important events during the week
follow. Figures for median market expectations, provided by business
information company MMS International, are in brackets.
Today: UK, consumer credit business in September (rise of Pounds 225m),
prices of manufactured goods at factory gate in October (up 4 per cent year
on year, 0.2 per cent on month, up 3 per cent on year excluding food drink
and tobacco), input prices for manufactured goods (up 2.6 per cent year on
year, 0.2 per cent on month).
Canada, October housing starts (160,000), August labour income (up 2.4 per
cent on year).
Hong Kong, revised gross domestic product for second quarter.
Tomorrow: US, October producer price index (up 0.3 per cent), PPI excluding
food and energy (up 0.1 per cent), September wholesale trade.
Japan, September machinery orders excluding electrical power machinery and
ships (up 6.5 per cent on month, down 17.7 per cent on year).
UK, Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey.
Canada, new vehicle sales for September (down 1.1 per cent on month).
Wednesday: US, consumer prices index for October (up 0.3 per cent), CPI
excluding food and energy (up 0.2 per cent), initial unemployment claims for
week ending November 6 (340,000), state benefits for week ending October 30.

data.
Germany, Bundesbank repo rate details.
UK, CBI regional industrial trends survey, August worldwide visible trade
deficit (Pounds 1.5bn).
Canada, October department store sales (down 1.9 per cent year on year),
October leading economic indicator (up 0.4 per cent on month).
Norway, October consumer prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 2.2 per
cent on year).
Thursday: Australia, October employment figures (down 2,500), unemployment
rate (10.9 per cent).
Sweden, October consumer prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month, up 4.2 per
cent on year).
Friday: US, October retail sales (up 1 per cent), sales ex-autos (up 0.4 per
cent). Monetary data for week ending November 1 and for October.
France, October preliminary consumer prices index (up 0.2 per cent on month,
2.2 per cent on year).
UK, September manufacturing output (up 0.3 per cent on month, 1.4 per cent
on year), industrial production (up 0.4 per cent on month)
Sunday: UK, CBI annual conference starts in Harrogate.
During the week: Japan, October trade surplus (Dollars 11.5bn), October
wholesale prices index (down 0.1 per cent on month, down 3.1 per cent on
year).
Germany, October final cost of living, September retail sales (down 1.5 per
cent on year).
Spain, October unemployment rate (16.9 per cent), growth in M4 monetary
indicator in October (14.5 per cent at annualised rate),
Finland, September unemployment rate (17.9 per cent).

FT  08 NOV 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of Unilever's exposure to emerging markets are expected to show
through when the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group reports its
third quarter results on Friday. Forecasts of pre-tax profits range from
Pounds 608m to Pounds 635m, up from Pounds 584m last time.
Growth is expected to have come almost entirely from regions such as Asia,
with a continued flat performance in the US and Europe.
The figures are also likely to be boosted by recent acquisitions, the
consolidation of subsidiaries and the impact of currency movements on the
sterling results.
National Power, the electricity generator, opens the electricity interim
results season on Wednesday with analysts as eager to hear the company's
latest market share expectations as its profits.
The results are National Power's last before the electricity regulator
decides whether to refer it and PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. The perception is that the lower the market share the less
likelihood there is of a reference.
Profits are fairly meaningless for the first half of the year which usually
generates only 30 to 40 per cent of the full year earnings. The figure is
likely to be around Pounds 210m to Pounds 220m, against Pounds 201m for the
first half of last year.
Analysts expect a rise of about 15 per cent in the dividend.
Associated British Foods, reporting full-year results today, will have
offset its continuing difficulties in baking against a better performance
from its British Sugar subsidiary and investment income. Pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 310m, up from Pounds 297m, are expected.
Anglian Water, the second water company to report, is expected to turn in
tomorrow an unchanged interim pre-tax of Pounds 100m.
SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is expected to report tomorrow a jump in
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 127m from Pounds 51.2m. Hambros' interim
on Wednesday will be less impressive with pre-tax profits at about Pounds
35m (Pounds 25m).
The strong performance of the oil majors is likely to continue on Thursday
when Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading report third
quarter results. Analysts expect profits on a current cost basis, excluding
stock losses and gains, to be around Pounds 900m, although some estimates
are close to Pounds 1bn.
Recent results from the US majors, including Shell US as well as British
Petroleum in the UK, suggest weak oil prices will have been more than offset
by strong marketing margins, as consumers have so far not clamoured for
lower pump prices despite sharp falls in crude oil prices.
Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, is expected to report pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 99m and Pounds 117m, when it posts its results for
the first nine months of 1993 on Thursday.
Continuing improvement in the UK, where Royal, like its rivals has benefited
from a fall in claims and increases in premiums, is the main reason. At the
same stage last year the company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 83m.
Commercial Union and General Accident, which report nine month figures in
the following week, will also show a strong improvement.

THE LOCAL Government Commission will today publish its final recommendations
for reorganising local authorities in Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire in a
move that is likely to spark a clash with Mr John Gummer, environment

The commission is expected to recommend maintenance of the two-tier
structure in Durham and much of Derbyshire, rejecting the government's
preference for unitary single-tier authorities.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Iraq trade claim about Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LETTER disclosed in a book to be published on Wednesday reveals that
Baroness Thatcher was made aware in December 1988 of suspicions that
Allivane, a British defence company, was being used to ship war equipment to
Iraq.
The letter, published in the book Spider's Web by former Financial Times
journalist Alan Friedman, was written by Mr Frank Machon of the Machon group
of companies and sent to Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, on December 23
1988. Mr Machon alleged in the letter that, when granting Allivane Saudi
export licences, ministers in either Britain or the US were 'funnelling war
equipment through Allivane which is certainly destined for Iraq.'
The letter is likely to provide further evidence for Lord Justice Scott, who
is leading an inquiry into the sale of arms to Iraq.

MINISTERS yesterday scotched speculation that the government had decided to
include a right not to work on Sundays in its plans for Sunday shopping
legislation.
The government plans to introduce a bill legalising Sunday shopping in the
Queen's Speech later this month. Ministers yesterday said that they had not
yet decided whether to include guarantees of shop workers' rights.
An official said: 'It is not strictly true that the government has changed
its mind on this. The government is still looking at the whole bill and
taking views from all the interested parties.'
A week-long campaign to enlist public support for the partial deregulation
of Sunday shopping, coupled with statutory protection of workers' rights, is
to be launched today by the GMBU general union in the north of England.

FT  08 NOV 93 / When loss of job improves finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one-fifth of redundant executives find their financial position is
improved by redundancy, says the latest annual survey of unemployed
executives by the Drake Beam Morin outplacement consultancy, David Goodhart
writes.
A total of 22 per cent of the 160 executives - most of whom are married men
 -say they expect redundancy to improve their financial position as a result
of severance payments. A worsening financial position is expected by 28 per
cent and 46 per cent say it was too early to comment on the effect.
Some 40 per cent of the redundant executives' partners are spending as
usual, but 5 per cent are spending more than usual.
There is a sharp increase in the number of executives who say they are ready
to relocate, from 31 per cent last year to 55 per cent this year. Nearly a
third are willing to relocate overseas.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Cardiff Bay deals brought closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cardiff Bay Development Corporation believes the go-ahead for the
controversial barrage that was given royal assent on Friday will enable
several deals which have hung fire to be concluded soon.
These include negotiations with a Norwegian company to build Cardiff's first
five-star hotel, a financial services company seeking to relocate, and a US
media company planning a European headquarters.
The corporation's economic appraisal calculates that the bay can eventually
result in Pounds 1.2bn of private-sector investment, 4.7m sq ft of business
space and 23,000 jobs. Without the barrage, these figures would be halved.
Next week a design competition will be launched for a 2,000-seat home for
the Welsh National Opera. In September, the Pounds 3.5m main contract was
awarded to build National Techniquest, a science centre described as the
biggest of its kind in the UK. Mr Michael Boyce, corporation chairman, talks
of 'an arc of entertainment' along the waterfront.
Since it was set up in 1987, the corporation, with a current annual budget
of Pounds 34m, has concentrated on infrastructure which includes a
distributor road giving access to the M4 motorway. The road, costing more
than Pounds 100m and part of it tunnelled, should be completed in about nine
months. As part of the bay's landscaping, 15,000 trees have been planted.
So far, the biggest retail deal has been for a Tesco superstore. Of the
office relocations, the first was by South Glamorgan County Council in 1988.
Prudential Assurance has established a regional headquarters and there have
been two large pre-lets: Welsh Health Common Services Authority moved this
year into a 150,000 sq ft headquarters, and construction has started on a
Pounds 16m UK headquarters for the Dutch credit insurance company NCM. The
developer for that is Grosvenor Waterside, part of Associated British Ports,
which owns the surviving Cardiff docks.
Design work for the barrage has been carried out and the main contract,
worth about Pounds 100m, will be awarded within six weeks. Seven contractors
have been invited to tender: Balfour Beatty, Bouygues, Laing, Tarmac, and
joint ventures of Kier/Christiani &amp; Nielson/Hochtief; Trafalgar
House/Ballast Nedam; and Taylor Woodrow/Sir Robert McAlpine.
Work will start early next year and should be completed within four years.
Despite the pressures on public spending, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary,
indicated on Friday that the necessary funding would be provided.
A design team led by Ove Arup was appointed in July for the next big chunk
of infrastructure - a mile-long, tree-lined boulevard to link the waterfront
with the city centre. The corporation, never short of superlatives, said:
'We are looking for an avenue on the grand scale, equivalent of the Champs
Elysees.'
The barrage, which with associated works will cost Pounds 152m, is described
by Cardiff Bay Development Corporation as 'one of the biggest construction
projects in Europe'. It is seen as the catalyst for the regeneration of
2,700 acres of derelict docklands which Mr Boyce sees becoming a 'Covent
Garden by the sea'.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Railway safety scheme faces axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ADVANCED rail safety programme proposed after the Clapham train crash in
south London five years ago could be axed because, at a cost of Pounds 600m
to Pounds 700m, it is too expensive.
British Rail said yesterday that it was continuing its evaluation of
Automatic Train Protection, a computerised system which takes over if a
driver takes a wrong decision.
But it acknowledged that development of the programme had been delayed by a
cash shortage, and that 'very significant funding' would be needed before it
could be brought into use.
There are concerns that ATP is too expensive in relation to the safety
improvement it would bring.
Railtrack, the organisation that is due to take over responsibility for
track and signalling, said it would be guided by an evaluation being carried
out by BR. Railtrack is to start operating next April as part of rail
privatisation.
The proposal for ATP was made in a report by Sir Anthony Hidden QC into the
Clapham train crash, which killed 35 people in December 1988. The report
recommended that the system should be introduced on BR's trunk routes within
five years of it having reached a satisfactory stage of development.
BR has been testing ATP equipment supplied by German and Belgian companies
during the past 18 months. It is used on two routes, between London and
Bristol and between London and Aylesbury, to check its performance on both
InterCity and local networks. The system is not in general use on any
international rail system though it has been applied locally around the
world, BR said.
A problem with introducing ATP is that it has to be adapted to very
different types of train, some heavy and travelling fast and others lighter
and running more slowly.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Hopes grow for Dounreay cargo contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS optimism in the nuclear industry yesterday that the US government
may fail to take over a cargo of spent nuclear fuel from Belgium which had
been destined for the Dounreay nuclear plant in northern Scotland.
However, the Belgian authorities have indicated a willingness for open
negotiations with the US Energy Department on shipping spent nuclear fuel to
the US. That could pose a long-term threat to the British plant's operation.
The last-minute competition between Britain and the US over the shipment of
144 nuclear fuel rods from Belgium follows a policy change by the US
government. From 1988 until recently the US has refused to take spent fuel
from European experimental reactors, despite having supplied the fuel in the
first place.
This created an opportunity for Dounreay to set up its own reprocessing
operation to cater for the European plants.
But last month the US Energy Department offered to take the Belgian spent
fuel at an advantageous price to store it in South Carolina in order to
prevent it being reprocessed into re-usable highly enriched uranium. It is
doing this as part of its policy of reducing nuclear proliferation.
It also offered to indemnify the Belgian authorities against legal action by
Dounreay for breach of contract.
It now appears that SCK-CEN, which operates the BR2 reactor at Mol in
Belgium, is close to deciding to stick to its contract with Dounreay.
The Financial Times has seen a letter dated November 3 from Mr Carl
Malbrain, general manager of SCK-CEN, to Mr Thomas Grumbly, assistant
secretary of the US Energy Department, in which he says it is 'highly
unlikely' that the US would be able to obtain either transport or official
clearance in Belgium to take the fuel before the end of the year, a
necessity because the Belgian nuclear inspectorate will close the plant if
the fuel is not removed by then.
Mr Malbrain also writes of 'hopefully' starting to ship fuel to the US
before the end of the year 'as a first step in a renewed long-term
relationship with the US DoE.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Japan chief enters Thorp fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURPLUS plutonium extracted from Japanese nuclear waste by Britain's new
Thorp plant will have to be stored at Thorp 'for some time' until it is
needed, according to Japanese electric power utilities.
In a letter in today's Financial Times Mr K. Kaneko, general manager of the
nuclear power department of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of
Japan, concedes that there will be differences in timing between plutonium
recovery and its use. 'But this does not mean that such stored plutonium
would be kept in store as surplus plutonium for ever,' he says.
Mr Kaneko is responding to a recent open letter from nine Japanese MPs from
the ruling coalition parties appealing to British MPs to support a
renegotiation of contracts to reprocess Japanese nuclear waste at Thorp.
They said Japan had no foreseeable use for the plutonium that would be
recovered.
Mr Kaneko says electricity utilities still support an early start-up of
Thorp. 'It should be noted that some Japanese parliament members' views are
only their personal views, not representing the whole Japanese public
opinion, and that the early commencement of Thorp operation is supported not
only by the Japanese utilities but also by the Japanese government,' he
adds.
Under the terms of the contract with Thorp's owner, British Nuclear Fuels,
Japan is obliged to take back all radioactive substances extracted from the
waste, although it can ask for it to be stored at Thorp until it is needed.
Mr Kaneko says: 'All plutonium recovered at the Thorp reprocessing facility
will be utilised for research and development activities including the fast
breeder reactor and in our own light water reactors as mixed oxide fuels.'
Any stored plutonium would be strictly controlled by the British government,
Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr Kaneko says.
He also stresses that Japanese law stipulates that nuclear power should only
be put to peaceful uses, and that controls will ensure that plutonium is not
proliferated.
The UK government is conducting a review to decide whether to permit the
start-up of Thorp, which cost Pounds 2.8bn to build but is now surrounded by
controversy.
Environmentalists say it is dangerous and some members of the nuclear
industry believe it is unnecessary because alternatives exist to waste
reprocessing, such as dry storage.
Japan is the largest foreign customer of Thorp, which will also reprocess
fuel from the UK, Germany and several other countries.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Industrialist predicts mass joblessness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR GRAHAM DAY, former chairman of British Shipbuilders, PowerGen and Rover,
has painted a gloomy picture of mass unemployment throughout the industrial
world and a growing division between an elite and an unemployable,
semi-literate mass which spends its days watching videos.
Giving the inaugural annual lecture at the South Bank Business School in
London, he said: 'I foresee future new employment opportunities being
accessible by fewer members of society with the rest either working at
subsistence levels or unemployed. Those unemployed in the 21st century may
well be unemployable.'
He said he based this view on what he had already observed. Citing examples
from his time in British industry, he said: 'At the most basic levels of
functional literacy and numeracy society has a problem now.'
He added: 'When broad employment criteria are for more, better and relevant
education and skills, it is relevant that very significant percentages of
society are not even qualified to the extent of the basics.'
He said he did not know how society would deal with the large number of
people unable to participate in the knowledge-based industries. 'Whether the
cry will be for programme enhancement or the organisation of activities
which can fill the time of those who will be unemployed, I cannot say.'
Sir Graham was sceptical of government's ability to create jobs and scathing
about the 'endless diatribe' about state-funded training, which he said was
wholly ineffective if basic education was inadequate.
'From time to time governments mount major training initiatives. Invariably
these are expensive, bureaucratic and of marginal impact.'
He advocated shifting the training burden on to employers but also
recommended penalties on those companies that did not comply.
Sir Graham cited the Pounds 35m a year spent by Rover on everything from
remedial education to doctoral degrees as a reason for its recent success.

FT  08 NOV 93 / London bus plan review expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are expected to drop plans to de-regulate bus services in London
from a wide-ranging de-regulation bill which is set for the next
parliamentary session starting in two weeks.
The bill is intended to be one of the two legislative corner-stones of the
new session. A final decision on whether to omit the London bus proposals
may be made as soon as today.
This follows a finely balanced argument in the cabinet between de-regulation
enthusiasts and others - understood to include Mr John Major, the prime
minister - who fear that proceeding with the plan might harm Conservative
prospects in next year's London borough elections.
Backbench discontent over the proposals erupted publicly during the summer,
with Sir Rhodes Boyson, the MP for Brent North and a former Tory minister,
warning that de-regulation was 'a form of suicide pill' for the party's
chances in the elections next May.
A poor Conservative performance then and in the European elections a month
later would trigger renewed doubts about Mr Major's leadership.
The plans to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital,
which were de-regulated in the mid-1980s, have been criticised by local
authorities and London Transport on the grounds that they would lead to road
congestion and fare rises.
Tory business managers have tried to focus the new session's legislative
timetable on issues such as law and order which are calculated to unite the
party.
This follows the debilitating wrangling that accompanied the tortuous
passage of the Maastricht bill through parliament.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Princess pictures may speed press law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night faced intense pressure to speed the introduction
of a new privacy law after publication in the Sunday Mirror of un-authorised
photographs of the Princess of Wales in a private gymnasium.
Further photographs appear in today's Daily Mirror, which says it will not
be 'cowed by the hysterical accusations now being made against it'.
Ministers said last night that publication would strengthen greatly the
hands of those in the government pressing for legislation to introduce a new
civil tort of privacy.
The latest controversy over pictures of the royal family will also lead to
fresh calls on the newspaper industry to appoint an ombudsman to work
alongside the Press Complaints Commission.
Some ministers believe the ombudsman should have power to fine newspapers
found to be in breach of the privacy guidelines.
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, yesterday
condemned the Sunday Mirror for publishing the photographs.

not yet decided whether to include guarantees ofshop workers' rights.
An official said yesterday: 'It is not strictly true that the government has
changed its mind of this. The government is still looking at the whole bill
and taking views from all the interested parties.'
A week-long campaign to enlist public support for the partial deregulation
of Sunday shopping, coupled with statutory protection of workers' rights, is
launched today by the General Municipal Boilermakers Union in the north of
England. The union nationally has more than 30,000 shop-worker members,
almost all of them employees of superstore operator Asda.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Hull port opens floating terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PORT of Hull and North Sea Ferries will tomorrow open an Pounds 11m
floating terminal in the River Humber for roll-on, roll-off freight that
will save ships from having to lock in and out of Hull's docks.
Two new Pounds 31m ships will use the terminal and travel at 22 knots to cut
the overnight crossing time between Rotterdam and the Humber from 14 to 11
hours.
Truck drivers will be able to reach more customers in Britain or northern
Europe, unload, re-load and still have time to catch the same vessel for
return at 9pm the same evening.
The move is partly a response to the Pounds 9bn Channel Tunnel, due to open
next year, but it also reflects a wider trend.
Ro-ro trade between Ireland, Scotland, northern England, the Midlands and
mainland EC markets in northern Europe appears to be moving increasingly
through the Humber and Rotterdam.
The new terminal, which has taken a year to build, will be for freight and
truck drivers only and will increase the Humber's ro-ro capacity by 1m
tonnes a year.
It has been designed so that capacity can be doubled as demand rises.
Associated British Ports, which owns the port of Hull, also has statutory
powers to build two more similar floating terminals when it wishes.
Mr Henry Johnson, chairman of the Humberside branch of the Road Hauliers'
Association and owner of a local freight company, said: 'If we get an order
to shift something today from northern England and get it to Germany
tomorrow, we can ship it from the Humber and have it in Rotterdam in the
morning. It is then four hours to the Ruhr.
'It is going to be very difficult to beat this sort of short-notice
flexibility using the tunnel because of transshipment logistics, bottlenecks
in Britain and the fact it will not be big enough.'
Rotterdam is a gateway to a European network of roads, railways and inland
waterways and its port is Europe's biggest, handling 290m tonnes of cargo a
year.
Hull, at the end of the M62 motorway, is less than three hours from
Liverpool, Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Hull's cargo throughput has grown continuously in spite of the recession. It
reached a 25-year high of 8.7m tonnes last year, a 63 per cent increase
since 1989, and is expected to rise again this year.
The Humber is now Britain's busiest estuary, and 62m tonnes of cargo was
shifted by its four main ports and smaller river wharves last year. A
quarter was unitised freight, with services to Rotterdam growing fastest.
The Channel tunnel is projecting a yearly throughput of 8m tonnes of
unitised freight.
North Sea Ferries - an Anglo-Dutch venture owned jointly by P&amp;O and Royal
Nedlloyd - already operates daily sailings of four large combined
passenger-freight ferries, two each to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. Two
freight-only ferries provide six other sailings a week, making 20 in all in
each direction.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Attempt to halt VAT on reading material
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLISHERS are redoubling their efforts before Budget to try to head off the
threat of VAT on reading material, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Everyone from national newspaper proprietors to book publishers is alarmed
that the chancellor might decide to extend VAT to cover books, newspapers
and magazines.
This week the Henley Centre, the consultancy group, published a study
showing VAT on newspapers would result in a gradual fall in the quality of
local newspapers. Previous Henley research showed that a rise in the cover
prices of national newspapers has 'a substantial negative impact' on the
sale of local titles and national papers.
The Periodical Publishers Association, trade body of the magazine industry,
also warns this week that the introduction of VAT at the standard rate of
17.5 per cent will make British publishers the highest taxed in Europe.
The association points to the fall in newspaper circulations in the Irish
Republic after the introduction of VAT. Sales there have fallen 25 per cent
since 1981 compared with a fall of about 10 per cent in Britain during the
same period.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Credit points to weak upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER AND business credit figures published today indicate a steady but
weak recovery.
The Finance and Leasing Association, which represents companies providing
credit, finance and leasing, says that credit levels for the third quarter
of the year were at their highest levels since the recession started two
years ago.
Consumer credit, at Pounds 3.7bn, was 27 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Finance to businesses was up 14 per cent at Pounds 3.6bn, entirely
as a result of a 38 per cent rise in hire purchase. There was no change in
level of leasing.
Motor finance for consumers increased 35 per cent for new cars and 32 per
cent for used cars as the result of a buoyant August, traditionally a month
of high car sales.
Mr Tony Mallin, chairman of the association, said: 'Although the recovery
has been patchy to date, the third-quarter figures give real hope that the
upturn will continue.'
The Finance and Leasing Association's figures are higher than those from
Infolink, the credit information organisation. It measures credit inquiries,
rather than levels.
Retailing as a whole saw increases of between 6.6 per cent and 8.6 per cent
for the third quarter compared with the levels a year earlier.
Data on employment in small manufacturing companies, published today by the
Confederation of British Industry, also bring some hope for recovery.
Employment rose in the four months to October for the first time this year.
This contrasts with the picture of the UK manufacturing as a whole, where
employment is still falling and is expected to continue to fall for the next
four months, says the CBI.
The CBI's survey also found that more small companies plan to raise
investment than cut it.

FT  08 NOV 93 / National Insurance shake-up urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAR-REACHING reforms to the national insurance system could be recommended
by the Commission on Social Justice set up to advise the Labour party on the
future of Britain's welfare state.
The commission says in a report published today that the present system is
failing to offer comprehensive social insurance to protect people in hard
times.
Only 30 per cent of the unemployed receive unemployment benefit, while fewer
than one in three retired women qualify for the full national insurance
pension based on their own contributions.
Ms Fran Bennett, the report's author and former director of the Child
Poverty Action Group, says entitlement to these benefits largely depends on
national insurance contributions paid on earnings. Contributory benefits
have less stigma than means-tested ones and are less intrusive.
But they fail to cover many people outside the labour market such as lone
parents and the disabled. They have also been reduced in value over the
years, with the removal of earnings-related supplements.
The contributory principle may be less relevant in the modern world, the
report says. Contributions based on full-time employment patterns do not fit
the needs of a workforce which is working more flexibly. Equally, the
boundary between employment and unemployment - when benefit will be paid -
is less clear.
Increasingly the unemployed, sick and elderly must rely on means-tested
income support if they have no other source of income. And new
non-contributory benefits have been introduced for children and the
disabled.
The report outlines five options, from abolition of the contributory system
to restoring the value of contributory benefits so that they provide
adequate replacement income in times of need.
Sir Gordon Borrie, chairman of the commission, said that the commission
would be designing a welfare system which provides security for people in
the next century. 'The status quo is not an option,' he added. 'Either we
reform social insurance or abolish it.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Fear of Budget 'eroding confidence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence has declined sharply ahead of the Budget, the Institute
of Directors reported yesterday.
Its latest survey of business opinion shows that the number of directors
polled who are more optimistic than six months ago about UK economic
prospects fell from 63 per cent in August to 42 per cent in last month. The
survey also shows declining levels of confidence among directors over the
outlook for their own companies.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, said the latest survey reflected deep
uncertainty about the business climate and concern about the impact on
business of the November 30 Budget.
Despite industry's improved performance in profits, turnover and orders,
company directors have become much less certain about the business outlook
and are looking to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to help restore
weakening business confidence.
'Company performance is continuing to improve, but we are afraid that
increases could halt that progress in its tracks', Mr Morgan added.
'The chancellor needs to reassure business that his first priority is to
sustain the recovery and translate it into long-term non-inflationary
growth.
This means that he should resist quick-fix tax increases to reduce the
budget deficit and set cost-reduction targets for government, as most
businesses have to do in order to survive.'
Asked to nominate their most likely business concerns over the next six
months, respondents cited cashflow as the biggest problem followed by
continuing weak demand. Even so, nearly 80 per cent of directors in the
manufacturing sector feel their company is performing well. Optimism about
general economic recovery is higher in the north, with Midlands-based
companies now significantly less optimistic than they were earlier in the
year.
Employment prospects have recovered, however, after a sharp fall at the time
of the last survey in the number of directors expecting to increase
payrolls. More than 30 per cent of directors now expect employment levels in
their companies to rise in the next six months, up from 27 per cent in
August.

FT  08 NOV 93 / TUC raps abolition of farm wage protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has been warned that nearly a quarter of a million farm
workers in England and Wales would face poverty and exploitation if it
abolished the Agricultural Wages Board.
The warning was delivered in a Trades Union Congress submission to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food after the ministry published a
consultative document on the future of the board.
The TUC dismissed government claims that statutory fixing of wages destroyed
jobs as an excuse to remove the only protection available to what the TUC
said was the poorest group of workers.
The submission called for stiffer penalties against employers who break the
law by paying less than the board's rates.
The TUC said that it was concerned about the falling number of
investigations against employers in the past 10 years in an area where farm
workers constituted the biggest single industrial group claiming income
support.
One of the first national hotel chains to agree an annual pay rise since the
abolition of wages councils in August has announced a rise marginally above
the level that the wages council had planned to recommend.
Stakis Hotels has raised its minimum rate to Pounds 3 an hour compared with
the planned recommendation of Pounds 2.99.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Gateway to cut prices of 150 lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GATEWAY TURNS up the heat on the big three supermarket groups today with
steep price cuts on a range of luxury items in the run-up to Christmas. The
retail chain has slashed its turkey prices to 42p a lb - almost half the
price of the birds at J. Sainsbury and Safeway, and cut some other products
by up to a third.
The move is the latest in a fierce price war between supermarket chains that
intensified last week when Sainsbury, Britain's biggest supermarket chain,
cut the price of 300 of its most popular own-label products.
Mr David Simmons, chief executive of Gateway, said the store's Christmas
promotion had been planned before Sainsbury launched its price cuts. But
Gateway has reduced its prices on other items - around 150 products - so
that they either match or are lower than those of Sainsbury.
Other retailers yesterday signalled their determination not to be beaten on
price. Asda, the food and consumer goods superstore chain, said yesterday it
would do everything to maintain prices which it froze 10 days ago. 'We
intend to remain the lowest-priced superstore and have not the slightest
intention of losing the high ground,' an official said.
Tesco said it would continue to compete vigorously in the market, but would
not be specific about any price-cutting promotions it planned before
Christmas.
The share prices of the sector have fallen in response to the price war.
Sainsbury fell 34p last week to 366p. Argyll fell 32p to 260p, Asda fell
more than 4p to 49 1/2 p and Tesco fell 10 1/2 p to 195p.
Mr Simmons said that Gateway's effort so far to trim prices, which began in
May, had more than paid for itself in additional sales. 'The extra customer
traffic has more than compensated for any margin cuts.' The chain has seen
an additional 1m customers a week on top of its usual 6m to 7m weekly
shoppers, Mr Simmons added.
A strong challenge is being mounted on margins by the rise of discount
chains such as Germany's Aldi and the UK's Kwik Save.
Chains such as Asda have been laying stress on permanently low prices and Mr
Simmons said he believed cut-price deals are here to stay. 'Once the
customer has a taste for value, it's hard to shake that,' he said.
Gateway's deep-discount promotional items include Christmas puddings,
Bulgarian red wine, Coca-cola, frozen peas and some biscuits, all of which
have been cut by more than 25 per cent.
The current round of price cuts in retailing and telephone services will not
be the last, says a report from Midland Bank published yesterday. 'Price
restraint is becoming a permanent feature of the retail scene and is
spreading to the non-retail sector,' says the bank.
It argues that price cutting has been shown to work for retailers: the
recovery in retail sales volumes has been almost twice as fast as growth in
gross domestic product.
Higher volumes have more than made up for the price restraint and it is
'very likely' that profits have increased.
The bank cites four reasons for the effectiveness of price restraint: a
change in consumer psychology as a result of the recession, low inflation
meaning that consumers are more familiar with what items cost, falling real
incomes constraining what consumers can spend, and finally that 'unlike the
1980s, there will be no personal borrowing boom over the next few years to
help consumers circumvent hefty price increases'.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Commission heads for clash over council restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Local Government Commission will today publish its final recommendations
for reorganising local authorities in Cleveland, Durham and Derbyshire in a
move that is likely to spark a clash with the environment secretary.
It is expected to recommend maintenance of the two-tier structure in Durham
and much of Derbyshire, rejecting the government's preference for unitary
one-tier authorities.
This move will put the commission on a collision course with Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, who has said that two-tier authorities should be
the exception.
Mr David Curry, local government minister, said last month that proposals
from the commission to retain two-tier authorities might be rejected.
However, that could precipitate the resignation of Sir John Banham, the
commission's chairman, who has recently criticised ministerial interference.
He has also suggested that reorganisation should be reconsidered if it would
add substantially to costs.
Sir John has already revealed that proposals for two unitary authorities in
Derbyshire have been withdrawn because of local opposition. In a Mori poll
for the commission, 39 per cent gave the status quo as their first
preference. The next most popular option, two unitary authorities, won
support from only 11 per cent.
The final recommendations for Derbyshire are thought to include two unitary
authorities for the city of Derby and north-east Derbyshire. The rest of the
county would be covered by a two-tier structure.
For Durham, the likely recommendation is to retain the existing two-tier
county and district councils.
In Cleveland the commission is expected to stick to its original proposals
for four unitary authorities.

FT  08 NOV 93 / BT calls up a Pounds 2bn-a-year vision of the future: A
system to supply television via the telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN Foster's neat detached house in Suffolk is unique in the UK. It is
the first home to be able to receive television pictures down an ordinary
telephone line using British Telecommunication's latest video-on-demand
technology.
The subject matter on the screen is not exactly riveting - a succession of
BT television advertisements. But the transmission of the pictures marks the
first time that the BT technology has moved outside the laboratory.
Mr Foster is a senior BT engineer working on the video-on-demand project at
the company's laboratories at Martlesham Heath near Ipswich. Two things are
remarkable about the images on the TV set in Mr Foster's living room. The
pictures, although a little grainy, appear well up to video recorder
standard. And they have come down an ordinary line from the nearest
telephone exchange - at Kesgrave three miles away.
BT believes the success at Mr Foster's house means that it should be able to
deliver television services into about 90 per cent of the 23m homes linked
to the BT telephone network.
'We have definitely proved the technology,' said Mr Nigel Cole, leader of
the team that worked for more than two years on taking the 'noise' out of
the system and ensuring that the digital signal could travel more than three
miles down the line. His colleague, Mr Gordon Hathaway, leads a team which
has developed the methods of squeezing the digital pictures by factors of
100 to one to send them down conventional copper telephone wires.
This week the system moves to the BT boardroom for a decision on its future.
BT is thought likely to give the go-ahead for a series of trials, probably
in the Colchester area. To start with the trials would involve about 15 to
20 homes but could be extended to 5,000 homes towards the end of next year.
This stage of the development could involve investment of between Pounds 10m
to Pounds 20m. The next step would be a 250,000 home experiment in 1995
before taking the system nationally, which would involve investment of
several billion pounds.
Mr Steve Maine, BT director of visual and broadcast services, believes a
wide range of services could be provided apart from the obvious
video-on-demand feature films.
BT has already developed elegant ways of displaying and ordering the
available choices. Using infra-red channel selectors the consumer could
simply point at icons on the TV screen for everything from movies to comedy,
documentaries or sport. If movies are chosen the choice continues to broaden
via screen-based menus. Under the likely regulatory regime live
transmissions would be forbidden.
Unlike live television, the video-on-demand, viewers could rewind or scroll
forward.
But Mr Maine believes it will be possible to request, for example, Nick
Faldo's winning shots from the US Open and see them from a number of angles
seconds after they have happened. Other possibilities would include allowing
viewers to call up an episode of a serial or soap they have missed for a
small charge or look at a series of travel videos and actually purchase the
holiday using the screens.
BT is talking to a number of potential programme and information providers
including the BBC, Kingfisher and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Mr John Tysoe, telecommunications analyst at Societe Generale Equities
believes BT has high hopes for the system.
He said: 'Sources inside BT are suggesting that video-on-demand could be
worth Pounds 2bn in revenue and perhaps Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m in profit
annually by the end of the century.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Yorks TV chief set to quit today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WARD THOMAS will take over as acting chairman of Yorkshire-TyneTees
television following the resignation, expected today, of Mr Clive Leach, the
chairman and chief executive of the ITV company.
Mr Leach declined to comment last night but an announcement is expected from
Yorkshire today.
It is believed that Mr Thomas and a non-executive director of the company
met Mr Leach on Saturday and told him that the board required his
resignation.
The move follows last week's warning that Yorkshire-TyneTees was likely to
make a pre-tax loss in its 1992/93 financial year instead of an expected
profit.
The problem arises from two factors - attempts to pull forward revenue into
the 1992/93 period by offering heavy discounts on advertising rates and
'overtrading', doing deals from an inflated station average price.
This meant that Yorkshire was in debt to advertisers either in advertising
time or cash.
As a former sales director Mr Leach - one of the more flamboyant executives
in ITV - has been held responsible for the serious financial position at the
company.
The decision that Mr Leach should go was taken at a meeting of non-executive
directors in London on Friday. It is believed that major shareholders such
as Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, would have pushed the issue to an
extraordinary general meeting if Mr Leach had not agreed to resign.
Until a new group chief executive is appointed the two managing directors,
Mr John Fairlie of Yorkshire and Mr John Calvert of TyneTees, will run the
day-to-day affairs of the company.
Pearson is in the final round of bidding to take over Macmillan, the US
publishing company and the largest remaining part of the former empire of
Robert Maxwell to be sold.
Sealed bids for the company have to be submitted by 5pm tomorrow. Apart from
Pearson, the other bidders are expected to include Paramount Communications,
the entertainment group, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovic and K-III, the US
magazine publishers.
Pearson is also interested in adding to its electronic publishing activities
by buying Extel, the information services group which is being sold by

FT  08 NOV 93 / Back-to-basics plea from Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER is seeking to create a coherent framework for
Conservative party policy over the coming months by putting a renewed
emphasis on his belief in restoring traditional social values.
Cabinet ministers have been invited to comment on a six-page letter which Mr
John Major sent them at the weekend, in which he calls for a return to
'common sense' in social policy areas such as education and law and order.
Mr Major has already made clear that the policy, which has been called 'back
to basics', will be the main theme of the new parliamentary session.
It is also clear that it will be at the heart of Conservative campaigning in
next year's local government elections.
By issuing the document, which will not be made public, Mr Major is also
asserting his authority over a cabinet which has been divided over key
aspects of social and economic policy in recent months.
In his speech to the Conservative party conference last month Mr Major spelt
out his belief that society needed to return to core values in law and order
and education. He also attacked the 'political correctness' that has been
associated with left-wing groups, while lauding 'common sense' and family
values.
Downing Street officials said that Mr Major's document was intended to be a
'ready reckoner' which ministers could use when asked about the 'back to
basics' philosophy at public meetings and in media interviews.
A further sign of the growing importance of basic values in the party's
policies came in a speech by Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, at the
weekend, when he outlined their importance in next year's local elections.
He said: 'There is more sense in Hampshire than in Hampstead, in blue rinse
rather than Bloomsbury. We must follow John Major's lead and speak out for
those basic truths which must not be ignored.'

FT  08 NOV 93 / Ministers spurn critics of plan for sick pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS confirmed yester-day that the government plans to cut the amount
of state support given to employers whose staff go on sick leave. The move
comes despite fierce opposition from business people and industrialists who
believe it will add to their labour costs.
Ministers have also said that they plan to cut Pounds 500m off the cost of
state invalidity benefit in the Budget on November 30. The government will
tighten the rules by which patients can receive the benefit, and will
require formal tests by GPs before it can be handed out.
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday it would be 'extremely
concerned' if the government went ahead with the plan for sick pay,
especially as it was evidence of a 'disturbing' trend to shift social costs
from the state on to business.
The CBI said it had not been consulted by the government, and noted that
'employers are just getting used' to the 1991 cut, which saw the
government's share of funding statutory sick pay fall from 100 per cent to
80 per cent.
But ministers said yesterday that they would definitely reduce that level of
support, possibly to 60 per cent of an employer's total contribution.
Officials in Whitehall said that the cut in sick pay support had been
resisted by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who has argued that
it would add to employers' costs when they were trying to emerge from the
recession. Furthermore, the move is surprising in view of the prime
minister's repeated opposition to increasing social protection for
employees. The CBI said the impact on small businesses could be particularly
heavy: 'If a small company was hit by, say, a flu epidemic which affected a
large number of its employees, then there could be a significant impact on
that company's operations and cashflow.'
On invalidity benefit, ministers said that they were aiming to cut the costs
of a budget which has now reached some Pounds 8bn per year, and place
applications for this benefit in a proper framework.
Ms Pauline Thompson, director of the Disablement Income Group, yesterday
conceded that some doctors have used non-medical criteria, such as age or
employment opportunities, when assessing patients.
But she feared that the government was moving towards 'more of an
all-or-nothing system that does not reflect the true facts of disability.'
She said those who would be affected most by tighter criteria were likely to
be borderline cases of 'people whose capacity for work varies.' The
Disablement Income Group had hoped, however, that the government would
introduce a more flexible system, including a partial disability benefit
which would encourage people to return to work, if only for a few hours a
week.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Portillo talks about his generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that
the government needed to prepare younger people for a time when they would
receive fewer benefits than pensioners receive now.
In an interview on ITV's Walden programme, Mr Portillo said he was in favour
of the state continuing to provide services in education and health but he
argued that, over time, the size of state spending, at 45 per cent of GDP,
had to be scaled back.
'People could be told at an early stage that the state could not look after
them as well as they deserved.
'The generation I am talking about is my generation and below. We are people
who ought to be responsible. And we ought to consider what is going to
happen to us in the next century.'
Mr Portillo argued that a growing number of people in Britain were able to
opt out of state-supported benefit schemes because of the growth of personal
wealth.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Nadir threat to sue law officers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive tycoon, said yesterday that he would start
litigation against the police and political figures over accusations that he
was involved in a conspiracy to bribe a judge.
Mr Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck, who fled to Turkish-controlled
northern Cyprus in May to escape Pounds 30m fraud charges, spoke after two
witnesses at the centre of the alleged plot had arrived in the island.
Mr Ali Riza Gorgon, Mr Nadir's lawyer, has declined to disclose where they
are staying, but has said a news conference is planned in the northern
Cyprus town of Kyrenia.
Mr Nadir has rejected allegations of conspiracy to bribe Sir Richard Tucker,
the judge who was to hear the case against him. He said on BBC Television
that he had met the two witnesses - Mr Michael Francis and Ms Wendy Welsher
 -and that their appearance on the scene 'makes life that much more simple
now'.
Mr Nadir said: 'It is my intention in the not too distant future - and I am
talking about a matter of weeks now - to litigate against all the people who
have taken part in this conspiracy.'
This involved numerous organisations: 'Certainly the Serious Fraud Office,
certainly Scotland Yard - and I am talking about the fifth floor (where the
top officers work) - the director of public prosecutions, the
attorney-general, and wherever the responsibility lies; and very likely it
will have to be the Home Office and the home secretary.'
Scotland Yard has described suggestions that officers conspired to fabricate
evidence against Nadir as 'nonsense'.

FT  08 NOV 93 / US Pollution Scandal: Race to move mountain of waste in the
Rockies - When spring melts the winter snow, water carrying toxic heavy
metals could bring death to the streams feeding the Rio Grande
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH UP in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, Hayes Griswold and his team are
racing against time. They are trying to dump 6.5m tonnes of dangerous mining
waste back into the pit it came from. They need to get as much of the work
as possible done before winter sets in, bringing some of the world's
cruellest weather.
They know that if they don't succeed, then in spring, as the snow melts,
1,000 gallons a minute of water polluted with toxic heavy metals will pour
from the waste dump to threaten the streams that feed the Rio Grande River
far below.
This is Summitville, a gold mine that has come to epitomise all the worst
aspects of modern mining.
It is a public relations disaster for the mining industry which has spent
millions of dollars to promote the idea that modern mines do not create
environmental problems. Environmental groups everywhere point to Summitville
as evidence that they do.
It will cost Dollars 25.3m to move the dump at Summitville, tip the waste
back into the pit and treat it with neutralising materials. Another Dollars
5m will be needed to treat the contaminated ground beneath the dump.
The bills are being paid by the US Environmental Protection Agency, Hayes
Griswold's employer. The EPA is spending Dollars 50,000 a day to prevent a
toxic mixture of cyanide and heavy metals spilling from the mine site.
The agency was forced to take emergency action early this year after the
mine's owner, Galactic Resources, a Canadian company, declared itself
bankrupt. But, while narrowly averting an environmental catastrophe, the EPA
was plunged into a financial nightmare. It estimates the final bill for
cleaning up Summitville will be more than Dollars 100m.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is checking out events at the mine,
which within six days of going into production was leaking water
contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals into the headwaters of the
Alamosa River, which supplies water to farms and ranches on its way to the
Rio Grande. Within a year it had poisoned all the fish in a reservoir 15
miles downstream and was corroding irrigation equipment used by farmers in
the valley below.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation is carrying out a parallel inquiry to
establish 'if there have been violations of criminal laws at Summitville'.
US law enables the EPA to claw back money for cleaning up a polluted site
from any person or organisation in any way previously connected with that
site. The agency is investigating whether Vancouver-based Galactic's
bankruptcy means the company and its executives are insulated from these
claw-back provisions.
Among the EPA's prime targets is Robert Friedland, aged 42, the Chicago-born
son of a German architect. For the first six years of the mine's short life
Mr Friedland was chairman of Galactic. For much of that time he was also
president and chief executive. To develop the Summitville mine Mr Friedland
raised more than CDollars 300m (Pounds 147.7m) for Galactic, much of it from
European institutional investors, particularly in Switzerland and the UK.
Today Mr Friedland's main corporate investment vehicle is a Vancouver
investment company, Ivanhoe Capital. He has been promoting Vengold, a
company exploring for gold in Venezuela. He is also negotiating with RTZ,
the UK-based world's biggest mining company, for a stake in the Lihir gold
project in Papua New Guinea. This is probably the biggest gold deposit in
the world outside South Africa.
Mr Friedland has a considerable personal following among some investors. He
helped Vengold raise more than CDollars 50m in North America and Europe this
year, one of the biggest capital-raising exercises by a Vancouver-quoted
company.
He was the executive driving force at Galactic when Summitville was
commissioned.
Local legend has it that gold mining started at Summitville, 12,500 ft up on
the north-east flank of the San Juan mountains, 25 miles south-west of Del
Norte in Rio Grande County, in 1750. The skeletal remains of wooden
buildings from mining activity in the 1870s still cling forlornly to the
mountainside near the huge pit dug by Galactic after mining resumed in 1986.
Galactic used a technique known as cyanide heap leaching to recover gold
from the ore it mined. This process usually starts with the construction of
an impermeable lined pad on the ground. Then heaps of crushed ore are dumped
on the pad and sprinkled with a cyanide solution that leaches the precious
metal from the ore.
It is a process that has been used by the mining industry for many years.
But this was the first time it had been used on such a scale in Colorado or
at such a height.
Cyanide started leaking from the Summitville ore heap almost immediately.
Yet rather than call a halt and order the pad to be repaired, regulators
from Colorado's state Mine Land Reclamation Board allowed Summitville to
collect the contaminated water and pump it back up to the top of the heap.
Thus over-ambitious management, botched construction, reckless mining and
weak state government regulation combined to create one of the biggest
scandals in recent mining history.
Summitville 'will likely be used as a case study of what can go wrong at a
mine site', says a report prepared for a group of mining industry and
environmental organisations.
Summitville, which was set up as a subsidiary of Galactic, claimed that
there was not enough flat land for a conventional heap leach pad. It was
allowed to dam a narrow valley and build a huge heap in it which was
eventually 127 ft deep and spanned 48 acres.
A creek ran through the valley but Galactic simply lined the heap with
plastic and ran a drain under it. It also built an unlined waste pile -
without regulatory approval.
Big problems quickly developed. More water flowed into the heap than flowed
out or evaporated, creating a risk that toxic water would spill over the
top. Acidic water, which dissolved the heavy metals such as copper, zinc and
iron in the waste material, began to flow from the waste pile. Cyanide
started to leak into the creek and from there into the ground water.
The company tried to pump the leaking water back into the heap, but that
raised the water level at an alarming rate. The Colorado authorities
considered closing the mine but were worried about the loss of jobs and
taxes. The state also feared it would be left with the cost of an emergency
clean-up for which there were no state funds. So Summitville was allowed to
continue as long as it installed a water treatment plant.
But the plant could not cope. There were more spills of water laced with
cyanide and heavy metals. The Colorado authorities then gave permission for
contaminated water to be dispersed over 16 acres of nearby land. But
disposal was concentrated in only 5.5 acres of steep mountainside. The
cocktail of cyanide and heavy metals flowed into nearby streams that feed
the rivers below.
The Colorado Department of Health was alerted and when Mr Jim Horn, one of
its inspectors, arrived at the mine, contaminated water was not only flowing
from the land disposal operations but also from nine other unauthorised
discharges.
'Literally, there was 1,000 to 2,000 lbs of heavy metals - iron, zinc and
copper - leaving the site in dissolved form,' he says. 'It was like adding
half a Buick (car) a day to the Whiteman Fork that flows into the Alamosa.
There was no life in the river for 17 miles and no life in the Terrace
Reservoir.'
An anonymous telephone call sent the Environmental Protection Agency rushing
to Summitville in September 1990. The EPA insisted the state authorities
act. Summitville paid Dollars 100,000 in civil penalties (on top of previous
fines totalling Dollars 30,000). As part of the settlement, it started work
on a plan to clean up the site.
By November 1992 this plan was ready - showing the projected cost for the
first phase alone would be Dollars 20m. Neither Summitville nor its owner,
Galactic, which had disposed of all its saleable assets to keep pace with
the mine's financial demands, had that kind of money. Summitville declared
itself bankrupt and said it would quit the site on December 15 1992.
Galactic quickly followed its subsidiary into bankruptcy.
Although Colorado insists that mining companies provide 'clean-up' bonds
before they start operations, Summitville had been asked for only Dollars
7.2m. About Dollars 2.5m of this had been handed back to help finance the
early reclamation work.
With only Dollars 4.7m to cover the clean-up, the state had no choice but to
call on the EPA to use emergency powers to take over the mine. The EPA,
whose income mainly comes from levies on the US chemical and oil industries,
is now footing the bill for the clean-up.
The timing of the Summitville scandal could not be worse for the US mining
industry. President Bill Clinton has promised to change the mining laws,
which date back to 1872 and, some claim, are too favourable to the industry.
The Summitville story is being cited as proof that federal mining laws need
toughening. Mr Phil Hocker, president of the Minerals Policy Centre, a
Washington-based lobbying group, says: 'The mining industry is attempting to
portray Summitville as an isolated, atypical incident. But it is typical of
a whole class of incidents in the US because often the political and
economic power of one industry in one particular state can be so
intimidating that regulators cannot resist it. There is a need for federal
minimum standards to be set for mining.'
This view is reinforced by a report on Summitville for Colorado's natural
resources department by Mr Luke Danielson, a Denver lawyer. This suggests
that permits for the mine were rushed through even before a reclamation plan
had been prepared. Then, just as Summitville's problems were becoming clear,
Colorado drastically cut funding for the mined land reclamation programme,
'leaving it understaffed, demoralised and under-equipped to cope effectively
with a problem of this magnitude and complexity'.
Colorado has already enacted, virtually with no opposition, sweeping reforms
to its state mining laws. 'The political climate has changed. The state is
no longer as tolerant towards the mining industry,' says Mr Alan Salazar at
the state Office of Policy and Initiative.
At the EPA, Mr Robert Duprey, director, waste management division, says:
'The most important lesson from Summitville is that we must have financial
assurances up front from mining companies. And we must have more effective
policing (of their activities). Also, we need a federal permitting process
for dealing with hazardous waste. This should not be left to individual
states. We have a lot of historic mining clean-up to do, we don't want new
ones.'
Environmental activists in California, Montana, Oregon and Washington states
are using the political ammunition provided by Summitville to call for an
end to the use of sodium cyanide in mining, which mining companies say is
essential in some forms of gold and copper mining. The Washington Wilderness
Coalition has coined the telling phrase: 'They take the gold. We keep the
cyanide.'
Summitville has also led to moves towards tighter mining legislation in
Latin America. Mr Oswaldo del Castillo, mining expert at Venezuela's
National Council for Investment Promotion, says: 'It is a relief to us that
Mr Friedland is not involved in mining in Venezuela.'
Mr Friedland says that, because of the various investigations, his lawyers
advise him not to give interviews about Summitville. But in a prepared
statement he said that while he was an officer of Galactic he was never
aware of any improper activity by any employee which would compromise the
environment.
'My primary role was attending to the financial affairs of the company.
There were numerous employees, consultants and government agencies who were
directly involved in technical evaluations and decisions at the mine site. I
am not a mining engineer and I of necessity deferred to the advice and
expertise of these qualified professionals who were engaged to design,
construct and manage the facility.'
Meanwhile, up in the Rocky Mountains, winter is closing in on Hayes Griswold
and his team. If they fail in their efforts to deal with the huge heap of
contaminated ore, the spring will spread Summitville's legacy into the
valleys and fields below.

<TEXT>
THE New Zealand dollar and share prices came under strong selling pressure
this morning, after Saturday's general election produced a 'hung'
parliament, with no party holding a majority of seats in the 99-member,
single-chamber institution.
Shares were down nearly 6 per cent at mid-session, rallying after sharp
falls in the opening minutes of trading. The New Zealand dollar initially
fell almost two US cents to USDollars 0.5390 but later recovered some
ground.
Ms Ruth Richardson, finance minister, said there was no reason for the
result greatly to affect the markets. 'The economic fundamentals which have
brought about a substantially improved performance from the New Zealand
economy remain in place, and should give confidence to investors,' she said.
But the election result surprised pundits and politicians alike, and ran
contrary to opinion polls published in the final week of campaigning. These
suggested that the ruling National party would be returned with a much
reduced but safe majority of 5-10 seats.
In the event, National secured only 49 seats, with the opposition Labour
party garnering 46. The two main minority parties - the Alliance, which is a
coalition of five left-leaning, Green and Maori parties, and New Zealand
First - won two seats each. New Zealanders also voted to change their
electoral system, replacing the current 'first-past-the-post' arrangement by
a form of proportional representation.
Mr Jim Bolger, National party leader, quickly declared there was 'no
constitutional crisis' and said that if the results were confirmed, he would
form a goverment. But by last night, Mr Mike Moore, Labour party leader, was
still refusing to concede defeat and had circulated a five-point plan to
leaders of the two minority parties suggesting areas of policy where the
three groups might have a common interest.
The election result is only tentative at present, as 'special votes' cast by
New Zealanders who were outside their own electorates on Saturday, have yet
to be added in. These traditionally account for about 10 per cent of all
votes cast. Since some seats are held on slim margins, the composition of
parliament could yet change. The final result will not be calculated for at
least 10 days.
Politicians from all four parties sought to soothe market nerves. 'We will
not frustrate the party that has the most votes from governing,' Mr Jim
Anderton, Alliance leader, said last night. His party might, instead, vote
on measures on a case-by-case basis.
'Much of the debate is premature,' commented Mr Winston Peters, head of New
Zealand First, adding that strategies would depend on final results, after
the special votes had been added.
On proportional representation, most opinion polls had indicated that the
decision would be extremely close. But it won soundly, with 54 per cent of
the electorate in favour of this system and 46 per cent against.
The new electoral system was due to come into effect in 1996, when the next
general election would normally be held. But the current uncertainties raise
the question of whether New Zealanders will return to the polls before then
 -and if so, under what system.

FT  08 NOV 93 / FAO sows the seed of a new harvest: Deborah Hargreaves on
election today of a successor in the top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the top jobs in world agriculture will be handed out today when the
169 member countries of the Food and Agriculture Organisation choose between
eight candidates for a new leader.
The vote ends 18 years of close control at one of the United Nations'
biggest agencies by the current incumbent, Mr Edouard Saouma, who is not
standing for re-election. The FAO has become identified with the personal
style of Mr Saouma, who manipulated the rules to get himself re-elected for
three consecutive terms amid mounting criticism of his leadership.
The winner of today's vote will have to move swiftly to re-establish the
organisation's credibility with its primary backers as well as articulate a
vision for its role into the next century.
'It's important that the next director-general has the intellectual
leadership to set the agenda for world agriculture,' says Mr Geoffrey
Miller, Australia's candidate and one of the three front-runners.
Mr Miller could prove a controversial choice with some member states if he
wins the vote, since Australia has shown strong support for free
agricultural trade in the current Uruguay round of multilateral trade
negotiations.
'We've got to change the way countries look at the FAO: developed countries
must see their contributions as an investment with the dividend being an
increase in world trade as the developing world becomes better off,' Mr
Miller says. But he runs the risk of identifying himself too closely with
contributing countries in an organisation where north-south divides are
rife.
The other two leading candidates are both FAO insiders: India's Mr Maharaj
Muthoo, director of FAO forestry operations, and the Chilean assistant
director-general, Mr Rafael Moreno.
European support is expected to be split between three candidates: Mr Gerrit
Braks, a former agriculture minister from the Netherlands, Germany's Mr
Christian Bonte-Friedheim and Mr Patrick Cunningham from Ireland. Other
runners are Mr Salahuddin Ahmed of Bangladesh and Mr Jacques Diouf from
Senegal.
The FAO was set up 48 years ago with the grand aim of 'ensuring humanity's
freedom from hunger', by improving agricultural production and distribution
of food. But today world hunger is as big a problem as ever with around 780m
people daily facing food shortages.
The FAO was criticised for its slow response to the African drought in
recent years. Critics contend that the organisation has lost its way, with
Mr Saouma spending more time on political in-fighting than on setting its
priorities.
'The set-up has allowed the director-general to spend much of his time
cultivating governments so that he can be re-elected,' said Mr John Abbott,
a former FAO employee and author of Politics and Poverty, a critique of the
organisation.
'Projects are approved when they are not useful and are not stopped when
they are not working for fear of offending that country.'
Disaffected Scandinavian countries decided in 1988 to channel much of their
aid through other UN agencies as they were unhappy with the running of the
FAO.
At the same time, some contributors to the FAO's budget including the US and
the UK succeeded in getting the organisation to hone its overheads when they
withheld donations to its Dollars 700m administrative budget. They are now
repaying arrears, but employees still complain about excessive red
tape.
In its defence, the FAO points to a report that it commissioned four years
ago by a group of independent experts which gave it a clean bill of health
and, in particular, did not recommend pulling out of any of its projects
world wide.
The organisation has scored some notable successes in its battle against
world hunger. It played an important role in the green revolution in Asia
which achieved a 77 per cent increase in crop yields over 15 years. In
recent years it has introduced programmes to conserve plant genes and attack
agricultural pests such as locusts.
But the criticism has ensured that most candidates for the top job are
campaigning on a cautious reform ticket.
'We need austerity, cost-effectiveness and efficiency in using taxpayers'
money,' says Mr Muthoo from India. His views are echoed by Mr Miller, who
says he wants to look at all aspects of the FAO's operations over the next
two years with a view to instituting change in time for the organisation's
50th anniversary in 1995.
Mr Moreno, who has lined up most Latin American countries behind his
candidature, talks of tightening some administrative procedures and
deploying more funds in eastern Europe.
As well as its Dollars 700m administrative budget, the FAO has another
Dollars 700m to deploy in aid, but in this it often overlaps with other UN
agencies. For this reason, Mr Abbott believes the FAO should return to its
original role of gathering information and giving advice to developing
countries on how to spend their aid rather than running its own projects.
The body has an undeniable wealth of expertise on world agriculture which is
facing a raft of problems associated with intensive farming such as soil
erosion, over-grazing and lack of water. The FAO needs to get its near 3,000
experts out of their plush Rome headquarters by the baths of Caracalla and
into the field if it is to find a future role for itself in a world growing
weary of UN bureaucracies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN SENIOR American official yesterday began talks with Pakistani leaders,
amid speculation that the two countries were making fresh efforts to resolve
their differences over the nuclear issue.
Ms Robin Raphael, assistant secretary of state for south Asia, arrived in
Islamabad over the weekend for talks with the government of Ms Benazir
Bhutto, the prime minister. She is the most senior US official to have
visited the country since last month's elections.
The visit comes after a recent call from Mr Wasim Sajjad, Pakistan's acting
president, for improved relations with Washington. The US cut off all
military and economic aid to Pakistan three years ago over concerns that
Islamabad had a covert programme to develop nuclear weapons.
However, Pakistan denies the charge, and claims its nuclear programme is
only for peaceful purposes. Islamabad has been reluctant unilaterally to
ratify the NPT or any other treaty preventing nuclear proliferation unless
New Delhi agrees to do the same.
In the latest diplomatic controversy between the two countries, the US
imposed sanctions on China and Pakistan this summer after allegations that
Beijing had supplied the M-11 missile to Islamabad. However, during her
recent election campaign, Ms Bhutto said repeatedly that she wanted to 'end
Pakistan's international isolation', widely interpreted as a commitment to
seek improved ties with the US.
Ms Raphael is also expected to discuss recent events in India-controlled
Kashmir, which have created fresh tensions between India and Pakistan, and
narcotics trafficking.
A diplomatic row erupted between India and the US last month when Ms Raphael
described Kashmir as 'a disputed territory'. New Delhi claims the area is an
integral part of India. Pakistani officials have welcomed the US position.
'Robin Raphael's visit will primarily focus on the nuclear issue but Kashmir
and narcotics trafficking will also not rpt not be too far down the agenda,'
said a senior Pakistani official yesterday.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Immigration route to labour market flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors should, by now, be putting the finishing touches to his
review of employment and competitiveness in Europe. The Commission
President's brief is to explain why US employment grew by an average 2.1 per
cent a year over the period 1982-90 while EC employment rose by just 0.9 per
cent a year. But it is in Europe, not America, where the more radical labour
market changes are now afoot. The flood of immigrant labour from eastern to
western Europe since the end of the Cold War may already be delivering a
solution to Mr Delors' problem.
In the early 1970s, the average number of asylum seekers arriving in western
Europe was 30,000 per year. By the late 1980s, the annual figure had
surpassed 400,000. But, as UN High Commissioner for refugees Sadako Ogata
points out, the end of the Cold War and the collapse of Yugoslavia increased
that number to 690,000 last year. Germany, the country to which the UN
estimates the bulk of Yugoslav refugees have gone, has seen its number of
asylum-seekers increase from 121,000 in 1989 to 439,000 in 1992.*
These political refugees, coupled with new economic migrants from the east
and south, are adding to a rising trend. By 1990, the OECD estimated that
the percentage of non-nationals in western Europe had doubled in a decade.
In fact, almost all of these immigrants come from other European countries -
the percentage of non-EC citizens living in EC countries in 1991 was just
2.8 per cent, compared to nearer 10 per cent in the US. But, when figures
for the early 1990s are finally released, the convulsions to the east will
have boosted that figure significantly.
This influx of new workers looks, at first sight, to be bad news for
European countries who are already trying to cope with high unemployment
rates. Yet the US had faster employment growth in the 1980s despite facing
an influx of migrants which was even more dramatic: counting illegal
immigrants, the immigrant share of the US labour force rose from 6.9 per
cent in 1980 to 9.3 per cent in 1988.
In fact, immigration into the US appears to be an important part of the
explanation for America's impressive job creation record in the 1980s.
Employment in the US rose rapidly in the 1980s because US workers were much
more willing to accept service sector jobs at increasingly low wages: US
real average wages barely rose over the decade while the wages of the
poorest 10 per cent fell by almost a third.
Research conducted by George Borjas, Richard Freeman and Lawrence Katz for
the US National Bureau of Economic Research confirm that the entry of
substantial numbers of relatively unskilled migrants, combined with
increased trade penetration, was an important for this fall in unskilled
wages. A disproportionate number were poorly educated: 36 per cent of
immigrant were recorded as high school drop-outs in 1988 compared to 15.3
per cent of native men. This inflow of new immigrants, willing to take jobs
at low wages, also helps explain why the US was able to combine job creation
with rising joblessness among ex-manufacturing workers.
Yet this source of labour market flexibility - encouraging east and south
European immigrants to beat down west European wages - will have rather
unpleasant consequences for unskilled workers in the west. Not surprisingly,
survey evidence does not suggest that Europe's population is too happy about
this new immigration.
Survey evidence also shows that it is the fear of unemployment at home,
rather than higher wages abroad, which drives economic migrants. So freeing
up trade with eastern Europe may be the best way to control the flow of
migrants, at the expense of slower employment growth in the west. But free
trade will not do much for Bosnian refugees. Like it or not, immigration is
one element of the US labour market model which western European is going to
embrace.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Investment in China set to top Dollars 100bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA EXPECTS contracted foreign investment to exceed Dollars 100bn (Pounds
66bn) this year for the first time. This would represent an increase in
planned investment nearly double that of last year.
An official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
(Moftec) said that in the first nine months of this year Dollars 15bn of
foreign investment had been utilised.
Funds invested since China opened for business to the outside world in 1979
now exceeded Dollars 50bn. Total contracted investment in the past 14 years
was nearing Dollars 200bn. More than 150,000 individual projects had been
approved, but many of these were tiny enterprises like restaurants and small
processing units.
However, the Moftec official said, 'more larger-sized projects with advanced
technology' were being initiated and more investment was being directed
towards infrastructure.
Other new developments included a tendency for more foreign businesses to
put their funds in inland areas. The growth of investment in China's
hinterland from a low base was now much higher than in coastal regions.
China was also opening new fields on a 'trial basis' to foreign investors,
including finance, insurance, retail businesses and construction.
The official said that about 50,000 enterprises with foreign involvement
were now operating, employing 5m Chinese. Most of these were 'well-run and
make a profit'.
Chinese economists are predicting that inflation in China will moderate to
about 10 per cent next year compared with 14 per cent in the first three
quarters of this year.
They are also forecasting that the country's growth will slow in 1994 to 10
per cent from the 13.3 per cent recorded in the nine months to September.
This would still be higher than the targeted 8-9 per cent.
The report, prepared by the Academy of Social Sciences and the State
Statistical Bureau, was optimistic about prospects in the coming year.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Hosokawa seeks reform meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, wants to settle a debate over
political reform by calling a meeting this week with Mr Yohei Kono, the
leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
Several weeks of inconclusive negotiations between government and opposition
have led Mr Hosokawa to fear that political reform is in serious danger of
derailment, and he wants outstanding issues to be settled this week.
Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if reforms are not introduced this
year, and there were signs at the weekend that he is frustrated by lack of
progress. He said the policy differences 'are not great' and a meeting with
Mr Kono could end most of them.
Under the proposed reforms, the present multi-seat constituency system will
be replaced by a blend of single seats and proportional representation.
However, the government and opposition disagree on the ratio of seats to be
decided by the two methods.
The multi-seat constituency system is blamed for encouraging corruption
during the 38-year rule of the LDP, whose factions competed against each
other in the same constituency to raise campaign funds and establish
networks of influence.
However, the reform proposals are opposed by many members of the Social
Democratic party, the largest group in Mr Hosokawa's coalition, as they fear
that the party will be the biggest loser under the new system and that the
LDP will benefit from the changes.
The LDP is also divided over the proposals, as older members of the party
are concerned that they will lose influence and, perhaps, their seats in the
new system. In public, these members offer vague support for reform, but, in
private, they are behind the stalling that has prompted Mr Hosokawa to call
for a meeting with Mr Kono.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Japan makes wartime apology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S coalition government has issued a clear apology to South Korea for
the brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula, ending many years of dispute
over the vague expressions of regret by past Japanese leaders, writes Robert
Thomson in Tokyo.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, told Mr Kim Young-sam, the
South Korean president, that Japanese forces were 'assailants', and that he
had 'heartfelt remorse' for the suffering inflicted on Koreans during the
colonial occupation from 1910 until 1945.
He said Japan had inflicted 'intolerable pain and sorrow' on Koreans when
'they were deprived of being able to learn their mother tongue', ordered to
adopt Japanese names, and forced to submit to sex with Japanese troops.
Many past Japanese apologies have included obscure language that did not
make clear which country was responsible for aggression and did not specify
the types of suffering inflicted on Koreans, as Mr Hosokawa did in his
meeting with Mr Kim in South Korea.
Mr Kim said the new Japanese prime minister had done what leaders of the
Liberal Democratic party, which governed Japan for 38 years, 'did not dare
to do', and relations between the two countries had begun a fresh chapter.
He said the two nations should now be able to view each other as real
neighbours. cally distant.
The two men see each other as leading their countries into a new era, as Mr
Kim's election ended a long line of military leaders in South Korea, while
Mr Hosokawa's coalition replaced the long-serving LDP and is attempting to
overhaul the Japanese political system.
Since taking office, Mr Hosokawa has argued that Japan must make clear its
wartime guilt before the country can play a larger political role in Asia,
where many countries have remained wary of Japanese intentions.
Apart from dealing with the past, the two leaders encouraged North Korea to
submit to international inspections to end lingering suspicions about its
alleged programme to develop nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
NORTH Korea 'cannot be allowed to build a nuclear bomb,' President Bill
Clinton asserted yesterday, and any attack by the north on South Korea will
be considered an attack on the US itself.
In a morning television interview which touched on several controversial
aspects of foreign policy, the president refused to discuss specific options
now under consideration, such as a possible pre-emptive strike against North
Korea's nuclear clear facilities. But he added, grimly, 'this is a very
grave issue'.
He said US relations with North Korea were at 'a difficult moment'. He used
similar words to describe Pyongyang's own current position, including its
political isolation, its big economic problems and its patent uncertainty
over whether to negotiate closer ties with South Korea or to remain
threatening towards it.
There was some disagreement, he said, inside his administration about the
best policy, but there had been extensive consultations with governments in
Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing - 'who are helping us to work through this'.
He did not comment on reports that North Korean troops had been massing just
north of the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas. But he noted that
US forces were stationed in the DMZ and stood ready to rebut any assault.
Their engagement, he said, demonstrated that any offensive against South
Korea meant that the US would automatically be involved.
On other issues, Mr Clinton argued that the US was 'trying to strike the
right balance' in its relations with China. He had been 'firmer and colder'
than his predecessor on human rights and weapons sales disagreements but he
was pleased with the 'consistent' US approach on the economic front and with
the emergence of the US as a growing market for Chinese exports.
'We believe that market reforms and decentralisation will promote democracy'
in China, he said.
Mr Clinton said his preferred course on Haiti was to tighten the sanctions
against the military regime in Port-au-Prince and he urged other nations to
follow the US in freezing the assets of its leaders. But he did not rule out
widening the oil and arms embargo.
Nor did he absolutely exclude a US invasion to restore to power Mr
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president. Comparisons, however, could
not be drawn with the US invasion of Panama in 1989 because of the absence
of any Haitian request for such action. He also refused to criticise the
Central Intelligence Agency for providing Congress with a report questioning
Mr Aristide's mental stability and commitment to democracy.
Generally, Mr Clinton expressed full confidence in his foreign policy team.
Some of the attacks on Mr Warren Christopher and Mr Les Aspin, secretaries
of state and defence, were 'quite unfair.'
He acknowledged three 'inherited' problems in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, but
was pleased with progress made on Russia, the Middle East, on raising the
profile on economic security issues and in reforming the Pentagon.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JORDANIANS go to the polls today in the kingdom's first multi-party
elections for nearly four decades. More than 550 candidates and 15 political
parties are vying for seats in the 80-member lower house of parliament.
In spite of what many observers have described as a lacklustre campaign, the
turnout is expected to be high. Nearly 1.2m people have collected their
voting cards which is more than twice the number who voted in the last
elections in 1989, when candidates ran as independents rather than for
parties.
King Hussein has urged voters to show moderation and common sense when
choosing their MP. 'Let us be on a high level of responsibility and caution
so as not to fall for the crackle of loud voices, fake glittering slogans,
or words of good meant to be bad,' he said in a speech to members of
Jordan's centre for democratic studies and research, which was later
broadcast.
The government has tried to improve voting procedures. On Sunday, police
officers were each assigned a ballot box and ordered to guard it until its
contents had been counted and checked tomorrow. Tight security will be
enforced during voting with around 16,000 police officers for the 2,906
polling stations. A ban on small firearms will be strictly enforced to
prevent celebrators shooting in the air if their candidate wins.
Officials at the Ministry of Interior, which is overseeing the election, say
they intend to outsmart candidates who might have paid in cash or kind for
votes. In the 1989 elections, bribed voters had to feign illiteracy at the
ballot box and call out loud their preferred MP. In this way representatives
of candidates, who are present in each voting station, could monitor the
paid-up votes.
This time 'illiterate' voters will be interrogated and candidates'
representatives forbidden from entering or leaving the voting station until
the ballot is over. However, there have been numerous accusations of
vote-buying with rates varying from 50-150 Jordanian dinars (Pounds
48-Pounds 144) per vote.
All eyes will be on how many seats the Moslem fundamentalists win. The
Islamic Action Front, which is the biggest and most prominent political
party standing in the elections, has 36 candidates in 16 out of the 20
voting districts. Despite a controversial change in the election law aimed
at reducing the number of fundamentalists in the next parliament, they are
expected to be the largest group as in 1989.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Freedom ferry for Staten Island: A New York drive for
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGEST garbage dump in the US lies on the western shores of Staten
Island, the smallest of New York city's five boroughs.
Every day, hundreds of lorries rumble across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge
with tonnes of rubbish destined for the landfill, known rather ominously as
Fresh Kills.
Not surprisingly, it has become a metaphor for the borough's rocky
relationship with the rest of the city. Most Staten Islanders feel the city
treats their home turf like a dumping ground, literally and figuratively.
'They dump their trash on us. They dump their homeless here, and when they
want to build a jail, they build it here,' says Mr Jim Groffer, a resident
for 38 years.
His litany encapsulates the anger and frustration felt by many of Staten
Island's mostly white and middle class population towards New York. Last
week, Mr Groffer and like-minded Staten Islanders hit back. By a two-to-one
majority, they voted to secede from the Big Apple and establish their own
city.
With a population comparable with that of Atlanta, Miami or Minneapolis, an
independent Staten Island would shed its status of New York city's forgotten
step-child. A borough which Manhattan sophisticates either laugh at or
ignore would finally gain a measure of respect.
Independence for Staten Island still faces formidable obstacles. Last
Tuesday's referendum merely approved a proposed structure for the island's
government. The more difficult task of setting the terms of the divorce lies
ahead.
As a first step, the Staten Island Charter Commission is charged with
drafting a specific proposal on disengaging the island from the city. Within
three months, it must present its plan for approval by the state
legislature.
Before that occurs, protracted negotiations with the city and careful
political manoeuvering in Albany, the New York state capital, are expected.
The final say rests with the governor, Mr Mario Cuomo, who has veto power.
The charter commission is hoping to complete the process in a year or two,
but others estimate it could take 4-6 years.
Ironically, Fresh Kills is likely to be the most coveted asset in the
negotiations. The economic viability of independence could hinge on whether
the city or Staten Island wins title to the dump.
If the island's claim succeeds, it could charge New York city millions of
dollars in tipping fees annually, says Mr Thomas Cocola, press secretary to
the borough's president, Mr Guy Molinari. The revenue could prove critical.
An early study of the finances of secession estimated the island gets
Dollars 170m more in services from the city than it pays in taxes, raising
the prospect of a doubling or tripling in property rates if the island goes
it alone. It found that the island's residents were in effect subsidised by
revenues generated by taxing large corporations based in Manhattan.
That economic reality does not square with the perception of many Staten
Islanders, who feel short-changed. Many parts of the borough - just a
20-minute ferry ride from the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan - still have no
sewers. There are no subway lines and only one train. Residents complain
garbage collection is less frequent than in other boroughs.
Furthermore, subsequent studies, released just before the referendum,
suggest that the economic bite may not be as painful as initially thought.
In the vote for New York city mayor, Staten Islanders, concerned over crime
and other so-called 'quality of life' issues, supported the Republican, Mr
Rudolph Guiliani, a former federal prosecutor, by a four-to-one margin.
Without the borough, he would have lost to Mr David Dinkins, the city's
first black chief executive.
Given the political arithmetic, the mayor-elect is sure to work hard at
fulfilling his campaign pledge to be more sensitive to the borough's needs,
with an eye towards taking the steam out of the secessionist drive. But with
last week's overwhelming vote Staten Islanders signalled they were in no
mood to turn back.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Jews vow to avenge death of settler
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JEWISH settlers vowed yesterday to step up their efforts to disrupt
Palestinian daily life in the Israeli-occupied territories after Palestinian
gunmen killed one settler and injured a former right-wing member of
parliament in an attack near the West Bank town of Hebron.
Hundreds of settlers immediately took to the streets of the West Bank in
protest, blocking main roads, burning Arab cars and wrecking a number of
Palestinian shops, and members of the parliamentary opposition called for
the suspension of peace talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.
These calls were ignored by the government, which said last night that the
negotiations would resume today in Cairo. The talks, held at the Egyptian
beach resort of Taba, were suspended last Tuesday by the PLO negotiators,
who claimed that Israel was offering only a redeployment of forces in Gaza
and Jericho rather than full withdrawal.
Quoting the outline treaty which frames the negotiations, Mr Nabil Shaath,
who will head the Palestinian delegation at today's talks, said in Cairo
yesterday that the treaty 'says that redeployment takes place in addition to
the withdrawal in Gaza and Jericho. That's very clear.' The talks would
focus on differences of interpretation surrounding Israeli undertakings.
This week's meeting, however, appears to represent talks about talks rather
than a full resumption of the Taba negotiations.
Yesterday's attack, for which the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement
claimed responsibility, killed Mr Haim Ayubi, a 30-year-old father of four.
He was the eleventh Israeli to be killed by Palestinians since the PLO
autonomy accord two months ago.
He died early yesterday morning, when the car he was driving was riddled
with bullets fired from a passing vehicle. His passenger, Rabbi Haim
Druckman, a former National Religious Party member of parliament and a
leading settler idealogue, was hit in the arm and shoulder.
The settlers were last night laying plans to block all main roads in the
occupied territories this morning. Castigating the government for failing to
protect them, a settlers' spokesman vowed that the occupied territories
'would roar and tremble' until the attacks ceased.
Israeli newspapers yesterday carried reports of progress in the country's
talks with Jordan, with claims that Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign
minister, held nine hours of talks last week in Amman with King Hussein,
that the two men initialled various 'understandings', but that Jordan would
not sign a full peace treaty with Israel until the Syrians were also ready
to sign.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Sweden shows effects of painful cure: Efforts to reform the
ailing welfare system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN ran out of influenza vaccine this month, well before winter had
exerted its icy grip. The shortage captured headlines at a time when the
country's much-vaunted welfare system is under enormous strain and is often
said to be breaking down in the face of recession and political pressure for
reform.
The shortage was not, in fact, a shocking sign that the health service had
run out of money for vaccines. But it was directly linked to changes under
way in Sweden's welfare system for several years, shaking its structure more
dramatically than at any time since its construction was completed in the
1960s and 1970s.
In the case of the influenza vaccine, reforms earlier this year in sick pay
regulations, placing responsibility for payment for the first two weeks off
work on the employer, not the state as before, led to an unforeseen surge in
demand for innoculations as employers organised vaccination programmes to
keep down sick pay costs.
Reforms in the sick-leave system have helped produce a more significant
effect in the economy as a whole: in the past three years absenteeism in
Sweden, once a chronic problem, has fallen sharply, from levels where three
out of 10 workers were off 'sick' at any time, to less than one in 10 today.
But rapid growth in unemployment, from less than 5 per cent to more than 13
per cent today, has probably been the most important factor in falling
absenteeism, as fear of job losses has sharpened the incentive to work hard.
This indicates a wider question about the changes in the Swedish welfare
system. To what extent have they been forced on the country by economic
recession, or have been adopted because of broad recognition that the system
had to be reformed to regenerate the economy? When the economy finally picks
up, will 'the Swedish model', however battered, be patched up more or less
in its old form, or are deep structural reforms going to render it
unrecognisable?
The answer probably lies somewhere in between. By the end of the 1980s, the
sheer scale of the public sector in Sweden, and the taxes needed to support
it, had become unsustainable, especially when compounded by economic
downturn. Cash transfers and funding of the health and education systems
grew to 33 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 24 per cent in
Britain. The tax take in 1987 was 55 per cent of GNP, compared to an OECD
average of 40 per cent.
The subsequent crisis has been so great, with the budget deficit climbing
inexorably to a forecast 15 per cent of GNP next year, that the Social
Democratic party, the architect of the welfare state, has not only
acknowledged the need for reforms, but actively participated in them.
Before losing office in 1991 to the right-centre coalition of Prime Minister
Carl Bildt, the Social Democrats, under their present leader Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, had began the process of cutting Sweden's huge marginal tax rates
and have since gone along with reforms such as the changes in sick pay. Mr
Bo Goransson, a Social Democratic expert on the welfare state, says the
'welfare equation' shifted from a viable balance where 55 per cent of people
in work supported the 45 per cent who were not productive. But the position
today, where only 48 per cent of the population are working, cannot sustain
the old welfare system.
To shift the balance back again, the Social Democrats are prepared for more
reforms - for example in the generous state pension system - to generate
more incentives to work and for employment creation. These, says Mr
Goransson, could be radical.
But the party has pledged to preserve and defend the essentials of the
system. 'We want to make it more visible and autonomous with more direct
links between what you pay and what you get. The redistributive element in
the system won't be so dominant, but the Social Democrats want it to
continue,' says Mr Goransson.
For the time being, to an outsider, Sweden still preserves a great deal of
its welfare provisions: cuts in unemployment benefit still leave dole levels
at 80 per cent of salary; child day care is universally available and
charges are low compared to private systems; generous maternity/paternity
leave is still in place.
On the tax side, employers' social security contributions remain above 30
per cent of employee salaries and marginal income tax of 50 per cent kicks
in at around Dollars 25,000 a year. The standard rate of VAT is 25 per cent.
Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party would like to take the process of
reform much further. Mr Olav Ehrenkrona, the prime minister's top domestic
policy adviser, talks of extending competition in almost all areas
monopolised by the state, including health and education. 'The problem is a
question of national competitiveness,' he said. 'How do you have overall
conditions that enhance growth and productivity? We have a long way to go
before we have an efficient service sector.'
He says it will be a gradual but inevitable process. But his vision is by no
means shared by political opponents. The extent to which the Swedish welfare
model is ultimately refined or restructured will not be clear at least until
after next year's election.
Previous articles in this series on welfare states across the world were

FT  08 NOV 93 / Brittan urges basic competition rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the European Community trade commissioner, this weekend
called on the OECD nations to intensify efforts to establish internationally
agreed minimum competition rules.
The aim should be to develop a legal order in which the whole world could
enjoy the benefits of effective competition law and policy, rendering the
cruder instruments of trade policy otiose.
But, giving the first Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton seminar on European
Law at Oxford University, he warned that this had to remain a very long-term
objective.
The history of the EC showed that to abandon trade instruments totally you
had to have a community - a group of countries coming together sufficiently
closely for them to be capable of being described as having pooled
sovereignty.
Japan and the US would never agree to such a pooling of sovereignty. Even if
agreement could be reached on the competition rules, agreement on a
worldwide independent competition agency to enforce them would be
impossible.
But that did not mean the extension of competition policy into the trade
area was not possible at all, he said.
Sir Leon said as a first step an attempt should be made through Gatt to
agree rules covering cartels distinguishing between acceptable industrial
co-operation and unacceptable restrictive practices.
A similar approach should be adopted to mergers. Rather than attempting to
establish a supranational body to vet mergers, efforts should be
concentrated on developing a core of common rules and a commitment to
enforce them.

<TEXT>
THE Greek foreign minister, Mr Carolos Papoulias, yesterday started a tour
of Balkan capitals aimed at underlining Greece's commitment to stability in
the region.
Greece's new Socialist government is anxious to repair relations with its
Balkan neighbours, which were damaged by the emergence of a strongly
nationalist faction in the previous administration. Mr Papoulias will be
sounding out his counterparts on how their links with the European Community
could be improved when Greece takes over the EC presidency in January.
Greece is particularly keen to restore ties with Albania, where the
government has stepped up discrimination against the ethnic Greek minority.
In Belgrade today, Mr Papoulias will come under pressure from President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to try to get UN sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia eased. However, Greece's stated aim of becoming a force for
regional stability is viewed with suspicion by western partners, given the
new government's decision to maintain its predecessor's close relationship
with Serbia.
Moreover, Mr Papoulias has not included Skopje, the Macedonian capital, in
his visits.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE attempted overthrow of Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of
state, by forces of the former President Zviad Gamsakurdia, appears over
following the fall of the main Gamsakurdia base of Zugdidi at the weekend.
Spokesmen for the Georgian government said that Mr Gamsakurdia with 1,000 of
his followers had fled to the town of Gali, in the neighbouring region of
Abkhazia - already under rebel control and a self-declared independent
state. However, the Abkhazian authorities in Moscow denied the claim.
The revolt against Mr Shevardnadze, launched last month after the Georgian
leader's forces had been forced out of Abkhazia in the west of the country,
resulted in Russian troops being sent to guard supply routes and railways
and in Georgia seeking to join the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of
Independent States to secure assistance.
Mr Givi Lominadze, head of the interim administration in western Georgia,
told the Interfax news agency that a curfew had been imposed in Zugdidi
because rebels were still active in the area.
The Russian assistance has come with strings - including the likely use of
the port of Poti, briefly in Mr Gamsakurdia's hands, by Russian naval
forces. Russian marines landed at Poti last week and have secured the town
while Russian detachments are already stationed in the port of Adjaria.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Serbs release UN hostages in Bosnia

THREE Swedish UN soldiers were released yesterday after being taken hostage
by Serb forces at a village in central Bosnia.
Clashes between Moslem and Croat forces were reported to have escalated
after UN commanders successfully negotiated the release of the soldiers, who
were seized south-east of Vares, the town which fell to the mainly Moslem
Bosnian army forces last week.
Major Hakan Birgir, company commander of the Nordic battalion, said the
three soldiers were released unharmed after being seized at Dastansko, near
Vares. It was not immediately clear why the Serb soldiers abducted the UN
soldiers or how their release was negotiated.
The entire group of some 30 UN soldiers was said to have had difficulty
extricating itself from the village after setting out to help about 500
Croats hiding from surrounding Moslem soldiers.
About 15,000 Croats last week fled the region after Moslem troops gained
ground against their Croat adversaries. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
yesterday appealed to the Croats to return to their homes in Vares, now
controlled by the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, according to Sarajevo radio.
Meanwhile, Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister, yesterday criticised
the UN for failing to protect the Moslem enclaves designated six months as
international 'safe areas'.
UN officials say Serb forces have stepped up their attacks on the eastern
towns of Gorazde and Srebrenica, two of six UN 'safe areas'. Serb forces
still block materials needed to provide shelter for refugees.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Turkey, EC press on with customs union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and the European Community meet today in Brussels to agree a final
negotiating timetable to take Turkey into a customs union with the EC in
1995, marking the biggest change in economic relations between the two sides
in 30 years.
Mrs Tansu Ciller's government, despite misgivings from domestic industry, is
committed to reach the deadline, by which Turkey will lower import tariffs
to zero and adopt the Community's common external tariff for third
countries.
This will mark a substantial advance on Turkey's existing association
agreement with the Community, signed in Ankara in 1963 and refined with an
additional protocol signed in 1970.
Today's meeting of the EC-Turkey Association Council attended by Turkish
foreign minister Hikmet Cetin and his counterparts from the Twelve, will
also draft an agenda to bring Turkish trade and commercial law into closer
convergence with those of the EC. The legislation will include intellectual
property rights, state aid and competition policy.
The Community accounts for around half of Turkey's exports and two-way trade
with the EC is set to exceed Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.2bn) in 1993. Turkey is
already the ninth most important EC export market.
However, in a customs union, Turkish industry is set to face increased
competition from imports. Last month, for the first time, Turkey used a
meeting of the Turkish EC joint parliamentary group to urge the EC to come
up with financial compensation - an issue which is set to dog the final
round of negotiations which formally gets under way today.
On the fiscal side, Ankara calculates the likely loss of tax revenues at
around Dollars 3bn a year, at a time when its budget is under strain. The
increase in imports would add Dollars 1.5-Dollars 2bn to Turkey's already
large trade deficit, the government reckons. Key industries such as autos,
white goods and processed foods may not survive the increased imports from
the EC - and from eastern European countries as Turkey adopts the common
external tariff.
Greece has hitherto used its veto to block all Community assistance to
Turkey. Currently the only EC budget assistance to Turkey is under the
Renovated Mediterranean Policy, an EC aid programme designed more to staunch
the flow of refugees from Maghreb countries than to help Turkey.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Loyal Kohl lieutenant maps out vision: Personal trial seems
to have deepened Wolfgang Schauble's ability to examine and expound the
crucial issues facing united Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WOLFGANG SCHAUBLE, effectively second-in-command in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrat party, gently ducks a question on whether his
health would permit him, one day, to become the leader of Germany.
Mr Schauble, confined to a wheelchair after an assassination attempt three
years ago, says he never thinks about the question. The man named in 1991 by
Mr Kohl himself as his heir apparent says he 'loves' his present job as
chairman of the conservative parliamentary group in the Bundestag.
Despite the struggle faced by the CDU in next year's elections, Mr Schauble
says 98 per cent of the party is behind Mr Kohl. 'Some may find this boring,
but this is a form of boredom I am glad to live with.'
For all his self-deprecation, Mr Schauble, in an hour-long interview with FT
editors during a visit to London last week, underlined his credentials as
the most incisive and intellectually capable member of Mr Kohl's governing
team.
His personal trial seems to have deepened his ability to examine and expound
the crucial issues facing united Germany. This talent may stand him and his
party in good stead during the gruelling run-up to general elections in
October 1994.
Asked about the competitive challenge for the German economy, burdened by
recession and reunification, Mr Schauble says: 'There is justification to
the criticism that we didn't understand soon enough (after unification) how
difficult the changes would be. . . . But the people now understand that
changes are inevitable, that we have to become more competitive.'
Unpopular government moves to cut budget outlays on social security, or to
deregulate the labour market, are bound to cause 'a great deal of
resistance' in the election campaign. 'In some ways that will help us to
make clear to people what this election will be about.'
One of the most divisive political issues is Mr Kohl's backing of Mr Steffen
Heitmann, justice minister from the east German state of Saxony, in the
election for federal president next year. Mr Schauble takes care not to
register any distaste for the choice. 'Heitmann is our candidate (for the
presidency). We do not change our candidate every four weeks.'
But he also hints at readiness to compromise with the opposition Social
Democrats. 'If the SPD would say they withdraw their candidate (Mr Johannes
Rau, the prime minister of North-Rhine Westphalia) we would not say we were
not ready to talk to them (about a joint candidate). But this is a fully
unrealistic assumption."
On European integration, Mr Schauble says economic and monetary union (Emu)
is still 'practicable'. The EC's choice of Frankfurt to host the forerunner
of the European central bank was 'very important' in improving the German
electorate's readiness to give up the D-Mark, he says.
Emu is, however, likely to remain difficult to accept for the German people
so long as Europe fails to deliver conclusive evidence that it is 'useful
and necessary.' The conflict in former Yugoslavia has made the Germans more
sceptical about European co-operation. 'How can I tell people at home we
should abandon the D-Mark for a currency union, when Europe is not in a
position to stop a war?'
Whatever form the European Union eventually takes, Mr Schauble says EC
members will not lose their 'state-like quality'.
Mr Schauble emphasises his agreement with Britain in matters like the need
to streamline the Commission and to make decision-making in the council of
ministers more effective after new members join the EC.
Asked to outline his best hopes for Europe in 2000, he spells out four
essential themes. The former Communist countries in eastern Europe should be
sufficiently developed, in economic and political terms, 'so as not to pose
a danger for European stability.' He is confident that the EC will have
improved its economic competitiveness.
He hopes the security partnership with the US will remain intact. And -
'here I stretch my optimism to the limits' - he hopes for 'positive news on
the development of democracy' in Russia.
Intriguingly, in his four-point end-of-the-century vision, economic and
monetary union does not get a mention. Surely not merely because he gave it
in London, Mr Schauble's answer could have come from Mr John Major.

<TEXT>
WESTERN nations expect to conclude by the end of the year a new multilateral
control regime for technology exports including Russia, officials in Oslo
said yesterday.
Members of Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (Cocom)
met in Oslo last week where they made 'good progress' on establishing a
replacement to Cocom. This was the body established in 1951 to restrict
exports of high-technology goods of potential military or strategic value to
the Communist bloc countries.
The main outstanding issue yet to be finalised is whether Russia would have
to establish an effective export control system as a prerequisite for
joining any new entity, officials said.
The Oslo meeting was a follow-up to an appeal made by President Bill Clinton
in April after his Vancouver summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. Mr
Clinton called for a review of Cocom, noting that the end of the cold war
had made Russia an ally.
Mr Arthur Knudsen, an official with the Norwegian ministry of trade,
confirmed meetings of the 17-member western nation Cocom were held in Oslo
last Wednesday, but refused to be drawn on details of the talks. 'We made
good progress, but details cannot yet be revealed because nothing is yet
finalised,' Mr Knudsen said yesterday.
He would not say where or when new meetings could be expected to be held,
but said the replacement to Cocom would be finalised before the end of the
year. 'We will have a conclusion on these talks very soon,' Mr Knudsen
added.
The Clinton administration is the main thrust behind concluding the talks by
the end of the year, according to officials.
Since the end of the second world war Russia has been the main target of
restrictions on high technology exports to Communist nations under the Cocom
regime. Some of the restrictions have been relaxed but others are still in
place.
Last Thursday, in an interview with the German magazine Stern, President
Yeltsin urged western nations to abolish Cocom's discriminatory trade
restrictions. 'After all Russia is not a Communist country; we are carrying
out fundamental reforms, we are moving quickly to the market,' Mr Yeltsin
said.
Although Cocom's role in monitoring sensitive exports to Communist states
has been diminishing since the end of the cold war, there remain fears that
such exports may make their way into hands of terrorists or be purchased by
nations seeking illicitly to develop nuclear weapons.

FT  08 NOV 93 / German capacity use falls further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAPACITY utilisation in west German manufacturing industry declined again in
September, and may continue to fall until the end of the year, the Ifo
economic institute in Munich says in a report.
The September figure, according to Ifo's latest survey of German
enterprises, was an average of 78 per cent, against 78.4 per cent in June,
the date of the last survey.
The figures confirm a steady decline in capacity utilisation since December
1990, when it reached a peak of 90 per cent, coinciding with German
unification.
Hardest hit were investment goods manufacturers, where utilisation dropped
to just 75.4 per cent in September, compared with a healthier 82.6 per cent
for all consumer goods manufacturers.
The decline coincides with a slight recovery in overall demand, according to
the Ifo survey. However, the apparent contradiction is accounted for by the
fact that production potential actually increased during the period.
There was no change in the level of orders coming to manufacturing industry,
which remained at 2.5 months' production, the same as in June. That figure
means the prevailing negative assessment of the current state of order books
was unchanged, Ifo says.
There was overall a slightly greater level of scepticism about the prospects
for business in the coming months, although very little change in the
expectations for exports.
'A further decline in capacity utilisation, albeit gentler, cannot be
excluded.'
One sector to perform against the trend was the hard-hit engineering
industry, where utilisation actually recovered to 77.1 per cent, from a low
point of 76.2 per cent in June. The prospects for the coming months were
also reported to be slightly better, although the chances of significant
improvement in capacity utilisation over the next 12 months are still
regarded very pessimistically.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE coming week could bring new tremors to the tense political climate and
further volatility to Italy's financial markets in the wake of allegations
about links between senior politicians and the security services.
The risk of new political bombshells follows the arrest on Saturday of Mrs
Rosa Maria Sorrentino, one of six top members of the security services
either already detained or being sought by police investigating political
corruption.
In recent testimony to magistrates, senior state security officials have
claimed covert funds, destined for the security services, were channelled to
politicians, notably from the Christian Democrat party
The allegations, made in leaked testimony to Rome magistrates, have focused
on the interior ministry, which is responsible for the secret service. The
ministry has been a power base for the Christian Democrats, which have
appointed each of its incumbents since Italy's postwar return to democracy.
Among the incumbents was Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, now head of state. In a
late night television address to the nation on Wednesday, he asserted that
the presidency should not be subjected to such attacks.
However, some of the mud being slung by the discredited security officials
is starting to stick. Newspapers yesterday published leaked claims by the
defendants outlining substantial payments made from covert funds to purchase
lavish furnishings for the homes and office of senior ex-ministers.
While many observers have stressed that the testimony should be treated with
extreme caution, as it may be deliberately inflammatory, others have noted
that Mr Scalfaro's television speech failed to address the substance of the
allegations against him.
Leading politicians have already rallied round the president in an attempt
to limit the damage to one of the few political institutions still
commanding widespread respect in Italy. Attempts to discredit the claims
were reinforced at the weekend after Rome prosecutors added the charge of
attempting to destabilise the constitution to the count of corruption on
which the accused are already being interrogated.
However, some of the damage has already been done. After dropping sharply on
Thursday, Italian share prices and the lira fell further on Friday after
another bout of nerves by investors worried by rising political tension. In
a brief stint of panic selling, shares and government bonds plummeted in the
wake of a rumour that Mr Scalfaro was about to resign.

<TEXT>
RUHRKOHLE, the German coal producer, will seek private financing to build a
36km-long road tunnel under the densely-populated Ruhr valley, Germany's
industrial heartland.
The project, unveiled at the weekend by Mr Heinz Horn, chief executive of
Ruhrkohle, received immediate support from leading politicians, including Mr
Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister.
It plans to build a toll tunnel from Mulheim to Dortmund under the current
A40 motorway which is plagued by chronic traffic congestion. The cost the
project was estimated at DM10bn (Pounds 4bn). The tunnel would have two
additional exits for Essen and Bochum, the region's largest towns.
A spokesman for Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of west German coal,
said the company was convinced the project would be viable and would seek
domestic and international investment for it.
The Ruhr valley, which stretches north of Dusseldorf, has a population of
5.3m people and holds the highest concentration of industries in Europe.
Ruhrkohle, which has successfully diversified nearly half its turnover in
activities like environmental technologies and infrastructure projects, said
it had conducted studies showing the tunnel was geologically possible. The
company said it hoped to provide technical know-how for the project.
The project could considerably boost the Ruhr valley, which is trying to
diversify away from its traditional reliance on coal and steel industries.
The region has succeeded in the past 10 years in becoming a centre for
environmental technology, one of the Germany's most profitable export
industries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has set in train a round of musical chairs at the top
of the public sector. The nomination of new heads for Union des Assurances
de Paris (UAP), the country's largest insurer, and for Credit Lyonnais, the
largest state-owned bank, are expected this week. Both institutions are
slated for sale in Mr Edouard Balladur's privatisation programme.
In Saturday's edition of the government's official journal, Mr Jacques
Friedmann, a close associate of the prime minister and architect of his
1986-88 privatisation programme, was named to the UAP board, while the head
of UAP, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, was appointed to the Credit Lyonnais board.
They are expected to be nominated presidents of these institutions at
Wednesday's cabinet meeting.
The current head of Credit Lyonnais, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, whose
controversial expansion strategy has helped plunge the bank into the red, is
reported to have been offered the relatively minor job of Credit National, a
small private bank whose presidency, for bizarre historical reasons, is in
the gift of the government. This report is given some credence by the fact
that Mr Yves Lyons-Caen, president of Credit National, who has reportedly
been offered a public procurement job, has summoned his board for a meeting
today.
For the most part, the changes are aimed at getting rid of previous
Socialist government appointees, with the signal exception of Mr Peyrelevade
who was influential in the Mauroy government's nationalisations of the early
1980s. But Mr Peyrelevade, who headed the Suez group before taking over UAP
in 1988, has won wide respect for his business competence. In recent weeks,
he settled a long-drawn out dispute with Suez by gaining control for UAP of
Colonia, the German insurer.
The government has already changed the top men at Banque Nationale de Paris,
the first state institution to be privatised, and at Elf-Aquitaine, the oil
company, which is expected to be the next for auction, following the sale of
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, which is under way.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland could have peace by Christmas if the British and Irish
governments grasped a unique opportunity for peace, Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister, said yesterday.
He said: 'I believe (the opportunity) is there, and I want to see (Mr Major)
take the courage and conviction in his hands, because we have a moment in
history to do it and it may not be there for a long, long time again.'
Speaking on BBC TV's On the Record programme, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe
there is an enormous responsibility on us to lead in this situation. We have
an opportunity, let's maximise it. History will never forgive us if we
don't'
In separate radio interviews, Mr Reynolds said: 'I believe that if those
crunch issues are addressed in an open and frank manner, with courage and
conviction on both sides, it is possible we can see the beginning of peace
before Christmas.'
Mr Reynolds' attempt to shift the onus on to Mr Major in part reflects the
pressures from within his own Fianna Fail party that Dublin should win more
open concessions for the nationalist community in the north.
Dublin believes that after its recent signals of willingness to meet
concerns of Ulster Unionists about the future of Northern Ireland's
political system, Mr Major should signal he is prepared to consider
nationalist demands over the north.
In an apparent divergence with the British government over the aims of the
initiative on Northern Ireland that the two prime ministers announced 10
days ago in Brussels, Mr Reynolds insisted the priority should be a
cessation of violence. He said a resumption of political talks between the
main constitutional parties would not be sufficient.
'If you don't get the people who are carrying out the violence to cease
violence, then I don't believe political talks are going to bring an end to
violence.'
He reiterated that if there were to be a proven end to the IRA military
campaign, 'there is a place at the table for Sinn Fein . . . That is the
(sequence) of events as I see them that will bring results'.
However, Mr Reynolds is having to thread an increasingly delicate path
through his own party. At Fianna Fail's annual conference in Dublin at the
weekend he faced criticism from delegates for his move to sideline the
initiative launched by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
Mr Reynolds responded by praising but not endorsing the contribution to the
peace process by Mr Hume, who was last night admitted to hospital suffering
'flu. 'Mr Hume's contribution is essential to any wide-based overall
framework for peace. (But) the creation of that peace must ultimately be the
responsibility of the Irish and British governments,' he said.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary is to investigate the shooting of a woman by a
soldier last night near Omagh, County Tyrone. The RUC said the woman, later
reported to be 'ill but stable' in hospital, was a passenger in a car. A
number of children in the vehicle were treated for cuts and shock.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Fisons drugs probe may lead to sackings: Salesmen alleged to
have offered inducements to GPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISONS, the troubled British pharmaceuticals and scientific group, yesterday
warned that heads could roll among its sales force after allegations that it
used illegal techniques to market its drugs in the UK.
Mr Cedric Scroggs, Fisons chief executive, and Mr Mike Redmond, its
pharmaceuticals division managing director, were yesterday in the West
Midlands interviewing members of the group's 100-strong UK sales force.
The managing director of UK pharmaceuticals operations is Mr Brian Higginson
and the UK director of sales and marketing is Mr Alan Morgan. Mr Scroggs
said: 'I categorically deny board members were aware of such practices. If
the allegations are true, there will be strong and quick disciplinary
action. Heads will roll. The practices suggest there is a rogue element in
the sales force, whether among individual sales representatives or
management.'
He continued: 'The buck will stop as high up as there was knowledge,
collusion or turning a blind eye to these practices. I am not bothered at
what level that might be.'
The allegations, made in yesterday's Sunday Times, are that Fisons breached
the drugs industry code of practice through free foreign trips, lavish
receptions and other incentives for doctors who prescribed its products.
The code forbids inducements to doctors and limits the value of hospitality
to the amount doctors would themselves spend.
The revelations cap a series of mishaps for Fisons in recent months. It has
now had difficulties in the three most important areas of pharmaceuticals
operations: development, manufacture and marketing of new drugs. Poor
standards at its plants forced the group to withdraw two products from the
US in 1989 and 1990 after regulators intervened. Last April, the company
stopped developing Tipredane, an asthma treatment and one of only two
medicines it had in late development, because of lack of efficacy.
The most serious of the allegations are that:
Fisons launched a scheme about five months ago which involved
representatives offering general practitioners Pounds 10 for each new
patient prescribed Tilade, the group's asthma product.
The company provided money for representatives to supply doctors with gifts
including luxury goods, theatre and ballet tickets and golfing trips.
Such practices would break the code of practice set by the Prescription
Medicines Code of Practice Authority, part of the Association of the British
Pharma-ceutical Industry. Serious breaches have led to expulsion from the
association, as happened to Bayer in the 1980s. Fisons could also be
prosecuted by the Department of Health's Medicines Control Agency under the
Medicines Act.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Markets braced for more pressure on bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS and traders in US and European bond markets are braced for further
pressure this week - which could have a knock-on effect for shares - ahead
of a spate of US economic data.
Further signs of an acceleration in US economic growth in October could
trigger more selling of Treasury bonds. Two important inflation indicators
are due tomorrow and on Wednesday, and retail sales data will be announced
on Friday.
The yield on the US long bond rose  1/4 point to 6.21 per cent last week,
spurring similar moves in European bond markets and sparking a sharp decline
in world stock markets.
In London on Friday, the FT-SE 100 fell more than 60 points in line with the
main continental European bourses. This followed an overall drop on Wall
Street of more than 70 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on
Wednesday and Thursday, although the market ended on Friday with an 18-point
rally.
'Any further weakness in the US bond market will exert a lot of downward
pressure in the European market,' said Mr Jonathon Davies, a bond analyst at
UBS, the London arm of the Swiss bank.
However, last week's sell-off in the financial markets was partly a result
of profit-taking, as traders wanted to realise the large gains they have
made on investments before the end of the year. But analysts say bond
markets are likely to be more vulnerable than stock markets this week.
One European equity fund manager said, after seeing gains of 35 per cent on
his investments this year, that 5 per cent off global markets would be a
healthy correction.
Although the long-running bull market in US Treasury prices may be coming to
an end, 'we will probably consolidate at (a yield level of) 6 1/4 per cent
on the US long bond', said Mr Kirit Shah, an international strategist at
First Chicago, the US bank. In European bond markets, where further interest
rate cuts are expected this year, there is still room for further gains. 'I
think we have another 12 or 14 months of bond-positive markets in Europe,'
said Mr Rob Gambi, manager of international fixed interest and currencies at
AMP Asset Management in London.
However, international banks and brokerages are advising clients to adopt a
defensive strategy in the short term. For example, PaineWebber suggests
selling Spanish and Italian bonds and investing in more stable markets.

FT  08 NOV 93 / Clinton steps up campaign for backing over Nafta: President
accuses unions of 'roughshod' tactics on free trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton turned up the political heat yesterday on opponents
of the North American Free Trade Agreement by accusing US organised labour
of using 'roughshod, muscle-bound' tactics to defeat the agreement in
Congress.
His attack on the labour movement, a traditional bastion of his own
Democratic party, underlined the importance he is attaching to the Nafta
vote in the House of Representatives on November 17.
The vote is widely seen as crucial not just to ratification of the accord
between the US, Canada and Mexico but also to US trade policy in general and
to the success of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, due to be
completed by December 15.
Mr Clinton, whose comments came in a morning television interview, left the
impression that he was more concerned about pressure being exerted on
members of Congress by the trade unions - by threatening to withhold
financial support and to run candidates against Nafta supporters - than he
was by the publicity campaign waged against Nafta by Mr Ross Perot, the
Texas billionaire and last year's independent presidential candidate.
The president also criticised US business for not doing enough to support
Nafta, at least compared with labour's grassroots campaign against the
agreement. But he was confident that Vice-President Al Gore would acquit
himself well in his televised debate with Mr Perot, scheduled for prime time
tomorrow night, because of his 'command of the facts'.
Mr Perot, warming up for the TV encounter, yesterday afternoon addressed
supporters in Tampa, Florida, and claimed there was evidence that he was to
be the target of an assassination attempt by a pro-Nafta group either at
Tampa or at the debate with Mr Gore.
Mr Clinton, in his interview, said Mr Perot was adept at 'keeping things
stirred up'. He denied he was boosting Mr Perot's apparently declining
popularity by agreeing to the debate, noting that 'he has enough money to
elevate himself'. The president remained confident that Nafta would have the
votes by November 17, even though they did not exist today. In particular,
he emphasised the safeguard clauses in Nafta's 'side agreements' protecting
against surges in imports from Mexico.
Only if these proved inadequate and there was overwhelming evidence that the
US was losing jobs would he contemplate renegotiating Nafta.
But Congressman David Bonior of Michigan, chief Nafta opponent in the House,
claimed yesterday to be 'on the brink' of winning the 217 votes needed to
vote the agreement down.
Mr Clinton stressed the serious international consequences of rejecting the
agreement. It would, he said, send the wrong message to Asian leaders he was
to meet in Seattle the day after the House vote - a view echoed yesterday by
the Senate Republican leader, Mr Robert Dole.
Passage, on the other hand, would constitute 'a clear statement' that the US
was intent on 'competing and winning' in international markets and was
committed to global free trade. It would put additional pressure on Asia and
Europe to complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks by the mid-December
deadline.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Business Expansion Scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE investing in the BES and enterprise zone trusts are being warned to
choose carefully, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The BES is being abolished
at the end of December while EZTs are coming to the end of their 10-year
span. David Major, personal tax partner with accountant Touche Ross, says:
'We are seeing an avalanche of schemes being marketed on the basis that
people should rush to take advantage of them while stocks last. Some look
very doubtful.'
The warning comes after Matrix Securities failed to get tax clearance for
South Quay, its Pounds 95m London Docklands EZT, after a High Court hearing
two weeks ago. It also lost in the Court of Appeal this week but will appeal
to the House of Lords on November 15. Major says: 'Be very careful before
committing yourself to any scheme, the attractiveness of which lies in
clever tax planning rather than its investment potential.'
The choice for BES investors remains wide. Nationwide building society is
seeking to offload some of its repossessed properties with the launch of
Nationwide Premier, sponsored jointly with Merrill Lynch, the investment
bank. The scheme aims to raise Pounds 30m and investors can choose a fixed
return of 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to a
compound annual return of 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer.
Alternatively, they can opt for a return after five years of 60p for every
100p invested, plus 1.2p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100.
The difference with other schemes linked to the FT-SE is that the return
will be calculated from the level on the start date to the highest closing
level during the five years, thereby locking-in the highest point. The index
would have to rise by 51 per cent in order to beat the fixed return. Minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000.
An industry analyst, the Allenbridge group*, recommends the fixed return as
'a first-class cash backed deal' with 'excellent security and a highly
competitive return.' It terms the FT-SE linked option 'good security' but
says the gearing level is less than can be obtained on some other deals.
BESSA Lincoln College, sponsored by Close Brothers, has a cash-backed,
arranged exit price of 120p, or a return of 80p plus an extra figure which
rises in line with interest rates.
Sponsor Neill Clerk has launched four cash-backed university issues. The
exit price on Second Glamorgan and Third Oxford Isis Residences is 122p. The
latter also has a Footsie-linked option of 60p, plus 2.5p for every 1 per
cent rise in the index (up to a maximum of 160p), with a lock-in after a
rise of 25 per cent.
St Anne's Residences and Derby Student Halls both offer a fixed exit price
of 120p, or 2.5p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 with the same
lock-in and cap.
The fixed exit price on the Fourteenth Johnson Fry Super Growth scheme is
120p. Johnson Fry's N&amp;P Loan Back Plus scheme has a minimum exit price of
117p, provided through a non-status and non-recourse loan from N&amp;P, but
carries the potential for more depending on how the property market
performs.
New trading issues include the chance to invest in Ealing Studios, the
film-maker; Cafe Poppy, a London brasserie chain; and Smiles Traditional
Inns (its first issue was over-subscribed in July).

MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday said that his party's next
general election manifesto may include pledges about a maximum working week
of 35 hours or four days.
He was speaking in Brussels, where today he will sign a European socialist
manifesto which includes heavy cuts in working time to end the recession and
cut unemployment.
'I am sure workers in Britain will back measures for economic development,
full employment and social progress,' he said. A 35-hour week was 'one
possibility'.
'The Conservative way is to accept high unemployment as an almost permanent
feature of our society,' he said. 'We are challenging that in the European
elections.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: Just another Irish bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK chamber of horrors has re-opened an occasional European debate.
Britain's reputation for extreme inequality and social brutalism co-exists
with the continuing, unexpected image of a land of honesty and justice. But
there is no challenger to the reputation of Ulster and Liverpool as western
Europe's worst places. They are why British lectures about the deficiencies
of the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty fall on cynical ears.
The Irish atrocities provoked the greatest concern in most European papers
but the trial of two 11-year-old Liverpool boys, accused at Preston crown
court of murdering a two-year old, aroused greater interest in France. The
contrasting attitudes towards Britain were reflected graphically.
La Depeche du Midi wrote: 'There is, in fact, something radically new in the
crime being judged today in Preston. A threshold has been crossed, a taboo
overturned and an image shattered . . . A rich western society trying in all
circumstances to save its children from violence. Violence strikes in the
third world suburbs of Liverpool and thereby marks, in one bloody symbol,
the end of our cosy blindness.'
At the other end of the country, however, Paris-Normandie wrote that the
British, like others, found it hard to accept that children could be
murderers because 'we wish to believe man has a future and that youth, more
than any other age group, carries the hope of a better world . . . British
justice is confronted with a basic problem. The mere fact that it is dealing
with it arouses and deserves the respect of everyone.'
The Ulster killings made the front pages almost everywhere else (but not
more than the death of the Italian film director, Federico Fellini).
Editorials abounded in Germany, but they were always short.
Only the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung made what one might have thought the obvious
point on November 1: 'The insanity is unbelievable: on the one hand, the EC
in Brussels celebrates the growing unity of Europe; on the other, people are
being killed under the screen of Christianity in one of the countries with
the greatest future in this Europe.' The last phrase might surprise some
readers: the German romantic attachment to those of opposite temperament is
often overlooked.
Only one Bonn paper observed that Ulster's atrocities would not be permitted
to continue if they took place on the British mainland. The Neue Zurcher
Zeitung wrote: 'Northern Ireland society has . . . stepped over an invisible
frontier, but nobody knows what lies on the other side. Either the wilful
and macabre shedding of blood has reached saturation level and will lead to
a readiness to compromise, with both sides giving up their ideals, or
despair will take over.'
The two sides in Northern Ireland are treated like terrible natural
disasters with no great causes at stake. The terms 'Protestant' and
'Catholic' are the norm, alongside ritual denials that the troubles are
based primarily on religion. Since 'Unionist' and 'republican' are not
susceptible to concise translation, the full political dimension is hard for
continental readers to grasp.
In Ireland itself, though, it is different. After the Shankill Road bomb
which killed 10 (Protestant) people, the Limerick Leader wrote a letter to a
nine-year old boy, Darren Baird, who lost his mother, father and sister.
'The culprits claim to represent Irish republicanism  - and, to our shame,
many of us, by our silence, have lent credibility to that falsehood . . .
many of us are so sick at what has happened this past quarter of a century
that we are sorely tempted to reject republicanism, even of the
constitutional kind. Truth to tell, many of us could no longer care less
what colour the flag flying over Belfast is. Thanks to the Provos, the stage
has now been reached where, rather than re-uniting the north, more and more
southerners would gladly cut it adrift.'
It has taken 25 years to reach a conclusion that seems like a cliche
everywhere else. For many commentators, Northern Ireland already is a place
cut adrift. But the human tragedy is not the whole story.
The British government spends twice as much per head in the province as it
does on the mainland. This adds Pounds 3bn to its budget deficit,
supplemented by another Pounds 480m in security costs. And the province,
year after year, eats up four times as much, relatively, in European farm
subsidies as the rest of the country.
On the Continent, there is scarcely any backgrounding or analysis of events
in Northern Ireland, in contrast with the attention devoted to the former
Yugoslavia. Stories are usually dropped - 'It's just another bomb.' The
Irish problem is nearly as complex as Bosnia, but more boring and far more
manageable.
Perhaps in Britain, too, it is understood less well because few think it
worth understanding.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Black holes that swallow good ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS three years' existence Hawks &amp; Handsaws has attracted a surprisingly
large mail, overwhelmingly from people sympathetic to its views. There have
been a few letters from psychos - usually from those on the far right-wing
of the pro-hunting lobby, or from those on the far right-wing of the
Conservative party (which may, or may not, be one and the same thing).
Generally, though, the letters have been friendly.
A good recent letter was the one from Colin Hill of The Rainforest Trust, in
response to H&amp;H's suggestion, two weeks ago, that the biggest thing wrong
with this sad and weary planet was our inability to cut through the flimflam
and recognise that many complex-sounding problems might be solved by simple
measures.
The example given was the suggestion by Gregory Benford, of the University
of California, that one way to respond to the extinction of species might be
to collect them systematically and freeze them in liquid nitrogen for
long-term storage. Just post them to the future.
Hill says this idea may be a good one, though he has a few apprehensions.
For instance, popping endangered species into the freezer, out of harm's
way, would probably be used to justify an even faster rate of pillage of the
natural world.
It would be difficult, therefore, to imagine a time when species could be
returned to their natural habitats - particularly as man himself would have
contrived to populate every available nook and cranny on the planet.
'However,' says Hill, 'I think Benford's concept is most likely to fall foul
of a general rule of human activity and behaviour, which holds that the
chances of an idea being taken up are in inverse proportion to its intrinsic
good sense.
'That this is so may be connected with our inability, as a species, to learn
the lessons of experience; or an unwillingness to face the truth, if this
appears unpalatable; or an antipathy towards working together, in pursuit of
a great or even a common cause. Or maybe it just boils down to greed,
selfishness and stupidity.'
Yet if, says Hill, we could suspend the general rule quoted above, we might
be able to mull a few more ideas to conserve the planet's bio-diversity -
ones which could be adopted with minimal pain and without providing an
excuse for junketing:
'With immediate effect, an eco-label on every piece of timber that has been
produced by environmentally sensitive means.
'An official health warning - preferably skull and crossbones - on every
piece of timber produced by the traditional smash-and-grab technique.
'From 1995, a total ban on imports of timber produced on an unsustainable
basis, in whatever form - ie, logs, sawn timber, plywood and charcoal.
'International agreement that whenever a mature tree is felled, a sapling is
planted.
'A global fund to compensate timber-producing countries for the resulting
loss of revenue.
'At least part of the proceeds of the new UK national lottery to be
dedicated to bio-diversity conservation initiatives.
'A single and comprehensive trust fund to enable the public to 'invest' in
buying and protecting a large chunk of the Amazon and other forests . . .
Trustees would include representatives of indigenous peoples.'
Of course, says Hill, such measures are too straightforward to be adopted.
They are far more likely to be condemned as 'unworkable' or 'naive.'
Good and simple ideas are generated in their millions, covering all sorts of
problems. Where do they all go? Last weekend, John le Carre, in The Times,
put forward what he called a few Utopian notions for patrolling the global
village now the cold war is over.
One of them: 'A well-equipped, well-trained, flexible volunteer army to be
raised by America and its close allies, and placed under unified command for
worldwide peace-keeping operations. It will be expensive, but not half as
expensive as the wars it will prevent.'
This does not strike me as Utopian; merely as common-sense. If you ask me,
all these good ideas disappear down black holes. At the other end they
re-emerge from white holes and are adopted by the race of intelligent beings
which lives in that far-away place. The laugh they enjoy when doing so is a
laugh at our expense.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Private View: Shedding light on the paddy fields of art -
Four people are competing for this year's Pounds 20,000 Turner Prize. One of
the exhibits consists of seven tonnes of rice lit by neon. Christian Tyler
meets its creator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VOICE behind me said: 'Is it Basmati or Uncle Ben's?' A group of
schoolchildren clustered round a teacher who was encouraging them to say
something about the work of art before them. 'It smells nice,' said one
girl, finally.
It did. But was it art or just a big rice pudding?
We were in the Tate Gallery, London, looking at seven tonnes of rice grains
arranged like a ploughed field along 20 metres of floor; in each of the six
furrows, a pinky-red neon light gleamed. Neon Rice Field is the latest work
of a Laotian refugee called Vong Phaophanit (pronounced 'powpa-neat').
In the next room stands a large cube of plaster blocks with the negative
impression of a door on one side and of a casement window on another. This
is a sculpture by Rachel Whiteread, actually the cast of a small room built
for the purpose. (Her concrete cast of an entire terrace house has just been
unveiled on a street in London's East End).
Next door hang three large abstract paintings by Sean Scully, arrangements
of broad, rough-painted bands with smaller striped panels inset. In the last
room are four outsize black and white photographs by Hannah Collins: a
rubber dinghy on cobbles, a derelict street, an arrangement of snails and
open oysters, and a female nude with hair tumbling down her back and through
the struts of a bentwood chair to the floor.
The four artists, of whom three are unknowns (the exception is Scully), are
this year's jury selection for the Pounds 20,000 Turner Prize to be awarded
on November 23.
The event has become a sort of national game, a gladiatorial contest of
aesthetes, professional and amateur. It swamps the pages of the press and is
beamed by television into every home in Britain. Each year there are cries
of 'Fix]' and complaints of a modernist conspiracy, commercial shenanigans
and political correctness. This year, to add spice and spite to the
proceedings, a pop group called KLF says it will make its own award of
Pounds 40,000 to the worst of the four Turner hopefuls.
I went to see the author of Neon Rice Field. He is a gentle man who looks
younger than his 33 years and lives in a large house in the
downwardly-mobile Montpelier district of Bristol. Tired from five days
sowing the floor of the Tate, he was courteous and a little wary.
Vong Phaophanit has resident status in Britain but no passport. He was born
in Laos and sent by his middle-class parents to study in France. When the
Americans pulled out of Vietnam they left Laos, too, and a communist
government was installed. The parents advised their son to stay away. He is
a painter by training - he studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in
Aix-en-Provence - and went through the conventional routines dictated by
western art history. Three years after leaving the college with an
upper-middling diploma, he dropped painting entirely.
Why? I asked. Was it too difficult? 'It's a very demanding discipline,' he
said in a soft French accent. 'And it's not easy when you share your life
with other people (he has an English wife and son). And there were other
problematics that I didn't resolve - about light, about the body, about the
texture, about depth . . .'
Mainly, though, it was because he could not afford a studio. 'I was
accumulating canvases and having to throw them away. I found the whole cycle
a little bit ridiculous. So, it's something I'm waiting with pleasure to go
back to one day.'
Painting and sculpture were primary arts, he conceded. Museum installations,
like his rice fields, were a fusion which helped the artist find other sorts
of answers. 'But what do you call an installation?' he continued. 'I can't
define it. Because, for me, when I look at a painting by Poussin, for
example, all the subject is a huge installation. He instals figures,
customs, colours, gestures. Renaissance fresco is for me a kind of
installation.'
I said that such objects required not only imagination but a lot of
technique and skill.
'We are talking about a medium which, first of all, is not about skill,' he
replied. 'OK, some people would do it with skill, and some would say I don't
care or would employ other people, just as Giotto employed his disciples.'
Is installation art a gimmick or fashion?
'I don't know. Compared to the whole history of art, it's just a foetus. It
has only 60 years' history.'
Is it a cul-de-sac, then?
'No, I still think there is a lot of potential with this medium. It has the
advantage for the public of a physical interraction, a combination of visual
and physical, the sound, the smell . . .'
It is also the subject of mockery.
'Well, that's up to the artist,' he said, quickly. 'You can't say, because
you've seen 4,000 paintings in your life, what is best and worst. You can't
say that installation is less perfect as an art form.'
I asked if it was a weakness of installations that they disappear - that
they last only as long as the gallery will house them.
'You have to accept that is one of the main natures of that art form. What
interests me is before and during. After that, you know, there's nothing
there. And I'm quite happy doing this.'
Can a man be an artist if he leaves nothing behind?
He laughed. 'Well, I doubt I will leave nothing.' There were always
photographic records and installations were sometimes sold, too. They are
converted into paper contracts in which the artist sells the collector the
right to recreate his idea.
Phaophanit plainly dislikes any attempt to pin traditional labels or
categories on his work. He said it was for triggering questions, not
supplying answers - questions about the Meaning of Art, the role of the
artist, the preconceptions of the viewer, the struggle of the creator.
Are these questions perhaps more interesting for you than for the public? 'I
hope the role of the artist is not to produce what the public wants to see,'
he replied, firmly.
But doesn't the public want to see something it can understand and enjoy?
'You do have people who only go and see exactly what they want to see. But
if we just limit ourselves to that criterion, you are going to censor a lot
of creative people.'
Phaophanit agrees with an earlier avant-gardiste that every person is an
artist. 'Everyone is an artist but probably not everyone can be: it depends
where you come from, what social class, what you want out of life.'
Some artists, I said, want to make a political statement - about elitism,
class, gender or race. Are you trying to say something with rice and neon?
'I never work with that direction in mind. I don't think art is always the
right tool for confronting specific subjects. There are other people with
other skills who could do it much better: writers, politicians, religion. It
doesn't mean that I am not questioning all these things.'
The best feminist art or 'black' art, he added, did not approach its subject
in an obvious way. That alienated people.
Is your work meant to be cross-cultural?
'Yes, but each person will have his or her interpretation. Neon Rice would
appeal to a Laotian but we have to see it as an individual experience,
appreciating not just from cultural point of view, not just an aesthetic
one. It's getting below preconception and culture to what we are made of.'
What do you think of Turner? 'I think he's probably one of the best painters
that England ever had.
'Probably one of the most complete painters, who managed not only to resolve
some kind of aesthetic programme but also who managed to question in a very
clear way about light and colour.'
One critic said recently that Turner would never have won the Turner Prize.
Do you agree?
Phaophanit laughed. 'You can't just turn back to the past in that way. It's
too easy to say something like that.
'It was the same thing with the Impressionists. They were refused into the
Salon de Paris - people like Cezanne, Manet. That doesn't mean in 400-500
years' time that we won't look at things in a different way.
'OK, it sounds very seducing, the idea that Turner wouldn't be nominated.
It's too easy.'
(The ridicule which greeted the Impressionists - and not only them - is
often cited by modernists in order to extol the avant-garde. Yet, the fact
that something is ridiculed does not mean it is not bad.)
Phaophanit said he gets both satisfaction and suffering out of his work.
'It's not easy to go out there and do something to convince people that what
you do is worthwhile, taking the risk that you never know what the work's
going to look like.'
Who, in the end, are you doing it for - yourself or the public?
'I am not doing it for myself and not doing for the public. I'm not doing it
for God.' He laughed. 'I think it's . . . I don't know.'
There was a long pause. 'I'm just trying to . . . create another opening in
what you may call the huge tunnel of art history.'
I thanked him and said I hoped he won the prize. I meant, of course, the
Pounds 20,000 - not the big one. I think.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Pletnyev plays Tchaikovsky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIKHAIL Pletnyev's contribution to the Wigmore Hall's current Tchaikovsky
Centenary Festival was a recital of the highest quality, a sustained feat of
exquisitely finished pianistic display and musicianly sympathy. Anniversary
celebrations are only ever truly valuable when they shed new light on their
principal subject. This was certainly the case with Thursday's performance
of The Seasons, Tchaikovsky's 12-movement 'calendar' of pianistic
miniatures: no-one hearing Pletnyev's traversal of the suite will ever be
tempted to dismiss it as mere salon-music.
Up to now received opinion has rated The Seasons exactly thus - a chore
discharged by the composer during the supposedly barren year of 1876.
Pletnyev seemed to take it as his mission to demonstrate how much of
echt-Tchaikovskyan inspiration can be discovered in the simple forms,
melodies and rhythmic patterns of these small scenes pittoresques.
He did this not by any act of special pleading - the Schumann-esque
intimacies of 'January (At the Fireside)' and 'May (May Nights)' were
uttered with the utmost reserve, the folk-musical images of 'July (Song of
the Reaper)' and 'September (The Hunt)' recorded with strict technical
brilliance - but by conveying complete imaginative grasp of purpose and
direction in the placing of every note.
This was truly aristocratic interpretation, with the confidence to step back
from both the music itself and the fine detail of its execution. It can only
ever come about when absolute technical authority is married to artistic
maturity; and Pletnyev, winner of the 1978 Tchaikovsky Competition, has
plainly achieved that marriage. From the first his playing was remarkable
for its control, polish and 'school'; but now grace and fantasy have been
added to those qualities, and his place in the constellation of Russian
pianists has never seemed more assured.
A first half of Mozart (which would have delighted Tchaikovsky, that most
passionate of 19th-century Mozartians) was full of hushed savourings of
melody, inspired bendings of rhythm: an altogether 'personal' approach
triumphantly justified by the sheen and limpidity of every phrase.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Listen to Dance Umbrella - Sophie Constanti finds out
all you want to know about bondage, S&amp;M and high camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE ARE,' confesses Nigel Charnock, in Original Sin, 'very few things
I'll go down on my knees for - and organised religion is not one of them.'
Original Sin, a 90 minute double-act for Charnock and the equally candid,
verbose, and thrustful Liz Brailsford, is about men, women and eternal
misunderstanding between the sexes: 'You asked for new men. We're making
them,' barks Charnock. But most of all it is about sex. And like at least
half a dozen shows in this year's Dance Umbrella festival (which ends
tomorrow), it is, in parts, all talk.
Charnock is blond (but no bombshell), skinny (but frighteningly strong) and
since his last solo show Resurrection, has taken to playing the same manic
screwball character in every production. His hyper active model of neurosis
is reminiscent of Leonard Rossiter's Rigsby, all indignant hands-on hips
posturing and nonstop jabbering; a man who nods and winks at his own
perversity and lewdness and he finds the perfect outlet for his pent-up
frustrations in a brand of dance theatre which is largely based on personal
revelation ('I'm not firm enough, or infirm enough,') and obscene requests
('I want to know you in the Biblical sense').
As a solo mover, Charnock is an incurable masochist - a trait which has
coloured his dancing since his earliest performances with DV8 together with
Physical Theatre. In Original Sin he repeatedly crashes to the ground and
hoists himself up again, he hobbles forward on the bare knuckles of his toes
and, at the end of the work, writhes naked and spent on a wet floor. Given a
partner he veers towards choreographed exercises in S&amp;M; basic bondage (and
gagging), prolonged physical and emotional abuse. Together - and apart - he
and Brailsford sustain the violent intensity of pace and punch, and
encourage an uneasy voyeurism in their audience. We end up climbing into bed
with the fatally mismatched couple in order to monitor a comically
disastrous sex therapy session in which the endless catalogue of fantasies,
hang-ups, needs and feelings of guilt has the effect of paralysing rather
than facilitating both verbal and sexual communication.
Original Sin has some blissfully funny moments and is all the more
entertaining for its knowing and merciless stabs at political correctness.
But while both Brailsford and Charnock - who can act and sing as well as he
moves - have a flamboyant, commanding stage presence, you are, ultimately,
left with the feeling that this show is little more than a collection of
witty one-liners, 'Bisexuals have the best of both worlds and still complain
about the choice,' tinged with a cynical, throwaway agitprop of the 1990s.
The work of David Rousseve, an African-American dancer and choreographer, is
also dominated by personalised texts. But unlike Charnock, who does not so
much tell stories as assault you with his dirty sexual laundry, Rousseve is
a beguiling raconteur. In Colored Children Flyin' By, an autobiographical
jigsaw which has evolved over the last four or five years, Rousseve delivers
a series of amusing, poignant and richly detailed monologues. These tell
mainly of the hardship and poverty suffered by his Creole, cotton picking
grandmother and of his own experiences on the first day of term at an
integrated school where, blowing gently against the head of the boy seated
in front of him, he discovered that white people's hair moves.
Rousseve's choreography for his Afro American company (four women, one man)
is the weakest link. As if straining to find an organic connection between
spoken material and movement, he seems afraid to let the dance possess its
own voice. Duets composed, give and take gestures, flat, one dimensional
rhythmic movement for the larger group; the lazinesss of Rousseve's
choreographic voice sits in stark contrast to the invention, rigour and
luminosity of his storytelling. And only gospel singer BJ Crosby, who dons
butterfly spectacles, wig and dressing gown to play the role of Rousseve's
weary old grandmother, exudes the same joyous generosity of spirit as
Rousseve himself as she sheds her costume for a show stopping rendition of
Amazing Grace.
Like Nigel Charnock, Matthew Hawkins first appears on the independent dance
scene during the early 1980s. However, Hawkins - a tall, strikingly
androgynous figure - occupies a stage world in which there is no room for
the uncontrolled neurosis and self destructive physicality of Charnock's
domain. 'There's no such thing as love - there's only obsession,' says
Charnock in Original Sin. But Hawkins proves otherwise, Marking the
centenary of Tchaikovsky's death, he goes down on his knees for the composer
and pays homage to music which, he states, is full of love. In Fresh Dances
For the Late Tchaikovsky, Hawkins and his troupe of four dancers are joined
by Rose English (majestic and tentative by turns) and Fenella Fielding (all
husky voice and heaving bosom as she recites poetry which Tchaikovsky set to
music). No one in this production - save the members of the Endymion
Ensemble - would have looked out of place on top of a Christmas tree.
Magnificent 'wearable art' costumes, luxurious swathes of fabric and
exquisite washes of light ravish the eye. But within this sumptuous setting,
Hawkins' choreography registers as cold, detached and directionless. As
Tchaikovsky's Souvenir de Florence permeates and transforms the Hackney
Empire, the performers are followed rather than transported by their
glorious visual and aural environment. Only Hawkins' refined sense of high
camp (as a dancer) and his predilection for skewed asymmetry and speed (as a
choreographer) prevent these so-called Fresh Dances from looking like a set
of pedantic, recidivist classroom sequences executed in front of a mirror.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Previn and Shostakovich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Shostakovich's most significant works, the First Cello Concerto and
Fifth Symphony, formed the core of Wednesday's Barbican Hall concert by the
London Symphony Orchestra. Both pieces stand as peaks of the 20th-century
repertory; they also transcend the Socialist Realism genre to which they
belong.
Although over 20 years separate them (the symphony came first, in 1937),
they were conceived in similar circumstances - under the menacing eye of
Soviet cultural apparatchiks - and represent triumph over adversity. Each is
deeply ironic, with every limitation turned to advantage.
In the current assessment of orchestral provision for London, the LSO - its
future at the Barbican guaranteed - is the only one of the four major bands
not under threat from the Arts Council apparatchiks; and its performance of
the Cello Concerto gave the impression of minds unconcentrated by the
absence of worry. Ensemble was precarious. Andre Previn, the orchestra's
Conductor Laureate, seemed uninvolved; Yo-Yo Ma's solo playing was
thoughtful in the melancholy slow movement, but mechanical elsewhere,
thwarted by the idiosyncrasies of Previn's beat.
Fortunately, Previn found his form for the Scherzo of the symphony, in which
he disclosed real instinct for the Landler rhythms. The introspective Largo
was deeply felt, wonderfully bleak and desolate, with admirably sustained
string playing and piquant contributions from the woodwind Previn conducted
a blazing, boisterous finale.
The evening had opened with the first British performance of Previn's own
Cello Sonata, premiered in Amsterdam in March. For a contemporary chamber
work it had the rare benefit of a captive, packed Barbican audience. The
idiom is uncontemporary: a pale blend of Shostakovich and Copland with mild
infusions of modern jazz. Its three rambling movements lasted a long
half-hour. Yo-Yo Ma, accompanied by the composer at the piano, played as if
it meant something to him, but Ma's programme note - 'He is not trying to
write a great work' - sounded apologetic.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Memories prodded - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TV'S THATCHER celebration season recently featured a variant on the old
chestnut 'Where you when you such-and-such happened?' The moment for which
memories were prodded was the ex-PM's abdication. And did we all remember
where we were? And is our recall as strong for other flashpoints in 20th
century history? Consider your answers now, for November is a video month
full of movies torn from the headlines and you may be tested.
Where were you when President Kennedy was shot? Michelle Pfeiffer as the
Dallas-dwelling heroine of Love Field (Columbia TriStar) was right there in
the same town. This tangy tragicomedy-cum-road-movie was never released in
UK cinemas - too offbeat perhaps for Mr and Mrs Popcorn - but is well worth
a look now. JFK-adoring Pfeiffer treks across America towards his funeral,
meeting a country changed and still changing in the wake of three years of
hope and one day of horror. Miss P, Oscar-nominated for best actress, won
that accolade at the Berlin Film Festival.
Where were you during the Cuban Missile Crisis? Ninety miles from Cuba if
you were one of the characters in Joe Dante's delicious period lampoon
Matinee (Guild). John Goodman plays the 1960s horror director visiting Key
West to unveil his new movie, plus multi-megaton gimmicks, while real-life
horrors threaten to explode offshore. Funny, evocative, inventive.
Where were you when you heard about the Andes plane crash? Wherever you
were, you can relive it now in Alive (CIC), the film of the book of the
disaster. Script and characterisation are sometimes wobbly, but the settings
are chillingly credible, the crash the most realistic in memory, and the
outcome as inspirational as it was in real life.
Where were you when Elvis Presley died? Probably anticipating the
clone-intensive mania that would follow. Honeymoon In Vegas (First
Independent) is the cinema's latest and best comic bulletin on Elvis
necrophilia. Nicolas Cage, James Caan and Sarah Jessica Parker enact a kooky
triangular romance in Las Vegas - or try to - while the town is rained on,
literally, by Presley lookalikes. Ex-screenwriter Andrew Bergman (Blazing
Saddles) directs.
Where were you the first time a major Hollywood star was cryogenically
frozen? Watching the enjoyable multi-tissue romance Forever Young (Warner),
where Mel Gibson receives the deep-freeze treatment as a 1939 airman scarred
by love and wanting to lose consciousness until 1989. Here he meets - yes -
love again. But he is better equipped to deal with it, having had 50 years
to sleep on the matter. Jamie Lee Curtis co-stars, the Pacific coast
settings almost steal the film.
Where were you when Robert Redford offered your wife Dollars 1m for a night
of passion? In Las Vegas (again) if you were Woody Harrelson in Indecent
Proposal (CIC), putting up a token show of righteous resistance before
pocketing the money. Demi Moore is the tug-of-war wife, Adrian Lyne of Fatal
Attraction the tug-of-styles director. The film ends as a romantic cop-out,
but the early temptation scenes have a cynical glitter.
Where should you be this weekend to escape the extended firework season
and/or more TV Thatchermania? Sampling, I suggest, major moments from world
cinema past and present as video's long arm reaches ever further into time
and space. November is the richest month for some time. A great French
classic? Les Enfants Du Paradis (Artificial Eye). A great German classic?
Pandora's Box (Tartan Video). Elizabeth Taylor in her prime? Cat On A Hot
Tin Roof (MGM/UA). Alfred Hitchcock in his prime? North By Northwest (CIC).
Modern British self-portraiture at its poetic best? Terence Davies's The
Long Day Closes (Curzon).
Alternatively - if Maggie withdrawal symptoms become too strong - you can
turn to an Australian film with the month's most tantalising title. It is
Blood Camp Thatcher (VIPCO), a straight-to-video movie unknown to me (as
yet), though it clearly casts a whole new light on those Downing Street
years.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Moonlight' falls into place / Review of the transfer
of Pinter's play to the West End
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWEVER MUCH we may enthuse about London's fringe theatres, there is still
nothing like the pleasure of seeing a good production in the West End when
the house is full and eager to listen. The facilities are better, there is a
wider as well as a bigger audience, many of them actually wearing suits: in
short, a sense of occasion. This is the serious theatre-going public that
the theatre has to catch unless it is to become a minority form.
Such thoughts are prompted by the transfer of Harold Pinter's Moonlight from
the Almeida in Islington to the Comedy Theatre just off the Haymarket. The
quality of the production has been transformed.
To be sure, some of the improvement may be put down to sheer practice.
Moonlight opened at the Almeida two months ago. Especially with a Pinter
text, where so much is left unspoken, it requires time for the actors to
adjust to their parts and to the way the rest of the cast is developing as
well.
Yet there must be more to it than that. Moonlight is Pinter's first
full-length play for 15 years. It was originally billed for 75 minutes, ran
for 80 and is now much nearer 90. The performance at the Almeida was not
bad, but the production was disjointed, the touch and the timing uncertain.
I described it as possibly Pinter's valedictory as a stage-writer. Perhaps
it still is, but at least at the Comedy he is going out in style.
There have been no cast changes and none in the technical direction. The
transformation is that everything has fallen into place. Take the lighting
first, if only because it is plainly important to a play of this name. At
the Almeida it seemed simply to go up and down or, to put it crudely, on and
off. At the Comedy it shades slowly and sometimes lingers. These nuances in
the lighting, designed by Rick Fisher, must be responsible for adding a good
three minutes to the play's length.
There was a particular moment when one noticed how much that mattered. The
lights went down to indicate a change of scene. In this season of 'flu and
and heavy colds, there was an immediate outbreak of coughing and clearing of
throats. The significance was that so intent was the audience on listening
to the dialogue that all coughing had been previously suppressed. And when
the lighting went up again, the coughing promptly stopped.
If that sounds like what happens during a symphony at the Festival Hall, it
is the right analogy. Pinter works through a mixture of sudden bursts and
pauses. At the Comedy the timing has become perfect. As a result, Moonlight
seems much more moving than when it first appeared.
Ian Holm's mortally ill civil servant, Andy, has become more angry at the
dying of the light, and strives less for effect. His wife Bel, played with
marvellous controlled calm by Anna Massey, looks genuinely disturbed at his
going. The minor characters - Ralph the referee and his wife Maria who has
been the lover of both Andy and Bel - now come on rightly as minor
characters, not the comic interlude they seemed before.
On the other side of the stage, the two sons who refuse to go to the death
bed show a kind of grief whereas at the Almeida they were a kind of musical
act. Even Claire Skinner's Bridget, the daughter who may or may not be
already dead, emerges in a clearer light.
I make no special claims for the meaning of Pinter and the pursuit of what
Moonlight is about seems futile. At his best, however, Pinter is a master of
ambiguity. He learned a great deal from TS Eliot, whose words did not always
make literal sense either. Where he excels is in using the stage in front of
a live audience straining to pick up every nuance, uncertain sometimes
whether to laugh a) because they are not sure whether there is a joke and b)
because laughter might interrupt the rhythm of the piece.
At the Comedy, David Leveaux's production has everything going for it. The
cast is in perfect stride. Theatre like this, however, will only work if the
house is full. Remember my words of last week. Going to the theatre is not
really expensive compared to what you spend might on other pleasures. It
costs Pounds 4.75 to buy a glass of non-vintage champagne at a conventional
London club close to the Comedy, and it probably costs much more at a less
conventional club even closer. Theatre is cheap at the price.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Books branch out - Antony Thorncroft helps celebrate
National Library Week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT ON earth has happened to our libraries? At Birmingham Central Library
they have been dancing all night; at the British Library they have let
ordinary people into the Reading Room; and at Malvern Library regulars have
been confronted by Nigel Kennedy stamping their books.
It is not privatisation gone mad. Quite the reverse. It is the Library
Association's National Library Week, designed to show the government that
the nation's libraries are alive and kicking and one successful British
institution that needs minimal reform.
The Week is timely. Last month Iain Sproat, number two at the Department of
National Heritage, threw a Molotov cocktail at the library service by
wondering out loud whether the loaning of books should always be without
charge. He was slapped down on Wednesday by his boss, Peter Brooke, when
opening a new Pounds 15m library in Croydon.
Brooke is a keen library man and Croydon was a good place to confirm that
the traditional library service can flourish inside state-of-the-art
packaging. So books are checked in and out by a computerised scanner - but
there are more of them on the shelves, up from 140,000 to 200,000. There are
40 computer terminals, which will not only hunt down books and, if they are
out on loan, tell you when they will be returned, but will also act as a
data base for businessmen seeking information and customers in Croydon - and
abroad. There are audio and music tapes, CDs and videos, but there are also
chairs where people can rest awhile. Half the local population uses the
library but almost half of these never take out books.
The new Croydon is inside the shell of a Victorian library, and is not only
the last word in its lighting, lifts and raised floors, but also in its
purpose. It is part of an arts complex, along with a museum, cinema, art
gallery, cafe, etc., and is also designed to serve the needs of small
businessmen, with its fax service and on line computer which links into the
data bases of hundreds of computers world wide. Just as Glasgow, Birmingham,
and Bradford have poured money into major arts developments in an effort to
attract business, and jobs, to their cities, so Croydon is using the library
as, in current jargon, a resource centre.
Of course there is a price to pay - a fee for businessmen wanting hard
copies of any information garnered; for members of the public taking out
videos and CDs. The more popular items among the Pounds 800,000 worth of new
stock should pay for themselves within a few weeks. But at least it is a
library which reflects the changing world outside rather than one retreating
into staff cut backs and shorter opening hours.
Although Peter Brooke has just embarked on a fundamental review on the
library service he is at pains to point out that he hopes the result will be
thousands of individualistic libraries serving their idiosyncratic local
communities. But the Library Association is wise to take the initiative this
week in promoting libraries and, in particular, the joy of reading books,
even if it does mean getting into bed with Radio 2 and encouraging actors
dressed as Miss Haversham to abseil down the walls of Newcastle Library.
Brooke places much emphasis on not charging for what was the core activity
of libraries - books will be safe - but in a decade's time libraries could
be more like business, educational and recreational centres, with the books
cornered off to appease a few wrinklies. Already persistent small cuts by
local authorities are eating into the service. In 1974-75 there were 229
libraries in England open for 60 hours a week; by 1991-92 this had dropped
to 18. Trained staff has fallen from 8,384 to 7,651 in the past decade. And
a recent survey shows that three out of four local authorities are planning
cuts this year. By law every local authority must maintain a library
service: unfortunately the law does not set out the quality of that service.
Libraries cannot rely on the goodwill of the current Heritage Secretary.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Pieces of silver - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO A New York jury has decided that the Sevso treasure, 14 pieces of silver
made around 400 AD for Sevso, a dignitary of the late Roman Empire, belongs
to the Marquess of Northampton, who bought it from a group of dealers,
including the late Peter Wilson, former chairman of Sotheby's, for over
Pounds 9m in the 1980s.
It is bad luck on Croatia and Hungary, who could not provide convincing
witnesses to prove the hoard was unearthed in their territories and then
smuggled abroad, but a massive relief for the Marquess, who has spent
millions defending his ownership.
But his problems are not over. Sotheby's, which planned to sell the silver
in New York in 1990 with an estimate of Pounds 40m, has hardly stood
shoulder to shoulder with the Marquess during the case and will not get a
second chance to sell the silver. Christie's turned it down originally and
might well feel the silver has the mark of Cain on it. On the other hand it
has traditionally disposed of the Northampton family treasures. The most
obvious purchaser, the Getty Museum in Malibu, was approached in the 1980s
and decided against buying the silver because of doubts about its
provenance. It is unlikely to have changed its mind.
So Lord Northampton may have his silver back (although an appeal is
possible) but he is no nearer finding a buyer for objects of great aesthetic
and historical importance but quite outside the interest and purses of most
art collectors, and museums, especially as he is on record as wanting to
sell the silver intact.
What is the price of immortality? Well, Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m would do
nicely. That is the sum the Tate is seeking to raise for its new Gallery of
Modern Art which it hopes to have open by the Millennium. It is already
talking to its rich friends and if one dips his hand deeply enough into his
pocket his name will live on into the next century as resoundingly as that
of Sir Henry Tate, whose sugar money brought the museum into existence in
the 1890s.
The Tate is confident that the government will provide matching funds from
the Millennium revenues of the Lottery for the Pounds 40m project, which
will give London its much needed specialist gallery of modern art, while the
old Tate, due to be much enlarged in 1995-96 thanks to a Dollars 10m gift
from an anonymous American benefactor, becomes the home of British art.
In the next few months the Tate will decide on a site for its Gallery of
Modern Art. One thing is certain: it will be on the River Thames. The
favourite location seems to be the abandoned Bankside Power station, with
its magnificent views towards St Paul's, which could be converted
comfortably. The aim will be to build a foot bridge linking the two
attractions. The alternative sites are the car park alongside the South Bank
arts complex and the Effra development area west of Vauxhaull Bridge.
So confident is the Tate that the scheme will go through that it is already
worrying about how to stock the new museum. Although up to 80 per cent of
its holdings cannot be shown through shortage of gallery space, the Tate
lacks major works by many of the leading 20th century foreign artists,
particularly the Americans. It is hoping that owners will be keen to loan
seminal paintings and sculptures to such a prestigious new Gallery.
While the new auditorium at Glyndebourne nears completion in readiness for
its opening next May the Arts Council seems to be spoiling for a fight with
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, which for seven weeks a year brings the Festival
productions to the general public at subsidised prices.
In an unashamed reversal of policy the Arts Council has decided against
bunching opera performances in big theatres in major urban centres and in
favour of an outreach programme to small and medium sized towns and venues.
It wants GTO to stop visiting traditional haunts like Manchester, Oxford and
Southampton, which are also on the itinerary of companies like Welsh
National Opera and Opera North, and instead move to opera starved middled
sized theatres, like the Marlowe in Canterbury and the Derngate in
Northampton.
The threat is that if GTO does not fall into line its grant will disappear.
GTO is understandably upset. It likes playing to big loyal audiences for big
box office revenues, and its productions fit better in the larger theatres.
Also they help it attract the best young singers. The other major opera
companies that tour, the WNO, Scottish Opera, and Opera North, are
presenting a common front on this one, and refusing to tender for any Arts
Council dates rejected by the GTO.
It should be possible to work out a compromise, with GTO adding some new
venues while losing some traditional ones. If the Arts Council study group,
cobbled together to come up with a policy by early December, decides to call
GTO's bluff and concentrates its funding on pocket opera companies visiting
even smaller venues, it will have a nasty row on its hands - and by then the
Council will be wrestling with the inevitable fall out from the anticipated
Pounds 5m reduction in its grant for 1994-95, as well as the consequences of
the Hoffmann report which, in theory, will eliminate funding from two London
orchestras. Perhaps it hopes that GTO's misery will be subsumed within the
general gloom.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: Idyll of the countryside: true or false?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOSTALGIA and romanticism shapes the artist's perception of the countryside
quite as much as that of the prospective clients. So paintings provide poor
evidence for the way in which the countryside has changed over the years.
This is the theme of a thought-provoking and enjoyable small exhibition,
Toil and Plenty; Images of the Agricultural Landscape in England, 1780-1890.
The exhibition is first at Nottingham University Art Centre and travels to
the Yale Centre for English Art in the New Year. If you cannot see the show,
the book by Christiana Payne is extremely interesting and so readable that
it would be an excellent choice for the bookshelves of any country-lover.
In Yale, the exhibition will become a more splendid thing for adding
pictures by names such as Francis Wheatley, Stubbs, and Samuel Palmer from
the Paul Mellon Collection. Despite being much smaller, the Nottingham
version has an attractive and interesting selection of artists: Rowlandson;
Turner (the large oil, 'Ploughing Up Turnips Near Slough' is nearly as
depressing as the title suggests); Peter DeWint; William Collins (father of
the novelist); Ford Maddox Ford and Sir George Clausen.
Several artists appear in an unfamiliar guise. John Martin, famous as the
dotty visionary, was a painter of conventional harvest landscapes, although
his haystooks have a slightly batty touch. Clausen appears as a Social
Realist who in the 1880s, influenced by Millet and Bastien-Lepage, produced
'Winter Work', an impressively tough image of the farm labourers' working
conditions. Photographs used for the painting also show him to have been the
first photographer to take unposed pictures of farm labourers.
At the same period, Helen Allingham painted the conventionally picturesque,
happy, rosey-cheeked family of labourers harvesting a field of golden corn.
Probably she invented her idyllic scene. Even if smallholders might still
have used a sickle, it would be odd for a woman to wield it while her
husband bound the stooks. After reading or seeing Toil and Plenty, you will
look more beadily at country pictures.
Another virtue is that Payne is mercifully dispassionate and
non-doctrinaire. The impression is that she actually appreciates painting,
which is rare with exhibitions selected to illustrate a particular social
historical theme. All too often the artist who subscribes to the 'myth'
(militarism, myth of childhood, patriachy, colonisalism) is condemned for
it.
Allingham, however, is not bashed for being a pedlar of myth and inaccurate
to boot. Nor are other artists who throughout a century of profound agrarian
change chose to paint scenes which delighted their eye and opened their
public's pocketbooks. However, the theme is more complicated than that, and
other values are projected onto the woods and fields.
The view Constable painted from the upstairs window, across his father's
vegetable garden, surely had a personal meaning to him. For other artists,
including Turner, awareness that England was at war imbued the rural scene
with patriotism. For Samuel Palmer and Edward Calvert, whose wood-engravings
perhaps sit slightly oddly in the show, the landscape was the work of a
divine intelligence.
Harvest was not only picturesque but a potent symbol of God's mercy and
man's virtuous toil. The book, rather more than the exhibition, sets the
painted landscape against the political background of social unrest, repeal
of the Corn Laws, vicious Game Laws, and trades union agitation. Life for
the poor in the towns was always worse, but for decades it was a close-run
thing. The harvest festival introduced by the Anglican clergy in the 1840s
was an image of social harmony and honest toil. Its pictorial equivalent was
an art which then as now, showed the countryside as benign, inspiring, and
timeless.
Toil and Plenty: images of the Agricultural Landscape, 1780-1890 (Yale,
214pp; paperback Pounds 19.50 ; hardback Pounds 30). Toil and Plenty is at
Nottingham University Art Gallery until November 14 then at the Yale Center
for British Art, 15 January 15 - March 13 1994.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Arts: House that Rachel built - Lynn MacRitchie finds this
Turner Prize contender no demolition job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WILL almost certainly have seen Rachel Whiteread's 'House' by now, in
other newspapers or on your television screen. You will have read the
furious and foolish comments, seen the former inhabitant invited to make
mock, covered your ears at that whiny old saw, 'Is it art?' But have you
visited it, taken yourself off to the junction of Grove Road and Roman Road
London E8, where it stands so impressively, looming white against the
surrounding green space? You should, and quickly too, because at the end of
this month it may have to be demolished, and vanish as if it had never been.
And if that happens, London will have lost one of the only truly successful
pieces of contemporary monumental sculpture I have ever seen.
'House' is successful for contradictory reasons. Indubitably monumental in
scale, it is also absolutely intimate in content, consisting as it does of
the cast form of the former living spaces. To create it, the empty interior
was sprayed with concrete from within, the house's walls forming the casing
for this mould of its inner life. When the concrete was dry, the outside
bricks and mortar were knocked away, leaving the form of the interior, made
visible for the first time. The wooden floor joists and stair treads were
left in place, providing a natural articulation for the concrete mass. Seen
from the front, it is narrow, almost elegant, the bow window emphasising the
upward thrust. Seen from the side, its blocky mass recalling the Hayward
Gallery or other brutalist constructions, the random sprawl backward is
revealed, the higgledy piggledy rooms petering out in ever smaller
extensions.
The concrete itself proves to be the most sensitive of materials, picking
up, retaining and presenting in perfect reversal all the details of the
construction - skirting boards and door frames, outside-in fireplaces and
window embrasures, indented light switches and electric cable runners - but
also the varying surfaces of the walls, including traces of colour from the
wallpapers, recalling the touching revelations of hidden lives offered by
half demolished buildings.
Whiteread's casting technique was developed to record the spaces under
baths, sinks or beds, revealing them as intimate repositories of human
activity. The idea itself is very simple, but the materials chosen, such as
plaster or rubber, and decisions such as whether or not to allow the hessian
from the surface of an old mattress to adhere to the rubber in which the
space beneath it is cast, offer a surprising variety of volume, tone and
surface.
Whiteread's first cast piece was 'Closet', 1988, made by turning a wardrobe
on its back on the floor, filling it with plaster and breaking off the wood.
She had remembered clambering in to a wardrobe as a child and the powerful
sensation of that enclosed, secret space, the sort of transitory zone adults
never enter but children seek out naturally, determined to discover magic in
the dark corners of the everyday. Whiteread's cast spaces are not magical,
but they are moving, perfectly poised between minimalism and intimacy.
A progress through wardrobes, beds, sinks and baths led to her first very
large scale piece, 'Ghost' 1990, cast in plaster from the inside of a
bedsitting room. 'I thought of casting a house after completing 'Ghost','
she told me. Finding a suitable site took nearly two years. The Grove Road
terrace was being cleared to make a park, thus providing the perfect mix of
a building about to be demolished and an open space.
The process of casting used sprayed concrete - 'I wanted to use a 'building'
material,' she explains. Technically, the piece was difficult, requiring new
foundations and an internal wire mesh structure. Whiteread, conscious that
the concrete would pick up every trace from the interior, had to have the
windows reboarded when one of the builders working with her wrote large
numbers on each piece of hardboard. All such attention to detail takes place
before a space is cast; the final surface is left as it emerges.
The creation of 'House' moved Whiteread's work, for this piece at least,
decisively into the public domain. 'I had no idea what I was letting myself
in for,' she admits. Working in the street, the creation and unveiling of
the piece inevitably became a public event, with the explosion of comment
that engendered, some of it inevitably highly political. Whiteread insists
she has not suddenly become 'a radical political artist standing on my
soapbox. The work I have always made is very quiet, spiritual, poetic -
there is nothing different to the sense of this piece.' This is quite true.
The work grew naturally from her previous explorations, was in one sense no
more than a continuation of them. But by growing in scale from room to
house, her process of quiet exploration, simply by having to be made
manifest on a grand scale, became a public monument, exposing in a way no
one has ever quite done before the spaces which shape our lives.
Standing revealed before us, our homes, secured at such cost, are proved to
be poor crooked things, their mean interiors measuring out our days. That
hopes and dreams and indeed art itself should emerge from these haphazard
shelters is testimony to the human spirit, a worthy subject for a remarkable
monument.
'House', by Rachel Whiteread. Opposite 182 Grove Road, near the corner of
Grove Road and Roman Road, London E8. Until the end of November. An
Artangel/Becks commission, co-sponsored by Tarmac Structural Repairs. Rachel
Whiteread is one of the four artists shortlisted for the Turner Prize. The
others are Hannah Collins, Vong Phaophanit and Sean Scully. The Turner Prize
Exhibition is at the Tate Gallery, November 3-28. The winner will be
announced on Channel 4, sponsor of the prize, on November 23. See Private

FT  06 NOV 93 / Collecting: The fair comes to Harrods / A look at a new
development on the winter antiques circuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEART sinks at the prospect of yet another big antiques fair joining the
circuit. We know why they happen. Dealers are bored sitting in their shops
waiting for customers, and have been conditioned into thinking that, during
the recession, they must market themselves better. Some of the biggest
names, such as Leslie Waddington and Richard Green, are in almost perpetual
motion at fairs around the world. They offer an encouraging example.
At fairs you meet hundreds of potential new customers; you get the chance to
pick over the goods of competitors; you catch up with gossip and the latest
ideas. You are doing something. Even if you sell relatively few objects on
the spot there are countless examples of buyers coming into your shop months
or years later, following up a contact made at the fair.
So when Mohamed Al Fayed, the chairman of Harrods in London and a keen
collector, approached Brian and Anna Haughton and asked them to hold a
pre-Christmas antiques fair in his department store there was little
hesitation. The Haughtons began as ceramics dealers. They still are: but to
stimulate sales they organised an annual ceramics fair in London. They added
a silver and jewellery fair; then went to New York which, surprisingly, had
no carefully vetted fair, and set up an annual show at the Armory. It so
impressed Al Fayed that he made his call, and a new, six-day, fair opens on
Friday.
Given the pulling power of the Harrods name the Haughtons had little trouble
in attracting more than 80 dealers, including such London heavies as picture
dealers Harari and Johns and Johnny Van Haeften (who is unveiling a little
known painting of 'The Flemish proverbs' by Pieter Brueghel the Younger with
a Pounds 1m price tag); furniture dealers Apter Fredericks and David
Pettifer; as well as Wartski, Spink, Hancocks &amp; Co. and some big names from
the US and Germany.
The idea is that the fair offers a further incentive for the international
rich to do their Christmas shopping at Harrods. With the store attracting
around 100,000 visitors a day at this time of year, the Haughtons need just
a couple of thousand to venture to the third floor and pay Pounds 10 for
some high class browsing to justify their enthusiasm. Harrods hopes they
will to call in at other departments during the visit. For its part it is
opening for the first time on a Sunday to satisfy the anticipated demand.
Fairs only flourish because dealers are prepared to pay up to Pounds 10,000
for the most prestigious sites. Most rentals are, of course, much less
expensive. The Kensington Antiques Fair, one of the oldest in the land, open
this weekend at the Town Hall, is aimed at the more modest collector, for
whom spending Pounds 1,000 is a serious matter. Bridging Harrods and
Kensington from November 17 is the winter Olympia Fine and Antique Fair.
This began two years ago to meet the needs of those dealers who depend on
the mammoth May Olympia to boost their summer trade and who wanted a similar
fillip later in the year. It was a success and this year almost 200
exhibitors will be selling antiques priced between Pounds 25 and Pounds
200,000.
An attractive sideshow at Olympia is the loan exhibition of Old Master
portraits from Dulwich Picture Gallery. Visitors can do more than admire:
they can adopt three of the paintings. Dulwich, which has no public funding,
fights an annual deficit of around Pounds 200,000. Among its money raising
initiatives is an 'Adopt an Old Master' scheme. So for Pounds 2,500 you can
assume responsibility for Van Dyck's portrait of Lord George Digby. You
cannot take him home, but he will be refurbished in your name, and will
carry it in perpetuity. You can also personally exploit his image - what a
grand, and status enhancing Christmas card it would make.
Dealers are taking space in fairs because fairs work, and seem to be working
better now than a year ago. The October Armory fair in New York saw a
Japanese 17th century gilt screen sell for Dollars 1.75m, (Pounds 1.15m)
while Mallett's of Bond Street, a first time exhibitor, disposed of the Duke
of Bolton's console tables, made in 1761 by John Vardy, for around Pounds
875,000. Other London dealers like Spink, Jeremy, and Asprey, also had a
profitable trip.
Back in London the City Antiques and Fine Art Fair, held for the first time
at the Business Design Centre in Islington, had an increased attendance of
13,500, and among the items sold were 12 Regency mahogany dining chairs, for
around Pounds 30,000 (from Cook of Marlborough).
Fairs are one way of seeking new business. Another is to take part in the
75th anniversary celebrations of the British Antique Dealers Association.
This has encouraged leading dealers to mount special exhibitions. For
example from Thursday Norman Adams is unveiling 'The Importance of Patina on
18th century English furniture' at his Hans Road shop, just opposite the
Harrods Fair; all month at Witney Antiques is 'An A-Z of 18th and 19th
century British samplers'; from Monday at Country Seat, near Henley, an
unusual offering of 'Truncheons and Law and Order'; and so it goes on.
Typically, this is a modestly priced collecting field. The market is picking
up, but slowly, and in the philistine UK, mainly at the lower price levels.
Dealers are accepting the new facts of life and are arranging their stock
accordingly. Agnews, which has probably more Pounds 1m paintings in its
vaults than any other London dealer, has just completed a promotion in which
all the works on display on its walls were priced at under Pounds 10,000. It
made sales worth around Pounds 120,000. Also in Bond Street Christopher Wood
is mounting a show, closing today, of paintings priced well below his usual
level.
And, of course, at Smith's Galleries in Covent Garden this weekend you can
just catch the annual Contemporary Art Society supermarket at which
thousands of works of art, many by recognisable names, are offered at knock
down prices, to the benefit of the CAS, and sharp eyed buyers. The show
attracted a queue before it opened on Tuesday but the walls are constantly
replenished with very affordable art.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Collecting: Picasso triumph - Enthusiasm in the market for
Impressionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ART market Jeremiahs were proved wrong when 88 Picassos were auctioned at
Sotheby's in New York on Thursday. The single-collection sale was the most
keenly awaited of the season after the pundits decreed that the convalescent
international art market was not strong enough to support such a deluge of
work by one artist. Moreover, the works on offer were not of the first
quality, and a number had been on the market recently.
What happened? All 88 found new homes. Even more remarkably, they realised
Dollars 32m around Dollars 5m more than the Swiss-based American collector
Stanley J. Seeger paid for them.
The number of bidders and the feverish competition transformed a genteel
black-tie evening sale into a gruelling three-hour marathon - bringing to
mind the boom days of the late 1980s when numerous thwarted underbidders
made sure they secured subsequent lots.
Dealers - conspicuously absent in the Impressionist and modern sales of the
previous two days - came back into the picture. Alex Apsis, of Sotheby's,
said: 'Quite frankly, I'm astounded. I knew the sale would be a success but
I was not prepared for this.' The sale's success can be partly explained by
the breadth of the collection.
It spanned the artist's multi-faceted career, and ranged from a doodle from
the master's hand, and the odd piece of sculpture or ceramic, to paintings
fetching several million dollars. Equally effective were the purposely low
estimates that enticed people into the sale, and the even more accommodating
reserves.
While works such as the top lot, 'Femmes et enfants au bord de la mer', had
been acquired by Seeger for Dollars 1m and sold for Dollars 4m, it was also
possible to secure a drawing for a quarter of the price that he had paid for
it.
Who could resist? Those crowding Sotheby's rooms and telephone lines
apparently could not. The Paris-based dealer and collector Heinz Berggruen
exhibited characteristic discernment in acquiring arguably two of the most
impressive pictures in the group.
Perhaps they will join the works in his collection on loan to the National
Gallery in London. Ironically, Seeger was not out to make a killing or to
recoup his spending. He is the heir to a Mid-West oil fortune who has
described himself as an 'art shopaholic'. The Picasso collection was 13
years in the making. It was simply time to move on.
Sotheby's and Christie's enjoyed more variable fortunes earlier in the week.
At Sotheby's on Wednesday, a handsome price of Dollars 13.7m was found for a
large, exuberant Matisse cut-out, 'The Wine Press', the first of these late
works on and of paper to appear at auction.
It is said to have been bought in Paris in 1987 for the equivalent of
Dollars 2.5m. (The two outstanding works of the season, the Matisse and the
portrait of Joseph Brummer by Henri 'Le Douanier' Rousseau, offered at
Christie's yesterday, were both sent to New York from Europe rather than be
auctioned in London.)
Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza secured 'Road, Sun in Winter and Snow', Pissarro at
his best, for Dollars 2.2m, double the lower estimate, and he also snapped
up the artist's 'Field at Eragny'. The success of Schiele's powerful and
highly experimental 'Lovers (Man and Woman I)' of 1914 is eloquent proof
that if a picture is good enough it does not have to be fresh to the market.
Bought by a Japanese buyer at Sotheby's in London in 1984, and bought in at
Christie's three years ago, it sold on Wednesday for a healthy Dollars 4.6m.
But only two-thirds of the lots found new owners. . Christie's Tuesday
evening sale fared marginally better with 75 per cent sold, but the total of
Dollars 51.3m similarly fell short of expectations.
The surprise of this sale came when a decorative Degas pastel of dancers
taking a curtain call doubled its lower estimate to sell for Dollars 7m. It
was last on the market in 1952. Far less surprising was the fate of Renoir's
earthy modern Madonna depicting his mistress Aline feeding their -
conspicuously male - baby. Described by the auction house as 'A difficult
picture', and not in ideal condition, it came bearing the heavy estimate of
Dollars 8m, the price it had fetched at auction in 1988. Bidding stopped at
Dollars 4.8m.
Enthusiasm for the Impressionist and early modern market has returned -
along with standing room only in the saleroom. However, there are still too
few zeros flickering across the saleroom's electronic tote, and even fewer
major works of art. Auction houses are still struggling to persuade
collectors to chance their possessions at auction.
It is arguably even more difficult to get them to agree to realistic
reserves. Both Alex Apsis and Christie's James Roundell claim that for every
picture in their sales, six more are turned down because of the owner's
ambitious expectations.
The New York sales have confirmed the upturn in the market seen over the
last year or so, and should prove a great filip to a market suffering lack
of confidence. They have also shown that the parachute has opened on the
free-fall of Impressionist and early modern art prices - and that good
quality and appealing pictures offered at the right price can sell extremely
well.

HONEST OPTIMISM by Peter Riddell Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 288 pages
PETER Riddell has been badly served by his publishers. They have given him a
dust-jacket from which it is hard to make out the title; and he has been
seriously under-edited. There is much repetition of points and facts, often
in the same words. More seriously, the whole structure of the book - the
relationship between its argument and its evidence - needs tightening.
The argument, deployed in the introduction and the conclusions, is simple:
politics has become a career, a profession of its own, practised for most of
the working life, rather than an occupation complementary to a 'real' job.
This would not perhaps be very surprising: most forms of activity have
become more specialised and professionalised over recent decades. And
Riddell is certainly able to show, at least comparing post-war with prewar
practice, that more MPs come from political jobs - advisers, members of
party think-tanks etc.  - now than then. Higher salaries and the greater use
of wives either as secretaries or independent income-earners make full-time
application possible. The number of hours per year during which the House is
sitting, has greatly increased, etc. etc.
The phenomenon is, then, fairly easily established. Having established it,
however, what follows? What, if any, are the consequences of this
development? If they are unsatisfactory what can be done about it? These
questions are raised by Riddell but he has relatively little to say on them.
He is uneasy about the phenomenon, but rightly sceptical of the most obvious
ways of combating it. The introduction of non-politicians straight into
government through created peerages has a very poor record of success. And
the evidence suggests (though with some exceptions) that late entrants to
Parliament have lower chances of making it to the Cabinet table.
In any case, despite Riddell's own unease, it is not clear that the present
situation is worse than the old one, at least in terms of the kind of
back-benchers it produces. He himself points out that care and trouble taken
over constituents is much greater than it used to be - as is the opportunity
for work in House Committees.
Between the introductory and concluding chapters lies the bulk of the book:
a mass of facts, anecdotes and statistics about politicians and their
careers. Some statistics are interesting - for example the relative security
of the average MP, once elected, for the rest of his life - and some
anecdotes enjoyable - such as Charles Kennedy's good luck and George
Younger's bad over entry to Parliament. But Riddell often reduces the
potential interest of his subject matter by his scrupulous fairness. He will
suggest a general rule only to follow it with enough exceptions to sink it.
Interesting or not, however, most of the facts he produces have little
bearing on his thesis. What you get is simply a strong flavour of the lives,
personalities and attitudes of those who have filled the House of Commons in
recent years. Not much of a wood, but some interesting trees.

IN EXTREMIS: THE LIFE OF LAURA RIDING by Deborah Baker Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 25, 478 pages
FOR 15 years between the wars Robert Graves and Laura Riding were a literary
double-act. If you wanted one - and it tended to be Robert - you had
perforce to take on the other. They were never married but lived together in
exile in Deya, Mallorca, until the Spanish Civil War broke out. They held
court there, dominating a group of friends and followers, laying down the
law on poetical matters. Their circle included the poet Norman Cameron; TS
Matthews, later editor of Time Magazine and his wife Julie; Alan Hodge, a
poet in his youth, later an assistant to Brendan Bracken and editor of
History Today; and another poet, one whose art matured, James Reeves.
It was Laura who called the tune. Unlike Frieda Lawrence she competed
strongly with her man in the area of work, manipulating his judgment as well
as that of other colleagues. When Michael Roberts compiled his anthology The
Faber Book of Modern Verse (in which as much space is devoted to Laura as to
Auden), hers was a hidden hand shaping the introduction. When WB Yeats
compiled The Oxford Book of Modern Verse she tried to twist his arm to
include young Reeves as part of a package of Robert's poetry and her own.
Yeats politely resisted this demand and refused her invitation to stay at
Deya. He at least remained unscathed by Laura.
But those in the immediate circle who put up any sustained resistance
discovered that retribution followed. Her most notorious gesture was in 1929
when Graves, his then wife Nancy (Nicholson), an Irish writer Geoffrey
Phibbs and Laura, were all living in a flat in Chiswick in which free love
on Shelleyan lines was the order of the day. Laura was piqued at the
resistance of Phibbs and - to cut a very tangled story short - she jumped
out of an upper window, followed by Robert out of a lower one. Phibbs ran
from the house screaming. Nancy (who was soon to quit Robert and leave the
field clear for Laura) eventually composed herself and telephoned for an
ambulance.
The episode, tailor-made for Alan Ayckbourn, has been described several
times. Until two years ago, when Laura died aged 90, any reference to it in
print would trigger a violent reaction from her, in the form of long
incomprehensible screeds threatening legal action. Martin Seymour-Smith, who
wrote a biography of Robert Graves in 1982, was deluged with Lauragrams over
many months. He came to the sensible conclusion that the events leading up
to the jump were 'not really explicable'.
Deborah Baker in what is the first biography of Laura (another by Elizabeth
Friedmann, the 'authorised' version, is in preparation) has no satisfactory
explanation to offer either, but she does give a full account of all the
participants, even those on the sidelines like Norah, Phibbs's wife, who was
having a fling with David 'Bunny' Garnett. Whereas Seymour-Smith described
Laura as 'a witch', Baker extends every inch of biographer's empathy she can
to present her as a woman worthy of our admiration.
It is an uphill struggle, made more so by the opacity of much of Laura's
poetry. Some of the hitherto unpublished early work, recently discovered,
may change the picture, but the mature work totally lacks the sweetness and
charm of Robert's. It is grimly intellectual. Nor is her prose less dense,
smacking of Gertrude Stein without the wit. But Laura was an influential
critic. Her (and Graves's) analysis of Shakespeare's sonnet 129, 'Th'expense
of spirit in a waste of shame . . .' in A Survey of Modernist Poetry was a
significant moment in literary criticism and is reputed to have set the
young Empson off on his quest in search of poetic ambiguity.
Clearly Laura possessed remarkable powers of analysis. They were combined
with an iron will that she used to deconstruct and reconstruct her own
personality several times. She was born Laura Reichenthal in 1901 to
immigrant Polish New York Jews. Nathan, her father, was a Marxist who worked
for The Call, a Jewish English-language newspaper. Laura worked hard to get
to Cornell University in her teens, where she met her first husband, the
history professor Louis Gottschalk. It was as Mrs Gottschalk, the young
faculty wife recently arrived in Louisville, Tennessee, that she scored her
first literary success, a poem in the avant-garde magazine, The Fugitive.
That brought her into contact with the likes of Allen Tate, John Crowe
Ransom, Donald Davidson, the self-styled Fugitive poets. Love affairs with
them saw the break-up of her marriage. Laura now styled herself Laura
Riding.
Laura remained Laura Riding until 1939 when a second traumatic episode
occurred leading to the collapse of her relationship with Graves. They were
living in a farm belonging to Kit and Schuyler Brinckerhoff Jackson in New
Hope, Pennsylvania with their hosts' children and the Matthews. The model
for this episode is not so much Ayckbourn as Daphne du Maurier at her most
spine-chilling. Laura proceeded to take complete control of the household
forcing Kit into a nervous breakdown, and insisting after Kit had left for
hospital treatment that her presence be ritually exorcised. No master of
terror aming at a tale of purest feminine evil could do better than Baker's
cold recital of the facts.
Graves fades out of Laura's life at this point to be replaced by Schuyler
Jackson whom she married. Laura now becomes Laura (Riding) Jackson. She
renounces poetry and much time is spent on a Dictionary of Exact Meanings to
be compiled in collaboration with her husband, a mediocrity and dilettante.
It was never to be finished though they lived off the publishers' advances
for several years. Later still after Jackson's death, Laura entered her
final phase as a litigiously-minded literary widow living in retirement at
Wabasso on the east cost of Florida, fending off all potential biographers
and researchers, a Miss Havisham of modernism. The process of her
rehabilitation as a neglected modernist as well as a precursor of modern
feminism has got off to an earnest, illuminating start with this book.

DYLAN: THE NINE LIVES OF DYLAN THOMAS by Jonathan Fryer Kyle Cathie Pounds
20, 276 pages
CAITLIN by Paul Ferris Hutchinson Pounds 20, 278 pages
DYLAN Thomas died in New York 40 years ago next Tuesday. His wild widow,
Caitlin, will be 80 next month: she lives on in Catania, on the slopes of
Mount Etna, with her long-term Sicilian partner and their devoted son.
Does Caitlin's angry, disappointed, drunken life really merit a biography of
her own? And is there much more to be said about the equally drunken Dylan,
after the excellent 1977 biography by Paul Ferris (which Penguin keeps in
print), not to mention a stack of other books about Wales' most famous poet?
In Dylan: The Nine Lives of Dylan Thomas, Jonathan Fryer makes a virtue out
of not having known Dylan and not coming from Swansea; you can see his
point. He also has a couple of theses: that Thomas 'was consistently far
better as a prose writer than as a poet'; and that the poet's artificial
public persona cohabited so uneasily with the sensitive inner man as to
create an unbearable tension which, in effect, was to kill him.
Additionally, Fryer claims a new perspective: 'How could someone who was
such a shit (to borrow Caitlin's blunt description) produce such magnificent
work at his best?' Fryer's book never begins to answer that riddle; never
explains how the young Welshman could achieve the heights of, say, Fern
Hill.
He has no difficulty, however, in confirming Dylan's well-documented CV. He
was utterly selfish, a liar, a thief, a sponger, an adulterer, a weakling, a
war-dodger, a drunk who could not hold his liquor, a chain smoker, a failed
journalist and even a plagiarist (his first published poem was lifted from
the Boys' Own Paper). But we may all agree that he also wrote a small number
of very fine poems.
Fryer reminds us that Thomas was a 1930's writer, despite being younger than
Auden, Spender, et al., and delivering a very different voice, style and
subject matter. He was only 18 when And Death Shall Have No Dominion
appeared; he was being feted in London's Fitzrovia at 20. By the time he
first went to America, in 1950, the creativity was failing, as he must have
known; and, says Fryer, he embraced the role of 'poet-performer and
pub-clown.' Only a couple of poems were to come, and then Under Milk Wood.
He was dead at 39.
The Welsh are still in two minds about him. His parents were both bilingual
but he refused any interest in the Welsh language. His father had read
Shakespeare to him from the age of four; he was brought up in a cultural
environment of Celtic Romanticism and Christian Non-Conformity, towering
sermons from the pulpit, and the traditional hypocrisies of the village life
of south-west Wales.
He was writing poetry at nine, and the meticulously-revised notebooks he
kept in his late teens are now known to have supplied the raw material for
more than half his total published output of poems. He fled Wales ('the land
of my fathers, and they can keep it'), yet kept going back - most famously,
from 1949, to the Boat House at Laugharne.
I sometimes suspect that only a handful of the poems will survive the years.
Strange how difficult it is today to separate their quality from the
overwhelming memory of that booming, rich, phoney voice in the recordings
(his plummy vowels were the product of childhood elocution lessons, not the
lower-middle-class suburbs of Swansea). Fryer might be right to commend the
prose. Certainly, Dylan was a radio 'natural,' and his discovery by the BBC
after the war could have lifted the strain of the family's chronic poverty -
but he and Caitlin drank the fees.
There is a mystery in this book. Although the author acknowledges the poet's
estate for permission to quote from the published work, he thereupon makes
zero reference to the text of the poems. It is surely absurd to write about
Dylan Thomas without discussing his poetry, especially if you propose to
argue for the quality of the (equally unquoted) prose. Instead, we get the
detail of every marital squabble and financial crisis. If there were
problems of copyright, we readers should have been told.
In welcome contrast, Paul Ferris is the best authority on the Thomases and
his new book, Caitlin - which is, inescapably, something of a spin-off from
his Dylan biography - goes back over a lot of expert and familiar ground.
The sections about Dylan are always more interesting, and better written,
than anything Fryer can manage.
Caitlin sounds like a right, royal pain. Daughter of a minor and genteel
Protestant household in Co. Clare, and one of the myriad mistresses of
painter Augustus John (she had an unrequited crush on his distinguished
admiral son, Caspar), she became a disappointed, and then an embittered,
woman. In her later years, she chose to blame it on her unreliable and
neglectful father - 'failure has bred, in direct line, failure,' as she
explained to Alcoholics Anonymous.
She and Dylan met in 1936 and the two youngsters played at innocence and
love. It hardly seems worth Ferris's time to sort out the subsequent and
various infidelities. In the beginning, she was usually the casual offender.
When Dylan replied in kind, particularly when he started going to America,
she blew a gasket. Double standards from Caitlin.
The point of this book is that Ferris wants to argue that Dylan's last years
were spent not only in terror of his failing powers as poet but also in a
crisis concerning his crumbling marriage. 'Since Dylan has good as given up
writing for the actor's ranting boom and lisping mimicry,' wrote Caitlin,
'anything he sells is either a rehashed bubble and squeak of adolescence or
a never-to-be-fulfilled promise in the future.' Strong words from a loving
wife.
In a later letter she told him: 'I knew you were abysmally weak, drunken,
unfaithful, and a congenital liar, but it has taken me longer to realise
that . . . you are a plain, stingy meany as well . . . So please consider
yourself free as shit.' By the time that encouraging letter reached New
York, he was dead.
This appalling woman thereupon went over the top, initially in Elba where
she chronicled her promiscuous despair in Leftover Life to Kill. There were
years of drinking, years of litigation with the trustees of Dylan's
fast-growing royalties, and a rather casual response to the demands of
motherhood. She settled down, more or less, with an Italian boyfriend, and
eventually - more or less - she stopped the drinking which she had learned
in the old days with Dylan.
She told Ferris: 'One side of me thinks that he was the most bloody awful
crook in the world. I didn't realise how mean and deceitful he was, what a
scoundrel, a low-down bastard, treading on my innocence.' She doesn't come
across too well herself.
Incidentally, the correct Welsh pronunciation is definitely 'dullan'. But
his doting mother was afraid that he would be nicknamed 'the dull one', so
she insisted that he be called 'dillan.' She had her way, and I have to
retract.

MACHIAVELLI'S CHILDREN by Edward Pearce Victor Golancz Pounds 18.99, 219
pages
NO DOUBT it is only coincidence, but this is the second book about British
politics to revolve around Niccolo Machiavelli within the last 12 months.
The first was by Lord McAlpine, the former Conservative Party treasurer.
Called not The Prince but The Servant, it was dedicated to 'the most
magnificent Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven' and claims that she could have
been better served.
Edward Pearce has come to a different conclusion. He quotes Machiavelli's
dictum that 'when seeking advice of more than one person, a prince who is
not himself wise will never get unanimity in his councils or be able to
reconcile their views', and comments 'fundamentally, she (Lady Thatcher) was
the prince who is not himself wise'.
Never mind the discrepancies, however. Pearce's book is not primarily about
the lost leader. He has simply picked up the old Machiavelli precepts and
applied them to the 20th century.
Never mind the validity either. Quite often the precepts do not apply at
all. For example, Pearce writes 'Pierre Mendes-France was a politician of
rugged, inveterate conscience by whom Machiavelli would have been
perplexed'. And 'Machiavelli, enthusiastic about violence, is reticent about
sex. Mistresses do not much figure in The Prince.' Still, we have Pearce's
assurance that the old maestro would have thoroughly disapproved of Harold
Wilson's relationship with the now Lady Falkender.
The Machiavelli references are the exhibitionist part of the book, very much
in line with the author's own tastes. He admires showmen: Peron, Mussolini
and (up to a point) even Hitler. He is fascinated by dictators, demagogues
and byzantine politicians. He appears to believe, in that naively snobbish
English way, that no intellectual good ever came out of the US, except
perhaps for Adlai Stevenson, who remarked in Machiavellian style that
flattery is all right, 'provided you don't inhale'. Yet Machiavelli would
have been just as flummoxed by Stevenson as by Mendes-France.
Pearce is very much an old world man. To be sure, some of Machiavelli's
Children may have been written tongue in cheek, but what the author really
likes is melodrama: big figures on a big stage, uncomplicated by detail. The
Machiavelli formula, however, is a useful platform for a string of anecdotes
and extraneous comment. I like the story of Ernst Rohm, the head of the
Sturmabteil, who was the only man to call Hitler Adolf instead of Mein
Fuhrer - 'a mistake never again made by anyone else'.
Pearce is strong on Hitler in general, and on Stalin. He prefers the former:
'Hitler was an orator, an electric presence . . .Stalin was a bureaucrat . .
. his addresses on film sound like any bored minister of state reading a
brief, and quite lack the zing of John Gummer.' The Tory Party is never far
away. Pearce the old parliamentary sketch-writer makes splendid play of
Machiavelli's notion of the over-zealous lieutenant: for instance, Gerry
Malone, now the MP for Winchester, standing up at a party conference to
demand 'Poll Tax Now]' Some of the targeting may be eccentric, but the book
is full of malicious pleasure.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Books: Gossip on Dizzy misses the fizz / Assessing a new
biography of Disraeli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT BLAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISRAELI: A BIOGRAPHY by Stanley Weintraub Hamish Hamilton Pounds 25, 717
pages
I WROTE a biography of Disraeli over a quarter of a century ago. So I must
'declare an interest', as they say in Parliament, when reviewing a new one.
There is a great deal of fresh source material since I wrote. Professor
Weintraub has been able to use the Gladstone Diaries, though rather
excessively about Gladstone's 'rescue work'; the papers accumulated by the
Disraeli Project in Kingston Ontario; the Rothschild Papers not available
when I wrote; and many other valuable collections. His research has been
thorough. He writes fluently and his book is easy to read. There is a case
for reconsidering personalities whose lives have been written a generation
ago provided that there is something to reconsider. In Disraeli's case I am
not sure that there is.
His effrontery, recklessness and adventurism - he was in many ways an
English Julien Sorel - have been described in much detail many times.
Professor Weintraub expatiates on these aspects, and he has given us the
fullest account we are ever likely to get about Disraeli's infinitely
complicated and very shady financial dealings. I never fully fathomed these
myself. Perhaps the author has not either, though he has certainly
penetrated deeper than anyone else. But the outlines of Disraeli's
debt-ridden career are well known. Details do not change the general
picture, although the author is right to emphasise a point often forgotten,
that Disraeli's desperate determination to get into Parliament was motivated
not only by hope of fame but by fear of imprisonment for debt, from which
MPs were legally immune. For much of his early life he was teetering on the
brink of ruin.
Disraeli in his youth was involved in numerous sexual as well as financial
imbroglios. Some of these - his affairs with the pushy Clara Bolton, wife of
his fashionable doctor and with Henrietta (Lady) Sykes - are well known;
also his ventures with his debauched Wykehamist friend James Clay in the
bordellos of Constantinople in 1830-31, from which both received unfortunate
maladies. But there is no evidence at all to suggest that, after his
marriage in 1839 to a rich widow 12 years older, he engaged in any
'irregularities'.
The least credible - and creditable - chapter in the book contains the
author's surmise that Disraeli in his early 60s fathered a son by Lady
Dorothy Neville and a daughter by an unknown woman. The daughter said to
look like Disraeli was sent to Australia and claimed a grand and mysterious
parentage. The evidence is slender to the degree of absurdity. A reputable
biographer should never have printed this farrago of guess-work or allowed
its pre-publication hype. The author admitting that his evidence is not
'conclusive' - a masterly under statement - says that the 'jury is still
out'. Only a jury of half-wits would be out for more that a few minutes
before unanimously acquitting the defendant.
This is essentially an anecdotal biography. It reads rather like a gigantic
gossip column - Chips Channon's diaries, or Harold Nicolson's, told in the
third person. There is plenty of 'period' colour, a host of personal
details, descriptions and stories culled from a multitude of sources.
But there are some surprising gaffes. A footnote tells us that a Sovereign
was a gold coin worth 'nearly Pounds 2'. Another explains an ironic letter
comparing Disraeli's salons in Paris in 1843 to 'Law's under the Regent' by
a reference to Henry Lawes, an obscure Cromwellian musician. John Law was of
course the famous Scottish-born speculator and finance minister to the
Regent Orleans in 1720. Again, the Marquess of Hartington, Gladstone's
temporary successor in 1874, did not operate in the House of Lords but from
the House of Commons. The title was a courtesy one. The author wrecks the
famous story of Disraeli saying on being served with champagne after a
series of tepid dishes 'Thank God for something warm at last' by
substituting 'wine' for 'champagne'. Claret is also 'wine'.
Disraeli was a romantic, a cynic, a wit and an orator. Weintraub brings all
this out, but Disraeli was above a ll an important political figure who left
a lasting imprint on the party which he came after so many vicissitudes to
lead. It is not easy to define exactly what his beliefs were or his purpose
was, but his role in politics is what really matters. Weintraub does not add
anything to the history of this, although it is by far the most interesting
aspect of his career. Richard Shannon's The Age of Disraeli (1992) probably
came out too late for Weintraub to take account of it, but in any case the
political side of a man who led the Conservative Party for 13 years and was
Prime Minister for seven does not seem to be his main interest. On one
politically relevant matter he does throw new light. This is the odious
anti-semitism with which Disraeli, despite being a confirmed member of the
Church of England, was continuously assailed right to the end. I believe now
that I under-estimated this in my own book.
There is an enjoyable parallel in modern times to events at the end of
Disraeli's career, though Weintraub could not have known it when he wrote.
Margaret Thatcher is not exactly a Disraeli-like figure, and Disraeli never
wrote his memoirs. But he did publish, shortly after he had been ousted in
1880, a semi-autobiographical novel, Endymion, for which he received a
Pounds 10,000 advance, enormous by the standards of the day and larger than
any known before.
Despite elaborate security a copy was leaked, and to the fury of all
concerned the Standard to a 'scoop' by printing in a pre-publication review
the juicier extracts. 'Plus ca change . . .' one might say.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Sport: The distinct tastes of the Japanese - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Norwegian Olympics are history as far as Japan is concerned. In Nagano
City, the Lillehammer of the Japan Alps, the mountains of Shiga Kogen and
Hakuba are where the action is until 1998.
The Japanese are relishing the role of organising the last Winter Olympics
of the 20th century. Huge neon signs proclaiming their triumph over their
rival, Utah, have been up and humming for two years. 'Welcome 1998 Winter
Olympics' flashes triumphantly opposite the Crescent Sky Bar on the 10th
floor of the Nagano Royal Hotel.
Any lingering echoes of the last Japanese Olympics on the island of
Hokkaido, in Sapporo, 22 years ago are half-forgotten. Indeed, many of
today's organisers were still in short trousers then.
Shiga Kogen is an extraordinary patchwork of 22 resortlets linked by more
than 80 lifts into one sprawling ski safari. They can all be skied
comfortably in a couple of days. I skied the western extremities of the
system at Okushigakogen, worked my way back via Yakebitai, Yamanokami,
Diamond and then attacked Nishitateyama, Tagamagahara, Higashitateyma and
Terakoya. This left 12 more areas to ski the following day, including
Sunvalley.
But the skiing in Japan, by and large, is fun but a trifle bland, with few
genuine black runs. Real Japanese skiing devotees get their kicks in Europe,
and one British tour operator, Powder Byrne has discovered something of a
niche market by organising their trips to Europe.
To British skiers, Powder Byrne are Swiss specialists. But the company's
alter ego sells France to the Japanese. Typical British Powder Byrne clients
would probably sniff at the idea of skiing in Val d'Isere - 'it is not our
sort of destination as far as the British market is concerned,' says the
company's managing director, Rory Byrne. 'But it is becoming a favourite
with the Japanese in spite of their long love affair with Switzerland. It's
extremely important to us, accounting for around 50 per cent of our total
turnover. In Britain we cater mainly for people aged between 35 and 55 who
want quality holidays in Switzerland' says Byrne.
'But the fastest-growing part of our business is taking young Japanese
skiers in their 20s and early 30s to Val d'Isere, Courchevel and Meribel in
France, as well as to the Swiss resorts the Japanese once traditionally went
to exclusively: Grindelwald, Zermatt and St Moritz.' The Japanese, wearing
the latest designer ski suits regardless of their ability, take their skiing
seriously. Their attitude to holidays tends to be different from ours.
Relaxation over lunch and apres-ski are anathema to them. They like to be
busy doing things - the more organised the better. Back home they pack half
a week's skiing into a weekend of intense activity, often skiing by floodlit
both before dawn and after dark.
According to Byrne, there are certain items the Japanese must have on a
skiing holiday in Europe: a proper bath and single beds. 'Unlike British
skiers who often complain if they are not given a double bed, The Japanese
insist on NOT having double beds' he says. 'We sell an enormous amount of
holidays to honeymoon couples, but for some reason even they insist on
single beds]'
At something like Pounds 1,200 for five days skiing (plus the inevitable day
for shopping) or as much as Pounds 4,000 for an eight day tour the Japanese
market provides lucrative business. Powder Byrne carry some 600 Japanese
skiers in winter and as many as 1,000 in Summer, including 'million yen'
tours to Britain.
Says Byrne: 'The Japanese are ski crazy, especially with the Olympics coming
up in Nagano. They have more skiers than any other nation - about 12.5m.
That's more than America. They are uniquely placed to be able enjoy skiing
all the year round with flights to New Zealand in the summer. But although
Japan has hundreds of resorts, they are nearly all on the small side. They
just don't have enough major areas to meet the growing demand. There's
certainly nothing remotely like Val d'Isere. So we bring them to Europe.
Byrne is casting his eye in the direction of Japan's neighbour, Korea.
In Japan, skiers seem to come in two groups: those who ski prettily and
daintily, and those who fall over a lot. Although the Japanese who come all
the way to France tend to be strong skiers, this is not always true among
heli-skiers. When they arrive in Switzerland they are almost inevitably
either among the best in the group, or - more often - by far the least
skilful. They are rarely average. This is partly explained by the fact that
back in Japan, skiers hardly ever ski off-piste and have virtually no
experience of powder. The good ones have usually learned in Canada, New
Zealand or Europe.
Because the Japanese are so keen to give helicopter skiing a whirl but are
so inexperienced, guides often carry with them a list of important Japanese
words to keep them out of trouble. These include such useful phrases as 'ki
o tsukete' (be careful) and 'o soku ite kudasai' (slow down, you are skiing
too fast])
When they are not skiing, the ubiquitous designer ski wear tends to make all
Japanese skiers - experts and beginners - look alike. One New Zealander who
skis regularly in Val d'Isere in ski-bum garb said scornfully: 'A few of
them spend a fortune on all this fancy equipment, snow plough for a few
turns and then fall over]'
Many male Japanese skiers seem terrified of losing face. They would sooner
ski slowly, with their bindings set low and look good than ski aggressively
fall, and risk looking foolish. They also like taking their heavily made-up
girlfriends - often quite timid, fair-weather skiers - on to the slopes with
them to provide an appreciative audience. Many even keep in touch with their
female companions by walkie-talkie. This allows a Japanese skier who has
reached the sanctuary of a mid-mountain restaurant to ask his wife or
girlfriend - possibly still struggling in a blizzard outside - what she
would care to order for lunch]

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST, nearly the end of the world, then the lights go out over Europe. On
Wednesday a bad night in European club competitions drew another set of
obituaries for British soccer. Both the remaining Scottish clubs and the top
two finishers from last season's English Premier League were eliminated in
only the second round.
Aberdeen and Aston Villa squandered hard-won advantages by losing at home.
In the Champions cup, Manchester United, ambushed by Galatasaray at home,
never looked capable of gaining the win it needed in Istanbul (where the
hosts deserved more than the whining tabloid chauvinism that greeted their
team's success).
It is the third year in a row that the English champions have been knocked
out in the second round of a cup that once spent six years in England. To
lose once at this stage in a cup competition may be bad luck, but to lose
three times in a row suggests carelessness.
And yet there were also signs of health. Norwich City completed a famous
victory over Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal hit seven goals away
to Standard Liege in the Cup Winners Cup.
There is a school of thought that any night that Arsenal score seven is a
bad night for English soccer. Last season the club captured both English cup
competitions. But the grudging reaction of the press and the hostility of
opposing fans imply that the club's triumphs are of little worth because of
the defensive manner in which they were achieved.
This season, George Graham, the Arsenal manager, has become almost
evangelical in the way he talks about his club's style. He speaks as if he
is the keeper of a pure tradition of British soccer. 'We keep hearing about
these lovely passing teams,' he said after one of his side's goalless draws.
'What happens when they lose?'
After Wednesday night, Graham might well repeat the question. Villa and
United, two teams which invariably win style points from the critics, found
the simple passing game that works for them in England falling apart. Both
were sunk by their inability to construct creative moves in midfield. Paul
Ince, Roy Keane and the ageing Bryan Robson, United's international midfield
trio, were outplayed by their Turkish counterparts. Villa were made to look
like trundlers by Deportivo La Coruna. Villa's only midfield player capable
of thinking before he acted was Gordon Cowans. But he is 35 and by the time
he had thought it was often too late to act.
Both teams, like the England international side which has a midfield
anchored by Ince, are victims of the shortage of creative midfielders in
English soccer (Scotland, as always, is better supplied in this area). It is
a measure of the problem that so many Premier League teams rely for their
creativity on players well into their 30s: Cowans, Paul Davis, Ray Wilkins,
Glenn Hoddle, Gordon Strachan, Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle, Paul Bracewell
and even lovable Steve McMahon.
A list of accomplished English midfield passers still in their (theoretical)
prime starts with Paul Gascoigne, ends with Nigel Clough and includes only
one other name: Ian Crook. Against a Bayern team stuffed with
internationals, Norwich, directed by Crook, never had any difficulty passing
the ball.
This shortage of what used to be known as midfield 'schemers' may be a
symptom of a flaw in the English game. Perhaps the helter-skelter pace of
play stunts the development of intelligent midfield players. It may also
simply be a historical accident. You wait for 10 years for a world class
midfield man, then three pass at once. There are several promising young
midfielders at Premier League clubs. Their development will be a measure of
English soccer's suitability as a habitat for the species.
The elimination of Bayern puts Wednesday's results in perspective. Nobody
would suggest that German soccer is in crisis because its most prestigious
team was outplayed by a side from an East Anglian market town.
The Germans do not over-react to failure. The English approach European
competitions with a constant inferiority complex. English clubs' recent
record in Europe is reminiscent of the early 1960s when even the best
English clubs seemed overawed by the idea of competing with Real Madrid and
Benfica. English teams, led by Liverpool in the days before teams were
limited to three 'foreigners', established a psychological dominance over
continental teams in the 1970s and 1980s; a period which coincided with a
poor period for the England international team. But this evaporated during
the five year ban following the Heysel Stadium riot in 1985.
The ban also meant that England slid to the bottom of the table of European
success which determines UEFA cup places. England now receives only two
against four before the ban. In a cup competition doubling a country's
entries doubles its chances of success.
Another effect of the Heysel ban was to reduce the number of high-level
games top English clubs played. England's run to the semi-finals of the 1990
World Cup followed five years of European exile and two seasons in which the
English first division contained just 20 clubs.
This year's international debacle is related to the damage done by the
increase in the matches top English players play at home and in Europe. When
the England squad assembles before internationals the hotel often looks like
a scene from MASH
But while English soccer struggles to compete on the pitch it is healthy off
it. It has huge television revenues and lucrative sponsorship and kit
contracts. Gates are rising and the the Football Trust is helping finance
the reconstruction of the grounds. English soccer's top clubs can compete
financially with the richest in Europe.
Before this recent bonanza English soccer's response to any financial
difficulty was to invent another competition. Now the problem is to persuade
the Premier League clubs to cut the games they play by trimming the size of
the division or from the Coca-Cola cup.
Two years ago when Graham Kelly, the Football Association secretary, was
luring the old first division clubs from the Football League to the Premier
League, he insisted that the league would eventually shrink to 18 sides. So
far he has not persuaded any clubs to vote themselves out of his new land of
milk and honey. Perhaps if the mood of gloom begins to depress gates and
revenues the clubs will act in the best interests of the English game. A few
more apocalyptic headlines might even help.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Motoring: An unruffled estate - Test Drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNPAVED track to the quarry was long and rough and the load of stone in
the back of the Citroen XM estate weighed well over half a ton. But the big
car seemed not to notice. It rode the bumps with the tranquility of an ocean
liner in a slight swell.
Back on the tarmac, it handled and cornered as it had on the outward
journey, running light. There could have been no better demonstration of the
merits of the Citroen's unique suspension, in which high-pressure gas
replaces steel springs and hydraulics keep the car at a constant level,
regardless of load.
The system is semi-active. Electronic sensors detect when the car is
cornering and stiffen the suspension on the outside of the curve, minimising
body roll. As a bonus, ground clearance can be increased instantly by about
2 in (5 cm) at the touch of a control. In the year and 12,000 miles (almost
20,000 km) I have been driving the XM Turbo SD estate, this has come in
handy when I have met floods or driven down ridged farm roads on which a
more conventional car might have left its exhaust system behind.
The XM is a turbo-diesel with automatic transmission. Its worst fuel
consumption - full tank to full tank - has been 30.8 mpg (9.17 l/100 km),
its best 38.5 mpg (7.34 l/100 km), and the average, 34.9 mpg (8.1 l/100 km).
For a large, two-pedal estate car with air-conditioning - which is bliss in
summer but does nothing for fuel economy - I rate this very good. It means I
have to fill up only at 500/550-mile (800/880-km) intervals. Fuel economy
would be even better if the transmission changed up earlier when
accelerating gently, and were less eager to change down on hills.
Citroen obviously decided that the XM turbo-diesel should drive as much like
a petrol car as possible. It is satisfyingly quick off the mark and
overtakes confidently but the 12-valve engine is on the small side (only
2,088 cc) and has to work quite hard. With the lightest of feet on the
accelerator, the transmission does not go into top under 50 mph (80 kmh)
and, on the over-run, drops down to third at about 45 mph (72 kmh).
On hills, it will hunt between third and second unless these gears are
selected manually but, once in top, the XM has a long and economical stride.
At 81 mph (130 kmh), the French autoroute limit, the engine is turning over
at well under 3,000 rpm and there is more noise from the tyres and wind than
under the bonnet.
The only time the engine has failed to fire first time was a failure of the
gizmo that prevents the starter from working unless the transmission
selector is in park or neutral. A faulty relay was diagnosed. The only other
minor blot in the XM's copybook was a drive belt that came off the
alternator pulley last winter.
Like all big Citroens, the XM, with its armchair ride and roomy interior, is
at its best on long journeys. Few cars leave driver and passengers so
unstressed. On French D roads - or British A or B roads, for that matter -
it swoops along, unruffled by surfaces that disturb cars suspended less
well. Back-seat leg and hip room is generous for two, adequate for three.
The slab-sided load space swallows two golf bags and trolleys with room to
spare for weekend luggage. Fold the back seat and the XM's carrying capacity
rivals - although, for load floor length alone, does not quite match - that
of a Volvo 940, Vauxhall Carlton or Mercedes E-Class estate.
Useful features include twin information read-outs. They give specific
information: which door is not closed properly, the temperature outside, and
which suspension mode (automatic or the stiffer sort, which I never use) has
been selected. The radio controls built into the steering wheel hub are a
boon although they probably will have to give way to an air-bag when the XM
has its mid-life facelift.
The foot parking brake, which is enough to put some potential buyers off a
manual gearbox XM, is fine on the automatic. That is because you need it
only for parking, not for starting, on a steep hill. Then, I follow the
sensible American practice of left-foot braking, as I do when manoeuvring in
confined spaces.
The list price of the XM 2.1D Turbo SD automatic estate is Pounds 21,980,
which includes ABS brakes but not air-conditioning, a Pounds 1,450 extra.
Footnote: Many readers have written agreeing with this column's comments two
weeks ago on the way officialdom appears not to take seriously driving
without insurance. I shall give a selection of your views when I return to

FT  06 NOV 93 / Sport: Serving up young British winners - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS Stefan Edberg who prompted the thought. Edberg, Sweden's former world
No. 1, is a London resident, and is often to be seen hitting with the
leading British players. 'So many of them practise beautifully but they have
no idea how to win their matches' he told me between matches in Hong Kong.
Sweeping generalisations are dangerous, but Stefan has a point. Ever since I
have been associated with the game, British tennis players, men and women,
have been late developers. Fred Perry was 25 before he won the first of his
three Wimbledon titles in 1934. Angela Mortimer, was 29 when she became
Britain's first post-war winner in 1961; Ann Jones was 30 when she followed
Mortimer eight years later; Virginia Wade, Britain's last champion, was
almost 32 when she won in 1977.
The explanation? Well, part of the reason is the lack of intensive
competition in the early years. Winning is a habit. The only way to develop
it is to compete from an early age. That is what Edberg did.
'Before I was 12 I was playing a tournament every week. There were dozens of
kids from my home district in Vastervik, all as eager as I was to win.
Competition became a way of life. Only the best players went on to national
competitions. The right incentives were there.'
Jeremy Bates, the 31-year-old British No 1, who has been in Telford this
week defending his title at the Volkswagen National Championships, had no
such early training in the art of winning.
'As a junior I was three or four years behind kids from Europe. Living in
Solihull there was no-one to practise against. In the winter it was dark in
the evenings when I came out of school and there was only one indoor court -
at the Edgbaston Priory club - which was always booked. So I could only play
at weekends, weather permitting, and could only compete in a few junior
tournaments in the holidays. I can now see that all this was totally
inadequate. No wonder it took me years to learn to win matches.'
Chris Bailey, 25 years old and the British No 3, is another who had sparse
competition between the ages of 12 and 17, the years when habits are formed.
'I played everything else at school - football, cricket, badminton, rugby
and basketball. During term my tennis coaching had to be squeezed in with
visits to Brian Blincoe in Norwich. The only competition I had was at local
tournaments in the holidays and the occasional Saab tournament, when
invited. So, aged 16, I took myself off to Norway and Sweden for two of the
International Tennis Federation junior tournaments. I was very green - and
very lonely, too. It was hell even getting somewhere to practise. When I saw
how good the other players my age were, especially the Swedes, I realised
how much I had to learn about winning matches.'
When he was 17 the lanky Norfolk lad, inexperienced and physically immature
but possessing obvious potential, was selected for the Lawn Tennis
Association's Laing Squad. This was the chance Bailey had been waiting for.
His first official overseas trip was to Bangkok with team captain Nigel
Sears. 'Nigel put me through such a punishing regime of training I was
reduced to tears . . . it all was very painful . . . but at least I knew I
still wanted to make tennis my career.'
That career was almost ended in 1990 when Bailey snapped the anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee, an injury that required surgery and
cost him two years. To his credit, Bailey simply redoubled his efforts and,
with the help of Sears and his wife, rebuilt his shattered leg. 'I feel all
the stronger as a result,' he says. 'But I still have to prove myself on the
court.'
Much as we all admired Bailey's heroic performance against Goran Ivanisevic
at Wimbledon this year (who but a madman would have attempted an ace on a
second serve at match point down?), the fact is Bailey lost a match he could
 -perhaps should - have won. He had still not learned the trick of turning a
winning chance into victory.
That is a quality sought by Britain's national training manager, Billy
Knight, himself a dogged competitor in the 1950s. 'Until they learn to
convert their wining chances they are not real competitors,' he says. 'The
only way you learn to do that is to play hundreds of matches. Ever since I
started this job in May 1991 I have been nagging and badgering the LTA to
create more tournaments. At last things are happening. Next year we will
have four Satellite circuits - that is 16 weeks of international competition
 -as well as the 21 weeks of domestic competition on the Reebok circuit.'
Knight is encouraged by (but certainly not complacent about) the minor
British successes that are now beginning to appear. 'Take our new junior
champion, James Fox. After an intensive match-playing schedule on the South
American junior circuit he played in his first Satellite circuit and
qualified for the Masters. That earned him three computer points. Now he has
just qualified in Bangkok and won his first round. Nothing to get excited
about but good positive progress.'
Certainly the atmosphere at Telford this week has been much more positive.
Matches on the new cushioned acrylic courts have been hard, competitive and
skilful.
'We are getting there slowly,' said Knight. 'Each year sees a slight
improvement. Players are altogether more professional in their approach to
life and are showing a greater belief in themselves. There is also a greater
togetherness. Instead of being jealous of the successes of others they now
see a good result from a rival as a challenge to themselves. That is a
healthy sign.'
Also healthy is the increase in activity among the tinies. Mark Cox, who
directs the nationwide Rover scheme, is quietly building an understanding
between coaches, parents and hand-picked pupils in the 10-12 age group to
provide them with facilities and the opportunity for regular coaching and
competition. If the experience of Edberg is anything to go by, this is the
most important area of all.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Property: What to do if it's all Greek to you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEARNING Greek is the top requisite for buying property in Greece. And, when
you are there, be natural: Greeks are quick to spot poseurs. Make friends,
go and drink in the kafenion, and try to get to know the local builders - as
many as you can - by their first names. Then, there is a good chance your
Greek home will be a dream come true.
Good personal relations ease every part of life, from paying the electricity
bill to working with the lawyer who buys the property for you. Friends can
put in a word for you with sticky officials and help with such sagas as
building permits or getting a telephone line, which could take years without
mesa (connections) - although, if you have a major problem, remember that
your friends' influence probably rises or falls with the government of the
day; the election victory last month of Andreas Papandreou's socialist party
put decisions on hold throughout the country.
Allow plenty of time to travel and look, and make sure you know the people
and place before you and your lawyer (or whoever is helping you) start
negotiations. This is especially important if you want to restore a derelict
house. Did you look in the next valley in case it has a better one?
Time spent in the kafenion, when you can catch people in the early evening
on their return from work in the fields, might give the lead to the house
you want. But never negotiate when others are about.
Go somewhere private, allow time for the preliminaries ('Where are you from?
How many children do you have?') and be in no hurry to name a price. Once
you have done that, there is no going back.
Water can be a problem. What is the supply: spring, well or mains? Does it
run all the year? Have there been restrictions? How did the village fare in
recent dry spells? And what does it cost?
Be prepared for bad news. Many places have water cuts, often, and some small
islands depend on tankers. Foreigners' notions of six showers a day, and
perhaps a swimming pool, vanish quickly when the water runs for only four
hours every other day, as happened in a village I know in Cyprus three years
ago. However good the supply, you are bound to have the other problem -
blockages. Drains are never big enough and a friendly plumber is crucial.
The extended family is another hazard. The house might be owned jointly by
many members of the family, some in the US or Australia. Yet, you need their
signatures.
Do not despair. If both sides really want the sale, a way will be found. But
watch out, also, in case a husband agrees to sell property that is not
really his but his wife's as part of her dowry. The transaction will not
succeed if she is unwilling to sell.
To guide you through such complications, you need good angels and lawyers -
and a Greek's elasticity about time. (When you want to be punctual, the
phrase is angliki ora - English time.) If you are tolerant, work as the
Greeks do - with their conventions and their ideas of good and bad form -
and do not cause anyone to lose face, a happy house in Hellas awaits.
Ever more local airports in Greece take charter flights where you travel
'seat only' from airports all over the UK. It is easy to reach your new
home. I flew to Heraklion in Crete from Gatwick for Pounds 132 return last
month, but I could as easily have gone from Bristol or Newcastle. These
charters have the bonus of not having to change at Athens airport (although,
if you do fly through the capital, take Olympic for the international sector
as well as the domestic: the change is much easier).
In choosing a house, I would look for plentiful water; terraces; some trees
(or, at least, a vine trellis) for shade; a view, meaning that it would be
on higher ground; near both a clean (and relatively unknown) beach as well
as mountains; and with good tavernas within walking distance so that I could
follow the Greek custom of eating out cheaply and often.
It would probably be in a village but on the edge, where it is quieter;
Greek villages are surprisingly noisy. Before dawn tractors, pick-up vans
and cockerels compete; in the day, mothers shriek for their children; and,
in the evening, the local lads parade their motorbikes.
Outside, basil and geranium would be growing in old olive oil cans painted
white. In the kitchen, there would be green olive oil from a local press;
currants hand-packed into old Nescafe tins, with bay leaves put among them;
and, if in Crete, a large bottle of raki, a drink distilled from fermenting
grapes three weeks after they have been pressed for wine, and drunk in
thimble-size glasses.
Raise a glass, then, in the old toast for new houses: kalorizika. It means
'good roots.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / Property: Greece opens its doors - Foreigners, especially EC
citizens, now find it much easier to buy houses there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERSHIP of the European Community has been making a real impact at last
on residential property in Greece. In the past two or three years, the
country has removed most of its restrictions on buying by foreigners -
something which has been of major benefit for EC citizens, especially.
One knock-on effect has been the growth in the number of agents in Britain
offering Greek property. And, for someone in the UK seeking a holiday home
in Greece, there is a colourful choice and a broad price range.
It is very much a tiered market, though. At one end is the small, renovated
old stone property or the possibility oF having an equally small new home
built, either way under Pounds 50,000 and probably on Crete, largest of the
Greek islands.
At the other end is something more glamorous, on its own and close to the
water on some lesser-known island - with a price tag probably over Pounds
250,000.
There are many islands to consider, along with their various transport
links. The Secretariat-General for Information in Athens said in a recent
official booklet that 'this small, mountainous country' had 9,841 islands -
provoking the question: who had time to count? But the tourist office in
London suggests a more manageable figure of 1,500 that are inhabited.
The most popular is Crete, 160 miles long with mountains and spectacular
gorges. And Hellenic Heritage Homes in Britain concentrates on this island,
where it has a team operating. 'We have an active building programme
restoring traditional Cretan houses,' says Hellenic spokesman Stefan
Nicholls.
The company is involved in a number of property-related activities. It has
plots available and can design and build new homes. It also has businesses
for sale.
But it also has good advice for anyone viewing a property independently: do
not show your interest but, instead, act like a curious tourist. 'If you
show your delight in a property, the price will increase in proportion to
your smile,' Hellenic warns.
Typically, it has a stone-built property awaiting renovation at Mourne. This
would make a two-bedroom home with an archway leading to an enclosed garden.
It has water and electricity is ready for connection. The property is Pounds
15,000 and restoration would cost another Pounds 17,000.
Alternatively, a small plot at Kissos, on the edge of the village and with
views across a broad valley, would be Pounds 10,500. Utilities are nearby
and a two-bedroom house could be built there for Pounds 30,000. A total of
Pounds 42,000 would cover the land, property, professional fees and taxes,
says Nicholls.
If you prefer a holiday home on one of the other islands, the John Goodwin
Greek Property Consultancy might help. A well-presented, 38-page brochure
gives clear information about buying procedures and illustrates many island
choices.
Examples include a renovated house overlooking the yachting harbour of
Patitiri, on Alonislios in the Sporades and close to mainland Greece. It has
three bedrooms, a balcony and terraces plus an unrestored stone cottage.
There are olive, lemon and cherry trees in the garden. Price: Pounds
105,000.
On Skiathos, in the northern Sporades, there are furnished, split-level
one-bedroom apartments with views to the outer islands and the Aegean sea.
They are priced at Pounds 46,000. On Zakynthos, the southernmost of the
Ionian islands, a picturesque, rambling, three-storey villa with four
bedrooms and a separate studio/flat, in an acre plot, is Pounds 170,000.
It might be possible to recoup some of this outlay with summer rentals, for
which there is a big demand.
Goodwin also offers property in Crete. He points out that, before 1990,
non-Greeks were not permitted to buy freehold property there as it was
designated a border area. Only enough properties were built to satisfy Greek
requirements.
When the restrictions were relaxed, demand by foreigners created a shortage
on the island, with increased prices. He recommends buying a plot and
building because the savings could be 'substantial.'
While the Greek islands are sought-after more than the mainland, villas are
more expensive to build on them. Corfu, the best-known of the Ionian chain,
once was a British protectorate.
Today, with 4m olive trees (the groves were planted by the Venetians during
their long occupation) and its international airport, it represents the old
and new worlds. It is also in the process of sprucing itself up.
Greece will take over the EC presidency from January and a summit meeting is
to be held on the island. Unfortunately, its new 200-berth marina, being
built with EC money, will not be open until 1995.
Sotheby's International Real ty has a variety of properties on Corfu, with
prices from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 1.3m. One is a four-year-old holiday
house on a sunny ridge, between the mountains and the sea.
It has four bedrooms, and its two wings are joined by a central living room
and dining area. There are several terraces, a guest studio and a large
swimming pool in the middle of the lawn. Price: Pounds 650,000.
On Hydra, where no motor vehicles are allowed and life centres on the
harbour town, Sotheby's is offering a converted windmill on a hilltop
overlooking the harbour. Accommodation includes two circular bedrooms with
bathrooms, a salon with kitchen, and a terrace with wide-ranging views. The
American owner is seeking Pounds 325,000.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Travel: Corsica - tourism down, explosions up - It is known
as l'Ile de Beaute. And so it will remain until the bombs and vendettas stop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

CORSICANS are hotheads by temperament, extremists by political conviction,
thugs by vocation. When they are not blowing up police barracks they are
sticking knives into each other. They are clannish, secretive, proud,
excitable, vengeful, intolerant of authority and intensely patriotic. For
such a small island there is simply too much Latin passion surging about.
Such, at least, is the general view of Corsica entertained by the mainland
French, themselves no slouches when it comes to Latin passion. But then the
French might not have an unbiased view of Corsica: they have been struggling
unsuccessfully to make proud Frenchmen of stubborn Corsicans since they took
control of the island from the Genoese 224 years ago.
One must never, I reminded myself on setting out, take French indignation
too seriously. I was interested to see what a little tour of Corsica might
show me beyond thuggery and passion.
At Marseille airport I picked up a few news periodicals for the hour-long
flight to Bastia. They were not encouraging. I read that Corsican tourism
was down 30 per cent this year. Investment was down. So was employment. The
only thing that was up was explosions.
Last year the FLNC - Corsican National Liberation Front - and other groups
of the Corsican independence movement claimed a record 309 bomb attacks on
the island. So far this year there have been 23 political assassinations.
The most recent was the gunning down in a Bastia street of Robert Sozzi, a
young militant nationalist who dared criticise his FLNC leaders for
fund-raising by extortion and protection racketeering. Added to bombings and
bank robberies, such behaviour is putting French mainlanders off the place
they still call l'Ile de Beaute.
Surely Corsicans could not be as hot-headed outside the political sphere as
in, I reasoned. The local news in La Corse, an island daily, would surely be
a little brighter. But no.
The Costa brothers from the village of Moltifao had shot a hostage in a
hold-up. Andre Bourdelles had shot a man who had crept up and tried to rape
him while he was taking his afternoon siesta. Everyone was shooting everyone
else. Gerard Berthier, for his part, was on trial for shooting his wife, who
had been provoking him.
'Angry, Bertier loaded a pistol and fired a warning shot into the stairs,'
said the report. 'This did not seem to frighten his wife who, on the
contrary, defied him by proffering her left breast: 'Shoot, if you are a
man]', Maryse Camolli shouted. Berthier fired and Maryse Camolli was, this
time, mortally wounded.'
Daily life seemed even more dreadfully hot-headed and Latin than political
life. Not even the sports pages were left unbloodied. They showed a colour
picture of leathery, whiskery-faced men in bandoliers standing over a row of
equally leathery, whisker-faced boar.
The main difference was that the men were alive, the boar dead. Underneath,
La Corse announced it was offering prizes to some of the 500 village hunting
teams which each year shoot more than 10,000 wild boar in Corsica. For an
island of 250,000 inhabitants, that is some shooting.
I stopped just long enough in Bastia to pick up a rental car and headed for
the deep countryside. Even here, though, one cannot entirely avoid the
separatist propaganda blitz. As I drove through a warm, late autumn
landscape seared brown and gold by four months of strong sun, I read the
graffiti that appeared on signpost and rock face along the winding road.
'Corsica Nazione]', 'Independenza]' it cheered in a language that remains
closer to medieval Tuscan than modern French.
But for anyone with their eyes open to what lies behind the spray-painted
exhortations, there is an unexpected dividend to Corsica's centuries-old
legacy of political hot-headedness.
Today Corsica remains one of the most spectacularly beautiful and
commercially undeveloped areas left in the Mediterranean. A little bit of
terrorism goes a long way - who will invest in an island where not even
French mainland insurance companies will offer cover on holiday homes?
Up and over the the mountainous centre of the island I wound. The French
19th century novelist Prosper Merimee called Corsica 'a mountain in the
sea,' and he was right. Just half-an-hour's drive from the coast I was
looking up at Mount Cinto, 9,000ft above the water.
Corsica is one of those places that could be many places. By the sea I had
passed beaches where the palms were as lush, the sand as white and the water
as clear as any South Pacific island. On the Scala di Santa Regina, at the
base of Mount Cinto, my car crawled up rocky, dry, narrow defiles that made
the Hindu Kush look gentle.
Near Calacuccia, amid lonely farmhouses and herds of black, half-wild pigs
snuffling around tree roots, I found myself in chestnut forests reminiscent
of the Cevennes. Still further on, at Valdo Niello, I entered thick pine
forests where chalets and summer-bare ski slopes reminded me of the Rockies.
Finally, just four hours after leaving the east coast, I popped out on the
west, at the gulf of Porto. Its high, bare red granite bays and promentories
rising sheer out of the sea, it is like nowhere else on earth.
If Corsica's countryside is spectacular, wild and in autumn nearly deserted,
its villages are civilised in the sun-drugged fashion that only
out-of-the-way Mediterranean towns can be. I saw only sleeping dogs, widows
in black and old men who watch every move you make.
Nor were there bomb explosions or bank alarms ringing when I was in the old
quarter of Ajaccio, the nearest thing Corsica has to a city. It is a place
of bars and palm trees and sun-faded awnings, whiffs of cat-pee and narrow
streets ending in sudden bright patches of sea.
I liked watching the stone-masons who sat outside the old Bonaparte house in
Ajaccio resting and eating pizzas of anchovies and tomato paste. I liked the
old man who called up to the kitten meowling for him from his first-floor
window: 'Eh] Basta]' Intensely Mediterranean, intensely conservative, this
is a place of slow, fixed rhythms. I am not surprised the young Napoleon
felt he had to clear out to get anything done.
These days, though, nowhere in the Mediterranean escapes the summer crowds.
If the mainland French are nervous of their countrymen's hospitality, the
Italians and Germans are less so. On the magnificent beach of Roccapina I
discovered a bay full of beautiful people; I had no idea that crewing
leisure craft in the nude was so popular.
In the resort town of Porto Vecchio, I dropped into Chez Laurent, a pasta
restaurant built into the town's medieval walls. Dining on lasagna and
gazing down on to the lights of the harbour, I asked Jackie Fadda, Laurent's
American wife, how foreigners got on with hot-blooded locals.
'Once a group of British football hooligans on their way to Sardinia tried
to make trouble in the bars here,' she told me. 'The shotguns were out in no
time at all. A few Brits were hurt and the rest spent most of the night
hiding under cars in the street. I don't imagine they will come back.
'But most foreigners know it doesn't pay to mess around with Corsicans. And
most Corsicans, even nationalists, want nothing to do with political
violence. This is not a political issue as much as an emotional one:
Corsicans get excited when they think of real estate speculators, the Mafia
and multi-national companies taking over and ruining their beautiful island.
It is a question of honour. They are actually a very hospitable people.'
Until the vendettas and bombs stop and the tourists start coming, Corsica,
wild and woolly, will remain l'Ile de Beaute.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Travel: Across the roof of Russia - Nick Haslam treks
through some of the most impressive terrain in the central Caucasus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER FOUR hours of hard climbing, we paused for breath. High above us,
shrouded in mist, lay the jagged wall of Ullu Tau.
At over 4,000 metres it is one of the most difficult mountains in the
central Caucasus to climb. Deeply fissured glaciers cling to its
near-perpendicular sides, and occasionally in the still mountain air we
would hear a crack and rumble as stones cascaded down the screes.
Below, the Adyr-su valley wound like a narrow corridor under a ceiling of
cloud. Our guide, a slender Russian girl called Galia, pointed to a
snow-covered pass which climbed above the other side of a wide grey glacier.
'That leads to Georgia,' she said. 'But without crampons, we cannot go on.'
It was just as well, for ages in our group of 10 walkers ranged from 28 to
70, and the thin air was beginning to take its toll.
A natural barrier between the steppes of central Russia and Iran, the
Caucasus have witnessed countless tribal migrations. By the early 20th
century, more than 50 languages were spoken in the Caucasian region, and the
tribes that inhabited its steep valleys had a reputation for fierce
independence. Stalin had attempted to quell opposition by deporting entire
populations to Siberia and central Asia.
But many returned following his death, and with the collapse of the Soviet
Union long-buried ethnic rivalries are surfacing once more. It was strange
to think that only 200 kilometres from where we sat on the silent mountain
side, civil war was breaking out on the Black Sea coast of Georgia.
We had lunch in a refuge at 3,500m. Around the steel-clad hut, high cliffs
dropped sheer to the glaciers. Brown-haired ibex with long curved horns eyed
us curiously, taking flight if anyone came near, vaulting effortlessly over
vertiginous drops to land on ledges that seemed only centimetres wide.
The high mountain pastures were rich in flowers and, as we walked down,
Galia picked a large bunch which she said would make an excellent tea when
dried. Suddenly I heard her laugh. She came over. She was clutching a
strange-looking grass with long white tuberous roots.
'It's called Yatrishnik,' she said, 'brought here by the Mongols centuries
ago and very good for a man's - ' and she hesitated, searching for a word '
 -potation.' We looked puzzled, and then she made an unmistakeable gesture.
'You mean potency,' I said. She smiled, and then with a wicked laugh
proffered me the plant, saying: 'You never know when you might need it.'
That night we stayed in a simple mountain lodge run by Galia's friends, and
a group of Russian mountain climbers joined us at supper. We toasted each
other in vodka, and they told us that the mountains each contained a spirit
which cared for the souls of mountaineers killed in accidents.
They had come to the Adyr-su valley to commemorate the death of a famous
Russian climber killed on Ullu Tau the year before, and we were shocked to
learn that he had been Galia's husband. In the morning, as we left the
valley, the road passed by the simple cemetery at the foot of the mountain,
and we saw the climbers and Galia standing in silence around a granite
headstone.
That day, we travelled 550km by bus down to the south-eastern end of the
Caucasus in the republic of Dagestan. The wide, dusty, poplar-lined road was
empty, save for the occasional cart so laden with grass that it looked like
a moving haystack.
We crossed through the newly autonomous republics of North Ossetia and
Ingoushetsia and at the border tension was palpable. Hastily constructed
blockhouses confronted each other across a no-man's land of gleaming new
razor wire, and nervous young soldiers trained heavy machine-guns. We
changed buses shortly afterwards; our driver told us he had to return to
Adyr-su before sundown because several buses on that road had been hijacked
at night and the drivers murdered.
In Dagestan the southern Caucasus had lost the lush alpine feel of the
Adyr-su valley. High jagged petrified waves of limestone loomed over rolling
terraced hills where peasant women in headscarves were erecting stooks of
recently-cut corn.
For three days we walked along the high mountain tracks, occasionally
crossing the Old Silk Road, which centuries before had been the quickest
overland route between China and Europe.
Villages on rocky hilltops, which were once fortified, looked little
changed, with houses piled upon each other and wide glassed-in verandas
giving stupendous views over the deep valleys below.
We stayed overnight in village homes, eating and drinking with our hosts
late into the night. They were generous and eager to talk, for westerners
were rare in this part of the world. In the mountain village of Kumuk, the
school teacher said he had little time for the recent changes. For him,
Russia was turning its back on its former satellite states. 'A kilo of meat
now costs 1,000 roubles (Dollars 1),' he said. 'My salary is 30,000 roubles
a month; perestroika is all very well, but you can't feed a family with it.'
At our last village in the Caucasus a wedding feast was taking place, and
dancers whirled around the bride and groom who were seated at a long table
in the shade of a vine. As we arrived, tired and dusty from the day's walk,
the tamada, or toast master, was making a speech. When he heard we were
British, he found places for us at the table, and caused a long series of
toasts to be drunk to friendship between Great Britain and the people of
Dagestan.
It was surprising how quickly vodka can overcome fatigue. Despite having
walked nearly 20km that day, we were all soon practising Dagestani dance
steps to the music of accordion and whistle played by three villagers.
On our last day we wound down from the mountains and caught our first
glimpse of the coastal plain of the Caspian sea. It was good to rest on a
beach, and swim. That night we built a fire and sat in silence under the
stars. Former travellers would have embarked here to cross the Caspian for
Kazakstan and China beyond. It was galling to think that for us, the slow
journey to the east was over and that tomorrow we would be on the morning
flight to Moscow.
Nick Haslam travelled to the Caucasus with Exodus Expeditions: 9 Weir Road,
London SW12 0LT. Tel: 081-675-5550. The company's 17-day 'Caucasian
Explorer,' which includes a day in Moscow and two in St Petersburg, costs
Pounds 1,200, including flights from London. 'Russia is a buzz area for us,'
said an Exodus marketing person.
'We have 18 Russian itineraries, ranging from historic buildings to remote
trekking. Dates for the Caucasian Explorer trip in 1994 are July 1 to
mid-September. Other tours are more generally available.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / Travel: 'Temple,' said Hubert. 'Caves.' 'River.' - Kieran
Cooke travels through Sri Lanka with a Sinhalese driver who turns out to be
a master of the one-liner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUBERT, the driver, had ears the size of cabbage leaves. They had great
bushes of hair trailing out of them. At times the light would filter through
them, like butterfly wings at sunset.
We rattled and jostled over the roads of Sri Lanka.
Hubert was a man of few words. 'School,' he would say as we passed a school.
An hour would go by. 'Buffalo,' he would grunt, and sure enough there was a
water buffalo, cavorting in a pond.
Another interval. We approached a church. I waited. 'Cemetery,' said Hubert.
Then, in a flush of verbosity: 'Dead people.'
I read somewhere that when the Dutch, good Christians to the core, arrived
in Sri Lanka, they carried their tombstones with them. Everything was
engraved on the stone but the final date of departure.
A good job colonialism took place in the age of the boat and not the jet.
'Any hand luggage, sir?' 'No, only my tombstone. Can I put it under the
seat?'
I shared these thoughts with Hubert. He wobbled his head but said nothing.
We went from Colombo to Nuwara Eliya in the hills. We stayed at the Hill
Club, where the termites are steadily chomping their way through the
library. The waiters, venerable men with grey moustaches, wore white gloves.
Hubert slurped the Brown Windsor soup appreciatively. He worked his way
through the steak and kidney. Hubert liked English food. He said spicy Sri
Lankan food gave him terrible wind. He asked for seconds of the apple
crumble.
We went on to Trincomalee on the east coast. Going through parts of Sri
Lanka is a bit like riding through Northern Ireland. Sailing along, not a
care in the world and suddenly, round a bend, there is a road block, with
men in khaki bristling with guns.
They say there are plenty of Tamil Tiger separatists round Trincomalee.
People refer to the Tigers, rather quaintly, as 'those boys.' But the Tigers
are fierce and frightening and best avoided.
There are ways of dealing with road blocks. I once had a driver in Belfast
called Carruthers. We never had any problems with the police or military.
Hubert worked a similar magic. He would say a few rushed words in Sinhalese.
He would point a thumb over his shoulder at me.
For all I knew he was telling them he had Mountbatten in the back of the
car. The soldier would wobble his head. Hubert wobbled back. We were waved
through.
Trincomalee, now sadly run down and neglected, has one of the world's finest
harbours. In the old days, when the British had a base there, 'Trinco' was
regarded as a plum posting.
'Cemetery,' said Hubert. 'For animals. British.' It was near the sea. Little
tombstones eaten away by the salt. But on some the writing was still
visible. 'Ned. A spaniel, always faithful. Died December 1909.'
Fort Frederick is on a magnificent spit of land jutting out into the Indian
ocean. Wellington stopped off there in 1799 after a bit of fun and games in
India. Stricken by malaria, the Duke missed his boat out, which subsequently
went down with all hands in the Gulf of Aden.
I pointed out to Hubert that if it hadn't been for Wellington's Trinco
stopover, Napoleon would probably have won at Waterloo and Britain would
have been eating croissants for breakfast for the last 180-odd years.
But then someone told me that the reason Napoleon lost was not because of
Wellington's cunning and superior tactics. Rather, the poor Frenchman was
suffering from terrible trouble with his teeth and could barely keep his
mind on matters at hand.
I laid these observations before Hubert. He listened gravely, wobbled his
head and cleared his throat loudly. He said nothing.
I met Mr Li in Trinco. Originally from Soochow, near Shanghai, war had
followed Mr Li around like the faithful spaniel in the cemetery. As a
teenager in the mid-1930s Mr Li had travelled with his father to Hong Kong,
Singapore and Penang, selling Soochow's famous silk to the hoi polloi.
Mr Li's father had gone missing, presumed dead, in Singapore. The Japanese
were in control of north China, the war broke out in the far east. Mr Li
carried on travelling and working. By the end of the war he was in Ceylon.
Just as Mr Li was ready to return to China, Mao Tse Tung marched into
Peking. Mr Li does not speak much Chinese now. He never really learned how
to cook Chinese food. The war with the Tamil Tigers has reduced the flow of
tourists to his small guesthouse. 'What to do?' says Mr Li. He has given up
any idea of ever returning to Soochow.
Hubert and I went back to Colombo. A seven-hour journey. From time to time I
nodded off in the back of the car.
'Train,' said Hubert. We bumped across a railway line. Years ago I'd
travelled on the now-closed line from Jaffna in the north to Colombo.
At one stage on the journey the carriages had gently come off the tracks.
People were calm. They climbed from the train and sought shade. A
conversation cranked its way into life between two elderly gentlemen. The
subject was trousers. Both had bought them at Marks and Spencer in London,
but at different branches.
'I always say the Edgware Road shop is better,' said one. 'Me, I always go
to the one in Oxford Street,' said the other.
I snoozed in the afternoon heat.
'Temple,' said Hubert. 'Caves.' 'River.'
I dreamt of big, green Irish cabbages.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Gardening: Buried past heralds fine fuchsia - Robin Lane Fox
explains why he is going to dig a hole this weekend and lay some old flowers
to rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A forward-looking fellow, I think of this article as back to the fuchsia.
For seven years, I have stayed away, driven off by interludes of white fly
and inertia in the face of winter. This year, I have returned to my old
allegiance: to fuchsias which span all social tastes and classes, from Lord
Roberts to Orange Drops and people with names like Annabelle Stocks. From
June until now, I have had the best of them  - in borders, as standards, or
in free-standing pots. I am returning to them this weekend for a ceremonial
pagan finale.
The fuchsias are not going on to the bonfire or flying skywards on the tail
of a rocket. They are not going to moulder in a possibly frost-free shed.
This year, they are going into the grave. Tomorrow, I will be digging a pit
about 3 ft deep. It will be lined with a layer of straw and the plants will
be laid horizontally with an atheist's prayer, asking for fuchsia life
beyond the grave.
There will be no question of turning sods darkly or poking around with
bayonets at dead of night. Burial will be in broad daylight in the
distinctively musical setting of the garden round my old vicarage. Every
Sunday, the believers in the nearby church obligingly sing their hymns so
loudly that I can join in my favourites while continuing to garden and avoid
the prayers. Tomorrow, Lord Roberts will be buried to the sound of pre-Poppy
Day hymns and, meanwhile, a different, pagan image will be living in my
mind.
In early years of Christianity, pagans before me were burying, too - not
fuchsias, but statues of their gods in trenches, laid carefully in the
ground to avoid and avert trouble. Above ground, a Christian might have
smashed them; underground, the images could still be effective, pointing
north to keep off barbarians who might otherwise break in through the Roman
equivalent of the Watford Gap.
In the year 421, Christians found three of them, buried carefully on the
line of a favoured barbarian in-road. They took them out of the ground, huge
statues of the old gods, long-haired and carved in marble. The barbarians
then broke into the area not once but three times - once for each of the
statues.
Forewarned by their experience, I think I will bury my fuchsias pointing
east in the direction of the vicar and on the cat-run of the village pets.
From now until March, they will hibernate in the ground, averting cats and
collecting boxes and saving their strength below the level of the frost.
I discovered this trick in an old fuchsia handbook for growers who do not
have heated greenhouses. The authors endorse it from their own experience;
modern growers still know about it and, if it works, it solves the fuchsia's
biggest nuisance: the need for shelter in winter.
Prepare your plants by drying them off and shaking off their leaves; dig a
pit; lay them horizontally, like pagan treasure on a bed of damp straw, wet
peat or polystyrene; put another layer of straw or bedding on top of them;
and then replace the earth while reciting your favourite line of Homer. The
grave should be at least 2 ft deep and you are advised to mark it with a
stick in case your mind wanders by spring.
Throughout the winter, the plants need no watering; late in March, they are
ready for their resurrection. Open the grave, shake off the straw and pot
them up. Admittedly, you have to find a frost-proof shed or room, but only
until late May. I wish they could return directly to normal life, but they
are still at risk after the resurrection and a frost around Easter could
wipe them out. By late May, they will be covered in new leaves and ready for
even better life in a border or in pots.
'All fuchsias,' the late Arthur Hellyer tells us, 'are of the easiest
cultivation.' To Arthur, no doubt, they were, but he must have taken his
answer to white fly with him. Indoors, especially, these pests are lethal
and a prime cause of failure: outdoors, they have more choice, and I find
they are combated best by giving fuchsias what they most appreciate. They
love to be sprayed, showered and fed heavily at every opportunity.
A dry fuchsia is unhappy; and if yours have been under-performing, the
reason probably is that you do not spray the leaves whenever you can with
one of those fertiliser fixtures from Phostrogen on the hose which I
mentioned last month.
Some of them, I believe firmly, are hardier than we realise, especially if
we heap earth, old ashes or leafy protection over the crown in the next few
days. The best collection of outdoor fuchsias can be seen in the Botanic
Gardens of Leicester University, where they are grown outdoors, often in
full sun, and left to survive the winter with a light top dressing.
Why, then, bother with burials and resurrection? The most exotic and opulent
fuchsias are the least reliably hardy, here or in Leicester. They have to be
protected, but they clutter up a greenhouse or spare bedroom for the next
six months. It is beautifully simple to treat them like an ancient statue
and lay them gently on their side below ground until the spring.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Cookery: Pheasant - just the most for a roast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEATHERS are becoming to women. At the Prince of Wales' wedding Kiri Te
Kanawa enchanted the nation not only with her singing but also with her
appearance. That hat with its frivolous plumage turned her into a bird of
paradise.
Two other images stand out in my mind. First a snapshot my father took of my
mother at the time of their marriage. Standing in the snow, elegant and
dashing in tweed with arching pheasant tail feathers pinned to her hat, she
could have stepped out of Claude Renoir's La Regle du Jeu.
Second, a seductive Cecil Beaton portrait of a model, pale-skinned and high
cheekboned, her face framed by a black feather boa hat.
Among birds it is of course usually the males that boast the finest plumes.
Most handsome of all in Britain at this time of year - and don't they know
it - are the pheasants strutting newly-ploughed fields or hanging the length
of one wall in a butcher's shop like some feathery Persian carpet.
More often recently I have spied those dandies downcast and bedraggled in
the rain, trailing their glorious tail feathers in the mud as they maraud
our vegetable patch in search of their dinner. That is the point at which my
heart hardens. I see it as my cue to think about putting them into the pot.
Feasting on pheasant is, after all, one of the rites of winter and November
is probably the best month to enjoy them.
Many birds today are sadly tame stuff, but those that are wild rather than
semi-farmed, and properly hung, make flavoursome eating and the smell of
roasting pheasant is a seasonal pleasure as atavistic as wood smoke and
roasting chestnuts.
Mushrooms, celery and Brussels sprouts are traditional vegetable choices.
Chicory is less obvious and every bit as pleasing, if not more so.
In the recipe that follows the birds are roasted on a rack over a dish of
buttered chicory so the agreeably bitter leaves are annointed with meat
drippings.
Plenty of plain mashed potatoes are needed to mop up the combined juices. I
like to serve potato chips as well for a crunchy contrast, and this is an
instance where convenience foods get my vote. Kettle chips are the next best
thing to game chips made at home - and they spare the cook the ghastliness
of frying smells.
PHEASANT ON CHICORY (Serves 6)
Four birds are more than are needed to serve six people but a brace can
cause the carver to panic. Besides, I like to have plenty of leftovers: cold
pheasant goes wonderfully well with bubble and squeak next day.
4 pheasants, preferably untrussed so that heat can circulate round them
easily; 4 thin slices of lemon; 4-8 slices of green streaky bacon; 2 1/2 -3
lb chicory;  1/4 lb butter; about 2 teaspoons each sugar and lemon juice;
1-2 tablespoons chopped parsley; a small handful of walnut kernels
(optional).
Slip a hazelnut-size knob of butter into the body cavity of each bird. Add a
grinding of pepper and a slice of lemon. De-rind the bacon, stretch it flat
with the back of a knife and tie it waistcoat fashion round the breasts of
the birds to protect against drying out in cooking.
Quarter the chicons lengthways and lay them in a large thickly buttered
roasting tin. Grind pepper over them and sprinkle with sugar and lemon
juice.
Melt the rest of the butter and drizzle some of it over the chicory.
Straddle the rack from a grill pan (or a cake cooling rack) across the
roasting pan and lay the pheasants on it on one side of their breasts. Brush
the upper parts of the birds with melted butter and roast for 15-20 minutes
at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6, basting at half time.
Turn the birds on to the other side of their breasts. Brush the upper parts
with more melted butter and roast for 15-20 minutes just as before.
Then lift the rack of birds off the roasting tin. Turn the chicory and baste
it well. Replace the rack of birds over the vegetables and sit the pheasants
breast upwards. Brush the last of the melted butter over them and roast for
15 minutes more.
Tilt the birds as you lift them from the rack so that juices from the
cavities pour into the roasting tin. Then let the birds rest while the
chicory continues to cook in the oven, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes more so
the buttery vegetable juices and those from the pheasants mingle and reduce
a little.
Cut the waistcoats from the pheasants and discard them if too frazzled for
your liking. Or cut the bacon into snippets and sprinkle it over the chicory
just before serving. (An alternative savoury finish is walnut pieces, which
can be toasted in the oven alongside the chicory for 5 minutes.) Add a
sprinkling of parsley for colour.
You may wish sometimes, as I do, to serve the breasts of roast pheasant only
with the chicory, saving the legs to eat cold with bubble and squeak. In
this case roasting times can be reduced a little.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Dear Marco, some hints . . . - Marco Pierre
White and his latest move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT HAS got into Marco Pierre White, the UK's most publicity conscious
chef? Successful as chef at Harvey's Wandsworth and partner in The Canteen,
Chelsea Harbour, White suddenly abandons his apparently profitable
independence to open The Restaurant in the Hyde Park Hotel, Knightsbridge,
London.
There, he has joined forces with Forte, the UK's largest hotelier which has
its own wine division, teams of managers, staff training and administrative
back-up and even an effective press office.
White was the youngest chef in Britain, at 27, to win two Michelin stars and
is desperately keen to climb the greasy pole of culinary stardom. Still
thick-skinned enough to be rude to fellow chefs who have tried to eat there,
White knows that in the West End - not far from such established chefs as
Nico Ladenis, Michel Roux, Pierre Koffmann and Simon Hopkinson - the
competition is at its most fierce. It is where he ought to be.
But there is a problem - The Restaurant needs a restaurateur, someone who
can pull together the different strands of the business and attack menu and
wine prices.
The Restaurant's entrance is not at all prepossessing, off a lobby that
leads to the hotel's ballroom. There are 15 widely spaced tables in the
dining room seating no more than 50. There is no view other than on to
Harvey Nichols and a busy staff exit, which I observed as I ate dinner. The
tables are uncluttered and the food served unceremoniously.
The dining room is a custard yellow and on the walls are lack-lustre
still-life paintings. My guest at its good value prix fixe lunch, was a
marketing consultant whose initial comment was that the carpets needed a
clean. He thought the decor was an effort to focus attention on the food. I
think it amateurish.
My lasting impression of the a la carte menu is that it is ambitiously long
 -too much for the kitchen to cope with. At Pounds 60 for three dinner
courses, excluding coffee and service, it is also one of London's most
expensive and rivals the dearest in Paris, Brussels or New York.
This debut menu includes three different soups: vichysoisse of oysters,
caviar chantilly, red mullet with saffron and haricots blancs with
langoustines and truffle.
Starters include a terrine of pork knuckle and foie gras and a excellent
salad of potatoes, lobster and truffle. After that come 14 main courses, six
fish and eight meat, that exude, and often deliver, complexity of flavour.
They include: roast Bresse pigeon leg en croute, braised cabbage, pomme
fondante, ravioli of ceps and a jus of thyme or a fillet of lamb with herbs,
shallots, couscous with black olives and a tian of aubergine.
I ordered a tranche of turbot with girolles mushrooms and a Sauternes sauce.
Those three ingredients were excellent but spoilt by an unannounced pile of
fresh noodles. Desserts are catholic in taste and range - a souffle of
prunes and armagnac, a delicious lemon tart and a memorably rich creme
vanille with poached fruits. The dessert menu is only spoilt by a line at
the bottom that an extra cheese course will cost a further Pounds 10.
I have seen the cheeses served and they are not ungenerous. But this line,
together with my dealings with The Restaurant's waiting staff and wine list,
made me think that nobody has been responsible for converting The
Restaurant's parts into a working model.
The waiting staff are over deferential, the maitre d' adept at taking orders
without a pad and the wine waiter surly. Delays occur - four Americans
waited two hours for their main course - but all the managers wanted to do
was smile and wave their hands. An unauthorised foray into the kitchen for
four small bowls of soup would have swept away any anxiety.
More radical surgery is needed on the wine list. It has been created by
Anthony Byrne Fine Wines, an estimable firm, but no attempt seems to have
been made to integrate the wines with the food. (White does not drink so
this is definitely a task for a strong and discerning manager). The emphasis
is on the more obvious, expensive, wine areas of France.
The wine pricing is outrageous. For a celebration dinner we drank a bottle
of Henschke's Hill of Grace Cabernet Sauvignon 1989 from Australia that cost
Pounds 50 excluding service. From the importers, Lay &amp; Wheeler, of
Colchester, Essex, it costs Pounds 18 but, more gallingly, just across the
busy street in the Fifth Floor Restaurant of Harvey Nichols, the same wine
costs Pounds 30.
The Restaurant will succeed and deliver its promise because of White's
talent, driving ambition and gradual maturity and Forte's resources. But it
will take time to reduce some exorbitant pricing and an astute, perceptive
and assertive manager to make the whole more than the sum of its parts.
The Restaurant, Hyde Park Hotel, 66 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7LA. Tel:
071-259-5380. Lunch Pounds 22.50, dinner Pounds 60 excluding coffee, wine
and service. Open Mon-Fri lunch, Mon-Sat dinner.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The '83 clarets - excellent drinking / Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BORDEAUX 1983 claret vintage followed a torrid summer that caused severe
rot, but was saved by a fine, completely dry harvest in September: not much
less than the then record 3.5m hectolitres in 1982.
But after that year's great success there was comparatively little demand
for the similarly priced '83s, which since have always been overshadowed by
their predecessor. En primeur buyers who expected to make a profit have been
sadly disappointed. The duty-paid, delivered first-growth prices ranged from
about Pounds 360 to Pounds 415 a dozen, but can now be bought at auction for
Pounds 300 plus 10 per cent buyer's premium, although Cheval-Blanc and
Mouton-Rothschild are around Pounds 375, and Ch Margaux that has a special
reputation sells for more than Pounds 400. Petrus of course, was hors
concours.
However, that does not reflect the quality of the wines, which, lighter than
the '82s, are much more developed and mostly make excellent drinking today:
no small recommendation for fine-vintage claret. This was demonstrated in
the annual tasting dinner of the ten-year-old first growths, attended by six
people, including two Masters of Wine.
The bottles were opened at least one hour in advance, and the right-bank
wines about two hours. The usual sequence was followed, from Haut-Brion to
Petrus. But, as often, there was a problem over the Haut-Brion for, at
10-years-old, it frequently has not developed its potential, and seems a
little severe compared with the more ample Medocs. Yet, when a few years ago
the same group tasted the 1945s and the 1961s, Haut-Brion was narrowly
second to Lafite on both occasions.
Here, then, are my notes, made at the table, followed by representative
comments from the other five. As the colours were all full, with Margaux and
Petrus exceptionally deep, but Ausone less so, comments on these have been
omitted.
Haut-Brion. Closed Grave nose, good fruit, flavour not yet complete, but
perhaps near best - nose sweet, soft, nice weight of flavour, touch of
iodine; clear, crisp nose, less intense than in some vintages, delicious
now, not sure about future; good tannin, good length, very enjoyable
tonight; lovely sweet nose, delicious but lacks backbone; soft and gentle.
Margaux. Fragrant, rich nose, full taste, plenty behind it, but will still
develop - crisp, fruity nose, lovely scent, flavour tannic, full-bodied,
good length; glorious aroma, supple yet powerful flavour, masses of fruit,
almost youthful; lots of tannin in mouth, but luscious fruit; wonderful
nose, unyielding palate, drink end of century; somewhat undistinguished
taste now.
Lafite. Distinguished Medoc nose, elegant, typical taste, at best but will
continue - bricky, harmonious nose, good fruit, excellent weight, with
length, tannic; dryer on nose than Margaux, like most could be drunk
already, satiny finish scented; plenty of fruit, good dry finish, delicious
wine; less intense than Margaux but elegant nose, dry on palate, but good
finish, delicious wine; attractive, drinkable.
Mouton-Rothschild. Nose not very developed, but velvety flavour, very
drinkable, but lacks concentration - dusty nose at first but spicy, but good
fruit, fragrant finish; good colour, slightly odd nose, reminiscent of soy
sauce, acidity pronounced, but very long, perfume grew in glass; lots of
fruit on palate, but less intense than Lafite, falls away in mouth; clarety
nose, not very open, nice sweet palate, easy drinking; rich, sweet
attractive.
Latour. Closed but rich nose, big wine, the most tannic of all, but will
develop, and the one with the most potential - classic nose, slightly
chocolaty sweet, good texture; lovely fruit; the most powerful of the lot,
sweet, full and rich, flatteringly fruity for Latour, very long; sweet and
powerful on the nose, huge, tannin and extract on palate, but drinkable and
a pleasure to drink; blackcurrants, big tannin with dried-fruits flavour;
very young nose and taste, fruity and rich.
Ausone. Sweet and rich, agreeable but not very distinguished - autumn leaves
nose, nice, open-knit texture; more acidity needed, attractive but slightly
sludgy; sweet on nose and tasted rather glyceriney; nose almost gamey,
tasting like a cough mixture; very sweet, not much body.
Cheval-Blanc. Rich, fruity engaging nose, sweet, round and fruity, but lacks
finish - good but restrained nose, sweet, good texture and length; rather
simple though, well-balanced, thick, velvety, somewhat 82-like in build,
with acidity that Ausone lacked, but less depth than Cheval-Blanc usually
has at this stage; charming nose, deep Merlot fruit, silky taste, very
well-balanced deep warm, round flavour, good but hard finish, tastes brought
together in synthesis, but perhaps a little dull.
Petrus. Very rich, but unconcentrated nose. Pomerol-style taste and fruity
but lacks intensity - Bricky, cheesy nose, full flavour but lean for Petrus,
very tannic; Earl-Grey tea flavour, but quite unresolved, slightly
locked-in; not porty but most beguiling, quite floral nose, very firm and
generous in the mouth, lovely length; closed nose, medicinal flavour;
interesting but fades on the palate, slight weakness at centre.
After all glasses had been refreshed, the order of preference was taken:
from one to eight, with the lowest number top. Although all agreed that
there was no bad wine among them, the difference in ratings were more marked
that usual.
One taster marked three wines equal first, and Petrus particularly
disappointed two tasters. This is how they finished: 1 Latour, 2
Mouton-Rothschild, 3 Margaux and Cheval-Blanc equal, 5 Lafite, 6 Haut-Brion,
7 Petrus, 8 Ausone. My own number one was Margaux, followed by Latour.
Ten-year-old wines may vary from bottle to bottle, and only one bottle of
each wine was opened.

FT  06 NOV 93 / 'Have you stopped beating your wives?': Michael
Thompson-Noel considers the long and distinguished history of the media
interview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU WOULD think that interviewing people for magazines and newspapers was
one of the easiest forms of journalism - money for old rope, undisguised
vampirism. Take the subject out to lunch; order cocktails and fine wines;
push the tape recorder button; use flattery and cunning in approximately
equal measure - and suck the victim dry.
There is, after all, a trade-off involved. An interview is usually a two-way
seduction.
The interviewer wants good tape: yards of serviceable quotes which display,
in passing, his skills as a questioner and background knowledge. Or her
skills, more likely, for modern-day stars of the killer interview - 'jugular
journalism' - are predominantly female.
The interviewee, in turn, is talking for publication. He can speak sincerely
and to the point, or seek a refuge in blandness, or conceal his real views
with lies.
What I hadn't realised was that the media interview has such a long and
distinguished history; or that its serviceability is so well-recognised that
it occupies a niche in the theory of communication.
W. T. Stead, who was responsible for popularising the interview formula in
Britain in the 1880s (he was editor of The Pall Mall Gazette), described
interviews as 'an immense engine of democratic enlightenment.' He was
echoed, 90 years later, by Denis Brian, in Murderers and Other Friendly
People: 'These days, more than at any time, our most vivid impressions of
our contemporaries are through interviews. Almost everything of moment
reaches us through one man asking questions of another. Because of this, the
interviewer holds a position of unprecedented power and influence.'
In the accepted sense, the first fully-fledged newspaper interview with a
celebrity was Horace Greeley's with Brigham Young in Salt Lake City in 1859.
Greeley was editor of the New York Tribune, Brigham Young the leader of the
Mormon Church. The interview was published throughout the world and
contained, interestingly, several lies on the part of the Mormon leader. He
gave a falsely low figure for his number of wives (he admitted to 15; in
fact there were 17) and under-stated his personal wealth. Young also denied
the existence of the Danites, his secret order of destroying angels.
The New York editor reported that Young was 'a portly, frank, good-natured,
rather thick-set man of 55, seeming to enjoy life, and be in no particular
hurry to get to heaven.' Much of the interview was couched in the Q and A
format still familiar today:
HG: 'Can you give me any rational explanation of the aversion and hatred
with which your people are generally regarded by those among whom they have
lived and with whom they have been in contact?'
BY: 'No other explanation than is afforded by the crucifixion of Christ and
the kindred treatment of God's ministers, prophets and saints in all ages.'
The Greely-Young exchange rings up the curtain on The Penguin Book of
Interviews, published this week and edited by Christopher Silvester.
Distrust of interviews and interviewers has been a constant theme since the
beginning, says Silvester. Kipling told two reporters that being interviewed
was 'just as much of a crime as . . . an assault . . . cowardly and vile.'
(Kipling himself had interviewed Mark Twain a few years previously).
But soon journalism was showered with them. From Silvester's anthology we
learn of Karl Marx's belief that 'as soon as (the English middle class)
finds itself out-voted on what it considers vital questions we shall see
here a new slave owners' war';
that Thomas Edison worked a 20-hour day and kept, at home, a supply of
35-cent cigars encased in expensive wrappers to fool alleged connoisseurs.
'You should hear them praise them';
that Emile Zola never mapped out a plot. 'I cannot do it. I have frequently
meditated for hours, buried my head in my hands, closed my eyes, and got ill
over it. But no use';
that Sir Edwin Lutyens had a childish sense of humour. 'There was once a
Scotsman who met a man in a fog, and said: 'Have you seen Macphierson?' 'I'm
not sure,' replied the other. 'I've seen one man but he was either a very
wee man wi' a beard or a very tall man wi' a sporran';
that Al Capone could talk the birds off the telephone wires. 'Graft is a
byword in American life today. It is law where no other law is obeyed . . .
Virtue, honour, truth and the law have all vanished from our life. We are
smart-Alecky';
that Benito Mussolini often read Byron;
that Adolf Hitler was two joints short of a rave;
that Joseph Stalin was as slippery as an eel in a tub of yoghurt;
that Brendan Behan was fabulously witty. 'I shake hands with no member of
the upper class except the Guinness family. They've done a lot for me';
that Frank Lloyd Wright was a mesmerising talker. 'Most . . . educated taste
today is an acquired taste. It has nothing whatever to do with certain
senses or the beneficial character of the thing tasted; it's only whether
you like it or not. And who are you? You are only an artificial thing whose
taste may be atrocious. So when we have a taste-built culture we have a
haphazard jamboree of all kinds of things';
that Ernest Hemingway so hated sharks that he went after them with rifles,
Tommy-guns, shot-guns and air-guns. 'With the .22 it's a brain shot. You
have to know the spot and hit them just right when they surface';
that Marilyn Monroe could be whimsically poetic. 'I have a reputation for
always being late. Well, I don't think I'm late all the time. People just
remember the times I come too late. Besides, I don't really think I can go
as fast as other people. . . I don't think mankind was intended to be like
machines';
and that Mae West was a monotonous old body. 'I wish I could've shown you my
beach house. But I sold it. I miss it. I had murals of naked men on the
walls. Great art. Nudity in art isn't sex, it's art.'
The business of interviewing - its theory and technique, etiquette and
ethics - has been analysed and atomised many times. One early critic accused
British interviewers of 'dressing out their interviews with dramatic or
melodramatic, minutely accurate or judiciously imagined details.'
For more than a century interviewees have been complaining that they have
been misrepresented, if not misquoted: that the published version of the
interview gave a markedly different impression to the one they recall.
Even without malice, misrepresentation is easily achieved. On the other
hand, Murray Fisher, who used to supervise the Playboy interviews, has said
that the magazine's technique was ' . . . to sift and refine the raw
verbiage of a tape transcript into a linear, continuous conversation. . .
This meant there was always a process of distillation and condensation, of
reshuffling and rearranging, but with sufficient faithfulness to the
original that the material had the verisimilitude of . . . spoken
conversation . . . Many of the interviewees have volunteered publicly that
the published interviews reported exactly what they said - even though no
interview has been published verbatim.'
Anyway, there can be bonuses in misquotation. I like what George Sylvester
Viereck, an American, told George Clemenceau, the French statesman, when he
interviewed him in 1928. It was Clemenceau's favourite trick to embarrass
his interviewers. He made startling statements, which he subsequently
repudiated. Early in the interview an impish Clemenceau referred to the
perils of misquotation.
Viereck fired back: 'To be misquoted is the destiny of great men. They are
always misquoted. That's no misfortune. Some of the best things attributed
to great men were probably never said at all - at least, not by them. The
world's imagination invents the appropriate word if the hero's own
imagination fails him.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / A grave issue to tackle: Minister for a Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCINDA LAMBTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Heritage Minister for the day I would slice sabres through the stifling
bureaucracy that has laid cultural architectural and artistic waste to
almost all churchyards and cemeteries throughout the British Isles.
Whereas in the past these plots of land were paradise - Elysian fields of
monumental sculpture and design, that reflected the tastes, dreams and
ideals of the age - today they are being swept squeaky clean of all their
spirit.
In the 1950s the church laid down rules and regulations as to the dimensions
and design of memorials. This was done with the best of intentions - to stem
the ever encroaching tide of plastic and green chippings - but it has led to
grimly uniform results, with blightingly bland blocks lying roughshod over
the remains of Britons.
Whereas architecture has forged forward with evermore innovative forms, this
miniature branch of structural design has stomped on, seemingly regardless
of its vital role to reflect the very culture of the country. Walking
through a new graveyard or cemetery is like walking through the most
horrifying of 1960s developments, with one gloomy difference: that it is
still being built, holy hand over fervent fist today. Democracy in life has
become a dictatorship in death, with even the most aesthetically minded of
us forced to end our days beneath blocks of Ceausescu-like regimentation.
At long last though there are rays of hope on this bleak horizon; with a new
generation of stonecarvers, artists and letter cutters, who are primed to
restore dignity, artistry and individuality to the tombstone. After barren
years, with Eric Gill and his disciples flying lone flags of excellence,
craftsmanship is returning again to the churchyard.
Arm yourself with this stirring knowledge, however, and you are in trouble.
Decide to order a plain block and it will go ahead like clockwork; decide to
commission a memorial of lasting beauty and you will be battling through the
brambles of church democracy. Crosses are often no longer allowed, nor are
statues and other images such as books and hearts. A gravestone, say church
authorities, should be: 'No more than 4 ft high . . . no less than 2 ft 6 in
high (you dream of Sir Richard Burton's life-size Islamic stone tent in St
Mary's churchyard at Mortlake); 'No more than 3 ft wide . . . no less than 1
ft 8in wide' (how you yearn for the great crawl-underable castellated
railway tunnel at Otley in Yorkshire, commemorating the 18 men killed while
building it); 'No more than 6in thick . . . no less than 3in thick'; (you
long for Nancy Mitford's substantial stone at Swinbrook, in Oxfordshire, or
for the life-size armchair, at Kensal Green, commemorating Henry Russell,
composer of My Old Armchair.)
Most stifling of all, are the rules governing inscriptions; with the Diocese
of Birmingham chillingly declaring that they 'be neither presumptious nor
laudatory'. All Diocesan advisory committees decree that wording on the
tombstone should be 'simple, short and appropriate' (How one craves the
stone of railway engineer, Joseph Rutherford, killed by a boiler explosion
at Bromsgrove, Worcs, in 1840: Under a steaming engine are 18 lines of
evocative verse: 'My Engine now is cold and still/No water does my boiler
fill/My coke affords its flames no more/my days of usefulness are o'er'.
Every square inch of this stone reveals the individual that it commemorates,
bringing him stirringly to life for each succeeding generation . . .
A churchyard was, and should still be, a chronicler of the community, a
celebration of its very diversity, with hearty huzzahs to the individual.
John Buchan lies beneath a circular stone, emblazoned with a Greek Cross, in
Elsfield's tiny churchyard outside Oxford. Sir Benjamin Baker, who designed
The Forth Bridge, lies beneath a giant amalgam of arches, in a Cotswold
churchyard.
The Dioceses of Chelmsford and of Oxford are beginning to realise that such
individuality should and could, be celebrated again. The Churchyards
Handbook too, calling the churchyard a work of art, has the encouraging
words that: 'Applications for specially designed and appropriate memorials
will be sympathetically considered'.
On the crest of this promising wave, there is one Liberty-like figure, who
with beacon aloft, shines freedom into the churchyard: Harriet Frazer.
With her organisation Memorials by Artists, at Snape Priory, Saxmundham,
Suffolk, Frazer has established a nationwide service to put people in touch
with designers, carvers and letterers who will make individual memorials of
beauty.
Her success has been spectacular. The tide of taste has unquestionably
turned. Diocesan committees should take stock of the situation.
An issue of grave and fundamental importance is in their hands; one that
affects us all. As Heritage Minister I would wrench off the bland blanket
that is ordained to lie over our remains.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Fashion: Coats - the winter wrap-up / Picking up a wardrobe
staple need not be a chore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPPING for a winter coat is unlike any other fashion experience. It rarely
involves the passion which the discovery of an exquisitely-cut suit or a
knock-'em-dead evening dress can excite. Searching for something
serviceable, long-lasting and neutral enough to go with everything is more
of a chore than a pleasure.
The winter coat is the Space Wagon of fashion rather than the sports coupe.
It can look like that too - shapeless, large and rather dull. Most of us
search for this worthy, essential but rather unexciting garment in fashion
chains or department stores. It may, sadly, be the only thing we go to
department stores for, now every high street is full of specialists in every
fashion area.
But something is afoot with both stores and coats. Since ex-Habitat boss Sir
Terence Conran and George Davies of Next et al brought 'design' to the high
street in the early 1980s, standards have risen. But the result has been a
certain homogeneity - if you woke up in a chainstore bereft of labels and
'house style' you would be hard put to know which one it was. And department
stores, selling a little of everything, have had an even bigger identity
crisis.
This year, however, several big names have aimed for greater individuality.
This may mean giving designer clothes a higher profile, or targeting a
specific audience more closely, or developing a stronger fashion image.
Whichever method is chosen, and whatever the results, the customer benefits.
As far as the great winter coat hunt is concerned, all this means sharper
styles and keen prices. The flamboyant long coat is back with bravura, and
the favourites are the velvet-trimmed dandy style, the 1970s throwback
military greatcoat and the fur-trimmed Russian coat. Any could be a
one-season wonder so you are best off searching the budget rails. Spend real
money instead on an all-enveloping, soft edge-to-edge or wrap style which in
camel, black or luxurious blonde will last for years.
For men there is a similar divide; long coats, sometimes belted, in forest
green or rust are here and now, but navy, grey and camel are still
investments.
As for the new corporate images to go with the new coats, Jim Maxmin, Laura
Ashley's American chief executive, says of his company, although he could
have been talking of many others: 'In the late 1980s we lost sight of our
roots, of what made us special. We are now restoring that very individual
charm'.
This means interpreting trends within a very traditional British image - and
ignoring them if they do not fit in. About 10 per cent of the collection is
adventurous enough to lure new customers - including sophisticated long
coats designed by students of London's Royal College of Art - while the rest
is planned to please their established market while still keeping abreast of
1990s fashion.
Take Principles, the middle-of-the-road chainstore which was looking
increasingly middle-aged. Perhaps realising that too many of its businesses
were competing against each other, the Burton Group, of which Principles is
a part, has this autumn 'repositioned' it towards a far tighter market
segment, defined as 'ABC1s, women in their 30s and men from 25 to 35.'
Whatever the marketing reasoning, the result is cleaner, more contemporary
but not over-adventurous clothes. The attention is on quality rather than
fussy detail, and prices are keen. This sensible formula should appeal to
customer, whether single women of 29 or married men of 40.
A not dissimilar, if less dramatic, change has taken place at Jaeger. When
chief executive Fiona Harrison arrived three years ago she found Jaeger's
image stuck in a dowdy 1980s groove. She took on Jeanette Todd, the Burton
Group's experienced design director, 18 months ago and the results have been
swift. Jaeger is now the holder of the British Fashion Award for Classic
Design which, says Todd, 'would have been unthinkable a year ago.'
The 'bitty' image of department stores makes refinding an identity harder.
In advance of its flotation as a public company, House of Fraser has made a
huge effort in fashion, on both style and price. More high-profile designers
are balanced by much sharper buying of inexpensive special purchases,
including the season's top coat styles and the fashion-forward Hot Shop
section which is shared with Harrods.
Debenhams is targeting a younger, design- and cost-conscious market,
persuading designers such as voguish milliner Philip Treacy to produce
exclusive styles with accessible price-tags. Even their most luxurious coats
are reasonable.
Intriguingly, Liberty is going in the opposite direction on price. In the
past its fashion image has been less strong than that of areas such as
interior design, something the store is now rectifying with a vengeance.
Following its Arts and Crafts tradition are quirky British designers like
Vivienne Westwood, Sophia Malig and Xavier Foley and individualist
foreigners such as Issey Miyake and Koji Tatsuno. The fashion floor is now a
sea of modish black, a far cry from chintzy Liberty prints. Coat prices are
correspondingly higher but the quality of styles, like Feminella's
capacious, perfectly plain wool and cashmere edge-to-edge coat justifies
this.
Finally, a word of warning. The long coat rarely really is, especially if
you are tall. The big store groups which call the shots with British
manufacturers maintain that their average customer is 5ft 4in and is highly
put off if she trips over the hem. Tall women must still resort to dearer,
designer coats. Until this changes, coats will not inspire the excitement of
true high fashion.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Fashion: Hard sell for sweet smells - Lucia van der Post
finds a fragrant area of successful market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no longer any excuse for not smelling sweet. In the flower-growing
centres of provincial France, in streamlined Connecticut laboratories, in
domestic kitchens up and down the UK magic potions are being mixed and
measured, lotions stirred, essential oils refined. From The Body Shop, with
a branch on almost every high street, to esoteric and exclusive little
operations known only to the cognoscenti, sweet smells are selling as never
before.
It is not hard to see why. Sweet-scented candles, oil-burning rings and
bowls of pot-pourri lend a house a particularly magic air while nothing so
engenders a sense of luxuriousness as body and bath lotions, essential oils
and unguents. It is their very inessentialness that is their most beguiling
quality.
For those who like the imprimata of a grand and charismatic name they don't
come much more charismatic than Giorgio Armani. At all the Emporio Armani
shops there is currently a pot-pourri of sweet-smelling products with a
distinct trend towards the natural herbs and spices.
From Australia come natural vegetable soaps in pure white, tea-tree salmon,
avocado, apple, milk and honey, wheat-germ yellow, lavender and rose-pink.
Bath products are scented with marigold and sage or thyme and mallow and
come packaged in beautifully simple natural wood boxes, cork boxes and ashed
wood shells. As for the candles, these come smelling of cinnamon (a
wonderful winter smell) and of the new Armani's 'Fire' and 'Earth'
fragrances. A happy morning or three could easily be spent sniffing your way
among the range though to avoid fragrance pollution I would try and stick to
one or other of the ranges.
Those who do not like to pay fancy prices and in any event are
temperamentally more inclined towards the simple bottle, the natural
products and the essential oils, then Neal's Yard offers a whole wealth of
options. Those who fancy a little experimentation can order their simple
creams and lotions and by following the instructions in the mail order
catalogue can mix their own face creams, bath lotions, body creams and even
their own sports and muscle rub or sun protection cream. A wonderful
catalogue with lots of inspiration for those who think body lotions and gels
are, on the whole, over-priced.
For the catalogue write to Neal's Yard Remedies, 5 Golden Cross, Cornmarket
Street, Oxford OX1 3EU. (Tel: 0865-245436). Neal's Yard has also just opened
a new shop at 9 Elgin Crescent, London W11.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Fashion: Name games - it's no go for logos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGO-ITIS, the defacing epidemic that ran amok during the 1980s, has not
been cured. I went to Harrods' sportswear department in London the other day
to buy a plain, navy-blue track-suit. These fall into two categories:
clinging, micro-fibre suits for the brave and baggy, cotton fleece 'sweats'
for the modest.
The sales assistants, scanning their impressive domain filled with
multi-coloured two-pieces, would have you believe that you are spoilt for
choice. You are not. All I wanted was a plain track-suit without a logo; no
'go faster' stripes or tributes to an Olympic medallist - and certainly no
free marketing for the brand. I discovered there was not a single plain
track-suit in stock.
Bearing in mind that a sandwich board man marching up and down Oxford Street
is paid, on average, Pounds 50 a day for his advertising efforts, I see no
reason why Nike, Adidas, Fred Perry or any other brand, should deface my
track-suit with its logo and expect me to pay for its advertising as well.
I put this to the sales manager. Did he not have, amid the plethora of
options, a single plain suit? No, he apologised. And why not? I persisted.
Does Harrods not come across customers who refuse to be used as an
advertising hoarding?
Certainly, he admitted. Many. So, what was the problem? Simply, that no
big-brand sportswear manufacturer was prepared to sell track-suits without
distinguishing logos. 'They're very difficult to get. The manufacturers
don't like making them,' he explained.
Thankfully, the epidemic of logo-itis that hit high fashion over the past
decade has, largely, been contained. When Dawn Mello took over Gucci in
1988, its cachet was in freefall. Her first, brave move was to rid the
products of the devalued green and red double-G logo. It was not long before
Gucci's reputation as leather-maker to the discerning was restored.
Mello says: 'It no longer makes sense in today's more sophisticated market
to have initials on every product. People just don't want it - or, at least,
not the customer we're trying to attract.'
Similarly, Louis Vuitton - once dubbed the 'Luncheon Voucher brand' because
it became the status symbol among young clerks and secretaries - Dunhill,
Hermes and others are now more discreet about their logos while Tanner
Krolle, the leather craftsman, is so coy about its name that this is
virtually anonymous, making for truly elegant luggage. Managing director
Philip Davis reasons, quite emphatically, that 'our customers respect
discretion.' '
Meanwhile, Chanel, the brashest marketeer of all, is now so over-exposed and
sits so uneasily with the times that it has become a social handicap to hang
any of its pinchbeck geegaws from one's person.
For those who want to do their sit-ups in anonymous cotton fleece, I found -
after much searching - two publicity-shy brands. Hanes, established in 1904
in America, makes three basic styles in three weights, each piece retailing
for under Pounds 10. Its excellent and extensive range can be found at 237
High Street, Acton, west London.
John Liggins, the manager, recalls: 'Twenty years ago, we launched Hanes
tracksuits in Britain, thinking that the timing was right since everyone in
Clint Eastwood's film Magnum Force was wearing them. But we burnt our
fingers and couldn't shift them because no one knew what they were for. Now,
though, we're the biggest manufacturer in the world: we make 1m T-shirts a
day.'
Hanes also makes gear for many sports brands such as Champion and department
stores such as Harrods, which puts its own labels on the products.
Alternatively, there is a new range of clothing by Doctor Martens (of boot
fame) which includes navy-blue or black schoolboy cotton track-suits which
are baggy, fastened with an un-logoed zip, and grip the ankles and wrists
with a band of elastic. The tops retail at Pounds 50 and the bottoms Pounds
40.

to give or receive from copies of Sumerian Court jewellery (Pounds 49.95 for
a Cornelian necklace) and The Royal Game of Ur (Pounds 32.95) to masses of
small statues and sculptures such as an Egyptian cat (Pounds 85). There is a
good selection under Pounds 20 - a blue Egyptian cat at Pounds 11.95, a cat

GTC has always had one of the most attractive Christmas catalogues but
whereas in the past it was primarily seen as a taster for those planning to
visit one of its three shops (at London's Sloane Square, Bath or
Cirencester) this year the company has caught up with white-hot technology:
you can now order 24 hours a day, by phone, fax or post and presents can be
sent anywhere in the world. This year's theme is a Scottish Christmas with
plenty of tartan and old-fashioned nostalgia - reproduction Victorian teddy
bear doorstops, butler's trays (but what about the butler?), hobby horses
and the like.

FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: Pick your presents off the mat - Mail-order
catalogues are a mixed bunch. But choose wisely and you could find your
heart's desire, says Lucia van der Post
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THERE ARE some frightening statistics about catalogues
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
such as that by mid-October, the average American will have been deluged by
68.35 catalogues, the mail-box will have folded up under the struggle and
the accumulated pile on the hall floor will constitute a fire hazard. All
this may also explain why so few novels get read. In the UK we are luckier.
Most (though not all) deluging is our own fault. My solution? When in doubt,
don't send off for the catalogue just in case. Be selective. Decide which is
the one for you, whether it be a charity you choose to support or a
commercial catalogue which is mostly likely to satisfy the desires of your
nearest and dearest. Here, then, is a taster of some of the best catalogues
around. If you send for them now you still have time to have a stress-free
Christmas present-buying time.

on offer. Photographed left is some exceptionally pretty yellow and green
French Provencal oven-to-tableware - the dishes each come with appropriate
woven baskets. Prices range from Pounds 36 for a medium-sized jug to Pounds
85 for the largest dish. There's a soft lambswool rug (Pounds 52), a gadget

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Min &amp; Dell, 16 The Pines, Broad Street, Guildford, Surrey. Tel: 0483-38468.
Pounds 2.50 for the catalogue, redeemable against first purchase.
Min &amp; Dell is a one-off. No central agency has been behind the buying
policy. You will not find in it products that you have seen anywhere else.
Founded by Anna Nicholas, who named it after her two elderly maiden aunts,
Minny &amp; Delly, its main aim is to find a market for crafts hand-made by
elderly people.
It was founded on the premise that older people were often a repository of
traditional crafts and skills which would give pleasure to many others.
Already she has about 100 craftsmen working for her. One used to make all
the models for the Science Museum and almost all of them have been given a
new lease of life.
As yet the catalogue is quite small, covering fine knitting, basketry,
needlecraft and textiles, jewellery &amp; metalwork, wooden crafts and toys.
Photographed here is one from a set of five of wooden dinosaurs (Pounds
34.50) all of which are packed into a strong cotton drill bag. Besides other
wooden animals there is a bag of six, happy, hand-knitted bears (Pounds 25)
which would enchant almost any child.
The children's knitwear is very attractive - lovely chunky Aran sweaters
(Pounds 55) as well as Fair Isle woollen jumpers (between Pounds 55 and
Pounds 65). The cobweb shawls would make a fine present for a new baby and
there are some very attractive hand-painted cuff-links.

The V &amp; A Treasury Catalogue, Freepost 361, Dep 5316, Hendon Road,
Sunderland SR 9AD. Tel: 091-514 2999. Catalogue free.
Here we have another catalogue for those who love the old, the traditional,
the nostalgic. Almost everything has been inspired by designs in the
Museum's collection so it tends to verge on the pretty and the feminine with
little to offer the modern-minded man. However, if this sort of thing is
your cup of tea, there is masses to choose from. There is a wide range of
jewellery - from some dramatic Elizabethan brooches (a couple of toros in
decorative Elizabethan dress with pearls for faces, Pounds 75), rope-edged
pearl earrings (Pounds 29.95), Victorian thimble brooch (Pounds 35) and
charm bracelet (Pounds 65) to a fresh water pearl and mineral necklace
(Pounds 99). There is a Victorian sampler to sew (Pounds 39.95) and a plain
wooden solitaire board with deep-blue marbles (Pounds 19.95). Photographed
above is a pure silk cushion cover with a screenprinted design of a Thai
elephant (Pounds 39.95) including the cushion pad. Look out, too, for an
enchanting selection of old-fashioned children's toys - teddy bears, sets of
traditional games, acrobat sticks and giant floor puzzles.

David Gill's gallery at 60 Fulham Road, London SW3 is well worth visiting at
almost any time for he has always been adept at identifying new talent,
giving it a platform - and a market. He (as well as many collectors and
museums world-wide) is a great admirer of the work of Peter Chang, a
one-time furniture designer turned sculptor who applies his sculptural
techniques to functional objects, like the fantastical salt and pepper pots
above (Pounds 2,850 each). Do not be put off by the price for there is a
great deal of truly interesting work available at much lower cost -
jewellery from Pounds 100, paperweights by Galouste &amp; Bonetti at Pounds 57,
candelabra for Pounds 200.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A taxing question - David Carter
asks which packages will keep the Revenue happy / Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A READER writes: 'My wife has three small businesses (a sole trader, a
partnership, and a limited company) all requiring book-keeping and annual
accounts. I have taken early retirement and would like to do most of the
work myself.
'What programme should I use? I have narrowed down the search to TAS Books
or Quicken for DOS. I understand that Quicken does not do 'proper' accounts
but I hope it will provide all the necessary information, correctly broken
down, for me to complete the quarterly VAT return and for our accountant to
produce year-end accounts.'
The last few months have seen a sharp rise in the sales of packages such as
Microsoft's Money and Quicken from Intuit. They are cheaply priced at around
Pounds 50 or Pounds 60 and are sold as 'personal finance managers', which
are also capable of managing the accounts of a small business.
Should small business users try Quicken or stick to a traditional accounts
package such as TAS Books?
The first point to clarify is how a 'personal finance manager' differs from
a 'traditional accounts package'. Most business transactions are conducted
on credit. So, on November 20, 1993 I might issue a sales invoice to a
customer for Pounds 1,000 plus Pounds 175 VAT. Finally, on February 2, 1994
the customer sends me a cheque for Pounds 1,175 in payment. In accounting
terms, therefore, each sale has two elements: when it is invoiced to the
customer, and when it is paid.
A traditional (or 'accrual-based') accounts package such as TAS Books will
record both elements of the sale. A 'Cashbook' accounting package such as
Quicken records only the second element - the February payment.
With a traditional package you would credit your sales and VAT accounts when
you entered the invoice - in November 1993. With a cashbook accounting
system you would credit sales and VAT at time of payment - in February 1994.
With the one method the sales go into your 1993 accounts, with the other
into 1994's. So, if your year-end is December 31, 1993, could you switch to
running your accounts on Quicken and defer paying tax on the Pounds 1,000
for 12 months? Unfortunately, no. As far as the Inland Revenue is concerned
your income is earned, and therefore taxable, when you invoice it, not when
it is paid.
Another tax authority is involved, Customs and Excise. Again, as far as it
is concerned, you become liable for VAT at the end of the quarter in which
the invoice is raised (hence the term 'tax-point date' on many invoices).
However the Excise offers a concession: if your turnover is less than Pounds
350,000 per annum, you can apply to account for VAT under the VAT cash
accounting scheme. This allows you to pay your VAT to the Excise when your
customer pays you, not when you raise the invoice. If you produce cash-based
VAT returns on Quicken in the normal way you must apply to the Excise for
permission.
So, if your sales invoices are substantially greater in value than your
purchase invoices, you should choose VAT cash accounting. If you have a
retail 'cash' business such as a shop, the cash accounting scheme would be
harmful. You would continue to pay your VAT on sales straight away, but
instead of being able to claim back the VAT on your purchase invoices as
soon as they arrived, you would have to wait until you paid them.
Whatever your final arrangement with the VAT authorities, there still
remains the Revenue, which will flatly refuse to accept that you made the
sale in February 1994.
With the exceptions of the bar, which can always use cash accounting and
members of other traditional professions who can adopt it after the first
three years, 'accrual-based' accounting is the only form acceptable to the
Revenue.
So, I am wary of 'cashbook' packages, and for a further reason. With a
traditional package the invoice goes on to the computer straight away and
you are right up-to-date on how much your customers owe you and how much you
owe your suppliers.
Users with bank overdrafts, for example, often want an accounting programme
to give them 'aged debtors' and 'aged creditors' reports. These are concise
summaries of all sales and purchase invoices outstanding for payment. With
the computer producing these, they have, for the first time, real control
over their bank account. With a conventional cashbook accounting system you
do not get this control because the invoice is not recorded until after it
has been paid.
Quicken can handle accrual accounting by using an asset account in which you
enter invoices as you issue them; if this is done it can record Vat in a
special account suitable for the tax authorities and generate an aged
debtors report, which it calls 'accounts receivable'. The VAT-paying
business user does not have the option of using Quicken the easy way and
must use this extra feature, described in the 'advanced business uses'
section of the manual. Tass, by contrast, allows you to use the traditional
system on which tax collection is based.
For this reason, TAS Books, at Pounds 99, would be my first choice of
accounts package for the business that has to account for VAT. In running
your personal finances, where simpler cash book accounting is a acceptable,
Quicken is ideal. However, for a VAT-paying business which must use its
advanced features, Quicken becomes more complicated than Tass Books.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Survivor of the squalls - Coat
maker who learnt to cut his cloth carefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUZANNE ASKHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN William Macdonald started his own coat-making business in 1985, he was
in the worst possible position. His old family company, making sheepskin
coats, had spectacularly failed (from a UK turnover of Pounds 35m). For four
years William had been running it under receivership for the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
'It was soul-destroying,' he says. 'But I knew that I still wanted to run my
own small business. I would never be happy working for anyone else.'
So William and his wife Malla founded Cocoon. The plan was to take the best
from the old company's philosophy and interweave it with modern market
requirements. The formula has worked. Today, the company makes lightweight
raincoats from their home base in Dumbartonshire, and sells them by mail
order and through their two shops in Edinburgh and London.
From the start, the Macdonalds devised some distinctive selling points.
'Every coat is effectively made to order. Customers specify arm and back
length, and colour,' explains William. 'We will also do repairs.'
Prices are calculated by adding the cost of raw materials and overheads,
then multiplying by a factor of three. The finished coats retail at an
average of Pounds 3,200.
The Macdonalds began with a seed capital of Pounds 310,000, derived from
savings, plus Pounds 37,000 in government grants.
To cover potential cashflow problems, William also negotiated a Pounds
310,000 overdraft facility with his local bank - this was possible because
the manager, who knew him, was confident he would succeed.
'Ironically, my biggest problem at the outset was my own lack of
confidence,' says William. 'Seeing a family business go under makes you
doubt your judgment and abilities.'
William designed a small range of garments, while he and Malla cut them out
and constructed them on the dining room table. They sold by mail order and
advertised in broadsheets and country magazines. In the first year their
turnover was an acceptable Pounds 340,000.
It went on to grow by 30 per cent every year. By 1987, the Macdonalds were
employing four assistants. To expand further, they needed commercial
premises. First, William successfully arranged for the overdraft facility to
be increased to Pounds 320,000.
Then they found suitable workshop space. 'We bought a 20-year lease for
which we pay Pounds 35,000 per annum. For that, we get 2,400 square feet.'
William took on a more active selling role - 'selling comes before
everything else' - while Malla supervised the workshops. One of their most
profitable showcases has turned out to be the country shows, particularly
the big ones: The Royal Show at Stoneleigh, the Badminton and Burley Horse
Trials.
'We spend Pounds 320,000 a year on stand fees, but it's worth it, as it
generates sales of 10 times that amount.' Initially, the Macdonalds found it
hard to get space in the most prestigious shows, but solved that problem by
going through the Rural Crafts Association in Godalming.
Another headache was solved in the past year. 'It's always been difficult to
find good suppliers who will extend credit and dye fabrics in small enough
quantities, ' says William, who has been forced to go abroad for most of his
raw materials. But Cocoon's ongoing growth has recently made suppliers more
inclined to take it seriously.
In 1989, the Macdonalds experienced their biggest disaster. 'We had hired an
agent in New York, who was handling almost half our turnover at the peak,'
explains William. 'Unfortunately, the pound rose, our profits were wiped out
and we could get no new orders.'
Remembering a hard lesson learnt with the previous family firm, William
immediately cut his losses. Cocoon's turnover that year stood still, at
Pounds 3150,000.
Since then the company has concentrated almost entirely on the UK market. He
opened a shop in Edinburgh at the end of 1989 (funded by getting his
overdraft raised to Pounds 330,000) and a shop in London soon after. Both
were paying for themselves within six months.
Today, the Macdonalds employ 12 staff, and turnover has reached Pounds
450,000, up from Pounds 370,000 in 1992. William is pleased at the figure,
although he feels his biggest mistake has been in acting too cautiously
throughout, curbing expansion.
'It's a legacy of the past,' he says. 'With Cocoon I have not taken risks,
have not expanded as much as I ought. Although our profit margin is supposed
to be 10 per cent, it always seems to be less.'
This year's catalogue features the Macdonald's daughter Anna on its cover -
indicating that a new family company has established itself in the ashes of
the old. Cocoon is leaner and less ambitious than its predecessor, and it
probably has more staying power.
William's immediate goal is to keep increasing UK sales; he aims to open
more shops. 'There is still a large untapped market here,' he says. 'I'll
leave the rest of the world for others.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Claiming for expenses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I PAY TAX on the Paye system. Additionally, I have income from a furnished
home which I let to students for most of the year, and as holiday
accommodation during the summer.
What expenses can I claim against the income (apart from loan interest)? Are
there any advantages in being classified as a 'trade?'
Can I claim expenses up to the value of my wife's personal allowance for
caretaking duties (both of us spend considerable time at the property and
she is not otherwise employed).
Furthermore, if I declare a loss, is there a limit on the number of years I
can carry this forward until I make a profit against which to offset it?
Your profits (or losses) will fall within case VI of Schedule D, since your
activities cannot be regarded as a trade under tax law.
Case VI losses can be carried forward against case VI income (from any
source) indefinitely, provided that a claim is made within six years of the
end of the tax year in which each loss is incurred.
It is possible to elect for the rents to be assessed partly under schedule A
and partly under schedule D case VI, but that seems unlikely to be an
attractive option, so far as we can deduce from the bare facts given. Ask
your tax office for the free explanatory pamphlet IR87 (Rooms to let: income
from letting property).
One way of avoiding national insurance problems for your wife would be to
give her a half share in the property, either as a tenant-in-common or as a
joint tenant with yourself. Your solicitor can guide you on these points, of
course.
If the property is mortgaged, the transfer into joint names could attract
stamp duty.
It is possible for you to offer your wife a contract of employment as
bookkeeper etc in relation to the property, but bear in mind your national
insurance obligations as her employer. Leaflets are obtainable from the
Contributions Agency of the DSS.
If you ever contemplate selling the property, consult your solicitor well in
advance about the possibility of reducing the prospective CGT bill by living
in it for a short time and giving judiciously timed joint main-residence
notices, under section 222(6) (a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992, as outlined in the free leaflet CGT4 (Capital gains tax: owner
occupied houses).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD YOU clarify the legal position regarding any will written on plain
paper using a computer and signed without any witness being present.
A will which is drawn up and signed by a testator without being witnessed is
invalid. In order for a will to be valid, all of the following conditions
must be met:
1. It must be in writing (computer type on plain paper will suffice).
2. It must be signed by the testator at the end of the writing in the
presence of two witnesses who must see the testator sign.
3. The testator's signature must then be witnessed by the two witnesses who
(or whose spouses) are not beneficiaries of the will.
4. The testator must be of sound mind and over the age of 18.
5. The testator must intend the will to be operative as a testamentary
disposition.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transfer of capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM British but my wife is an American citizen who is resident in the UK
paying British income tax.
I have heard that, should one of us die, any transfer of capital between us
is not tax-exempt as in the normal case between husband and wife.
I have the following main assets as a result of death: endowments;
life-linked savings policies and term life policies (Pounds 250,000); life
assurance from company pension (Pounds 160,000); house in joint names
(Pounds 160,000); and a mortgage in our joint names (Pounds 120,000).
My wife has the following assets in the case of death: term life policy
(Pounds 130,000), life assurance from company pension (Pounds 120,000);
other joint assets/savings (Pounds 40,000).
Am I correct in assuming that we could suffer inheritance tax if either of
us died, and is there a simple solution to avoid any such exposure?
The inheritance tax legislation provides that where a deceased person's
property passes to his or her spouse, and that the deceased (but not the
deceased's spouse) is domiciled in the United Kingdom, then the transfer is
exempt only up to a value of Pounds 55,000. Any value transferred in excess
will be liable to inheritance tax.
This rule might apply if you die and your property passes to your wife - but
it does depend upon her domicile and not on her residence or citizenship.
If your wife were to die before you, it appears that any UK property which
she owned and which passed to you would be covered by the inter-spousal
exemption.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Share swap avoids CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If a company of which I am a shareholder receives a bid in cash and shares
from another company, I understand that, if I accept the cash alternative, I
have made a disposal for CGT purposes. If, however, I accept a change or
exchange of shares, have I then avoided a disposal for CGT purposes?
Yes, by virtue of section 135 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
Ask your tax office for the free explanatory pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation
allowance for quoted shares) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHERE disposals exceed a certain figure, is it possible to carry forward the
annual CGT exemption figure from one year to the other?
If so, will you please quote me chapter and verse to assist me in writing to
my tax office, which does not seem aware of this point.
No, the annual exempt amount (now Pounds 5,800) cannot be carried forward.
That is why some people use it up by bed-and-breakfast transactions towards
the end of each tax year.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: An easier road to retirement - The
attractions of a scheme free from Revenue restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN MCKEEVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY people may already be aware of the advantages of a funded unapproved
retirement benefits scheme (Furbs). But they may not know that its
attractions can be increased if it is established offshore.
Although a Furbs is called a retirement benefits scheme, it is free from the
restrictions that the Inland Revenue applies to approved pension schemes.
There are no limits on the amount of either contributions or benefits, and
employees can take all their benefits as a tax-free lump sum.
They do not have to wait until they have actually retired to take their
money, either; there is great flexibility over the time when they can
cash-in the scheme and take their tax-free sum. And if employees die before
taking their benefits, the trustees can pay the whole of the fund to their
family free of inheritance tax.
The ban on self-investment that applies to approved schemes does not apply
to a Furbs, so the trustees can invest in shares in the employer company or
loans to it. This can be a useful source of finance if a company is
family-owned and managed.
The employer's payments are tax-deductible and do not attract employer's
National Insurance Contributions. The employee pays tax on the employer's
payments to a Furbs in the same way as on any other bonus. So long as the
employee's total remuneration takes account of this tax liability, it need
not be a drawback to establishing a Furbs.
All these advantages apply to any Furbs, whether set up in the UK or abroad.
The difference lies in the tax treatment.
The rate of income and capital gains tax on investments in a UK Furbs is
limited to the 25 per cent basic rate. This represents an immediate saving
of 15 per cent compared with the tax rate which the employee would pay on
the same investments.
So, a UK Furbs is an attractive investment vehicle in its own right. But the
attractions increase considerably if the employer establishes the scheme
offshore.
Normally, a Furbs would be a trust; thus, it would be 'offshore' if the
trustees were themselves resident outside the UK, perhaps in the Channel
Islands.
The major advantage of an offshore Furbs is that it is completely free of
CGT. This represents a 25 per cent tax advantage over a UK Furbs - a nil
rate of tax compared with the basic rate.
This favourable tax treatment would apply only if the Furbs was part of an
'ordinary commercial arrangement.' Exactly what constitutes such an
arrangement depends, of course, on the facts of the case. But there should
not be a problem where contributions are part of the remuneration package of
a senior employee who is not otherwise connected with the company - as a
major shareholder, for example.
More caution is needed, though, when the employee is also a substantial
shareholder. If payments to the Furbs are excessively generous, the Revenue
might argue that the company's contributions contain an element of 'bounty'
 -ie, that it intends to give the employee a benefit over and above that
which it would give to an unconnected employee as a reward for his services.
Indeed, the Revenue could take this further and say that the company had
acted as the mere puppet of the shareholder/director so that the Furbs trust
was 'really' established indirectly by the director.
If the Revenue succeeded in showing that there was a non-commercial element
of generosity in the arrangements, the employee would pay tax on the capital
gains made by the Furbs trustees when he received payments from the scheme.
While he would at least have deferred the CGT, he would pay tax at between
40 and 64 per cent when he received the money.
If the Revenue took the view that the individual himself had 'really'
established the Furbs, he would face a tax bill when the trustees made
capital gains, as if he had made them himself.
The trustees would normally pay tax on any dividend and other income from
their UK investments. They would not pay out the income to the employee
during the life of the Furbs, but would accumulate it and add it to capital.
When the trustees paid out the fund, the employee would normally be taxed on
the accumulated income as if it were his own.
Trustees should, therefore, adopt an investment policy which maximises
capital gains and minimises income. They should consider such investments as
zero coupon preference shares, capital shares, investment trust warrants,
second-hand qualifying life policies and non-dividend-paying shares in
private companies (typically, the employee's family company) - indeed any
investment that shows mainly capital returns with a low income.
Where the Furbs is a genuinely commercial arrangement and is set up offshore
for a reason other than the avoidance of UK tax (perhaps because the
employee is an international employee who is seconded abroad for long
periods), the tax position is even more favourable. In this case, the
employee would have no liability on the Furbs income, even if he were UK
resident at the time he took his benefits.
A UK Furbs is an attractive investment vehicle, combining flexibility with a
favourable tax regime. An offshore Furbs can provide an even more favourable
CGT environment, but at the price of a possible income tax charge.
Where the employee's circumstances involve an overseas element, this tax
charge may be avoided. Even if this is not the case, the trustees can
contain or eliminate the potential income tax by an appropriate investment
policy, and the high-earning employee might well feel it is a small price to
pay for long term freedom from CGT.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Latest annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows level annuity rates for individuals at a range of ages and
with Pounds 100,000 to invest.  Billy Burrows, of the London-based Annuity
Direct, says: 'This week, at least six life companies have reduced their
annuity rates.  It would appear that rates are falling faster than the
corresponding fall in gilt yields. This suggests that life companies may be
concerned with the increased mortality cost and are maintaining margins.'
Figures in the table are provided by the Annuity Bureau Ltd, Enterprise
House, 59-65 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PQ, tel: 071 620 4090.  RNPFN
annuities are available exclusively for those in the nursing and allied
professions.
BBC Ceefax now features five pages on annuities.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: High hopes for high-tech / A look at
the Henderson TR Global Technology fund - Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGY could be the west's antidote to competition from emerging markets
in Asia and Latin America, according to Brian Ashford-Russell, manager of
the Henderson TR Global Technology fund.
'Technology is what is going to allow developed countries' manufacturing
industries to compete with emerging markets. I see no other way whereby
industry in the west can really compete against the low labour costs you are
going to get in China, India,' says Ashford-Russell.
He sees technology as the foundation for 'emerging industries', which have
greater growth potential than more established sectors.
The fund's performance appears to bear out this view. It is near the top of
its sector - international equity growth - over the last few years. Over
five years it is fifth out of 112 funds, with growth of 170 per cent (offer
to bid, net income reinvested, source: Micropal); over three years it is
fifth of 139 funds, though it has slipped to number 26 out of 153 funds over
one year, with 37 per cent growth.
The fund is relatively small, at just under Pounds 30m, and it is managed by
the two-man team of Ashford-Russell, who has been with the fund since it was
launched in 1984 (at Touche Remnant), and Michael Bourne, formerly with
Prolific's technology fund.
Their definition of technology is fairly broad, covering information
technology, health care, manufacturing, some environmental technology,
high-tech aerospace components, defence, and new telecommunications, such as
cellullar communications.
Leisure and entertainment technology, such as games software, is included,
but ordinary consumer electronics is not.
According to Ashford-Russell, technology accounts for 20 per cent of world
stock market capitalisation, but the fund deliberately concentrates on three
main markets: the US, UK and Japan.
'In some ways it is better to stay with what you know best, and feel
confident about. On average we have 20 per cent exposure to the UK. The UK
does not represent more than 5 per cent of world technology, but that does
not mean you cannot make very good money from it.'
The largest portion of the fund is invested in North America, with 65 per
cent at the moment; the UK has 17 per cent and Japan 9 per cent, with the
balance in cash. 'The US really drives the trust,' says Ashford-Russell. He
sees most important consumer and industrial trends as starting on the west
coast of the US, and gradually filtering through to the rest of the country
and then the world.
The lack of any investment in Europe apart from the UK, or Asia apart from
Japan may seem odd. 'Europe has been something of a minefield for technology
investors,' he says, and has no current plans to try again there.
Missing out on the boom in south-east Asian stock markets is a source of
some regret, however. 'That has been one of the penalties of remaining
rather pure in terms of specialisation,' he says.
'If you go into technology companies in emerging markets the first problem
you come up against is that most are relatively low-technology sub-contract
or assembly operations.' However, Ashford-Russell is planning a trip to the
far east to look for promising companies in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and
Taiwan.
Both product and company life cycles are short in the technology sector.
This has meant high turnover in the fund - up to 400 per cent a year, though
that has now slowed to 75-100 per cent. The rapidly changing nature of the
business also increases the research load. Between them, Bourne and
Ashford-Russell see 1,000 companies a year.
They tend to be small to medium-sized companies - the smallest would have a
market capitalisation of Dollars 20m - and the fund usually holds 60-70
stocks. The ten largest holdings at the moment are: TR Technology investment
trust (UK, managed by the same team); Misys (UK); Seagate (US); Tadiran
(Israel/US); Cygnus (US); Marshall Industries (US); Arrow Electronics (US);
Software Toolworks (US); International Cabletel (US); Newbridge Networks
(Canada).
With rapidly changing markets and products, mistakes are inevitable.
Ashford-Russell describes them as 'torpedoes' - disasters that appear from
nowhere and sink you before you have seen them coming.
'We regard ourselves as doing very well if we get away with a quarter
without a torpedo,' he says.
However, torpedoes can turn around. One high-profile disaster
Ashford-Russell remembers was Micro Focus, the software company. On one day
in 1984 its share price fell by more than half, and kept on falling.
But in 1988, on a trip to the US, Ashford-Russell started hearing good
things about the company, and on his return went to visit it.
'I don't think they had seen any UK investors for a long time, but they were
operating in an area of the market which was not really terribly well
understood over here,' says Ashford-Russell.
'I picked up Micro Focus at about Pounds 1.50, and sold it over the last 18
months or two years on average at about Pounds 20.'
Timing is also important. Nintendo and Sega have revolutionised the computer
games market, but Ashford-Russell missed the best of both of them.
Charges. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual 1.5 per cent;
the bid-offer spread is 6.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000, and there is no savings scheme or Pep attached to the fund.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Goodbye Sid and bonjour Pierre / A
look at privatisation opportunities elsewhere in the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fragrant onion-seller pacing the Square Mile in London this week to
publicise French privatisations was not as out of place as she looked. The
European Community outlaws discrimination against the nationals of one
member state who apply for shares in the privatisations of other member
states.
But will it be as worthwhile being a Pierre as it was being a Sid when
Britain floated its monopoly utilities?
The best-known EC programmes are in Spain, France and Italy but KPN, the
Dutch postal and telecommunications group, and Deutsche Telekom are expected
to float in 1994.
The French government is committed to transferring 21 companies to the
private sector over the next five years, making the programme possibly the
largest and most attractive for retail investors.
At present, the partial flotation of Argentaria in Spain is under way, while
that of Rhone Poulenc in France is imminent and shares in Italy's Credito
Italiano should be available before the end of 1993. It all adds up to an
opportunity for private investors. But professionals will tell you that
cross-border applications are complex and best left to them. They may have a
point.
The first pitfall is that, unlike the UK privatisation programme, the
majority of governments are issuing stocks in commercial ventures rather
than monopoly utilities. Paul Killik, of stockbroker Killik, which offers a
French privatisation service, says: 'They are serious businesses. The
quality of earnings is not the same as the quality of monopolies and
utilities where you have to live with the regulator and perhaps a political
risk. But, apart from that, they are pretty nice areas to be in.'
Another snag for the independent-minded private investor is that, for the
privatisations of Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone Poulenc, the French
government required all applicants to have French bank accounts for
settlement.
Under the Killik service, investors and up to four more members of their
families hand over the money they wish to invest. The firm then sets up a
French account earning about 5 per cent interest and sends out application
forms as the flotations are announced. Under EC rules, standard-rate
taxpayers who keep their shares will not attract extra tax on dividends, but
higher rate investors will have to pay the additional 15 per cent.
Killik says clients' French bank accounts will be credited with dividends in
francs. It is not yet clear just how retail investors will collect dividends
in other countries.
Private investors have found it virtually impossible to secure shares from
the pool the French government makes available to international investors.
Officials seem to fear that individuals could make multiple applications
through friendly brokers in several countries. Brokers say that private
investors have a greater chance of buying shares from the domestic pool.
There are also different settlement arrangements. Unlike the UK government,
the continental European authorities seem to require investors to pay only
for the shares they are allocated, rather than for those for which they
apply.
In France and Italy, though, the settlement process takes a month which
means investors could find their money tied up for longer than expected.
Perhaps the main barrier for private investors is that privatised companies
and their advisers may be reluctant to welcome what are, for them, small and
fiddly transactions.

funds in its sector over the five years to November 1, with growth of 270
per cent (offer to bid, income re-invested, source: Hardwick Stafford
Wright). Over three years, it was ranked 24th of 45 funds, and it was 15th
out of 49 funds over the past year, growing 55 per cent.
The Asian Smaller Companies fund was launched in August 1993 and is invested
mainly in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The China Dragon fund was
launched in February 1993 and invests in China and adjoining territories
such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Both these funds are too new to have a
reliable track record.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL House Investment Management, a division of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, this week acquired Brown Shipley Unit Trust Managers, with some
Pounds 70m of assets. Some trust rationalisation may follow the change.
Two Brown Shipley trusts are moving to Rathbone Brothers, rather than to
Capital House. The Smaller Companies and Recovery funds, run by Patrick
Evershed, will be rebranded as the Evermore funds. The Brown Shipley
Recovery fund is top of the UK equity growth sector over one year, although
it is next to bottom over five years (Evershed took over management of the
fund only in 1991).
The new funds are reducing the initial charge from 6 per cent to 2 per cent
with immediate effect; the annual charge is 1.5 per cent.

RICHARD Portergill, a director of Albert Fisher Group, sold 600,000 shares
at 76p. Albert Fisher's price has been recovering steadily since directors
bought heavily in July and October last year at between 37p and 45p.
Since the arrival of Stephen Walls as chairman, the group has reduced costs,
streamlined its business by selling off non-core operations, and
strengthened management. In the four days before Portergill's sale, Walls
and Nicholas Saphir, another director, had each bought 30,000 shares at
around 76p.
Smithkline Beecham, in common with virtually all pharmaceutical stocks, has
had a miserable time over the past 12 months. Chairman Henry Wendt has sold
his entire holding of 44,000 ADRs but still retains equity units.
Each ADR represents five A shares; and over the past 12 months, the shares
have underperformed by about 37 per cent. Wendt has announced his intention
to retire.
John Dawson has sold 35,000 shares in Yorkshire Chemicals at 403p a share.
The price has moved more or less in line with the market for the best part
of 12 months and little better could be expected. Little significant
improvement in world-wide demand is expected, and the dividend yield is
below the market average.

THOSE WHO believe the property market is set for a revival may be attracted
by the flotation of the Wigmore Property investment trust. The trust will
invest in small and medium-sized property companies with market
capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m.
There are only three existing property investment trusts, of which the
largest is TR Property. Its shares have performed well over the last year as
falling interest rates improved investors' attitudes towards the property
sector.
Wigmore hopes to issue up to 50m shares at 100p each, with warrants attached
on a one-for-five basis. Over 19.3m shares are being placed with
institutions and property companies and the rest is on offer to the public.
Baring Investment Management is investment manager of the trust and the
property adviser is Baring, Houston &amp; Sanders. The 10 largest investments in
the initial portfolio are expected to be: City Site Estates, Chesterfield
Properties, Ex-Lands, Hemingway Properties, London &amp; Associated IT, Olives
Property, Prior, Southend Property Holdings, Tops Estates and Town Centre
Securities.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: High cost of home from home -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds that UK expatriates can face a mortgage problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EXPATRIATES tempted to buy a home in Britain during the current slack
market may find it difficult to get a mortgage. Lenders are far less happy
to loan money to someone who is abroad than to someone who is an
owner-occupier.
When Ron MacDonald, a marine engineer, found that he could double his salary
by working in Canada, he and his wife left for Quebec in 1981. Several years
later, alarmed at the rise in UK property prices, they decided to buy a home
in England. 'It seemed at the time that if prices continued their upward
spiral we would not be able to return to England, so we bought the
property,' said MacDonald.
He took out a mortgage with The Mortgage Corporation, a centralised lender,
for 70 per cent of the value of the property and let it out.
This year MacDonald found he was paying 3.5 percentage points more than the
standard rate quoted by the Mortgage Corporation. He asked why and was told
that as a non-resident he was considered a bad risk and was therefore
subjected to a higher rate.
MacDonald thought this ridiculous given that he had never missed a monthly
payment. But he has found it impossible to transfer to a different lender
since his property has fallen in value.
Julian Palmer, head of marketing at The Mortgage Corporation, said that it
did not penalise homeowners letting out their property by charging them a
higher mortgage rate but that it did charge different rates for clients
depending on their risk profile.
Lenders are reluctant to enter the expatriate market because it is harder to
pursue someone living abroad for mortgage payments and, in the extreme, to
repossess the home. They also do not want to find that they are financing a
commercial venture.
The flexibility of lenders during the property recession has been further
constrained by the stricter criteria imposed by mortgage indemnity insurers.
Borrowers have to pay a mortgage indemnity premium, which protects the
lender against a mortgage default, if the loan exceeds a certain proportion
of the value of the property - usually 75 per cent.
For this reason, those lenders that are willing to extend a loan to an
expatriate tend to restrict it to a maximum of around 75 per cent.
Paul Atkinson of Nationwide, the second largest lender, said that in
general: 'Our primary focus is to provide a mortgage for people to buy a
home to live in. If someone was abroad and wanted to buy a property in the
UK and rent it to people other than relatives, we would treat that as an
investment property proposition and would take a decision regarding what the
appropriate lending rate would be.'
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society no longer offers mortgages to
expatriates. 'Generally, we have found that those who are not
owner-occupiers have more difficulty in meeting their mortgage payments.
Moreover, those who live abroad face a currency risk if they are paying
their mortgage in sterling, especially if the rental income is not
sufficient to meet monthly payments,' said Gill Colver of C&amp;G.
However, some lenders are willing to take on expatriates, although most
stress that they look at customers on an individual basis. In all cases, the
property must be the principal or sole residence in the UK and the buyer
must show that they intend to return to it.
BNP, the UK mortgage lending arm of the French bank, has specialised in the
expatriate market for 10 years. It will lend to a maximum of 80 per cent of
the value of the property. A fee of Pounds 295 will be added to the loan.
The letting agreement must either be on an assured shorthold tenancy basis
or a corporate let.
Abbey National will ask potential buyers to fill in a letting questionnaire
and to return it with a cheque for Pounds 50. The maximum letting period it
will agree to is a renewable one-year contract. If the owner does not return
to the UK usually within three years, the bank may decide that the owner is
using the property as an investment vehicle and charge mortgage interest at
two percentage points above the standard variable rate.
Midland and National Westminster banks will lend up to 90 per cent of the
value of the property. Both would want the buyer to have a UK-based bank
account out of which mortgage payments would be made. Midland would insist
on taking first charge of the property, while NatWest would not lend unless
the expatriate is on a fixed term contract or unless satisfied that the
buyer intends to return to the UK within a year.
Lloyds will charge an administration fee of Pounds 175 and restrict lending
to 75 per cent of the value of the purchase. It would want to take first
charge over the mortgage. Barclays will charge up to 2.5 percentage points
over its standard variable rate and will lend a maximum of 80 per cent. John
Charcol, mortgage brokers, can also arrange expat mortgages.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Poor advice earns salesmen a rocket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME insurance salesmen are giving their clients poor advice on
straightforward life insurance, according to a report just published in
Which?, the magazine of the Consumers' Association.
It sent three researchers to visit 45 vendors who were a mixture of
independent financial advisers, tied agents, or employees of insurance
companies. The researchers asked for advice on the best way to protect their
families' income if they died early.
Which? said the cheapest and most appropriate solution for all of them would
have been term insurance, which pays out an agreed sum if the insured person
dies within a specified period but otherwise has no cash value.
Unfortunately, because term insurance is relatively cheap, it pays low
commission and is often ignored by sales staff looking to maximise their
income.
In this survey, most advisers recommended term insurance, but a number gave
advice described by Which? as 'appalling.' Term insurance was passed over in
favour of products paying higher commission but which were, in some cases,
completely inappropriate.
Twelve recommended whole-of-life insurance. They argued that because it
could be cashed in, the premiums would not be 'wasted.' But such policies
are not efficient ways of saving - you would probably do better buying
protection and investment products separately.
A handful of advisers recommended endowment policies, which would have tied
up more money than the researchers could afford. One even said the endowment
could be encashed after five years, which probably would have lost the
client a lot of money.
The Association of British Insurers says companies are now much more aware
of the importance of training salespeople to make sure they know more about
the products, ask clients the right questions and sell them appropriate
products.
Term insurance is essentially a simple product, but can have refinements.
Variations include automatic annual increases in the sum insured, or
optional increases if your needs change: for example, on the birth of
children.
Some policies can be renewed when they expire, extended earlier, or
converted into a different type. Some insurers even waive premiums if you
are ill or unemployed.
Your state of health has obvious implications for how likely you are to die
within the term for which you are insured. Most companies charge more for
smokers, and may ask you to have a medical if the sum insured is very large
or the medical details you give show that you present a risk.
Prosperity has approached the problem from a different angle with its new
policy, Life Choice. This is available only to healthy people: non-smokers
who are not overweight and do not have a family history of heart disease.
Everyone who applies must have a Bupa Health Check, for which they pay
Pounds 45, but this is offset against premiums.
Premiums, loadings for smokers and so on will vary widely between insurers,
so it is worth making sure you get several quotes or go to an independent
adviser who can find out the best buy for you. Lloyd's of London can offer
more flexible cover, for standard or unusual risks, with terms of anything
from one day to 10 years.
The early death of the main wage-earner is an obvious worry for many
families, but finances can be hit even harder if the main earner becomes
seriously ill or disabled and cannot work but needs special care.
Many insurers now also offer policies which can provide a regular income
while a person is ill, or pay a lump sum if he develops a serious or
terminal illness. Sometimes, this can be combined with life cover, although
it is essential to check if this is better value than buying the two
elements separately.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Lloyd's funds' mixed fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH publicity was given earlier this week to the setbacks of plans to
introduce limited liability capital to the Lloyd's insurance market. Johnson
Fry, the financial services company, announced on Tuesday it was scrapping
its Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust, a 'fund of funds' that aimed to
invest across a range of Lloyd's investment trusts and companies.
Charles Fry, chief executive of Johnson Fry, said that the company had
simply run out of time and had been unable to meet its minimum funding
target of Pounds 15m, raising only Pounds 8m from investors. A number of
funds have scaled down their targets for capital raising, mainly because of
the difficulties in finding sufficient space on what they consider to be
'good quality' Lloyd's syndicates. CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by Barclays
de Zoete Wedd and CLM Advisers, a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the brokers,
reduced the scale of its placing and offer for subscription to Pounds 110m,
compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 200m.
News that two Lloyd's members' agencies - Sturge and London Wall - were
abandoning their plans to list investment trusts on the stock market, added
to the mood of pessimism in some quarters. Yet on the whole Lloyd's efforts
to raise corporate capital must be judged a success so far. Institutions
such as pension funds and life assurance companies are continuing to sustain
their interest, albeit at relatively modest levels.
By the end of this week, 10 investment trusts and companies had published
prospectuses and raised more than Pounds 500m from institutional investors.
Three other trusts are expected to follow suit next week. Lloyd's should be
able to count on up to Pounds 1bn in corporate capital for 1994.
Most of the funds are also offering individual investors the chance to
participate. This is partially because stock exchange regulations stipulate
that investment trusts raising more than about Pounds 30m must usually raise
at least 25 per cent of their capital from the retail market. Some funds -
especially smaller ones - are limiting their offers for sale to
intermediaries such as private client stockbrokers. But others are
advertising directly to the public.
These include CLM Insurance Fund and London Insurance Market Investment
Trust (LIMIT), both of which advertised in the press this week, after
issuing their full prospectuses.
CLM has even opened a share shop at Lloyd's allowing investors the
opportunity to buy its shares over the counter. LIMIT, which is sponsored by
James Capel and Samuel Montagu, placed an issue for Pounds 280m with
institutions but is making some Pounds 70m available to private investors
through a clawback.
Investors in CLM and LIMIT must pledge at least Pounds 1,000. A smaller
scheme, Syndicate Capital Trust, sponsored by Rafael Zorn Hemsley, offers
individuals the chance of investing a minimum of Pounds 500. Shares in the
trust, which will support about 15 syndicates, are being marketed by
ShareLink Investment Services.
Angerstein (sponsored by NatWest Markets), Nelson (backed by Lazard
Brothers, Cazenove and Octavian), Masthead (an investment company sponsored
by Hambros and Murray Lawrence) and Premium Trust/Premium Underwriting
(sponsored by Noble &amp; Co and Wellington, the members' agents) are also
offering their shares directly to the public. Premium insists that investors
subscribe a minimum of Pounds 3,000.
New London Capital (sponsored by Warburg) and Delian Lloyd's Investment
Trust (sponsored by Hill Samuel) aim to raise most of their funds through
private placements with institutions. But they will consider applications
from private investors willing to commit at least Pounds 20,000 to the
funds.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Profiting from CGT - Capital gains
is the great unexploited tax break. Scheherazade Daneshkhu tells how to make
the most of it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL gains is the great unexploited tax break. The annual CGT exemption
entitles everyone to a slice of tax-free gains when they come to sell
assets. In the present tax year, individuals are allowed to make Pounds
5,800 of capital gains before having to pay CGT.
Most people do not use up their exemption. Only 85,000 faced a bill for CGT
in the 1992/93 tax year, compared with 1.6m who paid higher-rate income tax.
That leaves plenty of scope for tax planning, particularly by converting
interest income into capital gains. And since husbands and wives each have
their own allowance, this allows further planning opportunities.
Investors also are entitled to an indexation allowance which gives
protection from the effects of post-1982 inflation, and they can also offset
losses against gains. Unlike gains, losses can be carried forward
indefinitely to be set off against future gains. But the losses of one
spouse cannot be set off against the gains of the other.
Since gains cannot be carried forward, it is worthwhile trying to make use
of the CGT exemption every year. Large investors can do this by reviewing
their equity portfolio annually and realising gains - by selling shares and
buying them back, or bed and breakfasting in the jargon - in order to
increase their base price.
The process does, however, involve such costs as commission and stamp duty
and carries the risk that prices might move against you while you are out of
the market. But if you own shares which have become negligible in value -
perhaps as a result of a company going into liquidation - they do not have
to be sold in order to realise a loss. Instead, you can claim to make use of
the unrealised losses, which can be offset against any gains made in the
year of the claim.
You should never construct a portfolio around the sole aim of saving tax,
since it is the performance of the investments which matters in the long
run. By being aware of the opportunities for exploiting the CGT exemption,
though, you could find that some fit in with your investment strategy.
Converting income into capital gain
A higher-rate taxpayer who does not use his CGT allowance could save up to
Pounds 2,320 a year by ensuring that profit normally taken as income is
taken as capital gain instead. If all higher-rate taxpayers managed to use
up their CGT allowance in this way, they would collectively save Pounds
3.7bn a year in tax (assuming that income tax thresholds and the CGT
allowance did not change).
Earlier this year, Ivory &amp; Sime, the fund management group, launched an
investment trust based on exploiting the annual CGT exemption to give
investors an annual tax-free income of 7 per cent, paid monthly.
The ISIS trust does this by selling 7 per cent of an investor's holding
every year in order to use up the CGT exemption. The trust's launch was not,
however, particularly successful, raising just Pounds 26.6m.
Private investors can do much the same thing by constructing a portfolio of
zero dividend preference shares. These are one class of share in a
split-level investment trust and do not pay income. Instead, all the return
comes in the form of capital growth - which means that, for tax purposes,
the profit counts as capital gains rather than income.
An investor can sell zeros steadily to generate gains which can be taken as
income; tax will not be payable as long as the gains do not exceed Pounds
5,800. Zeros now yield around 7-8 per cent gross, which is more attractive
than the returns from building societies.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, suggests that those who want a
balanced portfolio of zeros can opt for the Exeter Zero Preference fund.
This is a unit trust run by Exeter Fund Managers which invests specifically
in zeros and has grown by 37.7 per cent in the two years to November 1,
according to the Hardwick Stafford Wright 'stats pack'. The trust has an
initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual charge of 1.2 per cent.
Zeros are a particularly suitable share to use, but investors wanting to
make use of their CGT exemption can also invest in low-yielding shares which
have the aim of capital growth.
Other investments which do not pay income, but are liable to capital gains
tax are qualifying second-hand endowment policies.
If you have a lump sum but do not want to start a long-term endowment
policy, it could be an idea to invest in one (or even a series) of
second-hand endowments maturing in different years so as to take profits
(which will be taxed as capital gains). You will, however, have to keep up
the premiums.
BZW and Kleinwort Benson both offer funds which group togther endowment
policies and save investors the administrative bother of paying the
premiums.
Lowering the amount of CGT payable
David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says it is possible to make
maximum use of the indexation allowance through careful planning. 'If a
purchase of shares were made on August 1 1992, and subsequent disposal took
place on June 30 1993, the indexation allowance would be based on increases
in the retail price index from August 1992 to June 1993.'
Harris points out, however, that by buying the shares one day earlier and
delaying selling them by a day, the indexation allowance would be based on
RPI changes from July 1992 to July 1993. 'Provided the RPI increases, a
greater indexation allowance will have accrued,' he adds.
Such precise timing might not always be possible but you should find it
relatively easy to involve your spouse in CGT planning. If the spouse has
not made use of their exemption, shares should be transferred to them before
being sold. Even if CGT is payable, it is a good idea to do this - provided
they are on a lower tax rate.
Boyton says investors also often overlook the fact that children have a CGT
exemption. Shares placed in a child's name should, ideally, not produce
income, since this is taxed at the donor's rate. But this is not the case
with CGT.
John Battersby, personal tax partner in KPMG Peat Marwick, says people who
work in a company in which they hold shares with at least 5 per cent of the
voting rights can get CGT relief. The relief was extended in March to
include all full-time officers and employees who hold the minimum number of
shares.
'Although known as retirement relief, paradoxically it does not require
retirement,' says Battersby. 'If the shareholder has reached 55 and sells
the shares, the first Pounds 150,000 of gains and half of the next Pounds
450,000 of gains can be tax-free.'
The investor will get the maximum relief if he has satisfied the conditions
for at least 10 years before making the sale. 'If there is no ready market
in the shares, a sale back to the company could qualify for the relief,
especially if the shareholder were disposing of his or her shares,'
Battersby adds.
In cases where an investor sells rights to shares and the proceeds are less
than 5 per cent of the value of the shares held in the company, Peter Rayney
and David Pooler, of accountant Moores Rowland, point out that it is
possible to make a claim to defer CGT liability. 'Effectively, the proceeds
realised are deducted from the allowable cost of the shares,' they say.
If a portfolio is constructed with the aim of exploiting the CGT exemption,
it is advisable to include within it assets which are not liable to CGT so
as to decrease the amount of taxable gains.
National Savings certificates, personal equity plans and the business
expansion scheme are all investments which are free of both income and
capital gains tax. Index-linked gilts earn most of their return in the form
of tax-free capital gain.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Markets: Rise in bond yields rattles equity investors - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US STOCK markets were unable this week to ignore the possibility that the
rally in government securities may be over. For the best part of a year they
have risen on the coat-tails of buoyant bond prices and low long-term
interest rates.
Two weeks ago, long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, stood at just over 5.8 per cent. At midday
yesterday, after more than a week of sustained selling, occasionally nearing
panic proportions, the yield stood at 6.25 per cent. It has not been this
high since August.
Declines in the price of intermediate and shorter-dated government
securities have also sent yields tumbling at the short end of the maturity
range. The two-year note, which was yielding under 3.9 per cent a fortnight
ago, now yields more than 4.1 per cent. The yield on the seven-year note has
risen from 4.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent over the same period.
This sharp increase in bond market yields has rattled Wall Street, and
equity investors in particular. For the past year, since the bond market
began its remarkable rally (a rally that dates back to the election of
President Clinton in November 1992), the stock markets have been luxuriating
in declining interest rates.
Equity investors like falling rates because they lower the cost of capital
for corporations, thus encouraging spending on expansion and supporting
profits growth, and they make stocks look more attractive than alternative
investments, thus encouraging money to flow out of bank certificates of
deposit and short-term money market funds and into equities.
Now, however, rates are heading higher, and with a vengeance. The turnaround
in rates has been prompted by the firmest evidence yet that the US economy
is picking up steam. Recent reports on industrial activity, gross domestic
product, house sales, and employment trends have all pointed to a
strengthening in economic growth.
The sight of an improving economy has spooked bond investors, who fear that
rising growth will eventually lead to a resurgence in inflation, and tighter
monetary policy in the form of higher short-term rates. There has been a
growing feeling among bond analysts that the market's year-long rally, which
brought long-term interest rates down from 7.5 per cent to a record low of
5.8 per cent, may be spent.
The rally in bond prices was primarily inspired by expectations that
President Clinton's tax-raising, deficit-reducing budget would
simultaneously restrain the federal deficit and slow future economic growth,
thus keeping inflation in check. Prices were also supported by the
government's decision to cut its long bond issue in an attempt to lower the
cost of financing the federal deficit.
It now looks, however, as if the market underestimated the resilience of the
economy. Although growth remains relatively modest - output is currently
increasing by about 3 per cent on an annualised basis - it is still stronger
than bond investors expected. Witness yesterday's monthly employment report,
which showed that non-farm payrolls rose by 177,000 in October, about 20,000
more than analysts had forecast.
In more normal times, all this evidence of improving economic growth would
be a positive influence on stock markets. These are not normal times,
however. Not only does concern about rising interest rates outweigh
encouraging news, but equity investors, like their fixed-income
counterparts, are increasingly worried that their market has overreached
itself.
Share prices are, by most measures, looking expensive. Stocks in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, the broadest measure of market performance, are
trading at more than 22 times latest earnings. The stocks of smaller
capitalised companies are also pricy, which explains why they have suffered
the most in the recent sell-off. While the S&amp;P 500 fell about 3 per cent
this week, the Nasdaq composite index, which includes many small
growth-oriented companies, dropped 4.6 per cent in just 2 1/2 days.
Smaller company stocks have been hit hard because in recent weeks they have
primarily been supported by speculative demand, often a sign that a buying
trend may be peaking. Consequently, as soon as broader market sentiment
turned around, investors bailed out of small-cap stocks.
This week's selling in stock markets may not be the last of any correction.
Bond prices probably have further to fall, although they may be low enough
next week to attract some bargain hunters. Equities, however, do not look as
if they have fallen far enough to become attractive to non-speculative
investors.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Markets: Price-cutting may prove catching - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAINSBURY was not the only company to be cutting prices this week. Murray
Johnstone has already blazed a trail in the unit trust industry by slashing
the initial charge on its unit trusts to 1 per cent. This week, it went a
step further - by offering units with no initial charge at all.
The deal has a touch of the stock clearance sale about it. Murray
International, one of the investment trusts run by the group, is selling a
holding of Pounds 5m in the Murray Equity Income unit trust. Rather than
redeem the units (and reduce the size of the trust), Murray Johnstone
decided to offer the units elsewhere.
Not only is there no initial charge for those investing in the Murray Equity
Income unit trust between now and November 30, but Personal Equity Plan
investments into the trust are also free.
Furthermore, for the first Pounds 4.8m of investments, there is an
additional 0.5 per cent saving (effectively a reduction in the bid-offer
spread). It adds up to a total Pounds 330 saving on a full Pounds 6,000 Pep.
Investment performance is, of course, more important than charges in the
long run. The trouble is that future investment performance inevitably
cannot be known, whereas charges are set out in black and white.
If two fund managers are equally good, the one who runs the fund with the
lower charges will provide a better return to the investor. So by buying
into a low-charging fund, the investor is tilting the odds in his direction.
The record of Murray Equity Income is reasonable. It is ranked 39th out of
94 funds over the five years to November 1, according to Micropal, with
growth of 62.9 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested). However, its
performance is below average for the sector over one and three years. The
gross yield on the fund is 5 per cent and the minimum investment Pounds 500.
It is also worth noting that Murray's annual charge is 1.5 per cent. There
are other funds with just a 1 per cent annual charge, and a low annual
charge may well work out to be far more important than the size of the
initial charge over the long run.
On the other hand, there are many trusts with a 5-6 per cent initial charge
and a 1.5 per cent annual charge, so Murray's initiative has to be welcome
news for the investor.
                          *       *       *
Save &amp; Prosper, undaunted by the recent adverse comment over high income
products, has launched another stock market-linked income bond. This one
will pay 9 per cent income per year for five years, but investors will only
receive back all their capital if the FT-SE 100 Index rises by 40 per cent
over a five and a quarter year period.
If the FT-SE falls, or fails to grow, over the period, investors will get
back 55 per cent of their original capital. This, together with the five 9
per cent payments, means that in total they will get back what they
invested. However, as one reader pointed out, this guarantee could also be
achieved by leaving your money under the mattress for five years; it takes
no account of inflation or the interest forgone.
Those who buy the bond are gambling future capital to get current income.
There is nothing necessarily wrong with that, provided investors know what
they are doing; S &amp; P claims that surveys show that 97 per cent of those who
bought the first tranche understood the product.
How likely is the gamble to work? A 40 per cent rise in the FT-SE over five
years represents annual growth of 6.6 per cent. But this ignores the
dividend yield, which means that the total return needed from equities is
over 10 per cent per annum. BZW figures show that equities have tended to
offer a real return of 7 per cent per annum, so the S &amp; P return is
compatible with an inflation rate of 3 per cent. That seems quite possible.
If the FT-SE 100 rises by 60 per cent over five years, investors will get an
extra 9 per cent bonus.
Income is payable quarterly or annually, and is free of basic rate tax;
higher rate taxpayers will face an additional charge. Minimum investment is
Pounds 5,000.
                          *       *       *
There was good news for the self-employed yesterday when the Court of Appeal
ruled against the Inland Revenue and in favour of Ian Lorimer, a vision
mixer. The revenue had ruled that although Lorimer did more than 200 jobs
for 30 different production companies in a year, he was not self-employed.
Accordingly he should be taxed under Schedule E, rather than the more
favourable Schedule D, which applies to freelance workers.
According to Jeff Gitter, media and entertainment partner of accountants
Lubbock Fine, the decision dates back to an Inland Revenue review of the
film and TV industry back in 1983, which produced a list of those jobs which
could count as freelance. Vision mixers were not on the list. The Inland
Revenue also claimed that Lorimer was not self-employed because he was not
providing equipment, simply his skill and labour.
The Court of Appeal has said it is clear that Lorimer was in business on his
own account. Gitter says the decision will have application to a number of
professions, such as actors, musicians and even management consultants. The
Revenue was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords; it may still try
to do so.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Markets: It's a bird] It's a plane] It's a chicken] - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SKIES over the City were dark this week with the wings of chickens
coming home to roost. For months, the big question about European equity
markets has been how they would react to a rise in US long-term interest
rates.
Now we know the answer: badly. The yield on long-term US bonds rose from
just under 6 per cent a week ago to around 6 1/4 per cent by Friday. In
response, London's FT-SE 100 index dropped 2.7 per cent on the week, closing
at 3085.5, after falling 63.5 on Friday alone. Other European bourses did as
badly.
Why has a relatively small rise in interest rates on the other side of the
Atlantic translated into a drop in European equities? Probably because the
rise threatens the twin forces that lie behind the past year's global rally:
the belief that sustained low inflation opens the door to ever lower
interest rates; and the flood of US money out of savings accounts and into
mutual funds, particularly those investing abroad.
This gush of dollars has been the crucial extra fuel for the rally in
European and emerging stock markets. The fear this week was that it might
dry up, ending the phase when investors in European stock markets could put
their critical faculties on hold.
On the most bearish view - that of Panmure Gordon's Robin Aspinall - UK
stocks could retrace all the gains made since August 1992, which would take
the FT-SE 100 index back to around 2,270. He is pretty much on his own:
other brokers, pointing to the lack of big selling on Friday, see this
week's developments as a passing correction, not the start of a bear market.
Still, even if the roosting chickens do not plan to stay, their return was a
brisk reminder of how markets work.
Some of those chickens were frozen. Supermarket shares fell sharply on
Wednesday in reaction to price cuts by Sainsbury on 300 own-label products.
For months, investors have been worrying about the outlook for the food
retailers' traditionally sky-high margins in the face of consumer price
resistance, the emergence of discounters, and the growing saturation of the
UK market.
On Wednesday came Sainsbury's response: lower prices and a recognition that
the company's growth will increasingly have to come from outside its core UK
food business. Food retailing shares fell 3.6 per cent on Wednesday, with
Sainsbury down 15p at 385p.
The next day, the rot spread to the food manufacturers, after David
Sainsbury's pronouncement that prices of branded products would 'have to
come down very significantly to compete.'
He went on: 'We're clearly now back in a period when people are again
talking about discounting and price wars.'
These are some of the stock market's least favourite words. But they are
ones that investors will increasingly have to come to terms with, if the
Bank of England gets its way. Serious price competition seems to be one
factor the Bank is counting on to keep inflation low.
The Bank's quarterly inflation report, published on Tuesday, says 'there is
a slight possibility' that underlying inflation, currently 3.3 per cent,
will 'briefly' rise above the government's 1-4 per cent target range in the
first half of next year.
After that, however, the Bank expects inflation to fall, even though the
economy will be picking up. How will this unusual combination of events be
accomplished? Thanks to 'the continuing output gap, moderate growth of
nominal demand, and slow growth in broad money and credit'.
In practice, those factors will only be converted into lower inflation if
they lead to sustained and intense price competition. The signs here are
mixed. Three quarters of British companies responding to the CBI survey last
month said they expected their prices to stay the same over the next four
months.
But whenever companies do get a chance to raise prices, they jump at it. In
the export market, for example, devaluation has allowed UK companies to
raise their sterling prices while keeping their foreign currency prices
unchanged.
Though manufacturers' UK prices have risen by less than 3 per cent over the
past year, sterling prices for their non-EC exports have risen by more than
14 per cent. 'Both the speed and extent to which export prices have
responded are surprising,' says the Bank.
A sluggish UK recovery and growing competition among retailers may prevent
UK companies from doing at home what they have successfully achieved abroad
 -but it will certainly not stop them trying.
There were other roosting chickens in sight this week. The 1p a share bid
for Ferranti being mooted by GEC led to predictable unhappiness by small
shareholders. Normally, in such circumstances, disgruntled shareholders get
short shrift, but Ferranti's complex capital structure, with five classes of
shares, amplifies their chance of making their voices heard. Without a 90
per cent vote in favour in each of the four important classes, GEC will not
be able to force recalcitrant investors into surrendering their stock.
The week's largest and most unsavoury chicken was the fate of Queen's Moat
Houses, the hotel chain which announced late last week that it was restating
its 1991 and 1992 accounts. A fresh valuation of the property value of the
hotels put them at Pounds 861m, compared with the Pounds 1.35bn estimated by
a different firm of surveyors only four months before. This week's chickens
included an investigation by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
into just how this could happen; and the departure of those of Queen's
Moat's non-executive directors who had stayed on after the change of
management earlier in the year. None of this will help the group's luckless
shareholders: the shares remain suspended, since March, at 47 1/2 p.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Markets: BT unhappily reverses charges - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a good week for BT's customers. Cheaper calls on Saturday and
Sunday next year will put Pounds 125m back in their pockets as the first
tranche of a guaranteed Pounds 500m worth of price cuts.
For investors, however, the future seems neither so certain nor so
encouraging. The company issued a carefully worded but clear warning on
Thursday along with its interim results that there was no certainty that
dividend growth at today's 8 per cent or so can be maintained. The news took
more than Pounds 500m off BT's market value as brokers marked the shares
down.
BT's half year figures, were at the top end of market expectations with
pretax profits up almost 50 per cent at Pounds 1.5bn. The interim dividend
was 6.65p, a healthy 8.1 per cent up on last year's allotment.
The sting came in chairman Iain Vallance's gloss on the numbers: 'Future
dividend policy will need, more than ever, to take account of continuing low
inflation, harsher regulation, tougher competition and emerging long-term
needs and opportunities'.
Analysts were yesterday still mulling over what Vallance was trying to
signal to the market. Laurence Heyworth at Robert Fleming saw it as a
warning to those who had tended to forget that BT remains a regulated
utility in spite of all the exciting possibilities in the convergence of,
for example, telecommunications and entertainment.
He drew a parallel with the water and gas industries where the trend is
towards tighter regulation and lower rates of return: 'Capital expenditure
is now flat at about Pounds 2bn a year. Why should the regulator allow BT to
report ever- increasing profits and dividends if it is not reinvesting in
its network?'
Other analysts pointed out there seemed no reason why in the short term at
any rate dividend growth rate cannot be maintained at generous levels.
Tressan MacCarthy at Panmure Gordon said: 'Either BT is hinting that it has
found another use for the cash or it is trying to put pressure on the
regulator.' The chart suggests that after some earlier volatility, the
relative dividend yield is set on an upward path.
Under the terms of its licence BT is bound to keep price rises for its
principal services within the terms of a formula which is the rate of
inflation minus 7 1/2 per cent. These conditions were set when inflation
rates were significantly higher; a direct result is the Pounds 500m that BT
has to return to its customers. BT has been making clear that it finds the
burden irksome.
Robert Millington at BZW pointed out, however, that BT has a remarkably
strong balance sheet for an international company with about Pounds 1bn of
free cash flow.
On balance, analysts believe that private investors should hold the stock
rather than taking profits now. Chris McFadden at Smith NewCourt is bullish
about BT's prospects: 'In the long term, I am very happy with BT. It is the
ideal stock for private investors, solid and with exciting elements in its
future strategy.'
Deciding an investment strategy, however is complicated by BT's dual nature.
This is especially true for those with part-paid shares who have seen a good
return to date but must pay a further Pounds 1.40 a share on March 1 next
year.
On one hand, BT is a large competitor in one of the fast-developing markets.
It is a sound company which couples strong management with good products and
aggressive market strategies. Among the possibilities are BT branded
products in entertainment and further development in business data
communications. The purchase of MCI to provide BT's face in the US has
significant potential. All of this will absorb some of BT's cash pile but it
will also, in time, provide the next generation of profits. On the other
hand, the company is not a bank but a regulated utility. It faces stiff
competition in its principal markets while regulatory burdens show no sign
of easing.
The cautious, believing that UK equity markets have had a good run, might
think that selling is a safe option, while those bullish about the
telecommunications business could seek more exciting candidates for
investment.

<TEXT>
Credit Suisse Orient Fund is a unit trust from Credit Suisse Investment
Funds, investing in the far east excluding Japan. Initially, about 40 per

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Nikkei at lowest since March - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo's Nikkei stock market index fell to its lowest level since March,
closing at 18,590.46 on Friday, as a combination of factors hit market
confidence. The weakening economy has been a worry, and corporate
developments did not help. The failure of Muramoto Construction, the largest
company collapse since the war, contributed to the gloom.
Some of the market's weakness was blamed on last week's partial flotation of
JR East, the semi-privatised railway group. The exchange's computer trading
system was jammed by the weight of buy orders, discouraging investors, and
leading to a sharp decline in the share's price.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Housing market recovery still
fragile, says Halifax - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two largest lenders reported different house price movements for
October. Nationwide, the second largest lender recorded a rise of 1.5 per
cent compared with September, resulting in the first annual rise recorded by
the society since its house price index began in 1990. Halifax building
society, which reports figures on a seasonally adjusted basis, found no
change in October. 'House prices have now generally stopped falling, but the
fragility of the recovery in the housing market is clear from the failure of
prices to pick up more strongly,' said Halifax. However, it predicted that
house prices would end the year 2 per cent above their level at the end of
1992.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Prisoners who find freedom inside: Christian Tyler goes
behind bars to meet inmates who learn how to cope with life through art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN with the grizzled hair, a gold ring in one ear and large tattoo on
his forearm was talking about Cezanne. 'I've got to paint,' he added. 'I
don't care if no-one ever likes my paintings or looks at them. It's just
colour that excites me.' But two exhibitions of his work and the offer of a
teaching post seem to confirm the potential of this artist who first picked
up a paintbrush, almost accidentally, only six years ago. He continued, the
eyes in the gaunt face starting to brim: 'It's the only way I have found
that can express what I feel: anger, love, pity. Before, I just expressed it
by being aggressive and physical. My whole life was prison or crime.'
It is the literal truth. Steven Down, the speaker, was sitting in the
lifers' block of Norwich Prison. Now 42, he has spent more than 20 years
inside for the murder of a security guard. A few hours before speaking these
words he had been told he was to be released on November 3.
Punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation are the three legs of the penal
system. The more men put inside to satisfy the first two aims, however, (and
Britain's jails are already overfull) the less chance there is of satisfying
the third. Overcrowding stifles reform - and the lesson of Norwich Prison is
that reform does occur.
Michael Howard, the home secretary, created a judicial furore last month
with his lock-'em-up speech and promise of six privately-run jails to take
the extra customers. Inside Norwich, the good folk who run the education
service were manifestly nervous about the signals coming from Whitehall. The
Home Office seems anxious to soften the impact of Howard's declaration to
the Tory Party conference. When Howard said prison should be more austere, a
spokesman explained this week, he meant it should be more constructive. He
meant that more prisoners should work or study instead of hanging about the
landings. Nor would the recommendations of Lord Justice Woolf - the liberal
who reported on the Strangeways riot in 1990 and who led the judiciary's
counterblast - be shelved.
'People are sent to prison as punishment, not for punishment,' said Paul
Killick, the young playwright recently appointed writer-in-residence at
Norwich jail. 'People ask, what about the victims? But, as the judge said,
these prisoners are going to come out one day. The angrier they are when
they come out, the worse for everybody.'
Bridgid Everitt, the head of education, described her job as helping
prisoners make positive use of their time inside and helping them plan for
their release. Whether this can be formally described as rehabilitation is
unclear: but she claimed that literature and the arts, by stimulating
thought and self-awareness, help prisoners 'make connections' to the world
as it really is, not as they might prefer to imagine it - or hate it. To
that extent, it helped them readjust to normal society.
Norwich Prison has 600 inmates, from juvenile remand prisoners to low-risk
'lifers' and psychiatric detainees. It has had a good report from Judge
Stephen Tumim, chief inspector of prisons. Certainly the atmosphere in the
main jail strikes a visitor as uncomfortable rather than menacing. In the
main block prisoners walked freely about the landings, dropped in and out of
each others' cells, to the constant blare of pop music.
A day in jail is long enough - long enough, at least, to establish that
prisoners are entirely cynical about the system which tries (in the words
inscribed on each of the jail's buildings) 'to look after them with humanity
and to help them lead law-abiding and useful lives in custody and after
release.' Unfairly or not, even those who have found some kind of redemption
in art give themselves, not the system, the credit for it.
Leroy Cooper is a Jamaican Liverpudlian whose first arrest, in the build-up
to the Toxteth riot in 1981, has given him a certain notoriety. Wearing a
bandanna, dreadlocks and what he calls his 'Clark Kent glasses,' Cooper
swung with studied brashness into the education room on the jail's second
landing. 'They make no attempt to reform you,' he declared, 'just leave you
in a cell to rot. But you need help to deliver the fledgling person. For
many of them (the prisoners) art is just filling time, but for me it is my
life: it is an artistic, creative statement.'
Cooper produces Undercurrents, a community arts magazine in Liverpool, and
sees himself as a visionary local leader who has been branded a troublemaker
by vindictive policemen. Nine years after a jail term for assault on the
police, he is awaiting sentence for a drugs offence. 'In between I went from
a rebellious, uncaring and shallow youth to a mature man,' he said.
The rhetoric may sound artificial but Cooper's cheerful arrogance ('I have
the drive, I have the intellect') is probably his way of recovering the
self-esteem that prison destroys in every man. Stripped of his
self-identity, a man who thinks he counts for nothing is dangerous: he will
seek revenge on society when he can.
This erosion of identity is what Gary Sparkes says he fears most and what
impelled him to start writing plays and poetry. He said his aim was to
improve himself in spite of the system not because of it: he felt nothing
but contempt for the authorities. 'I never classed myself as a criminal. I
was an idiot. But the longer they leave me in jail the more likely they are
to create an anti-social individual. I came in a non-criminal. I now have a
mass of criminal knowledge.'
Self-justification is part of most prisoners' armoury. But Sparkes, a tall,
handsome, quick-witted fellow originally from Romford in Essex, says he was
never unemployed and never engaged in crime. He had a wife, a house near
Haverhill with a Pounds 47,000 mortgage and a job with an estate agent.
After he was made redundant, everything went wrong. He worked as a
rough-neck in the Scottish oil industry but could not find permanent work,
fell into arrears on the mortgage while the house itself lost value.
Desperate for money, he borrowed Pounds 500 to finance a 'dope deal' and
lost that, too.
So he held up two post offices with a replica pistol. He pleaded guilty to
the offence and says now he genuinely feels bad about what he did. 'There
was a girl in there (the post office), very pretty, Asian about
five-foot-two, the same as my wife. But I did this to her.' He has lost his
home, his friends and his wife. For him, he said, the punishment is already
complete.
While he was in jail his wife sent him Oscar Wilde's Picture of Dorian Gray,
attaching a note which said: 'Don't take offence'. Sparkes, who until then
was more of a Stephen King reader, felt 'nothing but sympathy' with Wilde's
hero.
Awaiting sentence, he has embarked on a campaign of what he calls
self-preservation, forcing himself to treat the prison as a hall of
residence in which the food and lodging happen to be free and in which he
can find subjects for literary reflection. 'You see everything in this
place: closet queens, men desperately in love with their wives, some
incredibly thick, some extremely intelligent. It's an interesting place to
live. From the personal point of view this place has been good for me.'
But it is a slippery path between optimism and despair. 'You become horribly
cynical,' he said. 'I can see so easily how this could be the lot for me.
Freedom has got nothing to do with bars, anyway. I am not silly enough to
think the pot of gold is beyond that gate. If I can manage to hold out for
the duration of my sentence I am going to be able to lead a life
afterwards.'
Terry Shepherd is another who finds writing a solace but not an escape.
'People say it's just a distraction. I don't think that's right. You have to
be very aware of what's going on around you - and the people who do write
are more aware of what prison is than those who don't. People with no
interest in the arts are just living day-to-day, scrounging, smoking dope,
almost like an animal life. At the end of the sentence you go out, and what
has prison done?'
Shepherd trained as a chef, was introduced to Shelley by a schoolteacher and
thinks English poetry died with Sylvia Plath. He is a a self-confessed
loner, an introvert who speaks almost inaudibly. When drunk he becomes, as
he put it, 'very extrovert.' He means aggressive. He has previously served
nearly seven years in Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, for grievous bodily harm and
is now remanded on a charge of using or threatening violence. (In both
instances, he maintains, he acted in self-defence).
Poetry, he declared with undeliberate rhetoric, was about 'removing the
debris of the mind and getting down to basics. I could not do prison without
art. If they
took away my pens and paper I'd go barmy. I really would.'
It may not be surprising - though it is illuminating - to hear the
shorter-term prisoners discuss their artistic impulses. But how many men can
survive a life sentence without succumbing to the brutish culture of the
nick which regards emotional sensitivity as a contemptible or homosexual
weakness, and self-improvement as a sell-out to the 'system'?
The lifers' prison at Norwich is a low-category block which looks more like
a hostel than a place of detention. It stands in a small landscaped park,
surrounded by a high white fence, and there are no bars on the big sash
windows. Most of the inmates live in partitioned dormitories; the lucky ones
share a large, scruffy bed-sit.
To sit in such a place with three convicted murderers and feel at ease while
they talk about their 'raison d'etre' is a strange sensation. Lee Squires is
a former martial arts instructor who has done 11 years of a recommended
20-year sentence for killing a sub postmaster with a crowbar during a
robbery. He took up acting in Wormwood Scrubs and is also a sculptor whose
tortured plaster-and-acrylic figures would look at home in any contemporary
gallery.
Squires described how he had ignored the threats of other prisoners to break
the taboo which requires inmates to hide their weakness from each another
and their anger from the authorities.
After his crime, he said, the knowledge that he had taken another man's life
gave him several years of emotional distress and violent mood-swings. He
emerged, he claimed, a quite different man. 'I am more honest, expressive,
truthful. I am more articulate and understanding about relationships.'
Contrition did not reduce a man's sentence, however.
He maintains that even those who have been right through the penal system
from their youth can discover another self. 'There are some very evil,
disturbed, dangerous people,' he conceded. 'But they are in a minority.'
If ever there were an untypical-looking lifer, it is Joe White, the
energetic and articulate actor-manager with whom Lee Squires works. White
has put on 13 plays in four prisons culminating in a convict performance of
Dorfman's celebrated Death and the Maiden at the Tricycle Theatre in
Kilburn, London.
Looking himself every inch an actor, White maintains that drama can work
strange transformations: he described the scarred convict from the Gorbals
who never came out from behind his dark glasses until he went on stage, the
dour West Indian whose inaudible voice was released, the introvert lifer
whose family scarcely recognised him. Prison drama also attracted hatred:
one disturbed inmate, refused a part in For King and Country, drew a knife
and threatened to 'take out' a member of the cast to make room for himself.
By a prison convention, White is classed by colleagues as one of the
'non-criminals': he killed a friend with a shotgun while under the influence
of the drug LSD during a period of drop-out depression.
'We agree our offences warranted punishment in prison,' he said. 'And it's
fair to say that victims were not helped for years until counselling. But we
are still part of society. People have to understand why they have done what
they have done. By creatively grappling with the experience of prison you
can maintain a strong sense of self. We are outcasts but art enables people
to look at you as a human being.
'Outside they say we are having fun in prison. But this is the only thing
that has a significant rehabilitational effect. I have become more the
person I should have been.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / The Long View: Mutual admiration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU sure you really want to deposit so much money with us? my bank
somewhat surprisingly asked me this week. Or, to quote more precisely: 'If
you have more money in your account than you need, you could be paying a
high price for accessibility.'
The advice, needless to say, was not entirely disinterested but was the
lead-in to an offer of some kind of guaranteed stock market bond. Such
mailshots reflect the growing anxieties of deposit-taking institutions at a
time when their so-called high interest accounts are becoming vulnerable to
actions under the Trade Descriptions Act, and the money markets are
discounting at least a further half-point cut in sterling short-term
interest rates.
The flipside of this anxiety is the optimism of some of the longer-term
savings institutions, which I certainly noticed at the annual dinner of
Autif, the unit trust trade association, on Wednesday. British unit trusts
have booked net sales of Pounds 6.9bn in the first nine months of 1993,
already beating the previous 1987 annual record of Pounds 6.3bn (although
the 1993 total will have to reach almost Pounds 9bn to exceed the 1987
figure in real terms).
In any case you can argue that this is all rather small beer, and certainly
British unit trust companies are gazing with wonder across the Atlantic at
the extraordinary growth of their US equivalents, mutual funds. These have
set an example of vastly greater penetration of the savings market. One US
group alone, Fidelity, has close to Dollars 200bn in its stock and bond
funds, making it comfortably bigger on its own than the entire British unit
trust industry.
Over the past few years the shifts in the US savings market have been
enormous. In 1980 bank deposits and certificates of deposit accounted for 48
per cent of household financial assets, but that has now dropped to about 35
per cent, according to Jeffrey Schaefer of the Securities Industry
Association. There has been a switch into mutual funds, which are up from 2
to 13 per cent over the period, and also into tax-efficient municipal bonds.
The interesting thing is that although there is a strong tradition of direct
ownership of equities in the US (about 45 per cent of US equities are still
held by private individuals) the recent shift has been towards mutual funds.
Clearly these have been successfully marketed as providing an easy way of
holding stocks and bonds, and a natural alternative to deposit-based savings
as interest rates have tumbled. In fact the banks themselves are now selling
nearly 20 per cent of US mutual funds.
For a couple of years the flood of money into mutual funds was mopped up by
huge domestic new issue volumes but this year large amounts have been
spilling into international markets. For some fund groups, half the net
inflow is now into their specialist foreign funds.
Overall, American investors (of all kinds) bought Dollars 21.7bn of foreign
equities during the first half of the year, including almost Dollars 4bn
into so-called emerging markets, many of which not surprisingly have been
going crazy, with indices in Brazil, the Philippines and Indonesia all up by
two-thirds or more so far in 1993 in dollar terms. The impact of the mutual
funds has been reinforced by an urge by US pension funds for geographical
diversification.
In the UK the pressures on the savings market are less intense than in the
US, because interest rates are not yet so low, but building society savings
deposits have been growing only slowly this year. The role of unit trusts is
still comparatively small: Autif gives the value of funds under management
as Pounds 84bn, but official statistics suggest that only about half are
owned directly by individuals (the rest being in pension funds and life
assurance portfolios). For comparison, savers have Pounds 250bn in
interest-bearing deposit accounts. Still, the unit trust figure is growing
quite fast, and the latest statistics suggest that the personal sector has
also slowed down (and perhaps reversed) its regular net selling of
directly-owned equities, which are worth about Pounds 160bn.
The really big opportunity for savings institutions in the UK, however, may
not be in equity-based products but in income funds based upon bonds. This
change in emphasis has already happened in the US mutual funds industry,
where bond funds at Dollars 725bn are bigger in total than equity funds at
Dollars 620bn. In the UK bond and mixed funds account for only about 5 per
cent of the unit trust aggregate, a figure that should rise substantially as
investors progressively switch out of deposit accounts (although the banks
and building societies, as I found in my junk mail this week, are devising
defensive strategies).
Quite possibly the prospect of the disruption of the retail deposit base of
banks and building societies is one reason why the Bank of England is so
cautious about further falls in sterling interest rates. The problem about
the expansion of mutual funds as a savings medium is that they can be so
volatile (in 1988, flows into US equity mutual funds were negative).
Moreover, small investors can easily panic in a crisis, and mutual funds
promise them almost instant liquidity. What happens if the punters in Boise
and Baltimore want their money out of Indonesia straightaway? There can be
panic withdrawals from deposit-taking institutions too, but the regulators
believe they know how to handle those. After this week's stock market upsets
the nerves of mutual fund investors, and perhaps those of regulators too,
are being tested.
In the long run, securities-based investments, like unit trusts, offer a
higher return than deposits, but savers need a different approach. It is
better to accept a low interest rate than suffer a capital loss. Although
various kinds of guaranteed products exist, they usually involve locking
your money away for a period such as five years. Accessibility may be
increasingly costly, but when the Footsie Index can dive 60 points in a day
it can be a price worth paying.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Rabbit phone network shut with Pounds 100m loss

<TEXT>
RABBIT, the UK telepoint mobile phone service developed by Hutchison
Whampoa, was killed off yesterday with losses of more than Pounds 100m.
Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, said it was closing Rabbit and
selling Mobile Data, a two-way data service aimed at business users, as part
of extensive restructuring of its UK telecommunications operations. It
planned to take an extraordinary loss of HKDollars 1.42bn (Pounds 122m) in
its 1993 accounts.
Mr Hans Snook, group managing director for the UK telecommunications
operations, said the extraordinary loss represented Rabbit's start-up costs,
capital costs, operating losses and provisions.
The decision to close Rabbit will lead to losses for British Aerospace and
Barclays Bank, which own 30 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of
Hutchison's UK telecommunications business. Neither company would quantify
its loss yesterday.
Rabbit's digital (computer-based) technology requires customers to use
handsets close to a fixed base station. The national network of 12,000
stations, mainly in conurbations and near motorways, will be wound up as a
result of the closure decision.
Mr Snook said Rabbit had been a technological success which was liked by its
9,000 users but more subscribers had been needed to make it a viable
business. By contrast, in Hong Kong where Hutchison also offers the service,
some 70,000 subscribers had been attracted in only 18 months. All current
Rabbit subscribers will be offered a cash refund for the handsets which cost
Pounds 99 or an option to upgrade to two-way portable telephones.
Hutchison said the loss would be offset by an extraordinary gain made by the
group earlier this year. It said ordinary profits for the year ending
December 31 would not be affected.
Analysts said the announcement clarified the company's position in the UK.
Some said they would upgrade their 1994 forecasts because expected losses on
the UK business caused by Rabbit's operations would not now be realised.
Mr Canning Fok, Hutchison managing director, said the company would invest
about Pounds 345m over the next three or four years in a personal
communications network in the UK. The UK company expects losses in the
coming three years but Mr Fok said: 'These losses should be seen as a
strategic investment.'

<TEXT>
TOP-LEVEL talks between the German government and opposition yesterday
cleared the way for the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned
telecommunications monopoly.
Deutsche Telekom said it would now prepare for the sale of a first tranche
of shares, estimated at DM10bn-DM15bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 6bn) in 1996. The
amount is consistent with an earlier government plan to sell 25 per cent of
the company's equity in the first tranche, and a second similar tranche in
1998.
The cross-party deal follows two years of difficult talks between the
government and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), to secure the
amendment of the constitution necessary for Germany's largest privatisation.
The bill is likely to go before parliament within two months.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German post and telecommunications minister, said
the government and SPD had agreed to turn all three arms of the postal
service - Telekom, the mail service Postdienst and the savings bank Postbank
 -into private companies by 1995.
The government will retain a majority ownership in Deutsche Telekom until
1998, when the European Community will begin liberalising telecoms
monopolies in Europe.
Bonn had to concede to the opposition that a significant portion of the
proceeds from the privatisation would go to pension funds for the 700,000
employees in Deutsche Telekom and the lossmaking postal bank and mail
service. The government originally pledged all proceeds from the
privatisation would be re-invested in Deutsche Telekom.
'We could not have accepted a privatisation plan which had not given
provisions for pensions costs for all three companies,' Mr Hans-Gottfried
Bernrath, SPD negotiator, said yesterday.
Mr Bernrath said the pensions requirements for the three companies could be
as high as DM100bn. Deutsche Telekom's pension costs stand at DM3.5bn a year
for the next five years.
The sell-off agreement also envisages an independent regulatory agency, and
a holding company which will own the state shares of Deutsche Telekom, the
post service and postal bank, but will not have direct control over daily
operations. The government approved these arrangements to satisfy SPD
demands for some state supervision over the privatised companies.
But the agreement gives the company the right to veto the holding company's
decisions. Deutsche Telekom expressed relief that the holding company would
not seriously hamper its future operations.

FT  06 NOV 93 / British Steel to raise price of strip mill output: Fourth
increase in under a year will hit small users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is to raise by up to 5 per cent list prices for strip mill
products, used in everything from car bodies to building cladding.
The increases, which take effect on January 2, will tighten the squeeze on
margins faced by small and medium-sized users of steel in the UK.
They were announced at the end of a week during which Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, urged businesses to help curb inflation by
generating higher profits through increased output and capacity use, rather
than higher prices.
The rises will be British Steel's fourth in less than a year, including a
rebate reduction in October, and mean that prices for some products will
have risen by 20 to 25 per cent if the latest increases are fully
implemented.
But British Steel said last night that, even with January's increase, prices
will not fully have recouped the 'disastrous' 30 per cent decline from 1990
to the end of last year. It said it could not rule out more rises in 1994.
British Steel's share price rose 1p yesterday to 126 1/2 p in a sharply
falling market. Mr Peter Fish, managing director of Meps Europe, the
Sheffield-based steel consultancy, said he was surprised by the size of the
rises. 'It will be difficult to obtain such a big rise in one quarter,' he
said, 'and if British Steel does press hard for the rise, it would only
succeed in sucking in imports.'
Demand is rising slowly in the UK market, which would become more attractive
to continental producers, whose own markets are still falling.
British Steel is raising its basic list prices from Pounds 310 a ton to
Pounds 324 for hot-rolled coil, from Pounds 385 to Pounds 400 for
cold-rolled, from Pounds 445 to Pounds 469 for hot-dipped metallic coated
steel and from Pounds 400 to Pounds 418 for electrozinc-coated (galvanised)
steel.
Market prices paid by stockists and steel users are much lower than these
current figures, meaning that the effective increases could be as much as 7
per cent.
The rises are likely to hit smaller stockists and users hardest because they
do not have six-monthly or annual contracts with British Steel.
In contrast, big users such as automotive and packaging companies take
contracted tonnages, and many would not have had to accept the earlier price
rises this year. One City analyst said it would be difficult to imagine them
accepting anything but a small increase.
Strip mill products accounted for Pounds 1.7bn of British Steel's Pounds
4.3bn turnover in the year ended April 3. The company has argued that
restoring remunerative prices, with the drive to cut costs, is critical if
it is to remain an efficient and competitive producer.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Reform of insolvency law is sought to stem business failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Chambers of Commerce is to call for a reform of insolvency law
after an unexpected rise in business failures in the third quarter of the
year.
It wants to consider the pressures exerted by the Inland Revenue and Customs
&amp; Excise on companies and to examine the potential conflicts of interest
when accountants hired by banks to investigate companies are then appointed
receivers.
Seasonally-adjusted figures published by the chambers show 5,276 company
failures in the three months to September 30, 2 per cent more than in
April-June. They were down by 21 per cent on the same period last year.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general, said: 'This is worrying and
should give a warning to the government on the way they treat business. It
rather casts doubts on the pace of economic recovery.'
Without seasonal adjustments, the number of corporate insolvencies fell from
5,318 to 4,356 between the second and third quarters, bringing the total for
the first nine months to 15,909, against 17,952 in the same period of 1992.
Mr Brown said the chambers had established a working party on insolvency
which was due to report to its council on December 9 in advance of a
submission to the government. It will consider measures including reforms to
the procedures for obtaining company voluntary arrangements under insolvency
law and improved funding for the government's insolvency service.
It was concerned at the influence on failures of demands to pay value added
tax and corporation tax and pressure from the banks and other secured
creditors. 'They may be acting a bit too quickly to get their money back,'
Mr Brown said.
The group will also discuss how to encourage company directors to seek
outside professional financial help before it became too late to save their
businesses.
The British Chambers of Commerce figures, based on filings with the
government insolvency service and Companies House, showed there were 56
administrators appointed and 80 company voluntary arrangements in the first
nine months of the year, against 105 and 64 respectively in the same period
last year.
The seasonally-adjusted number of individual insolvencies rose by 6 per cent
to 9,170 between the second and third quarters, but was down by 2 per cent
on the same period last year.
Separate figures released yesterday by the Lord Chancellor's office showed
an 8 per cent decline in the number of company winding-up petitions to 3,661
between the second and third quarters. That brought the total for the year
to 12,213, against 13,581 for the same period last year.
Insolvency figures leave vital questions unanswered, Page 6

FT  06 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Index-linked gilts took on some water yesterday, but they still look
something of a haven in the latest bond market storm. That may seem curious
given the muted inflationary expectations in this week's Bank of England
inflation report. But since index-linked offer automatic protection against
inflation, the trading appeal relates to the trend of real interest rates.
Whatever happens to the US bond markets, weak economic conditions in Europe
may see lower real rates on this side of the Atlantic. That would help
index-linked gilts.
Besides, index-linked have a certain attraction relative to equities, which
also constitute an inflation hedge. The yield on the FT-A All-share index is
now only around 50 basis points more than index-linked. That may entice some
equity investors to switch into index-linked. It should be consolation for
the really nervous, though, that the relationship looks much less bad for
equities than it did in 1987. Then shares actually yielded a full percentage
point less than index-linked.
These short-term factors might have made index-linked even more attractive
were it not for continuing worries about liquidity. The market still lacks
trading depth: once committed, investors may need to look to the long-term.
That is why increased issuance by the Bank of England is food for thought.
Index-linked paper is cheap finance for an institution which believes it can
conquer inflation. Long-term holders are betting against the new governor's
chances of success.

FT  06 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Active Value Fund's restructuring proposals for Greycoat are very
similar to those made by Postel. The crucial difference is that the offer
acknowledges the crude balance of power among investors, sweetening the
terms for those who blocked the previous proposal and inflicting more pain
on those who have no choice. Preference shareholders and bondholders
naturally do better. But the deal is less generous to ordinary shareholders.
Yet with Greycoat's zero coupon bondholders having served a default notice,
receivership does loom on the horizon if the restructuring fails. Ordinary
shareholders would then be buried at the bottom of the heap.
Assuming the restructuring goes ahead, Greycoat will emerge as a highly
geared company with a few attractive trophy properties and reasonable scope
for rental growth in the rest of its portfolio. Given the current hunger of
institutional investors for property shares, there could be an active market
in the nil paid rights. Greycoat has already started muttering ambitiously
about recommencing speculative developments by 1995. Incredible though that
would have sounded a year ago, it does not seem so far-fetched today. It
would take remarkable forgiveness - or a particularly forgetful memory - to
back Greycoat's incumbent management in that game again. Still, that is a
worry for another day.

FT  06 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Hutchison/Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That Hutchison has decided to wring Rabbit's neck can hardly be a shock.
About the only surprise is the fact that the lame beast has been allowed to
hop along for so long. More significant is Hutchison's announcement that it
is to continue investing in its mobile telephone network, to rival Mercury's
One-2-One. At present the two digital networks cover complementary
geographical areas, One-2-One operating in London, Hutchison to be launched
in provincial cities next year.
That has led to speculation that the two networks might be merged. While it
is possible that Hutchison's declaration of an accelerated building
programme is only a negotiating tactic, its past record suggests that it is
not bluffing. If Hutchison is determined, One-2-One will have to respond
with a faster roll-out too. Both will have to find cash earlier to fund the
capital investment required.
More probable than an outright merger is the prospect that the two networks
may co-operate so that customers from one system can use the other in the
initial phases of development. That would encourage more customers into both
networks and improve cash flow. Mercury, however, is the stronger and has to
balance that advantage against conferring the power of its brand name on its
competitor. Vodafone and Cellnet, meanwhile, can expect more pressure on
margins as perceptions that their systems are expensive rise. But given the
rate at which the market is growing, that may not worry them unduly.

FT  06 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Bonds shaken and stirred
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little doubt that it was the drop in US bond prices which sent
yesterday's shiver around world equity and bond markets. Much harder to
assess is whether this is a genuine turning point or simply a correction
after the strong gains of recent months. In theory there is no reason to get
particularly alarmed. Inflation is hardly rampant, even in the US. Economic
conditions throughout the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development are so weak that it is difficult to imagine any country actually
raising short term rates. That points more to a correction in the US bond
market which had previously overshot rather than to a sustained fall. If so,
other markets should soon regain their poise.
Yet complex psychological factors are at work. The main force driving equity
and bond prices higher has been US investors moving out of cash in search of
better returns. Even the relatively modest climb in US bond yields will have
brought some of those investors a capital loss. Now they have a further
reminder that markets can go down as well as up. When that thought
dominates, cash becomes attractive again.
With an element of fear back in the equation, it looks unlikely that US
investors will stray abroad in such large numbers again. At the very least
that should dampen world market recovery hopes. Luckily the UK had already
decided not to hold a gilt auction this month, which means it will not be
putting foreign investors to too much of a test. But a vicious downward
spiral could develop on a broader basis if prices erode and more money is
pulled out of shares and bonds. That risk would be aggravated if the Gatt
round collapses, posing an additional threat to economic growth.

FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Jobs data helps Dow overcome
early falls
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH further declines in bond prices continued to trouble US stock
markets yesterday, share prices staged an impressive recovery from early
losses to end mostly higher at the final bell, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.45 at 3,643.43. The
more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 2.08 higher at 459.57, while
the Amex composite finished down 2.20 at 475.33, and the Nasdaq composite up
5.72 at 762.98. Trading volume on the NYSE was 333m shares.
Share prices gyrated wildly throughout the day as the stock markets were
buffeted by rising bond yields and program trading. The latest sell-off in
the bond market - which eventually pushed the benchmark 30-year bond down
half a point and the yield up to 6.2 per cent - was sparked by the news that
non-farm payrolls rose 177,000 in October.
The long-awaited jobs data proved more bullish than the bond market had
expected, particularly the strength in some of the non-headline statistics,
such as manufacturing jobs and working hours. Although this was good news
for stocks, equity investors were at first unsettled by the continuing rise
in long-term interest rates. Consequently, stocks struggled to break out of
early losses. At one point, the Dow was down 25 points at 3,600 and the
Nasdaq composite down 9 points at 748.37, with dealers blaming some of the
decline on reports that North Korea had massed troops on its border with
South Korea in preparation for a possible military attack on its neighbour.
Later in the day, however, the market began to draw strength from the jobs
data, and as bonds came off their lows and the Korean fears receded, prices
ended the session sharply higher amid a flurry of late buying. Banks rallied
strongly from recent weakness. Citicorp firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36
1/2 , Chase Manhattan added Dollars 1 at Dollars 32 3/8 , JP Morgan firmed
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Chemical put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 38
7/8 and BankAmerica added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41 7/8 .
Similarly, many of the leading stocks, which suffered in Wednesday and
Thursday's sell-off, also recovered. McDonald's rose Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 55 3/4 , AT&amp;T added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 56 and Motorola put on
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 98 7/8 .
Home Shopping Network rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 and QVC Network
fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 after the two companies said that they
had decided to abandon their planned merger. QVC is currently embroiled with
Viacom in a fight to take over Paramount Communications.
On the Nasdaq market, leading Nasdaq technology stocks, which have fallen
sharply in recent days, rebounded. Microsoft added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars
78 3/4 and Intel put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 60 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks fell from the opening to hit their lowest level in the late
morning, before recovering to close with just a small loss.
The TSE-300 composite index closed down 11.70 points, or 0.28 per cent, at
4202.03, for a loss on the week of about 53.5 points. The index hit its low
point of 4,160 at about 11 am EST. Final turnover was CDollars 797.4m.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, although there were few noteworthy
declines.

FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Brussels mulls bias towards cyclical
stocks - Analysts are cautious about recent strength in industrial equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium did not escape the turmoil on world stock markets yesterday. The
Bel-20 index of the largest and most heavily traded stocks on the Brussels
bourse closed at 1372.21, down 19.78 from Thursday's record high of 1391.99.
But yesterday's correction aside, this seems to have been a comparatively
good year for Belgian equities. The value of the Belgian stock market
increased by 24 per cent between the beginning of the year and the end of
last month. Records have been consistently broken, volume has risen by about
45 per cent and a new campaigning president, Mr Henri Servais, has taken
over at the head of the bourse.
The problem is that Brussels - hampered in the past by illiquidity, and a
bias towards cyclical stocks - still lags behind its European rivals. Most
European markets, with Britain and France notable exceptions, rose by more
than 30 per cent in the first 10 months of the year.
The background to the last three months of trading on the exchange has
certainly been turbulent. Changes to the ERM after the August crisis allowed
the Belgian franc to fluctuate much more widely against the D-Mark than
under the old, discredited ERM constraints. But the Belgian National Bank
has continued to shadow the D-Mark, keeping interest rates relatively high.
That, according to analysts, has put a damper on Belgian stock prices while
other markets have forged ahead.
Hopes of a cut in interest rates are now pinned on the government's pledge
to push through a series of measures aimed at improving Belgian industry's
competitiveness, cutting labour costs and reducing the country's social
security and budget deficit. The original aim of a 'social pact' between
government, unions and employers has already been dashed by the powerful
socialist unions, which walked out of the talks. The centre-left coalition
is trying this weekend to thrash out a plan on its own. If it succeeds, this
should at least 'create a more stable environment for interest rates to
fall', as one stock market analyst put it last week.
The question is whether Belgian stock prices already take account of
anticipated falls in interest rates. Looking at the best performers over the
last year, it seems that they do. Whereas 1991-92 saw investors looking for
defensive stocks such as the country's big banks, the last 12 months have
seen a surge of interest in the cyclical stocks.
The beneficiaries have been companies like Arbed, the Luxembourg steel
producer which plunged into loss in the first half of this year; Bekaert,
the steel cord and wire company, which has undergone substantial
restructuring over the last two years; and Societe Generale de Belgique, the
holding company which has been trying to reduce its exposure to cyclical
industry.
By contrast, the worst performers over the last 12 months include the big
retailers, GIB Group and Delhaize Le Lion. These essentially defensive
stocks enjoyed a sunny first quarter in 1992, but since then a fierce price
war in Belgium and problems at Delhaize's US arm have dragged down the
prices.
One consolation is that the turmoil on Belgian currency and bond markets
seems to have persuaded some foreign investors to take a closer look at the
bourse. Under Mr Servais, Brussels has also continued to promote itself by
encouraging new derivative products, including warrants, and introducing
'Belix' - a basket of Bel-20 stocks which corresponds to the weighting of
the index itself - for institutional investors.
Belgian analysts are cautious about the cyclical rally of recent months.
They agree that the Belgian economy probably touched bottom during the
summer; but as Mr Guy Lerminiaux of the Brussels broker Petercam says, 'the
recovery will be very very gradual, and we feel that there's already too
much anticipation in the industrial companies'.

FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dealers, investors calm after
downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DAYS of weakness in the US equity and bond markets, a bad week for Japan
and a wobbly start to Friday on Wall Street left bourses more deeply
inclined on the downgrade yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, both at dealing and at institutional investment level, there was a
view that this week's declines have been a healthy correction after gains of
more than 30 per cent in continental equities this year.
FRANKFURT fell 2.4 per cent for a loss of 2.8 per cent on the week, the DAX
index closing 50.05 lower at 2,012.56 after breaking through 2,100 at one
stage last Wednesday.
Turnover rose from DM8bn to DM8.5bn. Ms Karin Pelzer, on the trading desk at
Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that the bank was not running for cover:
the day started with profit-taking, she said, moved lower as traders sold
positions and carried on into a post-bourse discussion of when the time
would be ripe to buy back into the market.
The downturn was general, one exception being the department stores group,
Karstadt, up DM5 to DM597 on merger discussions with its competitor, Hertie.
PARIS weakened steadily after the opening of Wall Street and the CAC-40
index finished off 54.96 at 2,081.01, down 4.6 per cent on the week.
Mr Christopher de Mattos of Hoare Govett in Paris commented that, apart from
the impact of the fall in the US, a number of domestic factors were
pressuring stocks. Moving to an underweight position on France, he explained
that its adherence to high interest rates was putting a brake on investment
spending, while indications of a revision downwards in GDP growth next year
would see company earnings estimates for 1994 being cut back.
A deterioration in the industrial background, following the government's
climbdown on cost-cutting measures proposed for Air France, added to the
difficulties, he said.
AMSTERDAM declined by some 2.2 per cent with only Hoogovens among the major
issues resisting the negative trend. The CBS Tendency index closed off 3.1
at 136.4, a week's fall of almost 1 per cent.
Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium manufacturer, added Fl 2.10 to Fl 48.20
after reporting that it expected its steel division to return to profit by
the second half of 1993. The group also reported that it is considering a Fl
300m share issue.
Among big fallers on the day were Unilever, down Fl 4.70 to Fl 210.20,
Heineken, off Fl 3.60 to Fl 197.70 and Akzo, down Fl 2.30 to Fl 197.20.
ZURICH was pressured by profit-taking and derivatives-related trade as
investors sold underlying stocks and bought futures or options. The SMI
index fell 52.4 to 2,654.2, after 2,625.2, for a weekly decline of 3.6 per
cent.
Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that the market had
risen by more than 16 per cent since mid-September, commenting that the
declines over the last two days had been 'a sound correction and a warning
to those who think that you can make extraordinary profits for ever'. He
expected, however, that after some further weakness on Monday, prices would
resume their advance, propelled by a continuing high level of liquidity in
the market.
Banks and insurers were among the biggest losers with UBS shedding SFr22 to
SFr1,286, SBC SFr10 at SFr489 and CS Holding SFr55 at SFr3,380.
MILAN fell 2.2 per cent, analysts suggesting that this was a reflection on
the general markets malaise. The Comit index shed 12.23 to 555.46, down 4.8
per cent on the week.
Telecoms were under pressure in heavy volume: foreigners have large holdings
and they are an easy target when investors want to reduce their exposure in
Italy. Stet shed L143 to L3,859 and Sip was L150 lower at L3,268.
Banks were lower after the chairman of the Italian Banking Association
warned that the sector was likely to turn in a weaker second half. BCI fell
L110 to L4,190 and Credito Italiano L24 to L2,191.
MADRID continued to wake up with the onset of bad news, turnover rising from
Pta31.4bn to Pta39bn, after Pta20.7bn on Wednesday, as the general index
fell 6.46, or 2.2 per cent to 300.04 for a 2.6 per cent decline on the week.
In banks, rumours that the restructuring of Banesto might have encountered a
problem left the shares Pta100 lower at Pta2,590. But selling hit
construction stocks the hardest, FCC falling Pta540 to Pta13,500, Cubiertas
Pta280 to Pta8,450 and Huarte Pta80 to Pta1,340.

FT  06 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines 1.9% and
leads rest of region lower

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE selling and margin liquidation depressed share prices and the
Nikkei 225 lost 1.9 per cent, falling for the fourth consecutive trading
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index dropped 359.33 to 18,590.46, losing 5.6 per cent on the week,
having opened at the day's high of 18,941.69, and plunged to a low of
18,470.35 in early trading.
Afternoon buying by institutional investors lifted the Nikkei briefly, but
late afternoon arbitrage unwinding pushed share prices lower.
Volume swelled to 430m shares on active selling, up from Thursday's 252m.
Losers outnumbered gainers by 938 to 114 with 100 unchanged, the Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 23.23, or 1.4 per cent to 1,580.85 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.04 to 1265.11.
The absence of public fund support discouraged investors. Comments by Mr
Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, indicating the government's reluctance
to take immediate action to support the stock market, also added to the
pessimism. East Japan Railway met continued profit taking, declining Y7,000
to Y485,000, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y19,000 to
Y810,000.
Margin-linked selling depressed Keisei Electric Railway Y24 to Y868.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, which also met margin unwinding selling in the
morning session, found support in the afternoon, closing up Y5 to Y808.
Banks were lower on index-linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10
to Y3,320 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y50 to Y2,320. Some consumer electronics
companies were higher on bargain hunting. Sony rose Y20 to Y4,950 and
Pioneer Electronic by Y50 to Y2,770.
In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 438.40 to 20,801.29 in volume of 23.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE region reacted nervously to the falls in Toyko and the US. Mr Jonathan
Compton, divisional director at Credit Lyonnais Asia in London, commented
that the markets had not required much of an excuse to correct from high
levels, finding this in the rise of US long bond rates and the Nikkei's fall
through the 19,000 level.
HONG KONG fell 2.3 per cent, taking the Hang Seng Index marginally below the
9,000 level, though late bargain hunting helped it to recover some of its
early losses.
The index tumbled 207.95 to 8,996.93, after an intraday low of 8,834.69, for
a three-day decline of 640 points and a 3.6 per cent fall over the week.
The weakness was attributed to lingering profit-taking by US and European
institutions which led the bourse's recent record-breaking rally. However,
analysts noted that shrinking turnover indicated that market was not
undergoing a full-scale sell-off. Preliminary turnover dwindled to HKDollars
6.76bn from Thursday's HKDollars 7.39bn.
SINGAPORE gave up 2.6 per cent with trading limits imposed on retail clients
by some brokerages putting an additional restraint on activity. The Straits
Times Industrials index fell 55.13 to 2,068.72, a 1.6 per cent fall on the
week. Singapore Telecom rose 2 cents to SDollars 3.86 on institutional
buying.
KUALA LUMPUR took its cue from weaker overseas markets and the composite
index closed down 32.12 or 3.3 per cent at 944.94, for a 2.8 per cent
decline on the week.
MANILA fell sharply for the second day in succession as PLDT lost another
Dollars 1.37 to Dollars 61.62 in overnight New York trading, and then 30
pesos to 1,825 pesos. The composite index retreated 35.42 to 2,411.32, up
1.6 per cent over the week. TAIWAN's profit-taking continued especially in
speculative stocks. The weighted index, having opened up 41 points, ended
down 14.55 at 4,246.01 in turnover of TDollars 40.8bn, a week's rise of 3.9
per cent.
AUSTRALIA remained weak and the All Ordinaries index shed 21.7 to 2,079.9 in
turnover of ADollars 471.8m. The index has lost 1.6 per cent over the week.
Turnover was ADollars 471.8m.
Foster's Brewing was the heaviest traded stock in volume of 6.5m shares, the
shares losing 5 cents to ADollars 1.51.
SEOUL was one of the few markets in the region to show a rise on the day.
The composite index added 6.75 to 773.30, a week's gain of 4 per cent, in
turnover of Won1,000bn.
NEW ZEALAND recovered some ground in late trading and the NZSE-40 index
finished off 10.98 at 2,175.21.
BOMBAY advanced in speculative after-hours trading in a continuation of the
trend which built up in the last few minutes of the official session. The
BSE index added 29.65 to 2,664.72.

FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 index plunges 2 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE warning signals emanating from all of the world's major stock markets on
Thursday gathered momentum yesterday and triggered the biggest single-day
fall in UK share prices for more than a year.
Big international institutions moved to sell as they fretted over the
possibility of a rise in US interest rates. Such a scenario could lead to a
substantial repatriation of US funds, according to dealers. Cash from the US
is widely acknowledged as having been the driving force behind most European
markets this year.
After falling almost 37 Dow Jones points on Thursday, as the US bond market
tumbled afresh, the US equity market came under renewed selling pressure at
the opening yesterday before staging a strong rally and moving close to
positive territory as London closed.
The FT-SE 100 share index ended a frantic trading session a net 63.4 lower
at 3,085.6 - the heaviest fall in a single trading session since October 5
last year, when the London market was still affected by the UK's withdrawal
from the exchange rate mechanism. Over the week the FT-SE 100 has fallen
85.4. The market has come under increasing pressure all week, with
yesterday's 2 per cent fall leaving the 100-index a net 2.6 per cent lower.
The speed of the market's decline caught out many market dealers, with the
second-liners lagging the leaders and the FT-SE Mid 250 index, down 40.3
yesterday, down 68 points, or 1.9 per cent on the week.
Gilt edged stocks ran into sustained bouts of selling and posted losses in
excess of a point, before edging off the bottom.
Turnover in equities, still running at high levels during the week despite
the general uncertainty surrounding the market, increased yesterday to
773.3m with the FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for turnover of almost 360m
shares, well above the usual split between FT-SE 100 and other stocks and
indicating a high level of inter-marketmaker activity. The value of customer
business in the market on Thursday reached a heavy Pounds 1.73bn.
The view of senior dealers around London trading desks was that the market
had undergone an entirely justified correction, which reflected a similar
move on Wall Street and was replicated by moves on French and German
markets.
Most emphasised, however, that the level of selling pressure in UK equities
by UK institutions had been small.

FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness sold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International drinks group Guinness was one of the worst performing FT-SE
stock yesterday as the market digested a mixed trading statement and
analysts reported back from an overseas meeting with the company management.
There was a variety of opinions entertained in the market as the detail of
the early morning statement met the conclusions of analysts and fund
managers telephoning from the two-day presentation in Athens. 'There's
something for the bears and the bulls,' commented one dealer. 'And today the
market wants to hear the downside.'
Guinness shares had rallied in recent sessions as the depression caused by
September's results and anxiety over the group's relations with LVMH were
considered overdone. But yesterday's statement, in which Guinness stressed
the longer-term development of its spirits business, with cautious reports
from some analysts in Athens, led to conclusions that the stock was in for a
dull time, particularly in the short-term.
'It's another case of jam tomorrow,' was the comment from one drinks
specialist. Kleinwort Benson was among those reiterating its 'weak hold'
stance. However, NatWest Securities, which two weeks ago launched a Guinness
warrant, again pointed out the longer-term potential of the group's
strategy. The shares ended the day 24 down at 408p in turnover of 6.6m.
The drinks sector was said also to be buffeted by the effects of the fallout
from the supermarket price war and worries over brands. Whitbread declined
10 to 492p, Scottish and Newcastle 8 to 474p and Wolverhampton and Dudley 7
to 478p. Allied Lyons, down 10 at 553p, and Grand Metropolitan, off 15 at
389p, were said to be also undermined by cautious comments on the US spirits
market by an American drinks group. Greene King slipped a penny to 569p as
it announced an extention to its debt portfolio.
Conversely, food manufacturers and retailers held up well in the weak
market, having taken a pasting in the previous two sessions. However, J
Sainsbury, off 10 at 366p, and Argyll Group, down 9 at 260p, continued to
suffer.
British Aerospace denied reports that the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation had
proposed the cancellation of plans for the co-production of the RJ regional
passenger jet. BAe shares retreated 15 to 444p.
Motor stocks held up on yield considerations. Lucas Industries gained 4 to
175p amid talk also that the appointment of a new chief executive was
imminent. GKN stayed level at 465p.
Another of the market's best performing sectors was insurance brokers, which
finished the day 0.3 per cent up. Willis Corroon pushed up 2 to 223p. Most
of the others managed to hold unchanged or relinquish only one or two pence.
One analyst put the performance down to the companies' income - largely tied
to dollars - which would therefore appreciate if US interest rates rose.
After a strong performance the previous session on the back of well-received
results, BP fell victim to weak sentiment in the oil sector. This, together
with a move by Merrill Lynch from a buy to a hold on the stock, helped knock
6 from the price to 350 1/2 p in strong turnover of 21m.
Shell, which has results due next week, was unable to resist the market's
downward plunge and fell back 8 1/2 to 715p.
New price rises at British Steel helped the shares add a penny to 126 1/2 p.
A new plan for Globex, the electronic futures system, shook the shares of
Reuters, joint developer of the system. The price fell back 49 to 1632p with
2m shares traded.
News group shares weakened on renewed VAT fears, taking 18 from News
International to 275p and 6 from United Newspapers at 539p.
The water and electricity stocks continued to nurse a hangover from the
Ofwat report on Thursday, with the regional electricity companies
particuarly badly hit. Among these, Manweb tumbled 24 to 633p, Eastern 14 to
589p, South Wales 18 to 642p.
US selling exacerbated the declines in the telecoms sector, with Cable and
Wireless, off 16 at 464p, and Vodafone, down 20 at 549p, the worst affected.
A new proposal to rescue Greycoat, the indebted property group, appeared to
have received a wider welcome among investors than its predecessor and
property analysts said it stood a good chance of acceptance. Under the new
plan, preference share holders and coupon holders receive less dilution in
return for a having a larger rights issue. The shares added 1 1/2 to 25 1/2
p.

FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk lifts TV stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKEOVER fervour gripped television stocks as belief grew that the
government would relax the rules that currently prevent the largest ITV
companies taking each other over.
A flurry of activity swept across all stocks in the sector, focusing on
those where bid rumours had circulated for some time. Investor interest was
said to have come from across the board.
Anglia rose 14 to 394p on speculation that the way would be clearer for
Carlton to move in. While a higher increase may have been anticipated, one
analyst said that quite an amount of bid expectation had already been
factored into the price. Carlton remained unchanged on the day.
LWT Holdings moved ahead 15 to 499p on hopes of a bid from Granada, while
the latter stock fell back 7 to 475p. Central was a good performer, moving
ahead 25 to 2058p. Yorkshire showed a rally on its previous form and pushed
up 13 to 183p.
Suggestions that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland might be excluded from
any changes to the present system saw HTV slip 2 to 86p, although Scottish
managed to firm 2 to 440p.

FT  06 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSISTENT selling pressure, triggered by the recent big falls in
international bond and equity markets, drove the FT-SE future down to a
discount to the cash market for the first time in many weeks, writes Steve
Thompson.
Turnover in stock index futures was 23,000 contracts - more than double the
usual amount.
Dealers said the December FT-SE future began trading at 3,133 and came under
immediate selling pressure from all the big international trading houses -
as well as independent traders - as the market anticipated a weak opening to
European bourses and another bout of pressure in bond markets around the
world.
By the close, the contract had fallen to 3,072, a discount of around 2
points to the cash market, having dropped to a discount of about 10 points
to the cash market at one point, with sentiment helped at the close by the
steadier showing by Wall Street.
In traded options, activity in the Euro-FTSE accounted for over 5,900 lots,
while Lucas saw 5,243 traded.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Italian shorts steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN short-term interest rate futures steadied yesterday as some
economists began to argue that they offered good value after a sharp fall
earlier in the week, writes Peter John.
The Eurolira contract for December had fallen on worries that corruption in
Italy might stretch as far as the presidency. A surprise broadcast on
Wednesday by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, denying any involvement in
illegal activity, actually increased the uncertainty.
But at around 91.30, December futures are discounting three-month lending
rates of about 8.6 per cent compared with a discount rate of 8 per cent.
Mr Julian Jessop, Midland Global Market's specialist on Italy, argues that
approval of the Italian budget in the weeks ahead should clear the way for
at least a further half point off the discount rate and so increase investor
interest in Eurolire.
In the UK, the Bank of England provided Pounds 950m of assistance to the
clearing banks at the earliest opportunity.
The figure cleared most of the forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.15bn,
later revised to Pounds 1.25bn. Consequently, overnight lending rates
remained low at around 5 per cent and the effect of four consecutive days of
comfortable interbank conditions saw three-month rates edge lower to around
5 19/32 per cent.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 187m from
the system. Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 135m while a rise in note
circulation - generally high on Fridays as banks stock up cash machines for
the weekend - took up Pounds 820m. Bankers' balances drained another Pounds
25m.
Dealers said the Bank of England was not providing any signal on the
direction of base rates but the market remained convinced that a half-point
reduction to 5.5 per cent was likely to take place at or shortly after the
Budget at the end of the month.
The short sterling futures contract, which expires in mid-December, has
consequently remained within a narrow range and it closed at 94.48, slightly
easier on the day.
Hopes for an early cut in French lending rates sent the French futures
contract up eight basis points to 93.64.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar volatile on US jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar rose yesterday after a higher than expected gain in the latest
employment figures from the US. But its advance was slowed towards the end
of European trading by late profit-taking, writes Peter John.
The figure for non-farm payrolls increased by 177,000 in October while most
economists had anticipated a rise of about 150,000. Also, the September
figure of 156,000 was revised upwards to 162,000.
Initially, the US currency slipped slightly as investors who had banked on a
strong figure took their profits. Then a wave of buying pushed it to a high
of DM1.7078 against the D-Mark and Y108.48 against the Japanese yen.
Several economists argued that the data represented a fundamental economic
shift that would be underscored by buoyant retail sales figures next Friday
and a gain in industrial production figures the following week.
Mr Brian Fabbri, US economist for Midland Global Markets, said the pick up
in jobs signalled a move 'from slow to moderate growth'.
Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS said: 'The economic data is supportive of the dollar
and undermining the D-Mark.' He added that while more improved figures were
expected from the US, German retail sales figures next week could well
underline the continuing need for Germany to cut interest rates further.
By the end of the day's trading in Europe the dollar had fallen back to
DM1.6915, down from DM1.6960 previously. However, it has risen eight cents
against the D-Mark over the past month and there was confidence that it
would push towards DM1.7250 - seen as the next resistance point - in the
next few weeks.
There is also a belief that it will strengthen against the yen. Mr Chertkow
believes that the problems within the Japanese economy will prompt the US
currency to rise to Y110 within the next month and Y115 by the end of the
year.
However, it closed slightly lower yesterday at Y108.15, down from Y108.30
previously.
Meanwhile, the D-Mark was generally weaker against other European
currencies. Against the French franc it fell below FFr3.48 for the first
time since September to close at FFr3.4750 from FFr3.4840.
In the absence of new economic data, sterling maintained its strength
against the D-Mark to close half a pfennig higher at DM2.5150 and recovered
some lost ground against the dollar to end the day at Dollars 1.4865, up
from Dollars 1.4795 previously.
Expectations of further UK interest rate cuts have dimmed and some
economists now feel that there is no more than half a point to come off the
current 6 per cent base rates.

golf tournament

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish motor and energy group, stirred up a new row yesterday in
its efforts to win support for the controversial proposed merger of its car
and trucks operation with state-owned Renault of France.
The Stockholm stock exchange reacted sharply to an unauthorised announcement
by Volvo that its truck division had posted a SKr183m (Dollars 22m)
operating profit in the first nine months of the year, a dramatic turnround
from a SKr586m loss in the same period last year.
Volvo, which is not due to report its nine-month result until November 18,
released the figures as part of a presentation of the Renault merger plan to
journalists at the company-sponsored golf tournament in Spain.
The stock exchange quickly demanded shareholders be given the same
information and said it would investigate the incident to decide if Volvo
had broken bourse rules.
The news of the improvement in Volvo Trucks is likely to have a mixed effect
on the fierce debate among Volvo shareholders over whether to support the
Renault deal at a special meeting on December 7.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Skandia sells stake to Munich Re
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, a leading Swedish insurer, is to sell a 26 per cent stake in
Hamburg-Mannheimer, one of the biggest German life insurance groups, to
Munich Re for DM450m (Dollars 265m).
The move is in line with Skandia's strategy of concentrating on the Nordic
market and giving increased emphasis to unit-linked, as opposed to
traditional, life insurance.
The deal increases Munich Re's stake in Hamburg-Mannheimer to 80 per cent,
with the balance of the shares being held by the Allianz insurance group.
Munich Re said it had made the purchase to 'prevent uncertainty in the
shareholder structure at Hamburg-Mannheimer'.
Skandia said the sale would produce a capital gain of SKr1.9bn (Dollars
232m) and increase its operating result by SKr150m a year. It will also lift
Skandia's net asset value by SKr1.33bn, equal to SKr17 per share, and boost
its solvency ratio by five percentage points to 70 per cent.
The proceeds will be used to develop Skandia's rapidly-expanding
international life insurance business further. International life premiums
of SKr12bn in the first nine months of 1993 are well ahead of the SKr7.9bn
figure achieved for the whole of last year.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive, said the group was looking to develop its
long-established unit-linked life units in the UK and the US as well as
newly-started operations in Switzerland and Germany.
Munich Re, which is the world's largest reinsurance company, reports group
premium income for the year ended June rose from DM23bn to DM25.56bn.
But losses in mainstream reinsurance business eclipsed an improvement in
primary insurance results and in total underwriting losses - calculated
before investment income - increased from DM1.12bn to DM1.27bn for the year.
Mr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, chief executive, blamed the losses on a mixture of
negative factors, including overcapacity in world reinsurance markets,
exceptionally high compensation payments and heavy losses in industrial
insurance markets.
After taking account of income from capital investments, net earnings rose
from DM278m to DM287m. The group dividend is to be raised from DM10 to DM11
per share, thus passing on to shareholders the impact of lower German
corporate taxation.
The reinsurer said it was planning a major capital raising issue for next
year involving the issue of new shares with warrants attached.
It also disclosed its shareholdings of less than 25 per cent in other
companies. Munich Re has a 12.6 per cent holding in Salamander, a shoe
manufacturer. Munich Re and Allianz own 25 per cent of each other.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Home Shopping calls off plan to
merge with QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION shopping groups QVC Network and Home Shopping Network yesterday
called off a four-month-old merger plan because of QVC's separate Dollars
9.5bn bid for entertainment group Paramount Communications.
The move came amid signs that BellSouth, the Baby Bell telephone group which
has been considering involvement in the Paramount battle for weeks, might be
about to invest more than Dollars 1.5bn in QVC.
QVC, which is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading Hollywood film industry
figure, is making a hostile bid for Paramount in competition with a
similarly valued but friendly takeover proposal from Viacom, the cable
television group.
QVC and Home Shopping Network, its chief rival, announced plans to merge
last July - a deal which would have created a strong power in the growing
television shopping field, with sales of around Dollars 2bn a year.
However, the deal had seemed in doubt ever since September, when QVC's
energies became absorbed in its bid for Paramount. Home Shopping said last
month the talks had been put on the back burner.
Yesterday, the two companies said they had mutually and amicably agreed to
terminate discussions because of 'timing and other uncertainties created by
the QVC bid for Paramount'.
Separately, BellSouth, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone
companies, declined to confirm or deny reports that it is negotiating to buy
the 22 per cent stake held in QVC by Liberty Media and inject further funds
into the group which would allow it to increase its Paramount offer.
Liberty is in the process of merging with its associate Tele-Communications
Inc, America's largest cable service company, which in turn has agreed to be
acquired by Bell Atlantic, another Baby Bell company.
The severing of Liberty's links with QVC could help Mr Diller ameliorate
federal anti-trust concerns which could slow up his bid.
It would also remove Bell Atlantic from entanglement in the bid, thus
overcoming qualms BellSouth might feel at investing in a company partly
owned by another telephone group.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Royal Bank of Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Canada will report a net loss of about CDollars 425m
(USDollars 326m), or CDollars 1.50 a share, for the 1992-93 fourth quarter
following an increase in loan loss provisions and a CDollars 300m charge for
integrating Royal Trust.
This will leave net profit for the fiscal year ended October 31 at about
CDollars 300m, or 45 cents per common share, against a profit of CDollars
107m, equal, after preferred dividends, to a loss of 5 cents per common
share, for 1991-92.
Royal Bank became Canada's biggest financial institution by taking over
Royal Trust,the number two trust company, in September.
Before that deal it took over an insurance company.
The disclosure of additional provisions and the special Royal Trust charge
are being made a month before the fourth quarter results are due to be
released.
'We're dealing aggressively with our loan portfolio and our cost structure
and shareholders can look forward to a good fiscal 1994 with lower loan
losses, better productivity and higher profitability,' said Mr Allan Taylor,
chairman.
In the fourth quarter the bank will provide an additional CDollars 200m to
cover problem property and pulp and paper industry loans. It will also make
a CDollars 550m general provision because of the weak economic recovery.
But it has a CDollars 450m market value surplus on its Third World loan
portfolio, an increase of CDollars 150m from the third quarter.
Total fourth-quarter loan loss provisions will be CDollars 1bn, which will
bring the full year's total to CDollars 1.75bn, against just over CDollars
2bn in 1991-92.
At the end of October, total net non-performing loans excluding Royal Trust,
amounted to about CDollars 3bn, against CDollars 3.5bn a year earlier.
Total provision in the current year will be less than half 1992-93's
CDollars 1.75bn, the bank estimates.
However, the fourth quarter will also bear a CDollars 110m restructuring
charge to cover further rationalisation at branch level and in back-office
functions.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Telephone trio in talks on
setting up 'supercarrier'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE largest inter-national telephone companies are in talks which
could lead to the creation of a 'global supercarrier' which will redraw the
map of telecommunications competition in Europe.
Sources close to Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and France Telecom say the
companies have submitted a proposal to Brussels seeking approval for a
merger of all their core activities other than basic voice services.
The proposal says the two companies would first merge the management of
telephone lines, leased lines and data services. They also plan to create a
pan-European intelligent voice network.
Such a venture would compete directly with the Dollars 5.3bn partnership
announced earlier this year between BT and MCI Communications Corporation.
The proposal goes on to say that the new joint company will be seeking a US
partner. Both companies are talking intensively to AT&amp;T, the world's largest
carrier about Eunetcom, a Franco-German joint venture which operates global
telephone networks for large corporate customers.
According to Communications Week International, a trade magazine which will
publish details of the proposed alliance on Monday, a memorandum of
understanding between the three companies has been drawn up but not yet
signed.
It is understood that Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom and Mr
Helmut Ricke, chairman of Deutsche Telekom, have already discussed the
project - known internally as Project Atlantic with Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission President.
BT said yesterday that it knew the companies were in discussions but was
'incredulous' that the potential partners believed such a joint venture
would pass EC anti-trust scrutiny.
Combining the international business of the French and German telecoms
companies would create a carrier with annual revenues in excess of Dollars
9bn, most coming from the lucrative European and transatlantic routes.
The three companies have been working for months to evolve a strategy which
all three could agree on and which would not violate EC competition rules.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: Likely Audi loss blamed on
former chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Franz-Josef Kortum, new chairman of Audi, the Volkswagen quality car
subsidiary, has blamed the previous management's failings for the company's
expected slump into loss this year.
In an indirect attack on Mr Ferdinand Piech, former Audi chief and head of
the VW group since January, and Mr Werner Schmidt, now finance director, he
said Audi's distribution network lacked 'punching power'. 'This weakness is
an important reason why Audi is in a rather worse position than others.
Clear omissions in the past have to be made good,' he said.
Competitors in the quality car market like BMW and Mercedes-Benz had had 20
years to build their networks. 'It should be clear to everyone that Audi
cannot manage this in a few months,' he added.
Mr Kortum, a marketing expert appointed by Mr Piech, has repeatedly said
that Audi's quality was better than its image. His latest charges appear to
be a response to intense pressure from his aggressive patron to avoid losses
this year.
However, the subsidiary is not expected to return to profit until 1995,
after breaking even in 1994, according to company executives.
In a bid to rebuild the distribution system and improve Audi's market
portfolio, Mr Kortum will shortly seek permission from his supervisory board
 -chaired by Mr Piech - to invest a record DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) or more
next year.
His main task is to extricate the brand from a joint dealership network,
built up by Mr Schmidt, former group distribution director, in which the
quality Audi marque has been routinely sold alongside mass market VW cars
and vans.
The company had suffered badly in the current sales slump, he said. Almost
all markets had deteriorated, and foreign currency restrictions imposed by
Beijing had stifled hopes of bolstering sales in China.
Audi deliveries to all markets had fallen 25 per cent in the first nine
months of this year, production had been slashed by 33 per cent, and
turnover had slid 26.5 per cent to DM9.2bn (Dollars 5.4bn), Mr Kortum said.
Warning of more job losses to come, he said the company had 11 per cent
fewer employees at the end of September than a year earlier. After stopping
production for 53 days this year, it had already arranged for more
short-time early in 1994.
Mr Kortum, who four months ago was still forecasting a break-even this year,
said only that the 1993 deficit would be more than DM100m. The company lost
DM198m in the first six months on sales down 30 per cent at DM6bn. Last year
it earned DM172 net - 53 per cent less than in 1991 - on sales of almost
DM17bn.

FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: La Generale to float 25% of
Union Miniere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, is to sell a 25
per cent stake in Union Miniere, its metals subsidiary, through an
international offer of shares and warrants.
The stake is worth nearly BFr15bn (Dollars 412m) at current market prices,
but La Generale will raise half the total value initially and receive the
rest only if the warrants are exercised over the next year.
The sale will cut La Generale's stake in Union Miniere to about 50 per cent
and reduce the company's exposure to cyclical industrial stocks.
Buyers will be offered 3.08m units made up of one share and one warrant,
entitling them to buy a second share before December 15, 1994. The price of
the units, and the exercise price of the warrants, will be set on the basis
of the value of Union Miniere's shares on or about November 22.
Union Miniere has suffered in the last two years from the sharp drop in the
price of zinc. La Generale and its advisers on the sale - SG Warburg
Securities and Banque Indosuez - hope the offer will provide an opportunity
to speculate on the zinc market recovery.

KARSTADT and Hertie, two of Germany's biggest retail groups, are holding
merger talks in a bid to consolidate their position and pool purchasing
power.
A merger of the two, respectively Germany's largest and third largest
department store groups, would create a company with a combined turnover of
DM28bn (Dollars 16bn), and a retail network of 238 outlets.
Karstadt has 164 outlets and recorded a total turnover of DM20.5bn last
year.
Total sales at Hertie, which owns KaDeWe, the famous department store in
Berlin, were DM5.9bn.
The German Cartel Office confirmed yesterday that the two companies were
holding merger discussions. Company officials were reluctant to give
details.
The talks between the two companies reflects the increasing competition and
pressure from discount stores which have mushroomed over recent years
throughout Germany.
The discussions also continue a trend which has seen several department
stores merge such as Neckermann, or quit the business like Quelle.
The talks, which could lead to Kartstadt buying part of the Hertie chain,
follows earlier discussions aimed at a leasing agreement rather than an
outright purchase of Hertie by Karstadt. Mr Sy Schluter, a retail expert at
CSFB in Frankfurt, said the purchase was likely to involve Hertie selling
its shares to Karstadt.
Any merger would allow Hertie to tackle its high personnel costs which
analysts say are about 10 per cent above the department store average. Other
costs, including management and distribution, are estimated to be 15 per
cent above it competitors.
'Hertie needs to invest, particularly in logistics and computers. Its
turnover is too small at the moment,' said Mr Schluter.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Oil
prices volatile as gold soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES experienced sharp movements during the past week because of
confusion about demand in the main consuming countries and market
recognition that, even though northern hemisphere countries are approaching
their period of highest seasonal demand, supplies remain plentiful.
The price for Brent Blend for December plummetted on Wednesday to Dollars
15.60 a barrel, but had recovered to Dollars 16.20 in late London trading
yesterday.
When oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
set a production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day in September, they were
counting on that traditional rise in demand with the onset of the northern
hemisphere winter. But so far there have been few firm signs of a
substantial rise in demand.
Evidence which emerged during the week that recent economic growth in the US
has been stronger than expected was not matched by a rise in the use of
refined oil products, demand for which actually fell in October by 1.5 per
cent. Statistics published yesterday by the International Energy Agency
(IEA) showed better than expected demand in Europe, but the agency cut its
demand forecast for the main western industrial countries and Japan for the
current quarter to 40 million barrels a day from 40.1m b/d last month.
The IEA figures also confirmed earlier estimates that Opec production had
fallen in October to 24.65m b/d. That is above the Opec ceiling but not
sufficiently high to be a big worry for the markets, according to analysts.
They cite factors outside Opec control, such as buoyant Russian exports and
rising output from the North Sea, as additional reasons why oil prices
remain weak. If they remain weak, pressure will build for Opec ministers to
take additional action at their November 23 meeting in Vienna to cut output
further.
It also proved to be a week of contrasts in precious metals markets. Prices
were sent tumbling on Monday by weekend news from Xerox Corporation which
claimed to have developed a silver-free film process. Gold and platinum
prices followed silver down - there was no logical reason why they should
but some investment funds use computer programmes which link all precious
metals prices.
However, all this was forgotten by late on Wednesday when investment funds
started to buy gold futures on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex). This
buying became hectic yesterday as share prices crashed around the world -
analysts linked the investment funds' renewed interest in gold futures to
weakening stock and bond markets and the need for them to find other outlets
for speculative money. Gold tested Dollars 380 a troy ounce at one stage
yesterday before closing in London at Dollars 376.75, up Dollars 7.95 over
the week.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, in a special report for stockbroker T Hoare &amp; Co,
suggests gold's price will average Dollars 360 an ounce this year, 'only 5
per cent up on 1992 - but not a bad performance after hitting a low of
Dollars 326 in March'. Ms O'Connell looks for an average of Dollars 390 next
year and Dollars 420 in 1995.
Silver and platinum moved up with gold yesterday: silver ended the week up
11 US cents an ounce at Dollars 4.495 and platinum was at Dollars 380.25 an
ounce, up Dollars 5.75.
Analysts made the point that, although Xerox's new product, VerdeFilm, was
aimed solely at the graphic arts market (where it will substitute for the
silver-halide films used to make mastering plates for high-quality
photography used in many magazines and newspapers and commercial printing)
it did pose a potential long-term threat to silver usage.
Coffee prices fluctuated in a narrow range, but ended the week slightly
higher at Pounds 1,221 a tonne for the London Commodity Exchange's January
futures contract. The market had started the week with prices at Pounds
1,211 a tonne, but moved lower on Thursday following Brazil's first moves as
part of the producers' retention scheme.
Brazil bought 1,750 bags in Wednesday's auction - the first step towards its
declared target of purchasing 200,000 bags as part of producers' efforts to
boost prices. Coffee traders had expected producing countries to buy much
more in their initial foray into the market and their disappointed reaction
pushed prices lower on Thursday to test the psychological Pounds 1,200 a
tonne level. However prices recovered somewhat to see the second position
futures contract close at Pounds 1,216 a tonne.
Brazil entered the market again yesterday to purchase more coffee, but the
auction did not begin until London markets closed. Brazil said that after
yesterday's auction it would consider changing the rules for its market
forays since coffee supplies remain tight. Traders suggest the Brazilian
government must expand the range of coffees it is prepared to buy or it may
have to pay higher prices.
Producers are hoping that, by keeping stocks of coffee from the open market,
they will encourage consumers to draw down their own stocks and boost
prices. The US, the world's largest coffee consumer, has drawn down its own
stocks for the past two months and the market is entering the peak
consumption period - the northern hemisphere's winter. But traders still
remain sceptical about whether producing countries will have the discipline
to stick to the retention plan.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: The tell-tale signs that set the alarm
bells ringing / Profile of Queens Moat Houses on the run up to suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY, PEGGY HOLLINGER and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORE that is learnt of the Queens Moat Houses story, the more worrying
is the picture painted of life in what was once a sizeable public company.
The case raises disturbing questions for investors and regulators alike.
As the Financial Times pieced together the last months at QMH before the
shares' suspension in March - through conversations with former executive
directors, all of whom have resigned, new management, advisers,
shareholders, analysts and hotel managers - a yet more frightening tale
emerged.
Directors claim to have had no knowledge of the severity of the company's
difficulties only days before the Stock Exchange announcement of the shares
suspension, sticking to profit forecasts for 1992 of Pounds 80m to Pounds
85m. QMH last week reported a Pounds 1.04bn 1992 loss.
Advisers, except Bird Luckin, the group's auditors, which has refused to
make any comment, all say they were kept in the dark as to the true extent
of QMH's problems, only being told hours before the suspension.
Investors, advisers, rivals and observers have already been shocked by the
size of the losses and the apparent lack of nitty-gritty financial controls
which has been revealed by the new management.
As the tale unfolds, concern must deepen that a quoted company could be run,
and continue to be run, in such a shambolic manner. And that the checks and
controls which should have picked up and prevented the QMH disaster had
totally failed.
Mr John Bairstow, chairman and until December 1992 joint managing director,
says the new management is 'kitchen-sinking' the figures and that the report
produced by Grant Thornton, accountants called in after the suspension, in
May showed a less dramatic picture. Although he admits QMH's current
difficulty 'has to be regarded as mismanagement' he says: 'I see this as a
profits downturn after many years of successful trading.'
Advisers, no doubt anxious not to take the blame, point the finger at the
directors. Says one: 'Everybody has to rely on the directors, even the
auditors. If the directors are taking responsibility for the accounts,
investors, brokers, merchant banks and lending banks are entitled to rely on
that. We had no reason to see the management accounts'.
However, they each claim they were advising and putting pressure on the
company to address perceived problems.
Many investors and analysts had concerns about QMH long before the share
price began to plummet last summer. Rival hotel groups wondered how QMH kept
producing better profits than they did.
One large investor says: 'It made profits every year but cashflow was
negative all the time, and it had lots of rights issues. That rang alarm
bells.'
He says other pointers were the 'small, obscure auditing firm', the
depreciation policy - QMH did not depreciate its properties, fixtures and
fittings, Mr Bairstow was once quoted saying 'you can't depreciate
appreciating assets' - and the incentive scheme under which many hotels were
run. Although, he says, he did not entirely believe the record of sharply
rising profits, 'we must have believed it a bit'.
These worries began to crystallise when interim results were published in
mid-August last year. Pre-tax profits were ahead from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds
38.1m and the dividend increased. Mr Bairstow said then that the group was
'cautiously optimistic' because despite the UK recession 'prospects for
profitable growth and expansion in western Europe continue to be highly
attractive'. Debt stood at Pounds 790m, which he called 'comfortable' and
assets were worth over Pounds 2bn.
At this stage analysts were predicting full year profits of up to Pounds
95m, up from the Pounds 90.4m made in 1991, a figure since restated at a
loss of Pounds 56.3m.
Yet the share price fell sharply, from 70p before the results to 27 1/2 p by
mid-September. Analysts and shareholders were especially concerned about the
rising level of debt, which had stood at Pounds 709.3m in the 1991 balance
sheet, and that continental trading conditions would deteriorate.
The directors who made presentations to the City including Mr David Hersey,
finance director, and Mr Martin Marcus, joint managing director, were taken
aback by the severity of questioning from analysts over the debt and its
interest cover covenants and by the fall in the share price. 'The market
took a much stronger view of breaking covenants than we ever did,' says Mr
Marcus.
Immediately after the results it began an intensive round of talks with
shareholders, trying to persuade them that the debt was not a problem and
trading conditions in continental Europe were holding up.
Frew Macmaster, an investor relations firm, was appointed in the autumn.
Like QMH's joint brokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan, it took soundings among investors
and drew up a long list of concerns about the company ranging from the
auditors to the quality and structure of the board, including its
non-executive directors.
The reaction from QMH to the criticisms seems to have been one of surprise.
'It's been alright for years, what's wrong now?' was the way one adviser
characterised the company's response.
By November the group realised UK profits were coming in lower than
budgeted. The company guided the market's profit expectations towards Pounds
80m to Pounds 85m. This was still the number it told analysts it was
comfortable with when it saw them in late December and early January.
Brokers and bankers are amazed that a company could have so little idea of
the true profits - as they turned out - at this stage of its financial year.
'Management controls cannot have been in place,' says one adviser.
Management maintains it did not know that anything was wrong. 'We, sitting
in Romford (the head office), were quite happy that the figures produced on
a monthly basis would add up to the profit we were indicating,' a former
senior director says.
Also during the autumn of 1992 QMH was making urgent attempts to cut debt,
mainly by attempting to do more sale and leaseback deals - although as one
adviser says, that would do no more than shift the debt off balance sheet.
He says QMH 'had a naive belief in the opaqueness of off balance sheet
debt'.
About the same time it began negotiating an incentive scheme with its German
management, eventually signed on the last day of the financial year. Like
the incentive schemes in the UK, this would allow the group to take on day
one profits promised from hotel managers for the following 12 months. This
deal alone would have added Pounds 20m to QMH's 1992 profits.
Pressure was also being applied to the hotel managers, with those on
incentive schemes - where a fee for the year was agreed in advance - given
targets which were increasingly impossible to meet.
Mr Dennis Woodhams, who ran the Falcon Hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon until he
was dismissed last October, says 'they got greedy initially. Later, they
squeezed the managers out of desperation'. He says on one trip to Romford
early last year to discuss delaying his payments he found he was one of six
managers there that day for the same reason.
Also in the autumn, QMH started the lengthy process of renegotiating its
D-Mark multi-option facility. By this time the level of the group's debt had
shot up because sterling's exit from the ERM meant foreign currency
borrowings translated to far higher numbers.
Even so, talks with the banks were going well. But they depended critically
on the Pounds 80m-plus profit forecast.
The comforting messages and the appearance that some action was being taken
to address questions about the board structure helped the share price to
recover from its September low to a high of 59p in early February. It was at
this time that Mr Marcus sold 1.1m shares at prices of 57p and 57 1/2 p,
just before the group's closed period, when directors cannot deal in shares.
Mr Marcus sold his shares through Beeson Gregory, the smaller of the
company's two joint brokers. Mr John Gregory, partner, said his only concern
in handling the sale was to check it was not being made in the closed
period.
The sale raised yet more questions in advisers' and shareholders' minds. One
investor said it was that sale which prompted him to sell. One adviser
speaks of feeling 'incredibly let down' and another says 'we heard about it
through the market'.
By late March negotiations on the MOF had reached the final stages and the
company was due to report 1992 figures on April 7. Directors were still
sticking by the profit forecast it had fed to brokers. One adviser, working
on the presentation of the results, asked Mr Marcus for the final numbers
and was told to use the analysts' forecasts.
Former directors now say that they had not yet seen results from the
continental businesses, which were expected to contribute about half of
group profits. These were being audited as usual by Arthur Andersen and
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, but were late in arriving in Romford.
They finally arrived on Friday March 26. The Romford financial team worked
round the clock that weekend to consolidate them with the UK numbers. But
when they added them up the total came to Pounds 20m less than the
management accounts had led directors to expect. 'It was a big shock,' one
ex-director says.
By the morning of Tuesday March 30 it was apparent the group was Pounds 20m
short of the profit forecast on which the MOF renegotiation depended. And it
would be unable to pay a Pounds 6 1/2 m preference dividend due that
Thursday.
Mr Bairstow insists that the first he knew was when he was told by Mr Allan
Porter, deputy finance director, that the company might not be able to pay
the dividend because of what he thought was a technicality. It was only when
he asked more questions of the finance team he found there was a problem on
profits too.
Mr Bairstow says QMH decided it would not then be appropriate to take in the
Pounds 20m due from the new German incentive scheme. That cut profits to
around Pounds 40m. Mr Bairstow says that once he saw that figure there was
no point trying to come up with an accurate number since the covenants were
already broken. He also says the original Pounds 80m-plus forecast included
around Pounds 20m of 'auditing adjustments' which QMH was accustomed to take
into annual profits. But with these adjustments such as capitalising
interest and expenses, not yet made, profits were nearer Pounds 20m.
He then rang Charterhouse, QMH's merchant bank, alerting them to 'a bit of a
problem on profits' as one adviser put it. Mr Bairstow plays down the
difficulties. 'We had Pounds 110m of unused facilities and Pounds 30m in
cash. It was not a case of a company not being able to write cheques'.
Other advisers were called to a meeting at Charterhouse on the Wednesday
morning and were stunned as they heard the news. One says, Charterhouse said
that instead of the Pounds 80m profits expected there would be a loss,
although the size could not at that point be quantified.
'Everyone was gob-smacked,' says another adviser. Mr Bairstow asserts he was
as much in the dark as outsiders. But one says: 'Bairstow seemed as
astonished as the others - but he was the sort of man who likes to know
everything'.
Shareholders too were astounded. They can blame themselves for not being
more prudent in investing in a company over which so many doubts hung. But
as the group's advisers agree, shareholders could gain no inkling of the
depth and severity of QMH's problems from its published statements.
If, as former directors claim, the board did not know either, this must be
the central question for regulators' inquiries.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Serif deficit cut to Pounds 494,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Serif, the USM-quoted specialist printer and packaging group, yesterday
reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 494,000 for the six months to June
30.
The improvement, from a deficit of Pounds 571,000 last time, was achieved on
sales down by Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 8.7m. Last year's figure, however,
included sales generated by the bingo division of Cowells, which was sold in
July 1992.
Losses arising on the sale and termination of operations totalled Pounds
215,000 (Pounds 414,000), of which Pounds 72,000 was provided for in 1992.
Interest and similar charges came to Pounds 141,000 (Pounds 151,000). Losses
per share came out at 2p (2.3p).

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Takeover hopes boost selected ITV shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of a number of ITV companies bucked the trend of a falling stock
market yesterday on growing hopes that the government will allow a modest
degree of liberalisation of ITV ownership rules.
The central takeover targets such as London Weekend Television, Anglia
Television and Yorkshire Tyne-Tees rose while Carlton Communications, which
hopes to increase its ITV interests, was one of only three Footsie 100
companies whose share price did not fall.
LWT rose 15p to 502p, Anglia was up 14p to 398p and Central finished up at
2058p, a rise of 25p on the day. The FT Actuaries media sector rose by 0.97
points to 2234.87.
The government has yet to take a final decision on ownership rules, but is
now moving in the direction of a modest liberalisation which would allow
some consolidation in the fragmented ownership structure of Britain's
commercial television system.
Proposals are now being put to Mr John Major, the prime minister, following
an inter-ministerial meeting this week.
At the moment none of the nine largest ITV companies can take each other
over.
There is now considerable political support for protecting the ITV companies
in the national regions of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and a
determination that there shall be two separate companies in London.
If the new proposals are accepted the main changes would come in England,
although the scale would be limited.
Granada Television, Carlton Television and Meridian are all part of larger
groups and therefore likely to be the main predators. The key targets are
likely to be LWT, Anglia, Central and Yorkshire Tyne-Tees.
It is very unlikely that an ITV company will be able to own more than two
large ITV licences. Granada is likely to try to take over LWT in which it
already has a stake and which in turn has a stake in Yorkshire.
Carlton, which owns 20 per cent of Central, may decide to make a move on
Anglia. If the degree of liberalisation now being considered goes ahead,
Carlton and Granada could emerge as the lynchpins of the British commercial
broadcasting system.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti agrees pref bid terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI International, the troubled defence electronics group, yesterday
agreed terms with GEC on recommended cash offers for its three classes of
preference shares totalling Pounds 1.29m.
GEC had already proposed a Pounds 10.1m bid, worth 1p a share, for
Ferranti's ordinary shares which was recommended by the Ferranti board but
which is being fiercely opposed by some of the group's 48,000 shareholders.
GEC, which is expected to finalise its formal offer in the next few days,
has said its bid will be conditional on shareholders representing at least
90 per cent of each class of share accepting the offer.
Under the terms of the proposed preference share offers GEC will pay 69p for
each 5.6 per cent first cumulative preference share and 47p for each 3.5 per
cent second redeemable preference share and each 3.85 per cent third
cumulative preference share.
The Ferranti board, advised by Baring Brothers, said it believed the offers
to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of preference
shareholders. Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, has acknowledged that
the GEC offer faces a number of significant hurdles, not least the
opposition of some individual shareholders. However, he has warned that the
only alternative to the bid is receivership.
Ferranti's 10 largest shareholders own 38 per cent of the equity and the top
100 own 59 per cent of the shares. But in order to clear the 90 per cent
hurdle, virtually all of Ferranti's 8,000 largest shareholders will have to
accept the deal.
The final 10 per cent of the stock is in the hands of some 40,000 individual
shareholders, some of whom have commissioned Mr John Katz, an investment
consultant, to explore alternatives to the GEC bid. Mr Katz has warned that
the offer 'is likely to be massively rejected.'
Ferranti's complex share structure also poses a potential obstacle to the
deal. Ferranti's special shares are to be converted into ordinary shares on
a 1-for-1 basis but this will require 75 per cent approval at an
extraordinary general meeting.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pathfinder forecasts recovery at Ruberoid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUBEROID, the roofing subsidiary Tarmac is spinning off to the market,
yesterday forecast a return to pre-tax profitability for the current year.
The pathfinder prospectus published yesterday also reveals that Tarmac has
indemnified the company to the tune of Pounds 6m in case of claims over
environmental contamination at some sites in The Netherlands and Belgium.
Expert advice was that this sum would be more than adequate in the worst
case. Mr Ian McPherson, chief executive, said: 'If this business was being
floated in the normal way, shareholders would not have these indemnities.
Ruberoid is coming out clean.'
He estimated that the sites potentially affected account for between 10 per
cent and 15 per cent of turnover and said: 'We are not out of compliance
anywhere.' Precise costs were difficult to assess but previous and adjoining
land owners may be at least partly liable.
Ruberoid said pre-tax profits would be Pounds 7m for the 12 months to
December 1993. Losses rose to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 6.7m) in the year to
December 31 1992 on turnover of Pounds 280.4m (Pounds 263.8m).
That was after provisions of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.9m) with the bulk
against redundancy and reorganisation as well as some to cover poor contract
results. There was a notional interest charge of Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 6.8m).
No exceptional items are forecast for 1993 and the interest charge is likely
to be just below Pounds 1m following a refinancing which should ensure an
average gearing of about 10 per cent during the year.
Shares will be firmly placed with institutions. Up to 35 per cent may be
clawed back by the public offer for sale. The issue values the company at
about Pounds 70m.
Robert Fleming is sponsor and Robert Fleming Securities are brokers. The
prospectus is to be published on November 11, with the offer closing on
November 18.

There was a loss per share of 1.34p (1.48p).

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Pounds 1.97m were yesterday reported by Burtonwood
Brewery for the six months to September 25 1993, a 29 per cent increase on
the Pounds 1.53m last time.
The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 26m (Pounds 25.7m) and was
struck after a Pounds 206,000 (Pounds 36,000) loss on asset disposals and
net interest payable of Pounds 387,000 (Pounds 499,000).
Earnings per share came out at 6p (4.8p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.7p per share.
The company said the purchase of additional licensed premises had
contributed to increased profitability. An improved performance from the
retail division had also had a significant impact.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lower charges help lift reorganised Wm Cook
to Pounds 3.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, has reported a
substantial increase in interim pre-tax profits, reflecting lower interest
charges and the absence of both reorganisation costs and losses on its
discontinued US operations.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 25 increased to Pounds 3.35m
from Pounds 604,000 a year ago. Turnover from continuing operations
increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 48m, compared with Pounds 46.1m in the
first half last year.
The discontinued US operations added another Pounds 3.47m.
Earnings per share jumped to 10.27p (1.93p) and the group announced an
increased interim divided of 2.5p (1.5p). The stock closed up 8p at 260p.
In spite of 'very difficult trading conditions' the company said its UK
businesses 'performed satisfactorily,' while the sale of the group's
loss-making Unitcast US steel casting operations to its management last
December removed Pounds 1.11m of trading losses recorded in the year-ago
period.
The UK operations posted trading profits of Pounds 3.91m in the latest
period compared to Pounds 3.77m a year earlier. Profits last time were also
depressed by Pounds 623,000 reorganisation costs.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 551,000 (Pounds 1.43m).
Commenting on the outlook Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, said
the prospects for UK manufacturing continue to be poor. 'The demise of UK
coal mining, coupled with a lack of infrastructure investment in roads and
railways, is not good for us.'
'Also worrying are the recent indications of further defence cuts. The deep
recession in mainland Europe also affects us by hindering our export efforts
and increasing the attempts of subsidised European producers to penetrate
our existing markets.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Arcadian Pounds 18.6m rights to fund hotel
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Arcadian International, the leisure-based developer and
operator, will be closely watching the course of its Pounds 18.6m rights
issue to fund the Pounds 21.3m acquisition of eight hotels.
The company posted its full year results and showed accounts prepared on a
going concern basis subject to the success of the rights issue.
The full year figures show pre-tax losses have contracted from Pounds
853,000 to Pounds 440,000 in the year to April 30.
Arcadian has not paid a dividend for three years.
But it claims the support of 60.6 per cent of the equity holders.
Shareholders representing 6.1 per cent have promised to take up their
rights. The balance of the issue has been underwritten by Charterhouse.
Brokers are Charterhouse Tilney.
The 6-for-1 issue of 53.1m new ordinary shares at 35p each will raise about
Pounds 17.3m after expenses.
Shares were suspended on October 29 at 60p, ahead of publication of the
pathfinder prospectus.
Arcadian said consideration for the purchase of the eight hotels, which had
been 'independently valued' at Pounds 21.4m, would be satisfied by cash of
Pounds 5.5m for Hidden Hotels.
Arcadian is paying Pounds 3m in shares for all the equity of Clipper Hotels
at the theoretical ex-rights price of 38.5p, plus warrants to subscribe for
1.25m shares at 75p any time before the end of the year 2000. It is also
absorbing Pounds 12.5m of Clipper's debt.
After the rights and the acquisition Arcadian will be just over 10 per cent
geared with Pounds 3.5m of net debt compared with Pounds 28m of net assets.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat's moves to survive - Financial
restructuring recommended to fend off receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property company struggling to fend off receivership,
yesterday recommended a financial restructuring that includes an injection
of Pounds 86m by investors led by the UK Active Value Fund.
If accepted by ordinary and preference shareholders and bond holders in
early December, the package will secure the survival of one of the UK's most
original 1980s property companies, whose buildings were as adventurous as
its methods of raising finance.
The rescue improved the terms for preference shareholders who last month
voted down a similar restructuring proposed by Postel, the UK's largest
pension fund.
Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, advisers to the UK Active Fund which
orchestrated the rescue, said they were confident the new package addressed
the concerns of the various investor groups and would be approved.
Ordinary shareholders are being asked to subscribe to a five for one rights
issue at 12.5p, worse terms than the four for one rights proposed by Postel
at the same price. The rights issue, which will raise Pounds 73.6m, is
underwritten by Samuel Montagu.
Investors led by the UKAV fund will subscribe to a placing of 30m shares at
20p, raising Pounds 6m, whereas Postel was proposing a placing at 15p. UKAV
will end up with 22 per cent of the ordinary shares.
The underwriters, who include Postel, have effectively agreed to take
warrants in lieu of underwriting fees.
Preference shareholders are being asked to subscribe to a rights issue of
one ordinary share for every preference share at 12.5p which would raise
Pounds 6.25m.
They are also being asked to approve a reduction in the nominal value of
their shares from 100p to 60p, where Postel had asked them to reduce the
value to 40p.
The shares will carry a lower 7 per cent coupon on the higher nominal value.
Postel proposed a 9 per cent coupon.
This scheme allows a hike in income, over Postel's deal, combined with a
lower capital write-down and an option to convert into ordinary shares until
the year 2013.
Preference shareholders can also elect to convert each of their shares to
3.75 new ordinary shares within 21 days after the financial restructuring
becomes effective.
Mr Treger says that any preference shareholders who fully convert will
retrieve par of 100p if the ordinary shares were to rise to 24p.
The deal for Britannic bond holders, who are secured on one of Greycoat's
assets, is barely changed.
Approval fromthe zero coupon bondholders, who voted against the Postel deal,
will no longer be needed. The restructuring, if approved by other bond and
shareholders will cure the current breach of gearing covenants on the bonds.
'Ordinary shareholders are paying the price of keeping the preference
shareholders happy and the extra cost of the zeros,' said Mr Myerson.
Mr Myerson said there was no current intention to change the executive
management team. The UKAV was a long term investor and interested in the
development skills within Greycoat. 'We see ourselves as bringers in of
equity' in the future, Mr Myerson said.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter fall at Sea Containers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NET earnings of Sea Containers fell from Dollars 23.3m to Dollars 15.9m in
the third quarter of 1993 leaving the nine months total to September 30
lower at Dollars 33.7m (Pounds 22.3m), compared with Dollars 36.9m.
Earnings per share dropped from Dollars 1.92 to Dollars 1.17 in the quarter
making Dollars 2.15 (Dollars 2.47) for nine months. Revenues totalled
Dollars 315.9m (Dollars 334.4m), but are not directly comparable because of
the sale of a manufacturing facility in January 1993 and translation of
sterling revenues at a lower exchange rate.
Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said ferry and port earnings for the third
quarter were down Dollars 2.7m at Dollars 20.9m because of the sterling
devaluation. Had there been no devaluation, however, there would have been a
10 per cent increase.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Virgin Atlantic in discussions with Delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN Atlantic Airways is discussing a marketing alliance with Delta Air
Lines, one of the big three US carriers, as well as with Far Eastern
carriers to strengthen its long distance international network.
Virgin has refused to confirm the talks with Delta but said it was
interested in negotiating 'full marketing alliances' with international
carriers. Mr Richard Branson's airline also said that no agreements were
imminent but Virgin was hoping to secure a deal by the end of this year.
Any partnership would not involve any equity investments, added Virgin. In
recent weeks, Mr Branson had reinforced his ownership of the airline by
buying out his Japanese partner, Seibu Saison, the hotel and retailing
group, which owned a 10 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic's parent company,
Virgin Traveller.
Delta is understood to have made the first approach to Virgin this summer.
Both airlines appear to believe that a marketing partnership including code
sharing, enabling the two carriers to use each other's ticketing codes,
could benefit them because there are no obvious conflicts.
Delta flies to London's Gatwick airport while Virgin is focusing on
Heathrow. At the same time Delta's US domestic network could feed Virgin's
services to US gateways.
Although Delta is the largest US carrier to fly across the north Atlantic,
its operations are centred at its Frankfurt European hub. Delta also has
cross equity links with Swissair and Singapore Airlines.
Virgin also confirmed yesterday that it had received 'a couple of
approaches' from Far Eastern carriers. Among possible partners is Malaysia
Airlines, the largest carrier in south east Asia, which said last month it
was planning to sign code sharing agreements with several other
international carriers in the coming months.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Repair costs and legal fees leave Tottenham
at Pounds 3.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE

<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the north London football club currently at the centre of
a Football Association probe into player transfer dealings, revealed an
advance in pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 restrained by already
publicised provisions.
A final dividend of 2p has been proposed, which along with the special 3p
interim paid in November 1992, makes a total of 5p for the year (nil). The
shares fell 2p to 106p.
The taxable result emerged at Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 3.06m, restated from
Pounds 2.96m for FRS 3), having been reduced by Pounds 600,000 for the
unexpected repairs needed for the East Stand where rotten wood was replaced
with steel, and Pounds 550,000 in legal fees incurred in the dispute between
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, and Mr Terry Venables, erstwhile chief executive
and team manager, in their acrimonious summer struggle for control of the
club.
In his statement Mr Sugar said that general trading conditions in the second
half had been good, but that profit in the period had been eaten up by the
above-mentioned 'unforeseen expenditure'. He added that full provision had
been made, but that the company intended 'to pursue most vigorously the
recovery of these costs'.
The merchandising division - now reorganised with the help of a consultant -
lost money but is expected to return to the black in the current year. Mr
Claude Rittner, from Amstrad, was yesterday appointed managing director of
Tottenham Hotspur; with no responsibility for the footballing department, he
will run the merchandising side, along with 'all the commercial and
logistical aspects of the company'.
While turnover from continuing operations grew to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds
19.3m), player and match expenses jumped 86 per cent to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds
7.44m).
Although operating profits were down at Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 3.84m), there
was Pounds 203,000 of interest receivable (Pounds 1.18m payable). After tax
of Pounds 305,000 (Pounds 100,000) earnings fell to 19.1p (23.4p) per share.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The right mix for motivating
employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN RICHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having pioneered some innovative motivational techniques on my own
business, and now simultaneously advising some of the UK's largest companies
on the subject, I must say I am appalled by the views of Alfie Kohn as
discussed by Lucy Kellaway in her article, 'Rewards for the top performers'
(Management, November 3).
The idea that 'incentives are equally hopeless at motivating senior and
junior employees' is an irresponsible, apart from wholly untrue hypothesis.
Certainly motivation does not guarantee success because there are many
factors to get right in a successful organisation, but all too often the
problem is that employees lack it.
Motivation is only in its crudest form about 'throwing money at people' as
Kohn implies. I see it as a package of features (of which money is just one)
as follows:
1. Making work fun. If we enjoy what we do, we do it better.
2. Recognition. Saying 'well done' and 'thank you' occasionally.
3. Rewarding specifically what you want your people to achieve.
4. Communicating informatively (rather than just instructively).
5. Showing your people loyalty/giving them job security.
Rewards when given should be 'little and often' so as to avoid resentment
and to create as many 'winners' as possible.
Of course rewards should be linked to what the company is trying to achieve
and there is no reason, therefore, that this should 'encourage sucking up to
the boss' or that it 'discourages innovation' if done properly.
Kohn's alternative, that we give employees a 'share in the decisions', as
opposed to presumably a 'share in its success', would strike a very hollow
note with my colleagues. Who are we kidding?

FT  06 NOV 93 / When the little children suffer: The UK Child Support Agency
has caused a furore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive of the UK's much criticised Child
Support Agency, always knew that the task of making divorced and separated
parents pay adequate maintenance for their children would cause a storm.
'Making absent parents responsible for supporting their natural children
inevitably means a redistribution of income,' she says. 'Many of those
parents have been living a lifestyle which they can afford only because
their first families are living on social security.
'They are naturally upset that they now have to make choices about what they
can afford to spend. But those choices are of a different order from those
which are made almost daily by lone parents on social security.'
If Ms Hepplewhite anticipated the furore that has erupted over the agency in
the past few weeks, the MPs who legislated it into existence seem to have
had no such prescience. The debates when the Child Support Act passed
through parliament in 1990 barely reflected the concerns now filling MPs'
postbags.
The agency has been accused of wrongly identifying happily married men as
fathers of illegitimate children. Its maintenance awards are said to be too
tough on absent parents. Second families are allegedly suffering hardship
because of the higher maintenance to be paid to children of first marriages.
Ms Jane Kennedy, a Labour MP on the Commons social security committee, which
is looking into the complaints, believes that the row raises important
questions over the agency's powers. She believes those powers are much more
wide ranging than people thought they would be.
'Single-parent families, for example, cannot make any claims for benefits
without involving the agency,' she says. 'That very considerable power needs
to be questioned.'
Despite growing misgivings on both sides of the Commons, social security
ministers are standing firm behind the agency. Making absent parents support
their children has become a moral crusade for a party anxious to establish
itself as pro-family.
Conveniently, it also offers the possibility of knocking as much as Pounds
1bn off the social security budget, which currently picks up most of the
bill for lone-parent families. The only concession the government has made
to the protests has been to set new priorities for the agency, so that it
can pursue the most deserving cases, not just those producing the biggest
savings for the Treasury.
Mr David Willetts, a Conservative member of the social security committee,
supports the agency. He is impressed that it has managed to find 90 per cent
of the absent parents who had 'disappeared' from all records. But the prime
minister appeared to wobble in his support earlier this week, when he
promised that ministers would closely monitor the agency's operations.
The furore is likely to increase. So far, just 36,000 assessments have been
completed out of a workload for the first full year of 1m cases. More than
2m cases will have been settled by the agency within four years - the time
it estimates it will take to review all maintenance agreements and bring
them into the system.
Each case involves three or more people - two parents and at least one
child. The agency will eventually affect the lives of perhaps a sixth of the
population, multiplying the volume of complaints.
Most of those complaints come from the absent parents, 90 per cent of whom
are men. Yet the case for making those absent parents pay up and pay more is
strong. Seventy per cent make no maintenance payments at all to their
children. Of those that do, the amount averages Pounds 25 a week.
This poor record is acknowledged by some of those protesting over the
agency's work. They nonetheless question the fairness of the higher payments
awarded by the agency - averaging about Pounds 50 a week.
The formula used to calculate payments is set out in the Child Support Act
that created the agency. The amount absent parents must pay depends on their
'assessable income' - their net income less housing costs and an allowance
of Pounds 44 for essential personal expenditure. This latter figure is based
on the amount of social security the parent with the child will already be
expected to live off.
The amount of maintenance with the child should be paid depends on the
number and age of the children. A single mother with two children under 11
would be entitled to Pounds 70.55 a week.
However, the absent parent will never have to pay more than half of his
assessable income. So the full Pounds 70.55 a week would only have to be
paid if the absent parent's net income less housing costs came to more than
Pounds 185 a week. For each Pounds 1 below this level, the single mother
would lose 50p of maintenance.
According to the agency, this leaves absent parents with between 70 and 85
per cent of their after-tax income. But many of the parents who have
protested at the formula say this is too inflexible.
Ms Kennedy highlights two features of the formula that need changing:
It ignores the travel costs of absent parents who wish to keep in contact
with their children.
It leaves fathers who have remarried with too little for their second
families.
Ms Sue Slipman, director of the National Council for One-Parent Families,
supports an allowance for travel costs, though not for the expensive treats
that the lone mother often cannot afford. But she is much less sympathetic
to those absent parents who complain that their second families have less to
spend because of the higher maintenance payments.
'The agency is trying to right the amazing injustice of first families who
live in poverty while the second family does not,' she says. 'A transfer of
wealth is inevitable if family break-up becomes endemic in society.'
Ms Slipman sees the need for adjusting the formula in so-called 'clean
break' divorces, where the absent parent has settled property on the mother.
She points out that there is actually no such thing as a clean-break
settlement - the courts were always able to reopen maintenance assessments
if circumstances changed. And many such settlements were designed to
minimise the father's costs: in most cases, social security would pick up
the bill for mortgage payments on a home transferred to a single mother.
But if property settlements are not acknowledged in setting maintenance, Ms
Slipman fears that absent fathers will wish to reclaim their share of their
ex-wives' homes. The consequences could be a rise in homelessness among
single parents as the homes are sold off.
However, supporters of the agency's work are unrepentant at the reopening of
settlements made by the courts. 'The courts often awarded as little as
Pounds 10 a week per child,' says Ms Mary Honeyball of Gingerbread, the
lone-parents' pressure group. 'The agency's awards merely show how low some
court awards were.'
Ms Slipman goes further: 'The agency must be judged not on how much the
absent parents are squealing, but on the amount of money which is
transferred to the parents caring for the children.' Whether MPs will agree
with this stern judgment will be seen when the social security committee
reports on its inquiries into the agency at the end of this month. Until
then, as Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, puts it: 'This
issue will run and run.'

FT  06 NOV 93 / Let the vroom times roll: Mercedes' motor sport initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl last month got down to some serious negotiations with
the president from Paris. Sitting opposite him, however, was not Francois
Mitterrand but the urbane and very English figure of Mr Max Mosley,
president of FIA, the Paris-based world governing body of motor sport.
Mr Kohl was arguing in person the case for a second German Grand Prix - at
the Nurburgring in the Rhineland Palatinate where he was formely premier.
Germany once again is taking its motor sport seriously. But then so is the
rest of the world.
Grand Prix, sports and saloon car racing - and more recently North America's
IndyCar championship - are now being beamed regularly by satellite and
terrestrial television channels to more than 100 countries.
At the same time, motor sport is acknowledged as a valuable promotional tool
in the fierce global battle for sales between top international carmakers.
It is not surprising that Mercedes-Benz should this week have unveiled its
own ambitious new motor sport programme. Having acquired an equity stake of
undisclosed size in Ilmor Engineering, a small Northampton-based racing
engine company, the German manufacturer is embarking on a three-pronged
project:
First, in partnership with Ilmor, Mercedes will formally enter Grand Prix
next year as an engine supplier.
Second, Mercedes and Ilmor will in 1995 begin competing in IndyCar racing,
again as an engine supplier in competition with arch-rivals Toyota and
Honda, which will be supplying engines to other IndyCar teams.
Third, Mercedes will from next year start entering its new C-class saloon in
the prestigious German touring car championship.
Ilmor is one of several dozen specialist motor sport concerns that have made
England the acknowledged world leader in motor sport engineering and the
home of most Grand Prix teams. It was started by engineers Mario Illien and
Paul Morgan, both formerly with engine maker Cosworth, and is already a
substantial force in Grand Prix and IndyCar racing. In Grand Prix, Ilmor
supplies engines to the Swiss Sauber team, lying sixth in the world Formula
One championship in its debut year.
Mercedes' re-entry to the world of motor sport after an absence of almost 30
years, might be seen as extravagant given the extent of its financial
problems: deep losses are forcing it to cut 30,000 jobs in its commercial
car and truck operations.
But Mr Norbert Haug, Mercedes' motor sport director, dismisses as wildly
excessive the Pounds 20m the company is rumoured to be spending on touring
car competition. 'It is nothing like that. No way do we have anything like
that - it is impossible for us,' he says.
While Mr Haug will not give precise figures, he makes clear his view that,
through a series of partnership arrangements such as the Ilmor link-up,
Mercedes has found a bargain way to re-enter motor sport.
For example, in touring car racing, Mercedes builds the cars but the
vehicles are raced in a variety of external sponsors' liveries. This defrays
the costs for Mercedes, while giving sponsors relatively cheap worldwide
exposure.
'We have worked it out - we get back five times as much as we put in,
measured by the TV time and space in newspapers and magazines we get if we
had to buy it,' says Mr Haug.
Success for Mercedes in motor racing should allow it to meet several targets
in terms of broadening its traditional market for commercial vehicles. Some
45 per cent of the company's commercial car sales are inside Germany, where
it is anxious to lose its conservative image and attract the younger buyers
who have been flocking to the sporty 3-Series cars of rival BMW.
In North America, where its sales have been falling in the face of fierce
competition from Japanese up-market brands such as Toyota's Lexus, Mercedes'
IndyCar involvement is designed to attract a broader spread of customers and
to underpin the start of production of its sporty four-wheel-drive vehicle
in Alabama in the mid-1990s.
Traditionally, Mercedes' US customers have been the well-heeled middle
classes who place a premium on the European prestige carmaker's heritage.
But IndyCar more closely reflects the soul of America. It is a much larger
church in which preoccupation with so-called European 'heritage' is less
important, and which is far more receptive to the technologically advanced
but heritage-free Japanese models.
Mercedes motor sport involvement should help drive home chief executive Mr
Helmut Werner's message that the company can no longer regard itself as the
provider of exclusive products at premium prices.
The company, he says, must cut production costs, price its cars more
competitively and slug it out in the marketplace like anyone else.

FT  06 NOV 93 / A tiger trapped in a gilded cage: Carlo De Benedetti's fall
to earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago today, Carlo De Benedetti could have been stepping off a private
jet in New York's Kennedy airport or climbing into a limousine at the Place
Vendome in Paris.
Today, he is confined to his apartment in Rome, a caged tiger subjected to
the scrutiny of magistrates investigating the 21-month corruption scandal
that has cut a swathe through Italy's political and business elite.
Admittedly, it is a gilded cage. After almost spending Tuesday night in
prison - Mr De Benedetti was released at 11.35pm after nearly a full day's
grilling - he is under house arrest at his luxurious pied-a-terre.
The apartment, a stone's throw from the Piazza Navona with its famous
fountain, has been transformed into a working office for the restless
Olivetti chairman. Two secretaries have flown in from the company's Ivrea
headquarters to back up the one assistant permanently on call in the
capital.
Mr De Benedetti, one of Europe's wealthiest and most incisive entrepreneurs,
is lucky that the restrictions on his freedom are fairly lax compared with
the constraints imposed on some businessmen under investigation for alleged
kickbacks to politicians and civil servants. He can use the telephone and
receive visitors. His lawyers hope he will be able to return to the office
on Monday.
Mr De Benedetti is the latest victim of the corruption scandal, which has
already led to about 1,000 arrests. Rather than thinking about how he might
wreak revenge on the prosecuting magistrates, he is concentrating on his
business responsibilities. Apart from Olivetti, of which he is chairman and
joint managing director, his interests include industrial companies in Italy
and France and financial interests from Barcelona to Budapest.
However, it is as one of Europe's most daring business leaders in the 1980s
that he is best known outside Italy. In the decade of the 'mega deal', he
galvanised stockmarkets with a string of takeovers, extending his interests
from computers to car components, fashion to high finance. His cross-border
business ambitions, reinforced by his fluency in Italian, French and
English, and some German, reached a peak in his late-1980s bid to buy
Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's industrial and financial group.
Having the audacity to try to seize SGB provoked an outcry from the Belgian
business establishment. His eventual failure to win the prize cost Mr De
Benedetti dear. However, he did not waste time licking his wounds. He
sensed, earlier than most, the sea change from the booming 1980s to the
recessionary 1990s and started to pull in his horns.
A rationalisation strategy has helped Mr De Benedetti concentrate on
Olivetti, the ailing typewriter maker he turned around in the early 1980s.
In the past three years, the group has been buffeted by the turmoil in the
information technology business, with plunging product prices and cut-throat
global competition.
However, it is Olivetti that is behind Mr De Benedetti's present plight.
Earlier this year, he admitted to Milan magistrates investigating political
corruption that the company had paid more than L10bn (Pounds 4.15m) in
bribes to officials at the Italian post office. Like many other businessmen
caught up in the corruption inquiries, Mr De Benedetti claimed the payments
had been essential to gain access to state contracts. Obtaining a foothold
in Italy's big public-sector market was vital to secure jobs and convince
public administrations in other countries that Olivetti was a serious
contender, he maintained.
Mr De Benedetti's comprehensive testimony, which provided new information,
was welcomed by the Milan judges, who rested their case against him. Since
then, however, responsibility for the post office inquiries has shifted to
the Rome judiciary.
Last Saturday, they issued a warrant for his arrest. The magistrates claimed
new evidence had come to light, suggesting that Mr De Benedetti had been
economical with the truth in Milan. At dawn on Tuesday, Mr De Benedetti
returned to Italy after a long holiday weekend to give himself up. By late
morning, he was under interrogation in the capital's rambling Regina Coeli
prison on the banks of the Tiber.
It was a sobering experience. In some ways, Mr De Benedetti's ordeal echoes
that of the hero in Tom Wolfe's novel, Bonfire of the Vanities, another
1980s master of the universe who falls to earth.
Mr De Benedetti's brush with justice was much briefer than that of the
fictional character. 'My father only spent 2 1/2 hours in his cell, with the
rest of the time taken up in prison formalities or formal interrogations,'
says his son Rodolfo, who manages the family's Cir holding company.
After protesting his innocence, he struggled to gain his release before
midnight. 'My father fought like a lion because he wanted to go home. He
didn't want to sleep there,' says Rodolfo.
Mr De Benedetti's friends say he is understandably angry about what took
place. Surprisingly, however, he is not bitter. A maverick in the Italian
political and business establishment, Mr De Benedetti entered prison
convinced he was being made a scapegoat by his political and business
enemies.
One close associate says: 'He was pleased to discover there was no political
element involved. The magistrates behaved quite correctly in their
questioning, and were just trying to ascertain the truth. The trouble was
they didn't seem to realise how big companies work, or the business and
financial impact of putting him in jail.'
However harrowing, Mr De Benedetti's friends contend this week's experience
was mild compared with the legal battle over his brief stint as deputy
chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, the Milan bank that almost collapsed in the
early 1980s.
Those close to Mr De Benedetti are convinced the six-year jail sentence he
received in 1992, against which he is appealing, was politically motivated.
Mr De Benedetti was a staunch critic of the Christian Democrat-led
government of Mr Giulio Andreotti, prime minister when the sentence was
handed down, and of Mr Bettino Craxi, the disgraced former head of the
Socialist party.
La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, and L'Espresso, the
second-biggest news magazine, which Mr De Benedetti owns, frequently
provided a platform from which Mr De Benedetti broadcast his views.
His readiness to criticise the political elite, now largely discredited by
the corruption scandal, reinforced Mr De Benedetti's image as an outsider in
the Italian establishment. In spite of his wealth and childhood spent partly
with the quasi-regal Agnelli family, owners of Fiat, the country's biggest
private company, De Benedetti remains a dangerously unpredictable figure for
many business colleagues.
'No one doubts he's clever. But not so many people trust him. And there is
always the danger he will allow himself to become emotional and say
something he shouldn't,' says one banker who has worked closely with Mr De
Benedetti.
Isolation from the political establishment has not dulled the De Benedetti
family's political antennae, however. 'Italy is going through a revolution,'
says Rodolfo. 'Revolutions can be bloody or peaceful. If bloody, they're
usually short. If peaceful, they tend to take more time. The risk of
confusion as a result is usually very high, and I see my father's experience
as part of that confusion.'
When will the arrests and turmoil end? 'One day, there will be a political
solution,' he says. That means some form of amnesty, he suggests, linked
with fines and a veto on some politicians holding public office. 'But it
can't be put through by the current, discredited, parliament. We have to
have elections as soon as possible.'
For now, though, all his father can do is wait.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From S MCILROY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to suggest a cost-reduction programme for the chancellor,
that would save (or release) considerable resources from current consumption
without removing the reasons for using those resources in the first place.
Abolish current road tax, transfer tax cost to fuel prices. Substitute the
old tax disc for an MOT disc, issued by garages, and display the MOT disc on
windscreens. This would save paper, police and magistrates' time, post
office counter staff time and much else. The government would not lose
revenue and millions of man hours could be reallocated to more important
tasks.

<TEXT>
Sir, So a British company is now to distribute made-in-Malaysia Proton cars
in Europe ('World Trade News: 'Proton sets up European venture', November
3). Will historians note this announcement as meaning a) the end of Britain
as an industrial nation with a new role as the sales department for the
third world; b) the empire striking back after 100 years of being forced to
buy made-in-Britain products; c) the beginning of a south-north transfer of

Or is it time that categories such as 'third world', 'south', or 'developing

Sir, The FT 1000 Guide to Secondary Education (October 30/31), together with

one glaring inaccuracy when it drew a number of inappropriate comparisons
between the success of schools in Wycombe and those in Milton Keynes.
You claimed that the results of one Wycombe secondary modern school at GCSE
level (34 per cent of pupils with 5+ A-C grades) were 'much better than the
performance of Milton Keynes's comprehensives', which achieved 'only 23 per
cent'. This latter figure is incorrect; the Milton Keynes' schools' average
was 32 per cent. I am sure that the true figure would have led your
correspondent to reach different conclusions from those prompted by the
erroneous 23 per cent. The 5+ A-C percentage here at Stantonbury Campus was
37.5 per cent.
There are, though, some more striking comparisons. Stantonbury Campus is the
largest provider of secondary education in England and Wales. This year, 110
of our students have entered higher education. Our average points score for
A-level results, attained in a large open entry sixth form, was 15.6 points/
pupil. This figure is far in excess of that achieved by three of the
Buckinghamshire independent schools listed in the FT 1000, and is also
better than the points score of the Royal Latin Grammar School at Buckingham
and equal to that of Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School at Aylesbury. Our points
score is also very close to that of such institutions with a reputation for
academic success as Aylesbury Grammar School (17.1 points/pupil) and a
number of other grammar schools in the more favoured parts of
Buckinghamshire.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not a drinking problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a pity Joe Rogaly's thoughtful article on crime ('Tough talk is
not enough', November 5) is flawed by one significant error. He asserts '. .
. most assaults are caused by drunkenness'. The reality is that this is not
so. Various research, from Britain and elsewhere in Europe, fails to
identify causal links between disorder and excessive drinking. They
sometimes coincide, but the hard evidence that one leads to the other is
negligible.
This is not to down-play proper concern in this or other matters of alcohol
misuse, which the drinks industry seeks to counter. But Mr Rogaly's
'solution' to violence of increased drinks taxation fails on all counts. The
small minority who abuse alcohol are undeterred by excessive pricing; look
at Scandinavia's experience. The 95 per cent or more of us who drink
sensibly are unreasonably penalised. And it picks the wrong target, given
that violence is a complex product of, usually, factors other than
drunkenness.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Leading Article: A bout of nervousness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKET turning points are, more often than not, marked by a change in
the thrust of economic policy. After the sell-off in the US bond market this
week, which was followed by sharp falls in the world's leading equity
markets including the UK, it is beginning to look as though investors
suspect that the change is about to come. The markets' worry, which dates
back to mid-October, reflects stronger than expected US growth in the third
quarter and a growing suspicion that the fourth quarter will be buoyant.
Against that background the risk may be growing that the US Federal Reserve
will perceive a renewed inflationary threat and feel obliged to put
short-term interest rates up instead of down.
Yet the argument is scarcely cut and dried. The present strength of consumer
spending in the US, as in the UK, owes much to a fall in the savings ratio
which looks unsustainable; in both economies consumers face significant tax
increases next year. Nor did yesterday's US job figures point to a rate of
job creation that would justify a panic in the bond market. And as far as
the global environment is concerned, the problems are still chiefly about
deficient demand rather than inflation.
As CS First Boston has pointed out this week, there are two novel and
enormously powerful forces at work in the world economy that are holding
back prices. One is that weak demand has prompted importers in Britain and
other devaluing countries to switch to new lower cost sources of supply in
Asia and elsewhere, where liberalisation is dramatically transforming former
command economies. For the UK, import volumes from the European Union are
down 10 per cent since September 1992, while the share of the new regions in
the UK's imports from outside the European Union has risen by nearly 5 per
cent since the start of the recession. The decline in imports from Europe is
all the more striking in that competition from the new regions has forced
exporters in non-devaluing countries such as France and Germany into price
cuts.
Harsh conditions
Another powerful influence is that workers are responding in
uncharacteristic fashion to harsh conditions in labour markets. Instead of
making unrealistic demands for higher wages, they have gone on a buyers'
strike in their capacity as consumers and are withholding their purchasing
power unless discounts are on offer. This week's decision by J. Sainsbury to
start a price war in food retailing is, in part, an attempt to forestall the
effects of such pressure.
Here lies part of the explanation for the lack of the widely expected surge
in prices after sterling's devaluation last year. And the nature of the
analysis raises a question about the call by the governor of the Bank of
England for companies to restrain their profit margins in the interests of
preventing a renewal of inflation.
So far in the 1990s there has been less downward pressure on profit margins
than in the recession of the early 1980s, when competitiveness was badly
impaired by an overvalued exchanged rate; and certainly the recent increase
in manufacturing output prices owes much to higher margins. Yet exporters'
initial response to the devaluation of sterling  - to boost prices to
increase margins - seems likely to be reversed in a depressed European
economy in which the world's exporters are battling increasingly fiercely
for market share. The surprising thing is that they have not been forced to
trim their sails more rapidly to this biting wind. Asian competition will
probably have a more potent influence on margins than the governor's
exhortations.
Huge outflow
These forces are, of course, much more powerful in Europe than the US, where
the tradeable goods sector is a smaller part of the economy. The US is also
out of sync with continental Europe and Japan. Why, then, should the global
markets slump to the tune of the US Treasury market, when the leading
economies are moving in different directions?
One answer might be that the valuation of non-US bonds and equities has been
sustained in part by a huge outflow of US capital. A significant amount of
the Dollars 180bn that has flowed into US mutual funds so far this year has
spilled over into foreign markets in pursuit of higher returns. If the US
bond market starts to offer more attractive yields, then funds may be
repatriated, with devastating effects on foreign markets.
Or perhaps not quite as devastating as it might appear at first sight. For
part of the exodus of funds from the US reflects a structural shift in
pension fund portfolios, as fund managers have been pursuing more active
diversification strategies. While mutual funds' investment in overseas
markets may be the equity equivalent of hot money, the pension funds are
likely to be less footloose, if they are working to specific asset
allocation targets. This is, then, a mixed picture. The markets have been in
dangerous territory for some time. But their behaviour this week could prove
to be a temporary correction rather than a U-turn. It all depends on the
Fed.

FT  06 NOV 93 / It's hell in the aisles / Examining the growing threat of an
all-out war between UK supermarket chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of an all-out grocery price war moved a step nearer this week
when J. Sainsbury, Britain's largest food retailer, threw down the gauntlet
by cutting prices on 300 of its private-label lines, accounting for a tenth
of its total turnover.
The immediate impact was to increase turmoil in the food retailing sector
and set off a further slide in the already weak share prices of Sainsbury's
and other leading supermarket groups. 'All hell has broken loose and nobody
has a clue what will happen next,' said one stockbroker's analyst yesterday.
The biggest question is whether Sainsbury's has simply joined the reaction
to fiercer price competition, or whether its move marks a decisive turning
point in the fortunes of an industry which appeared until recently to be
defying the laws of economic gravity.
By setting no time limit to its promotion and saying it expects to sacrifice
gross margins to win volume, Sainsbury's appears finally to have accepted
what many industry observers have warned for some time: that from now on,
low prices are the name of the game in food retailing.
Many industry observers believe Sainsbury's move is shrewdly calculated, and
that by emphasising the quality as well as the price of its private label
lines, it has made a bold bid to consolidate its position as the industry
leader. Some also think that, by turning up the heat, it hopes to shake
weaker players out of the market.
However, it is far from clear how well the gambit will succeed. Most
observers think all the leading food retailers are keen to avoid being
sucked into a self-destructive price war of the kind which raged in the late
1970s. However, few doubt competition is set to become fiercer still.
Behind the increasing hostilities on the high street lie not only the
recession, but profound structural changes in food retailing. Mr David
Sainsbury, chairman of the supermarket group, acknowledged as much this week
when he said its sales growth was set to slow during the 1990s.
That marks a distinct shift from a few years ago, when food retailers
embarked on huge investments in superstores, in the apparent belief that the
consumer spending boom of the late 1980s would continue indefinitely. Behind
the more cautious approach lie three factors:
Falling inflation means supermarkets can no longer earn easy profits by
raising prices to consumers faster than the prices they pay their suppliers,
as they were able to do during much of the last decade.
The supermarkets' historically high profits have attracted new competitors
into the market, in the form of grocery discounters. Many, such as Aldi of
Germany, are large and powerful groups with a long-term commitment to
increasing sales in the UK.
J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, the three biggest supermarkets, have
invested Pounds 10bn in superstores since the mid-1980s. That has led to a
huge increase in retailing capacity in some parts of the country, which will
grow if they continue expanding sales area at recent rates.
The supermarkets' desire to protect these investments is the biggest
argument for them wanting to avoid an all-out price war. But for exactly the
same reason, the damage they would suffer if things really got out hand
could be even more devastating than during the late 1970s.
Most of the Big Three's growth in the past few years has come from new
superstores. However, this growth has depended heavily on achieving
exceptionally high levels in sales per square foot and the big profit
margins needed to finance investments in still more stores.
However, the economic arithmetic behind this formula looks far less certain
in current consumer markets. As a consequence, all the big supermarket
groups, to varying degrees, face the same dilemma.
To keep their big stores profitable, they cannot afford to lose sales to
discount grocers. However, if they respond by competing too heavily on low
price, they risk devaluing the carefully-cultivated brand image which is
essential to high margins.
While most observers believe Sainsbury's has so far successfully straddled
this divide, many are much more doubtful about Tesco. They say the group
seems increasingly uncertain about its future direction, and that by
launching cheap, lower quality, 'tertiary' brands, it is sending confusing
messages to consumers.
Some in the industry argue that if such muddled policies continue for long,
they could nullify Tesco's huge efforts in the past decade to move its brand
image up-market and make it hard to regain a reputation for quality once
economic recovery comes.
The current turmoil could squeeze some weaker chains, such as Gateway,
Waitrose and the Co-ops, out of the market. However, not only have such
groups shown remarkable staying power until now; but some other retailers
fear their disappearance could make conditions worse, not better.
According to one senior retail executive, if a store chain closed, its
floorspace would probably be sold cheaply to a discounter or a foreign
chain. 'That would make complete nonsense of the billions we have all spent
on expansion in the past few years,' he said.
A more probable outcome is that the industry may be obliged to accept
margins far lower than the 7-8 per cent return on sales which the leaders
have grown used to. In that case, the pressures on one or more of the
biggest groups to scale back dramatically investments in new superstores
could become overwhelming.
That seems unlikely to happen soon. Not only are long lead times built into
store opening programmes - typically three years. But no group wants to be
the first to take a step which would involve serious loss of face and raise
grave doubts among investors about its future growth potential. On the other
hand, some industry analysts are convinced that things have got so tough
that if one big chain announced it was chopping back its investment plans,
others would quickly follow suit.
However, if recent pressures continue, supermarkets will be unable to put
off hard choices indefinitely. Many still seem to be hoping the current
price war will be short-lived, and that they will be rescued by an economic
recovery next spring. But even if that happens, it is likely to be a long
time, if ever, before the industry returns to go-go years like the 1980s.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Misery piled on misery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A grim joke is doing the rounds of Britain's baking industry, which has
recently seen the price of a white loaf slashed to as low as 9p in some
outlets. 'We won't cut the price any further,' it runs. 'We're simply going
to tape a 10p piece to every loaf instead.'
Bread is one of the biggest casualties of the battle for sales which has
forced UK food retailers to launch promotional discounts, special offers and
budget grocery lines on a scale not seen since the supermarket price war of
the 1970s. But it is far from the only one.
Since the summer, the price of fresh milk in many stores has fallen from 25p
to 21p a pint, barely half the amount charged for doorstep deliveries. Other
volume lines subject to severe price competition include canned fruit and
vegetables, biscuits, jam and tea.
Some retailers are believed to be selling certain items at below cost price
just to get shoppers into their stores. But while price falls are good news
for consumers, they cannot continue indefinitely unless supermarkets get
their suppliers to share the pain.
So far, the City seems unsure which sector will suffer most. Supermarket
share prices have been under pressure for months but J Sainsbury's
promotional campaign last week also knocked many food manufacturers' shares,
just as they were recovering from last year's 'green pound' devaluation and
investors' loss of confidence in consumer brands.
Some manufacturers expect things to get much worse in the months ahead. 'The
outlook is for a really bloody winter for everybody, retailers and suppliers
alike,' says one.
Who fares best in the struggle for diminishing margins depends only partly
on the relative size and strength of the companies involved. At least as
important are the market structure and profitability of individual product
categories.
Most vulnerable are manufacturers in mature businesses, such as canned goods
and bread, which are highly fragmented or glutted with excess capacity.
However, even in some fairly concentrated categories, such as biscuits,
supply and demand have been thrown out of balance by the arrival of new
cut-price competitors.
Nonetheless, Mr David Lang of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite argues that
UK food manufacturing overall is much better placed to brave a price war
than in the past. As the chart shows, the industry has become much more
efficient since 1985, raising labour productivity by more than a third.
Furthermore, big capacity cuts in low-margin sectors, such as poultry, have
reduced their exposure to the commodity cycle. However, such businesses
remain vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates and to the growing willingness
of big supermarket chains to buy abroad.
Conversely, those suppliers likely to suffer least are manufacturers of
distinctive high-quality products, which continue to spend on innovation and
marketing and do not let their prices diverge too far from cheaper
competition. As one industry observer put it: 'Ironically, this could be the
moment when big brands return to investor favour.'
Judging by last week's industry-wide drop in food manufacturers' shares, the
stock market has yet to grasp that distinction. But with the yield on some
shares now above bank base rate, even the most pessimistic investors must
soon start wondering just how much worse the industry's misery can get.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Man in the News: New mayor's city challenge - Ehud Olmert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No city in the world is more sensitive to more people than Jerusalem, which
is revered by Christians, Moslems and Jews; the future status of Jerusalem
is also the hottest single issue on the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
agenda.
These sensitivities are about to be tested after the election this week of
Mr Ehud Olmert, of the right-wing Likud party, as mayor of Jerusalem. Mr
Olmert, 43, defeated the Labour party's Mr Teddy Kollek, ending a 28-year
era during which the 82-year-old incumbent came to symbolise the fortunes of
the divided and disputed holy city, which is only recognised by two
countries as an official capital.
Mr Olmert, a successful lawyer and former cabinet minister with a reputation
for brashness, strongly opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord signed
in September in Washington, and the prospect of an independent Palestinian
state. His commitment to retaining Jerusalem for 'eternity' as a united city
under Israeli control and his encouragement of greater Jewish settlement in
Arab areas of Jerusalem has provoked the prospect of increased Arab-Jewish
tensions.
'I will use all my powers as mayor to fight for the policies I believe in,'
he says. 'I will try to avoid unnecessary conflict with Palestinians but I
will work hard to protect Jerusalem as one united city under Israeli
control.'
His first actions have been designed to calm the concerns of those - in and
outside Israel - who fear the surprise election of a Likud politician could
worsen Arab-Jewish relations and jeopardise the peace process.
Mr Olmert chose to hold a victory tour in the cobbled-stone souk of the
Moslem quarter of the Old City, where the bells of the Holy Sepulchre Church
compete with the muezzin's call to prayer. The mayor-elect pressed the hands
of carpet-sellers, argued in Hebrew with Arab merchants about building
licences and patted the heads of Palestinian school-children.
His remarkable triumph, greatly assisted by a large turn-out of voters from
the ultra-orthodox Jewish community, has proved a political embarrassment
for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The Jerusalem election was the first test
of public opinion since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accord and Mr
Rabin had treated it as a vote of confidence in his peace policy. Mr
Olmert's election has also angered some in Jerusalem's secular community,
who fear the increasing power of the religious right could lead to curbs on
bars, cinemas and social events during the sabbath.
The need for a reconciliation between its diverse constituencies has never
been more imperative as the city enters perhaps its most crucial period
since the 1967 Six Day war, when the Israelis wrested the Old City in East
Jerusalem from Jordanian rule. Mr Olmert will be mayor to 544,000 people -
72 per cent Jewish - when the city's future is discussed as part of the
peace process between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation over
the next two years. Several options will be on the table, ranging from
international supervision of the Israeli-occupied parts of the city, to a
physical division of the city along pre-Six Day War lines.
Mr Olmert has pledged that he will allow Jews and Palestinians to settle
anywhere they choose in the city. In practice this would allow Jews to move
into neighborhoods in Israeli-occupied areas, which under Mr Kollek were
reserved for Arabs. Already one member of Mr Olmert's municipal coalition
administration, which is dominated by the religious right, has said there
are plans to settle 100,000 Jews in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem.
Mr Olmert has also said he will treat Jews and Arabs equally, both
economically and socially, after years during which Palestinians living in
the occupied East of the city have been treated as second-class citizens.
For instance, they have been denied permission to obtain building licences
to develop property, their main complaint against the administration.
'The former administration has consistently neglected the needs of the vast
majority of people in East Jerusalem. It is a disgrace to look at the state
of services such as roads, garbage collection and cleaning there,' Mr Olmert
says. 'I am committed to carrying out a policy which treats all the citizens
of Jerusalem as equals. This is my elementary obligation as a human being.'
In spite of his early alignment with fire-brand right-wing politics, Mr
Olmert has gained a reputation as a campaigner for social justice. As health
minister and later minister responsible for Arab affairs between 1988 and
1992 he was credited with persuading the then Likud government to launch an
initiative for Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip to choose delegates to negotiate self-rule.
But Palestinians, the vast majority of whom abstained in the election, are
skeptical of Mr Olmert's promises of equal treatment. Few, however, mourn
the passing of Mr Kollek who, in spite of his 'moderate' international
reputation, concentrated most of the investment on infrastructure in the
Jewish West side of the city.
As Mr Olmert walked up the main commercial high street in East Jerusalem
this week, one Palestinian shopkeeper said: 'Teddy did absolutely nothing
for us. Look at this street. It hasn't changed at all. It looks exactly the
same as it was when the Jordanians left in 1967.'
Even if Mr Olmert delivers on better treatment for Palestinians in
education, social services, and building licences, he will not succeed in
dampening Palestinian demands for their rights to sovereignty over the
occupied East of the city.
'We will always refuse Jerusalem to be under Jewish control, no matter what
the Israelis say they will do for us,' Mr Ibrahim Abu Omar, a carpet seller
in the Old City told Mr Olmert on his walkabout.
As Israelis and Palestinians gear themselves up to tackle the question of
Jerusalem's status, Mr Olmert's unequivocal and uncompromising stand on the
future of the city is likely to complicate what was always expected to be
the most difficult subject of negotiations.

THE TORY party yesterday backed proposals by a Conservative MP to give

Mr Peter Thurnham, MP for Bolton North East, proposed in a pamphlet that it
should be possible for council tenants to be given 40 per cent of the
freehold of their houses, with first refusal to buy the remainder. He called
for housing benefit to be capped and replaced by a fixed element in family
credit, and for mortgage tax relief to be phased out.
The pamphlet was welcomed by Sir George Young, housing minister.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Rabbit out of business by end of December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY morning the 9,000 customers of Hutchison Whampoa's Rabbit
Telepoint service received letters telling them that from December 31 the
system would no longer exist, Rachel Johnson writes.
Subscribers will no longer be able to make calls with their Pounds 99 Rabbit
handsets.
Mr Mike Bowerman, the group director for paging and telepoint, was confident
there would be no exodus of subscribers even though its telepoint service -
together with its Mobile Data operation - had fallen victim to the
competition among UK telecommunications companies.
The company is offering a choice of deals, including cash refunds, in return
for Rabbit hardware, including:
A Nokia 101 or equivalent cellular telephone, including connection and
subscription to either Vodafone or Cellnet's standard cellular service, at
Pounds 7 per month for 12 months. Hutchison says this deal is worth up to
Pounds 500.
A free Hutchison message pager, with answering service, worth Pounds 100, at
Pounds 7 per month for 12 months, a package it says is worth Pounds 380.
A voucher for a Hutchison PCN (personal communications network) phone and 12
months subscription in return for a Rabbit handset, a package worth Pounds
500.
It was too early for some of Rabbit's biggest retail stockists - Comet and
Dixons - to digest the news of the withdrawal.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Weinberg aims to catch insurance tide: The opportunities in
the market that prompted a new venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR MARK WEINBERG'S latest venture is intended to catch two separate, but
related tides in the insurance market.
Its first element, an operation to take over life insurance companies, close
them to new business and manage them more efficiently, is directed at the
long-predicted shake-out in the life insurance industry.
The second element is seen as a way into the growing 'bancassurance'
industry - selling insurance products through banks and building societies.
Experts predict that by the end of the decade bancassurance will account for
30 per cent to 50 per cent of the UK retail financial services market.
Quite apart from the general belief that there is over-capacity in the life
insurance industry, life companies face the difficult prospect of tougher
regulations on how much information is disclosed about policies. Next year,
life insurance sales agents will have to tell potential customers more about
the products they are selling, including how much cash commission they
receive on each one.
The changes on disclosure are bound to affect the design of products,
turning them towards ones which have lower initial commissions either
because the commissions are spread or because costs are lower. This trend is
seen as favouring larger companies which can more easily cut costs and gain
fresh capital.
In general, Sir Mark's venture aims to cut those initial costs sharply by
managing funds that are closed, so doing away with the need for a
salesforce. It would not, however, close funds in which attracting new
business proved profitable.
'The real key is not to incur high front-end distribution costs,' says Mr
David Beynon, who will be chief executive of the organisation.
It will not be the first to move into this area - but those there at
present, such as Century Group, are only medium-sized insurance offices,
below the scale of Mr Beynon's plans.
Mr Michael Wadsworth, partner in the insurance practice at consulting
actuaries R. Watson and Co, believes the idea is a good one and well-timed,
since there are still a number of offices 'floating around' in search of a
buyer.
Mr Beynon says it would have been impossible to enter the market and ignore
the role that bancassurance is playing in intensifying competition.
However, the timing for this element of the venture is perhaps not quite as
propitious, leaving a smaller pool of potential partners than might have
been the case not long ago.
Five years ago, when the Financial Services Act determined that retailers of
financial services must either sell products of one producer exclusively, or
sell the best product of a broad range of producers, most banks and building
societies saw exclusive arrangements as more profitable.
Since then financial retailers' desire to control their own products has
made 'tied' arrangements less popular, and the trend is for banks and
building societies to set up their own life insurance operations.
The main clearing banks already have their own life companies, and many
building societies have already made, or are making, their own arrangements.

FT  06 NOV 93 / BBC may extend satellite TV service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is considering creating a range of international satellite
television channels, using its archives.
In the wake of a licence fee settlement linked to retail prices until the
end of 1996, the corporation is clearly being encouraged by the government
to maximise its earnings.
Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general, said yesterday that the main
opportunities lay in creating thematic channels in areas such as
entertainment, education and factual programming.
Mr John Birt, director-general, warned that the BBC faced a future of flat
income with some rising costs. The corporation had to continue reducing
costs, seeking additional revenues from commercial activities and cutting
licence fee evasion.
The BBC confirmed that its target was to make further efficiency gains of 13
per cent over the next 13 years.
Producer Choice, the controversial move to an internal market for BBC
services, was working, the BBC said. But Mr Rodney Baker-Bates, finance
director, said the organisational change would be reviewed annually for the
next three or four years.
The BBC comments came after publication of the summary of a review of BBC
efficiency by consultants Touche Ross, which praised the way the BBC was
tackling change.
Without Producer Choice, Mr Baker-Bates said, 'the outcome of the Touche
Ross review would have been very different'. For the first time, the BBC
knew the true cost of all its programmes and facilities. For some people,
the finance director added, it had been an 'extremely enlightening and
sometimes startling process'.
As part of the internal review of all BBC resources, 1m sq ft of excess
accommodation had been identified and would be disposed of over the next
three or four years.
BBC borrowings, which are Pounds 142m, would be reduced to zero by the end
of 1996, apart from normal operating finance.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Civil servants to step up protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVANTS yesterday promised further industrial action in the spring
after a one-day strike that government offices claimed to have survived with
few problems.
Unions declared the action had focused public attention on plans to
privatise many public services and said the action had been the biggest day
of protest by civil servants for 12 years.
The plans for spring include escalating the protest throughout other public
sector unions in a second day of action.
The five unions which carried out yesterday's action claimed support from
about 75 per cent of their 300,000 members, and said the strike had caused
'massive disruption'. But the Treasury said that the figure was closer to
150,000.
Among the closures forced by the action was the Tower of London, which had
to turn tourists away when Beefeaters joined the strike. Prisons were
disrupted in Scotland when warders walked out on a three-hour stoppage over
the lunch period. The Prison Officers Association began a separate dispute
at the same time by stopping overtime in protest at the same policy of
'market testing' in prisons.
The six UK passport offices were operating with skeleton staffs dealing with
urgent travel needs, while a quarter of the country's unemployment benefit
offices and Jobcentres were closed. Support was strong at the Driver Vehicle
Licensing Agency in Swansea.
Only 99 of the 500 Department of Social Services benefit offices were able
to open normally although some others were able to offer a limited service,
either over the counter or by manning telephone lines. Few benefit payments
were expected to have been affected, because they are met mostly by postal
cheques or by direct debiting.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, admitted the strike had hit
some departments 'quite hard' but he criticised civil servants for trying to
make themselves immune from efficiency savings.
'If we don't test our services against private competition, how do we know
we are running them at the best cost?' he said. Some of his own department's
staff rejected his arguments and 38 of them attended a mass rally at Central
Hall, Westminster.
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, was barracked during a heated meeting in London by members who
wanted stronger follow-up action. He called for unity, saying: 'Our campaign
will continue right up to the next general election.'
In some areas, including Merseyside, Bradford and Lincoln, as many as 90 per
cent of civil servants were reported to be on strike. The response in other
areas was described as more patchy.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Hurd lauds Ulster peace seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night used his first visit to
Northern Ireland in eight years to appeal to the province's political
parties to build on their recent efforts to secure a lasting peace.
With Mr John Major, the prime minister, preparing to meet unionist leaders
at Downing Street next week, Mr Hurd also offered an assurance that the
troubles were at the top of the government's agenda.
Mr Hurd was speaking after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party
leader, had given a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the prospects for
success of the Major-Reynolds peace initiative.
In an implicit rebuke to the Rev Ian Paisley, the hardline Democratic
Unionist party, leader, Mr Hurd praised Mr Molyneaux and Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, for taking
some risks for peace.
'They and others will need to take more,' he said.
It emerged earlier this week that ministers were prepared to press ahead
with the peace process without DUP participation if necessary. Mr Major and
Mr Paisley are expected to meet on Monday or Tuesday. In remarks delivered
less than 24 hours after Mr Hume claimed there would be 'peace within a
week' if his initiative with Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams was
embraced, Mr Hurd - a former Northern Ireland secretary - said he did not
agree that a political settlement could do nothing to stop terrorism.
He praised the six-point plan recently put forward by Mr Dick Spring, the
Irish foreign minister, as 'constructive'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, is expected to discuss the peace process further during his
speech to the Fianna Fail party conference this weekend.
Unionist MPs yesterday rejected Mr Hume's 'peace within a week' claim as
'preposterous'. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said Mr Hume's
contention was 'just about as arrogant as it is ludicrous'.
Mr Molyneaux claimed he had seen an early draft of the peace plan, and said:
'It is a fiendish plan which would suppress the wishes of the greater number
of people in Northern Ireland. They represent a total surrender to all of
the demands made by the IRA.'
Mr Paisley yesterday urged Mr Hume to 'stop this dialogue-of-death process
with the republican movement'.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Rabbit runs out of subscribers and time: Alan Cane charts
the short and difficult history of Hutchison Whampoa's mobile phone service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WON accolades from Which? magazine for friendliness and economy but it
failed to attract the masses. So there was little surprise yesterday when
Hutchison Whampoa announced it was killing off Rabbit, its telepoint mobile
phone service, after attracting only 9,000 subscribers.
It was strange that the company had persevered with the service in the first
place. In October 1991, a consortium comprising British Telecommunications,
France Telecom, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, Nynex of the US and Northern
Telecom of Canada, essentially wrote the obituary for telepoint in the UK
when it announced it was withdrawing its Phonepoint operation.
The operation was one of four consortia licensed by the government in 1988
to provide mobile phone services based on a technology - known as CT2 -
developed by Ferranti, the Manchester-based electronics concern.
CT2 can be used to develop a mobile phone service that is cheaper, lighter
and more reliable than conventional cellular phones. It depends on a network
of base stations established in public places. Users have to be within 100m
of a base station and can only make, not receive, calls. The handsets,
however, are, at about Pounds 99, significantly cheaper than conventional
cellular telephones. Transmissions use digital - computer-based - signals
rather than analogue, bringing improved quality and accuracy.
By the time the consortium withdrew, declaring the service suspended because
of adverse market conditions, it was clear that CT2 technology had little
mass-market appeal. It had established only 3,300 base stations and had
about 800 customers.
Mercury Callpoint, a consortium comprising Mercury, Motorola of the US and
Shaye Communication of the UK, had given up the previous July; Ferranti had
sold off its Zonephone business. Byps, however, owned by Barclays Bank,
Philips and Shell, was sold to Hutchison Whampoa which set about developing
a system for launch in the UK.
Hutchison launched Rabbit in June last year. It has done rather better than
Phonepoint, with 9,000 subscribers and 12,000 base stations across the
country, but it has little prospect of attracting an economically viable
volume of subscribers in a reasonable time.
By contrast in Hong Kong, Hutchison, Chevalier Telepoint and Pacific
Telelink, which is backed by Vodafone, the UK cellular telephone operator,
have all launched successful services. Hutchison alone has more than 70,000
subscribers. The Hong Kong market is stronger because it has a large
population concentrated in a small area.
Mr Hans Snook, managing director for Hutchison Telecommunications in the UK,
said Rabbit had been hampered by unsatisfactory equipment - the only
available handsets performed well but were too big - and the need,
single-handedly, to educate the market.
To some extent, Hutchison's decision must also be seen as a way of clearing
the decks for its own excursion into the next generation of portable
telephony - PCN or personal communication networks - based on a combination
of cellular radio and digital signalling. This is the new battleground in
portable communications and the most important.
Hutchison says the launch and roll-out of its PCN network, which will cover
at least 70 per cent of the UK population in the first year of operations,
will require further investment of about Pounds 345m over the next three or
four years.
In the UK, Hutchison's chief competition in the field is Mercury One-2-One,
a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and US West.
But if PCN is the mobile communications of tomorrow, does CT2 have any role?
Mr Snook believes it will be developed as the digital cordless telephone for
the home, combining low weight with accuracy.

FT  06 NOV 93 / BZW top in gilt trader profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the securities house, made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 37.17m from its gilt-edged marketmaking operations in 1992.
This makes BZW, for the fourth consecutive year, the biggest profit earner
that trades UK government bonds - known as gilts.
Last year was an exceptionally good one for the 19 gilt-edged market-makers,
normally known as Gemms: most of them benefited from the strong rally in
gilt prices, the decline in interest rates and heavy issues of gilts.
Gilt yields fell dramatically, particularly after the Conservative general
election victory and again after sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The combined post-tax profit for the Gemms jumped to Pounds 65m in 1992  -
their most profitable year since Big Bang in 1986 - against Pounds 49m in
1991 and Pounds 40m in 1990, according to the Bank of England. The prospect
of earning good profits has encouraged houses such as Yamaichi of Japan and
Merrill Lynch of the US to apply for Gemm status.
With post-tax profits of Pounds 24.55m last year, BZW clearly accounted for
the lion's share. It is credited with employing a broad range of trading
tactics which enabled it to spread its risks.
Mr David Gelber, chief operating officer at Midland Global Markets, said:
'When you have the combination of more issuance plus a reasonably bullish
interest rate scenario, it's good for the gilt market and for Gemms.'
Midland's gilt-edged marketmaking operations made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
10.6m last year, sharply up from Pounds 3.5m in 1991.
BZW's gilt-edged operations also include its Eurosterling and Ecu government
bond business, while some other houses only include their UK government bond
business in the figures.
Several of those in the gilt-edged market expect 1993 to be as profitable as
1992 and possibly even better given the continued rally in the gilt market,
the decline in interest rates, the prospect of continued low inflation, and
strong demand by overseas investors for UK and other European government
bonds.
However, some Gemms speculate that BZW may find its position challenged by
US securities houses such Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman
Brothers, reflecting the growing importance of US business.
Salomon Brothers made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14.1m on its gilt
operations last year.
One gilt strategist said: 'This year there has been a fundamental shift in
the kind of business seen in the gilt market.'
US investors have been keen to diversify in the search for higher yields
while US hedge funds (which employ a range of complex and technical trading
strategies and which often trade very large amounts of stock) have been
significant participants in the European and UK government bond markets.
A gilt trader said: 'The US securities houses have had a huge competitive
advantage.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONVERTED Victorian fort in the middle of the Solent, with its own
lighthouse, helicopter pads, tennis court, indoor swimming pool and
gymnasium, has been sold after the asking price was cut by nearly Pounds 5m.
The price, paid by an anonymous overseas investor, remains confidential  -
however, agents Knight Frank and Rutley confirmed bids of Pounds 950,000 had
been asked for the No Man's Land fort off Portsmouth, which first went on
the market three years ago for Pounds 5.75m.
The fort was built in the 19th century as a defence against the French.
It was bought in a derelict state from the Ministry of Defence by a
developer who converted it into a 5-bedroom house.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Rebels anger standards chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIVIAN THOMAS, chairman of the British Standards Institution, yesterday
reacted angrily to the rejection at its annual meeting of the board's plans
to improve executive decision-making.
He said the dissenters were 'impugning the integrity of the staff of this
organisation. We are being judged guilty of changing things, and nobody
likes change.'
But Mr Gordon Gaddes, director-general of the Federation of British
Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Associations, said the protest against
the leadership was widespread. He had taken 63 proxies into Thursday's
meeting, including the British Compressed Air Association, the Engineering
Industries Association, the Gauge and Toolmakers Association and companies
as diverse as BICC, Weir Pumps and subsidiaries of GEC Alsthom, Philips and
Rolls-Royce.
'What we are concerned (about) is the stage by stage transformation of BSI
from a members' organisation to one with a corporate board,' he said.
The BSI supervises the creation of thousands of standards for British
industry. Its problems started in June when Mr Michael Sanderson, the chief
executive, left abruptly after 'a deep disagreement on important matters of
policy and management'.
The rumpus was followed by the announcement of a government review of BSI's
affairs.
Dissent at the annual meeting centred on the board's proposals to vote
itself stronger executive powers and to bring directors' fees more closely
into line with market norms.
Mr Thomas says the changes had two objectives. The first was to tidy up
loose ends from 1991's more radical reorganisation into a smaller, more
dynamic body.
The second was to fill gaps in the board's executive powers exposed by the
sudden departure of Mr Sanderson.
But the BSI members who attended the annual meeting voted by 44 to 2 to
delay a decision.
Mr Ram Mylvaganam, BSI marketing director, says its aim is to convince the
29,400-plus members who did not attend the meeting that the changes are in
the best interests of BSI, its members and British industry.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Insolvency figures leave vital questions unanswered: The
controversial business of predicting economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST figures from the British Chambers of Commerce showing a 2 per
cent rise in company insolvencies in the third quarter of the year cast some
doubt on the extent of business recovery.
They also raise questions about how far insolvency statistics can be used to
predict the future rate of failure.
Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at accountants Price Waterhouse, warns
that the figures are of little use in predicting recovery. 'People are too
willing to draw conclusions from the figures he says.
'That is like trying to steer a ship by looking at its wake, or guessing the
number of parties by watching a bottle bank. They are a lagging not a
leading indicator.'
Many commentators have traditionally believed that there is a delay of about
18 months between economic recovery and a decline in the number of business
failures. That does not seem to be the case this time.
Mr Steve Hill, an insolvency partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says the
figures may be 'more in synch with the economy' because of the different
nature of the recession of the late 1980s, and because of changes to
insolvency legislation which have provided new mechanisms for rescuing
insolvent companies.
He warns there may still be 'another ripple to come' with rising failures,
as companies take on new orders during the recovery without being able to
secure adequate finance to support this expansion.
But Mr Ian McIsaac, restructuring partner at Touche Ross, calls the 18-month
lag 'mythical' and not borne out in either of the past two recessions. He
says the decline in failures is closely correlated with changes in gross
domestic product, and expects failures to rise again in the short term.
'It is change that wrong-foots companies,' says Mr Homan. 'At the moment
they are bumping along at the bottom.' He uses the insolvency figures as a
broad indicator of the future recruitment needs of his department. As a
result, he stopped hiring at the start of this year.
Part of the problem is that there are at least five sets of insolvency
statistics, all compiled in varying ways to measure different things:
Touche Ross receivership and administration appointments. Based on monthly
notices in the official London and Edinburgh Gazettes. These do not show
liquidations, and many of the companies they record may be rescued or be
sold as operating businesses.
British Chambers of Commerce/Department of Trade and Industry company
insolvencies. These show records of companies wound up on orders made by the
courts, and voluntary liquidations requested by the company. They are based
on records filed at Companies House.
Lord Chancellor's Department petitions. These are based on winding-up
petitions made by companies or their creditors in the courts. Not all the
petitions are granted, and the figures record potential failures earlier
than those finally registered at Companies House.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet business failures. These include company liquidations, as
well as bankruptcies of sole traders and partnerships, based on a wide range
of sources. The data is used as the basis for failure figures circulated by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
Trade Indemnity business failures. These are based on collapses as recorded
by customers who have notified Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance
group, of defaulters.
None of the different sets of figures give any indication of scale: they do
not show the value of the companies that fail, nor whether the company
ultimately survives and continues to trade in some form. The collapse of a
complex business with many hundreds of subsidiaries - such as the Maxwell
empire - can cause severe fluctuations.
The figures' predictive value may be limited, but they do all provide stark
evidence of the enormously destructive effects of the recession over the
past few years.

THE SECURITIES and Investments Board yesterday obtained a High Court
injunction to prevent Overseas Client Services, a company based in Hong
Kong, from carrying out unauthorised investment business in the UK.
The action arises from an investigation by SIB into the activities of OCS,
Gresham Futures and two individuals, Mr Peter West of Brighton, East Sussex,
and Mr Paul Bingham of Northwood, Middlesex.
Neither the two companies nor the two men are authorised under the Financial
Services Act to conduct investment business.
Asking for the injunction, counsel for SIB Ms Barbara Dohmann QC, said:
'This was a complicated scam where clients believed they were buying options
on recognised exchanges but instead they got bets and mirrors trades. The
scheme operated like a can-opener on their accounts.'
Mr Justice Lindsay, granting the injunction, said there was evidence of a
strong prima facie case that OCS had traded in breach of the Financial
Services Act. Both Mr West and Mr Bingham deny any dishonesty.
The injunction also prevents OCS making misleading statements and concealing
material facts about its operations.
Gresham and Mr West also gave the court undertakings not to conduct
unauthorised investment business or make misleading statements. Mr Bingham
undertook not to make misleading statements or conceal material facts.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Warning over new ways of working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is poorly placed to take advantage of radical changes in employment
demands into the next century, a leading employment specialist said
yesterday.
Mr Michael Wilmott, director of social and economic research at the Henley
Centre, told a London conference that Britain was falling behind its
competitors in education and training. The development of both areas, he
said, was essential to supply a growing sector of 'knowledge workers' -
executives who know how to put knowledge to productive use - that experts
have forecast will dominate workplaces.
'Britain is not well placed to take advantage of the worldwide movement
towards the knowledge economy,' he said.
The employment revolution was being defined by a greater desire for flexible
working hours and working from home, according to surveys.
Employees' priorities were also changing, said Mr Wilmott, quoting a social
change survey carried out by the centre among employees earning more than
Pounds 15,000. When people were asked which of five options they considered
the least pleasant aspects of their job, the most widespread response - from
35 per cent of respondents - was work-related stress, followed closely by
travelling to and from work and long hours. Only a quarter listed poor
salaries.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Royal Ordnance to cut 300 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL ORDNANCE, the munitions-making subsidiary of British Aerospace,
yesterday announced plans to cut more than 300 jobs even though it has won a
crucial medium-term order for the Ministry of Defence.
The company said 216 of the 534 jobs at Birtley near Gateshead, Tyne and
Wear, would go. It warned that additional orders would be needed to stave
off further job losses at the plant, which makes cartridge cases and shell
bodies.
Its factory at Glascoed, Gwent, will lose 97 of its 418 jobs. Royal Ordnance
said this factory, which assembles large calibre weapons, had sufficient
firm orders to sustain the remaining workforce.
Yesterday's announcement came as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, firmly rejected calls for the government to help defence
companies to diversify.
He said it did not make sense for taxpayers' money to be used to help the
defence industry to compete against companies in civil markets.
Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, attributed yesterday's job
losses to 'inept defence planning', and attacked Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his
opposite number, for having 'no strategy for the future of Britain's
defences'.
Mr Clark responded to reports that the government plans to make substantial
cuts in defence spending over the next three years by urging Mr Rifkind to
meet Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to rethink plans 'as a matter of the
utmost urgency'.
Last month Royal Ordnance was awarded five-year contracts worth about Pounds
200m for ammunition types ranging from small arms to tank shells and worth
about Pounds 200m. The deal, delayed after coming under scrutiny from the
Treasury, was won against strong competition.
However, following the defence cuts, the new order is worth only about half
the previous five-year deal agreed in 1988. This was after BAe's purchase of
Royal Ordnance, a controversial transitional arrangement which guaranteed
the company's place as dominant UK supplier.
The company said the impact on jobs would have been 'considerably worse' if
it had not secured all the new orders, and that several of its 13 UK sites
would have been threatened.
It said it hoped to achieve the cuts through voluntary measures but could
not rule out compulsory redundancies.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Tory council bids for health powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE-controlled Wandsworth council in south London has begun
campaigning to take over responsibility for health purchasing from its local
district health authorities.
The move comes at a time of growing debate over whether district health
authorities, which lost their local authority members under the 1991
National Health Service reforms, are sufficiently representative of the
community.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth council, said yesterday that
healthcare decisions were 'too important to be left to unelected quangos'.
The immediate cause of Wandsworth's action is the threatened closure of its
Queen Mary's Hospital which, said Mr Lister, was a 'grim reminder of what
can happen when a bureaucracy loses touch with the community'.
But involving the council in health purchasing made additional sense now
that local authorities were responsible for community care, he said.
If the council approves the proposal next week, it will be put to Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary. Legislation would be required to
give local authorities health purchasing responsibility, and the government
has no plans to introduce it. But the question of accountability is a
growing issue in the National Health Service.
Earlier this year Mr David Knowles, president of the Institute of Health
Services Management, said the creation of smaller health authorities had
'shifted the balance of their accountability and legitimacy'.
Mrs Bottomley was accused of undermining public accountability further last
month with proposals to abolish regional health authorities, replacing them
with offices of the NHS's central management executive.
The traditional argument against local authority involvement in healthcare
was that they lacked the expertise to manage hospitals.

FT  06 NOV 93 / London hospitals plan to retain sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the combined Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in London
yesterday proposed a rationalisation plan involving retention of both sites.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, had asked the trust board to
consider whether clinical services could be concentrated on a single site,
following the merger of the hospitals under the government's restructur-ing
of London healthcare.
The board has concluded that 'the capital funds to achieve a single site are
unlikely to be made available or guaranteed at this time'. It is proposing a
'radically more effective provision of services', making use of the best
buildings on each site.
The trust's restructuring plans are designed to achieve a 20 per cent
reduction in unit costs. It said yesterday, it would also be necessary to
'secure manpower productivity improvements of 4 to 5 per cent in each of the
next five years.' This is certain to lead to a reduction in the hospitals'
6,700-strong workforce.
If Mrs Bottomley accepts the trust's recommendations, the two hospitals will
have only one accident and emergency department, located at St Thomas's.
Guy's accident department would close, although a minor injuries service
might be established there. Other departments would be reorganised between
the two sites to provide the best clinical coherence.
In deciding to retain both hospitals, board members are certain to have
taken account of their relatively low site values. Recent valuations are
believed to have put price tags of Pounds 19m on Guy's and Pounds 23m on St
Thomas's.
The trust says its rationalisation proposals would enable Guy's and St
Thomas's to sustain 90 per cent of the present volume of services.
Reorganisation of departments to provide a fully integrated service would be
achieved over five years.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Top accountant may face censure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISCIPLINARY commit-tee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales is expected next week to find against a former head of its
own investigations committee.
Mr Brian Worth was under scrutiny for the adequacy of his supervision while
chairman of Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international association of
accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK.
The institute launched an examination of his 'supervisory responsibilities'
regarding Mr Nick Young, a former executive director of CKL who was
convicted for forgery and deception at the Old Bailey three years ago and
has since been released from jail.
Mr Young, who was not an accountant, used CKL's address and its stationery
as part of a scheme which attracted more than Pounds 7m from more than 70
investors over 10 years.
While claiming to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of
return, Mr Young was actually spending it on a system of horserace betting
which he believed he had perfected while attending Cambridge University in
the 1960s.
More than 60 investors who subscribed to Mr Young's schemes are pursuing CKL
and Clark Whitehill for compensation, alleging that the firm should have
been aware of his activities.
Mr Worth, who lives in Gloucestershire, was in charge of the institute's
investigations committee and resigned in late 1991 when it began examining
the case.
He denied failing in his supervisory responsibilities, and had stressed that
he had accepted Mr Young's assurances on a number of issues related to his
activities.
Earlier this year he said that the CKL committee was spread around the world
and that Mr Young was the association's only employee in the UK. He said
that he had met Mr Young only once or twice each month.
Following hearings last week, the case has been adjourned until next
Thursday when a formal decision is expected.

FT  06 NOV 93 / City broker admits theft and deception
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CITY investment broker swindled clients out of huge sums to keep his
'tottering' business afloat, Inner London Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Renton, of Virginia Water, Surrey, pleaded guilty to 14 charges
of theft and four offences of obtaining property by deception between May
1991 and January 1992 involving some Pounds 645,000. A further 20 charges of
theft and deception concerning a further Pounds 1m were denied and not
proceeded with.
Mr Stephen Waller, prosecuting, said Mr Renton had been chairman and
managing director of Wentworth Asset Management, which ran into financial
difficulties in 1991.
Bank of Scotland told him to clear his overdraft and, unable to meet his
obligations, Mr Renton used his non-executive directorship of the
Leeds-based Mount Charlotte hotels group to persuade people to invest in a
bogus share issue.
'He told investors that it was a no-risk investment which would be very
profitable for them. In fact, it was to keep his tottering investment
business in existence,' said Mr Waller.
Mr Renton disappeared in April 1992 after failing to keep an appointment
with his former accountant, Mr John Collard. Mr Renton's wife, Marjorie,
contacted the police and four days later Mr Collard decided to bring in
Fimbra, the self-regulating body for financial advisers.
On the same day, Mr Renton phoned his wife from a hotel and said he had
attempted suicide with an overdose. The next day, he was arrested at
London's Heathrow airport.
He told officers his company had gone a little 'awry' because of the
recession and his bank's 'humpty' attitude. He had decided to recycle
clients' cash.
Mr Waller said Mr Renton had claimed that the actor Sean Connery had
invested in his company, and that it had assets of more than Pounds 60m.
Losers included the Canadian stockbroker Mr Otto von Botho and his wife
Susan, who ploughed in a total of Pounds 280,000, and Sir Edward Goschen,
the banker and retired stockbroker who lost Pounds 185,000, the court heard.
Judge Peter Fingret adjourned the case until December 3 for a pre-sentence
report and granted Mr Renton Pounds 75,000 bail.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Wyvern Crest to lose to new EC directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WYVERN CREST, a supplier of business books by mail order, is among the
companies which believe they have much to lose from the proposed EC
directive, Jimmy Burns and Stewart Dalby write.
Mr Michael Herbert, managing director, yesterday called the directive
'mind-bogglingly inappropriate'.
The company, which is based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, trades as Wyvern
Business Library. It is a small concern with a growing client base in
mainland Europe where it makes more than 20 per cent of its sales. It
insists that all overseas customers and many UK ones pay for books with
their order. The company sells more than 100,000 books a year and half of
its turnover is on a cash-with-order basis.
Mr Herbert believes the directive would have a 'devastating effect', cutting
profits and undermining advertising strategy, which operates on very narrow
margins.
'The directive would mean killing a viable economic activity by a
bureaucratic stroke of the pen,' he said.
He added that it would lead to a significant cut in payments coming in, and
would become a 'charter for fraudsters'.
Mr Herbert said the company would be faced with no choice but to end its
European business altogether because of the legal complexities of chasing
non-payment across borders.

FT  06 NOV 93 / EC may ban cash-with-order demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of companies that use small advertisements in newspapers to sell
their wares could go out of business if a draft European Community directive
becomes law, the Advertising Association warned yesterday.
The directive would make it illegal for companies to insist that customers
enclose payment for goods with their orders. Consumers would be entitled to
wait for the goods to arrive and then forward their cash.
Larger organisations would be able to cope with the delay in payment, but
small companies could face 'unwarranted financial damage', the association
said.
The 'distance selling' directive in its present form would also outlaw
unsolicited selling by telephone. Consumers would have to give consent in
advance to being phoned, although it is unclear how, in practical terms,
this could be achieved. It is possible this clause will be dropped.
Selling by fax and electronic mail without consent would also be banned. Few
homes have these facilities yet, and none of the regulations would apply to
business-to-business selling.
The association argues that UK consumers are already well protected by
voluntary agreements. These include the mail order protection scheme, which
has existed for more than 20 years, and the telephone preference scheme, set
up recently to allow householders to opt out of being canvassed on the
phone.
The draft directive is due to be discussed at a meeting of the EC Council of
Ministers on November 19. The measure would probably need to be opposed by
at least three countries before being thrown out. The association is
lobbying for support among other member states but, at present, the UK is
the directive's only opponent.
An earlier version of the directive allowed for voluntary agreements to
operate but the European parliament insisted the provisions were
strengthened and underpinned by law.
If the directive does progress, many points will need clarifying. For
example, it is unclear whether companies would be able to request, but not
insist, that money be sent with an order, and whether a company would be
obliged to supply the goods if the customer refused to pay in advance.
Payment by credit card would probably continue as now, but there would have
to be a delay before payment was activated.
Even a demand in an advertisement for a stamp-addressed envelope in return
for a catalogue could fall foul of the directive, said the association.
National newspapers is one industry that could be badly hit by the
directive.
Mr David Pollock, director of the Newspaper Publishers Association, said: 'I
estimate that hundreds of millions pounds worth of advertising could be lost
if this directive is accepted. Newspapers like the Daily Mail and the Daily
Express have a substantial proportion of their advertising from distance
selling.'
Mr Colin Fricker, legal services adviser to the Direct Marketing
Association, said: 'One industry which will be severely hit will be travel.
Think of how many holidays are booked with the money being paid up-front.
This directive, if accepted, will just encourage bad debts.'
Royal Mail said it regretted the directive because it could be
self-defeating. 'This directive could result in a lowering of standards in
distance selling, because companies will start mailing from outside the
(European) Community,' it said.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Westland presses Major after contract loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTLAND, the helicopter manufacturer based in Yeovil, Somerset, yesterday
used a visit by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to press its case for
additional UK orders following the loss of a Canadian contract worth about
Pounds 400m to the company.
The company is waiting for a government decision on plans to purchase 25
EH101 helicopters in a troop-carrying version for the RAF.
Mr Major told Westland employees he expected a decision soon and expressed
disappointment over the Canadian cancellation.
Until recently Canada was the biggest client for the new helicopter, which
Westland makes jointly with Agusta of Italy.
Canada last year ordered 50 of the helicopters in seaborne and
search-and-rescue versions. In September this was reduced to 43. But Mr Jean
Chretien, the country's new Liberal prime minister, confirmed on Thursday
evening his election pledge to cancel the whole purchase.
The contract would have been worth CDollars 4.8bn (Pounds 2.4bn) over 13
years. More than half the total value was for work to be done in Canada,
with the first delivery not due until 1999.
The Anglo-Italian joint venture, EH Industries, and its Canadian partner
Paramax Systems, are now to negotiate compensation from the Canadian
government under penalty clauses in the contract.
The cancellation, although not a surprise, is a setback for the EH101
programme, which is crucial for Westland's prospects. The only firm order so
far is for 44 Royal Navy anti-submarine helicopters, placed in 1991. Italy
is also expected to order an initial batch of 16, with options for eight
more, but has yet to sign a contract.
Westland said the decision was unlikely to lead to substantial job
reductions, although it affected prospects for additional jobs from around
1995. The company still estimates a potential market for at least 750 of the
helicopters including civil variants.
The project, under development since 1984, has been subject to severe delays
and cost increases.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Wyvern Crest have much to lose from proposed EC directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WYVERN CREST, a supplier of business books by mail order, is among the
companies which believe they have much to lose from the proposed EC
directive, Jimmy Burns and Stewart Dalby write.
Mr Michael Herbert, managing director, yesterday called the directive
'mind-bogglingly inappropiate'.
The company, which is based in Ely, Cambridgeshire, trades as Wyvern
Business Library. It is a small concern with a growing client base in
mainland Europe where it makes more than 20 per cent of its sales. It
insists that all overseas customers and many UK ones pay for books with
their order. The company sells more than 100,000 books a year and half of
its turnover is on a cash-with-order basis.
Mr Herbert believes the directive would have a 'devastating effect', cutting
profits and undermining Wyvern's advertising strategy which operates on the
basis of very narrow margins.
'The directive would mean killing a viable economic activity by a
bureaucratic stroke of the pen,' he said.
He added that it would lead to a significant cut in payments coming in, and
would become a 'charter for fraudsters'.
Mr Herbert said the company would be faced with no choice but to end its
European business altogether because of the legal complexities of chasing
non-payment across borders.
National newspapers is one industry that could be badly hit by the
directive. Mr David Pollock, director of the Newspaper Publishers
Association, said: 'I estimate that hundreds of millions pounds worth of
advertising could be lost if this directive is accepted. Newspapers like the
Daily Mail and the Daily Express have a substantial proportion of their
advertising from distance selling.'
Mr Colin Fricker, legal services adviser to the Direct Marketing
Association, said: 'One industry which will be severely hit will be travel.
Think of how many holidays are booked with the money being paid up-front.
This directive, if accepted, will just encourage bad debts.'
Royal Mail said it regretted the directive because it could be
self-defeating. 'This directive could result in a lowering of standards in
distance selling, because companies will start mailing from outside the
Community,' it said.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Gore-Perot joust seen as gamble for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has taken a political gamble in sending Vice
President Al Gore into televised battle with Ross Perot, the Texas populist,
on the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The confrontation was last night fixed for Tuesday evening in Tampa,
Florida, with Larry King, the talk show host, as moderator. There may be
other TV debates before the House of Representatives votes on Nafta on
November 17. Mr Clinton is giving a hour-long interview on one of tomorrow's
regular Sunday morning current affairs programmes. Nafta is certain to
consume a fair part of this.
Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, warned Congress of the
dire consequences of rejecting Nafta. Drawing together the treaty, the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations and the APEC summit in Seattle later this
month, he said, 'these are 40 days that can shake the economic world and
shape America's future position in it'.
Last Tuesday's round of off-year elections, which saw the Democrats lose
three big races in New York, New Jersey and Virginia, might have stiffened
resistance to Nafta among the 50 plus Democrats still reckoned to be
undecided.
Nafta was not an issue in any of the contests but the results have been
freely interpreted as demonstrating that Mr Clinton's political coattails
are very short and that congressmen may be inclined to pay more attention to
local opinion against the agreement.
The White House also thinks Mr Perot's credibility is diminishing, a
conclusion borne out by public opinion polls. But last year's three
televised presidential debates showed how effective he could be with his
homespun arguments.
It was considered inappropriate for Mr Clinton himself to take Mr Perot on,
while fielding Mr Lee Iacocca, pugnacious former head of Chrysler and a
prominent pro-Nafta campaigner, might have resulted in verbal fireworks, but
too much on Mr Perot's terms.
Mr Gore, his many years in the Senate notwithstanding, is not a natural
television debater. His confrontation last year with then vice president Dan
Quayle showed him to be a bit stiff. But it is thought his dignity and
ability to marshal arguments and facts will stand up well against Mr Perot's
tendency to shoot wildly, if divertingly, from the hip.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Uruguay Round of World Trade Talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, yesterday
called for countries negotiating the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to
enter 'a market-opening race in efforts to leap-frog the offers of other
countries', writes David Dodwell.
He told members of the American Chamber of Commerce in London that the
difficulties now facing negotiators 'are formidable - and success is in no
way guaranteed'.
Arguing that the Uruguay Round settlement was 'not just a series of deals,
but a more rational way of handling world trade', Sir Leon called for the
leap-frogging race to ensure success ahead of the December 15 deadline for
completion of the talks.
He conceded that a 'leap-frogging race' would have to be conducted privately
if it were to succeed.

FT  06 NOV 93 / EC agreement on formula to protect European culture under
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission and a majority of the 12 EC member states yesterday
said they had agreed on a negotiating formula to protect Europe's cinema and
broadcasting industries from being overwhelmed by the US, if they were
included in the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks.
The formula would allow EC countries to continue and even increase
subsidising the audiovisual sector, to reserve screening time for indigenous
production of films and television programmes, and to regulate not only
transmission but technology in the sector.
This is 'not only the position of the Commission but of the majority of the
member states', said Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EC commissioner for culture,
after the 12 culture ministers met in Brussels yesterday.
At yesterday's meeting, France, Ireland and Spain maintained their vigorous
insistence that cinema and broadcasting be exempted altogether from any Gatt
settlement, to protect European culture from being swamped by products from
Hollywood. Last year, within a total world market for audiovisual services
worth Dollars 156bn (Pounds 103bn), the US exported Dollars 3.7bn to the EC,
against a mere Dollars 288m going the other way. Almost three quarters of
films screened in Europe were American.
France has mobilised its cultural elite to defend a 'cultural exception' for
the sector. A majority of EC states and Brussels believe, however, more
effective protection can be had by getting cultural output inside the
protection afforded by Gatt rules, under a regime of 'cultural specificity'
the Commission has yet to define precisely.
An aide to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, said yesterday
Brussels was still collating member states' views on exactly what they want
protected. Mr Pinheiro told ministers the US - which until now has refused
to countenance any restrictions on its audiovisual access to Europe - was
now prepared to accept the EC's 'Television without Frontiers' directive.
This licenses EC broadcasters to reserve most TV screening time for European
work, but is merely a recommendation. Washington has set its face against
any further protection by Europe.
France yesterday insisted protection was legitimate because of the public
service nature of the audiovisual sector.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants resounding backing from the 12 EC member
states to force a better offer on market access from the US and Japan within
the Uruguay Round world trade talks.
EC foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, will receive a toughly
worded document drawn up by Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner leading the
negotiations, which describes US and Japanese failure to match what the
Community is offering on market access as 'the great disappointment' coming
into the final stretch of the talks.
A version in French of the written report Sir Leon has prepared for the
ministers warns that the EC has 'neither the capacity nor the intention' to
cut tariffs for goods and services unless its main trading partners make
similarly concrete offers. The EC has lodged an 'illustrative offer' with
Gatt in Geneva, aiming to halve high tariffs, in line with the agreement at
the Group of Seven summit of industrialised nations in Tokyo last July.
Sir Leon is likely to face strenuous efforts by France and its allies on
Monday to keep the Commission on a tight negotiating leash. French officials
say Paris may push for a new 'jumbo' council of the 12's foreign, trade and
agriculture ministers this month.
A tense 'jumbo' council on September 20 acceded to French demands to seek
additional concessions - described as 'amplifications and clarifications' -
from the US on the subsidised farm trade agreement the two sides reached a
year ago. 'It took us a while to re-establish credibility as speaking with
one voice after September 20,' a Commission official said yesterday,
underlining that Brussels would resist any new meeting which risked more
internecine warfare over Gatt.
Sir Leon's document for Monday says optimistically: 'The unanimous
conclusions of the joint Council of September 20 have exorcised the spectre
of the internal Community quarrels which had long blocked the negotiations.'
Sir Leon's tactics, Commission officials say, are to demonstrate that only a
robust and united stance towards the US, and a free hand for the Commission
to negotiate, are likely to get an acceptable result by the Uruguay Round
deadline of December 15.
He warns the 12 in the document that the EC has most to gain, but also the
most to lose from a Gatt failure, and that it may have to 'redefine its
objectives to concentrate on the indispensable'.
But the document also notes that the EC's offer on market access has had 'a
catalytic effect' on Gatt signatories other than the US and Japan, and
stresses that this should be exploited to bring pressure on Washington and
Tokyo. 'Third countries have deduced that the Community is really determined
to conclude' the round, the document says.
Sector by sector, the Commission account of the state of the negotiations
reports some progress with the US on the controversy over trade in cinema,
broadcasting and audiovisual products, and on demands for greater access to
the EC's food and cereals markets. These claims are already perplexing
French officials.
Elsewhere, the document underlines EC disappointment with Japan and the US
on opening up their financial services markets, and with the US on textiles,
maritime transport, and aerospace. In the aviation sector, the US last year
reached a bilateral agreement with the EC on subsidies. Now it wants within
Gatt a tougher code on direct subsidies for the EC's Airbus consortium, and
a loosening of constraints on its own practice of indirect subsidies through
military spending to the US aeronautics industry, the Commission says.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Economists cheer US jobs outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS yesterday hailed an improvement in the US jobs market during
October, in spite of a slight upturn in the unemployment rate.
Although Labour Department statistics published yesterday showed the
unemployment rate rising to 6.8 per cent, from 6.7 per cent in September,
most economists agreed the figures indicated more people were looking for
work again, and reflected a more encouraging outlook for the economy.
Job creation in October was much more robust than most forecasters had
predicted, but the number of people either working or looking for work
increased even more sharply. Most economists said this probably reflected
people who had previously given up the hunt for jobs returning to the labour
market as the economy strengthened.
By two different measures, based on separate surveys of businesses and
households, the Labour Department's statistics showed an increase in jobs.
The survey of businesses showed a net increase of 177,000 in the number of
jobs in the non-farm sector - and an increase of nearly 1.9m over the last
12 months. 'October job advances were fairly widespread, with increases in
services, construction, wholesale trade and finance,' said Ms Katharine
Abraham, commissioner of the government's Bureau of Labour Statistics,
saying the number of manufacturing jobs stabilised after nine months of
decline.
The survey of households, which can capture not only sectors such as
agriculture but also consultants and self-employed contractors who may not
be counted in the business survey, showed a net increase of 471,000 in the
number of jobs, but also a rise in the number of unemployed as a net 739,000
people entered or re-entered the labour force.
Ms Abraham said 6.8 per cent unemployment was 'in line with the rates in the
July through September period'.
'Unemployment remains a bit below the average of 7 per cent for the first
half of this year and is substantially below the 7.7 per cent reached in
June 1992,' she said.
Ms Abraham said the data also provided signals that employers remained
cautious about hiring new workers: the average factory working week has
continued to rise to 41.6 hours in October, equalling the post-second world
war record set in 1966, and much of the increase in jobs continues to come
in the sector of temporary employment services.
'The rapid growth in personnel supply services, coupled with the increasing
use of overtime by manufacturers, suggests that at least some employers have
been reluctant to meet increase demand for their products by adding new
employees to their payrolls,' she said.
Data from the biggest states showed unemployment increasing markedly in
California, Florida, New York and Texas, but declining or stabilising in the
Midwest.

<TEXT>
MR Manuel Marin, EC commissioner for development policy, said yesterday the
EC was working on a 'tailor- made' association agreement with Israel to
consider all Israel's trade demands in agriculture and high-tech exports.
He also said the EC would begin on Monday to work out a 'new vision' for a
joint policy in the Middle East and would continue to press for the lifting
of the Arab economic boycott against Israel.
Mr Marin was responding to criticism by Israel that the EC mandate for a new
agreement fell far short of Israel's needs to close a trade deficit of
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn). He said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister, had expressed strong criticism of Brussels in a private meeting
yesterday morning and that 'to some extent I understand his feelings'.
Mr Rabin has in the past said the EC was 'dragging its feet' in responding
to Israel's request for a new agreement after the signing of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
Mr Marin said the EC recognised Israel as a special case and wanted to reach
a deal on closer political, economic, trade and scientific co-operation. 'We
have to recognise that the government of Israel has created a historic
change in the Middle East, so our answer is a political answer to improve
the level of political and financial co-operation.'
Mr Marin said the EC, the biggest donor to the Palestinians, wanted to
increase co-ordination of regional policy and this would begin at meetings
on Monday with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
Mr Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, housing minister, said yesterday Israel was working
hard to get Jordan to sign a peace agreement and indirectly confirmed
reports that Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, had secretly met Jordan's
King Hussein on Tuesday.
A meeting mainly aimed at establishing principles on spending the roughly
Dollars 2bn of international aid pledged for the West Bank and Gaza said
yesterday that the Palestinians must fully account for aid they receive.
The recommendation came from the first meeting in Paris of the Ad Hoc
Liaison Committee, chaired by Mr Johan Jurgen Holst, Norwegian foreign
minister and chiefly composed of the US, Canada, the EC, Japan, Saudia
Arabia, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Prospects dim for BAe deal in Taiwan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS of a successful deal between British Aerospace and Taiwan
Aerospace Corporation receded further yesterday as TAC said it wanted to
cancel plans for the co-production of BAe's existing regional jet aircraft,
the RJ.
TAC said it was still interested in work on a new generation of aircraft,
the RJ-X, and that more talks were possible.
But BAe has long insisted that there should first be a deal to produce the
RJ. Only then should a new model be considered. It said yesterday that
'nothing had changed'.
BAe and TAC, which is 29 per cent owned by the Taiwan government, signed a
pact to create a joint venture company in January. If it goes ahead it could
help save about 3,000 jobs in BAe's loss-making regional jet aircraft
business.
TAC's announcement came after the company's first board meeting since talks
with Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, in Taiwan three weeks ago.
Mr Earle Hou, TAC chairman, said that the board 'arrived at a consensus in
principle that the RJ-X is very important, but that since conditions have
changed over the past year, a serious re-evaluation of the RJ is necessary'.
Mr Chu Hsing, TAC's acting president, said the company had proposed to BAe
that they should abandon plans to co-produce the RJ. The TAC board also
decided to continue talks with BAe, in response to a letter sent to the TAC
chairman by Mr Cahill earlier this week. No date had yet been set for the
next set of talks. BAe said yesterday no progress was likely before
Taiwanese elections at the end of the month.
Taiwan wants to enter the civil aviation market with the help of BAe
know-how. Its caution over the existing model results from a patchy sales
record, although orders have improved in recent years.
Some Taiwanese officials have also questioned whether the RJ's capacity and
range are best suited to the fast-growing east Asian markets.
The RJ performs well on 300-500 mile trips but on longer journeys becomes
progressively less economical than competitors such as the Fokker F-100 and
the smallest of the Boeing 737s.
Opposition to the RJ model is only the latest in a series of objections
raised by TAC or Taiwanese banks lending money to the joint venture, called
Avro.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Tokyo shrugs off fall in share values
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday shrugged off the continuing fall in the
Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei index losing a further 1.9 per cent in a
fourth consecutive day of selling.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said that while the
government was closely monitoring stock prices it was not considering
additional stimulus measures to support the stock market. Mr Hirohisa Fujii,
finance minister, said early implementation of fiscal measures announced
last September was more important than worrying over day-to-day market
movements.
However, the recent decline in share prices is expected to hamper Japanese
banks' attempts to cover losses stemming from the failure of Muramoto
Construction, the largest corporate collapse in postwar history, and other
bad loan write-offs with profits from stock sales.
The Nikkei average yesterday declined 359.33 to 18,590.46, for a loss of 5.6
per cent on the week. Pessimism over corporate earnings is the leading
factor dragging down the stock market. According to the National Tax Agency,
total income declared by companies with capital of Y100m (Pounds 625,000) or
more, during the year to last June, fell a record 18.9 per cent to
Y24,895bn. Of the 35,287 companies, only 56.6 per cent made profits, the
lowest since 1975.
Another damper has been last week's flotation of East Japan Railway, the
largest listing since Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1987. JR East
yesterday fell to Y476,000, 21 per cent lower than its initial trading
price.
Meanwhile, Japan's current account surplus for the six months to September
rose for the fifth consecutive half-year period. The surplus increased 11.7
per cent from the previous year to Dollars 68.7bn (Pounds 45.4bn). However,
in yen terms, the unadjusted surplus declined 5.5 per cent to Y6,875.1bn,
suggesting it may have peaked on a yen basis. The six-month trade surplus
rose 8.1 per cent to Dollars 70.8bn, marking its sixth consecutive gain.
Within the total, the current account surplus grew 10.3 per cent in
September from the previous year to Dollars 13.3bn, rising for the 30th
consecutive month. The month's trade surplus grew 8.5 per cent to Dollars
14.6bn.
Capital flows in September indicated that Japanese investors were net
sellers of foreign bonds, selling a record net figure of Dollars 5.95bn in
order to book profits ahead of the September interim book closing. Foreign
investors were net buyers of Japanese securities, purchasing a net Dollars
3.47bn in stocks and Dollars 2.4bn in bonds.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Foreigners drawn into Algerian conflict: The increasing
violence of Moslem militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French and Algerian governments were mightily relieved this week when
three French consular officials were freed after a seven-day kidnapping by
suspected Moslem militants.
But the hostages' ordeal - following the murder last month of seven foreign
nationals by radical Islamic militants - has dramatically brought home to
all foreign residents the fact that they are inexorably being drawn in to
the conflict which is tearing Algerian society apart: that between those who
wish to install an Islamic republic and those who want to pursue reforms
aimed at liberalising the country's economy and society.
The safe release of the three French officials - the result of a massive
joint police and army operation in Algiers - does at least suggest that the
Algerian security apparatus is more efficient than many observers might have
believed.
Whether the fear that is gripping the foreign community turns into panic
hangs on what happens in the next few weeks. The sheer size of the country,
the number of foreign residents (over 100,000, of whom 76,000 are French,
half the latter number spouses of Algerian citizens), and the diversity of
their occupation and place of residence make it very difficult to ensure
their safety.
No leading foreign company, including those operating in the oil and gas
sector, has so far left Algeria despite the wild rumours sweeping the
capital. But some are cutting back their operations. Some families have been
evacuated; children who had gone to Europe for half-term school holidays are
not returning for the time being. Many foreigners have been regrouped by
their respective companies and embassies, notably those living in more
isolated areas and away from big cities. Many companies have asked for a
permanent military presence on their building sites, a request which
increasingly is being granted.
Some diplomats complain the Algerian authorities have been very slow to
react and increase their safety. Others point out that it is not easy for
the police to switch from the hands-off attitude the government insisted it
adopt after the riots of October 1988 and during the three years of
free-for-all demonstrations by the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front.
The violence is escalating, with at least 700 reported dead this year. Until
last winter members of the security forces were the main targets of radical
Islamic groups. The most dangerous of these groups is the Islamic Armed
Movement, whose members received a thorough training in the camps of
Peshawar in Pakistan before going to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
Violence has increasingly taken the form of economic sabotage - anything
from setting forests on fire to burning municipal rubbish trucks and on
occasion factories.
Leading Algerian intellectuals and writers, few of whom favour an Islamic
republic but many of whom have long been critical of the manner in which
their country was governed after independence, have been slain: people such
as the academic Professor Mohammed Boukhobza, knifed to death last June in
front of his teenage daughter, and the writer Tahar Djaout, murdered last
May. In the eyes of many radical Islamic activists, they are worthy of the
same fate the Iranian leaders wish on Salman Rushdie.
Algerian intellectuals are not alone in arguing that murder is 'not', as one
of them put it, 'an acceptable form of literary criticism'. Many ordinary
Algerians are deeply sickened by the growing violence on all sides, though
among the crowd of younger unemployed many appear to look on the whole
situation as a kind of wild thriller in which they tot up the points.
Journalists have figured prominently as targets. Omar Belhoucet, the editor
of the daily El Watan who has just been in New York to receive a press
freedom award, narrowly escaped murder last May. He also had a difficult
time with the former government of Mr Abdessalan Belaid, which imprisoned
him for a few days earlier this year for articles allegedly endangering the
'security of the state'.
Not that the press has been beaten into submission. El Watan, La Nation and
the satirical El Manchar are as lively, and critical of the government, as
ever. Indeed, press freedom in Algeria today remains, in the view of one
senior diplomat with wide experience of the Arab world, greater than in any
other member of the Arab League.
But this does not reflect a broader easing of the political climate. The
High State Council (HCE), the five-man presidency which has de facto ruled
Algeria since President Chadli Bendjedid was forced to resign in January
1992, has sought for about a year to institute what it calls a 'national
dialogue' among trade unions, employers, professional organisations and the
legal political parties - which do not include the Islamic Salvation Front.
But this has yielded no results, and has utterly failed to dissipate the
prevailing atmosphere of political mistrust. Members of the 'dialogue' are
deeply divided on whether to talk to the fundamentalists, and have not even
been able to agree on an agenda. The recent advent as prime minister of Mr
Redha Malek has so far made little difference.
In view of this political vacuum, all the parties to the talks turn to the
military as the sole bulwark against a total collapse. Its senior officers
might well be able to live with a more strictly improved code of Moslem
social rules but they would baulk at the idea of a 'government of god', as
one of them put it.
Such people acknowledge they are engaged in a tough fight. But they argue
that western powers should understand the advent of an Islamic republic in
Algeria is not in their best interest. Such a development would not simply
destabilise the whole southern and eastern flank of Europe, they say: it
would also cause considerable tension among the millions of Moslems living
in the European Community.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Keeping Jordan's extremists in line: The Islamists'
prospects in next week's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC fundamentalists look likely to form the largest bloc in Jordan's
parliament after Monday's elections - the first multi-party poll in the
kingdom since King Hussein last year lifted a 36-year ban on political
parties.
Members of the Moslem Brotherhood, elected as individuals, constituted the
biggest bloc in the last parliament, with 40 per cent of the assembly's 80
seats. But while the Islamic Action Front, the Brotherhood's party, is
widely expected to win fewer seats this time - it is fielding 36 candidates,
in 16 of Jordan's 20 constituencies - they are certain to keep a strong and
tenacious voice in the legislature.
Accommodating Islamic fundamentalists has long been a characteristic of King
Hussein's rule. Even when political parties were formally banned, the
monarch courted members of the Brotherhood, offering them cabinet posts and
free rein in their charity and social service work in Jordan. By working
with the fundamentalists, he hoped to induce them not to work against him.
But over the past few months, King Hussein appears to have changed tack.
With an eye on Egypt and Algeria, where militants are waging violent
anti-government campaigns, the king has tightened the reins on Islamic
groups. While allowing them to run as a political party - as they are now
prohibited from doing in Egypt and Algeria - he has at the same time acted
to ensure their success in the polls will be limited, while stamping hard on
any manifestation of Islamic extremism.
In a move widely seen as curtailing their likely electoral success, the king
recently made a controversial change in the voting law restricting each
voter to a single vote, where in the previous 1989 poll they could cast as
many votes as there were seats in their constituency.
Action against extremism has been decisive. Ten supporters of the banned
Islamic Liberation party are currently on trial for allegedly plotting to
kill the king at a university ceremony in June. Last week, four men were
killed and five wounded in a shoot-out between the army and a trio of
Islamic extremists near Jordan's border with Israel. The extremists had
worked with Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, the spiritual leader of Egypt's Gamaa
al-Islamiyya extremist group who is at present on trial in New York for his
alleged role in the World Trade Centre bombing.
Moreover, in the run-up to the elections, King Hussein publicly criticised
the Islamic Action Front, while at the same time warning Mr Leith Shbeilat,
perhaps the most popular and outspoken of Jordan's Islamic MPs, that he
should toe the line.
Mr Shbeilat, who was last year tried but acquitted on charges of plotting
against the king, is highly critical of the government and has decided to
boycott Monday's poll.
For many Jordanians, the king's moves seem to overestimate the threat from
the kingdom's fundamentalists. And certainly, their ability to change
Jordan's political system in their favour has so far proved limited. Despite
having 30 Islamic MPs, the fundamentalists made very limited progress in the
last assembly towards their ultimate goal of installing Shari'a (Islamic)
law. Motions to ban the sale of alcohol, segregate sexes in schools and
universities and throw out the kingdom's International Monetary Fund
economic reform programme all failed.
Moreover, examples of Islamic violence or state-threatening militancy have
been rare in Jordan, which has long had one of the region's most effective
security apparatuses.
Nevertheless, both King Hussein and his western allies are keeping a close
eye on the Islamists. According to press reports in Amman recently, when Mr
Fayez Tarawneh offered his credentials to President Bill Clinton this summer
as Jordan's new ambassador to Washington, Mr Clinton warned against allowing
the Islamists to become too powerful through the elections.
King Hussein has powerful domestic and foreign policy reasons to keep the
fundamentalists in check. He must, above all, ensure that the
fundamentalists' opposition to the peace process cannot veto Jordan's
prospective peace agreement with Israel. The parliament to be elected on
Monday may well have to ratify any final agreement with Jordan's Jewish
neighbour.
Nevertheless, the king must also balance such concerns with his
determination that Jordan should produce a meaningful democracy.
It appears to remain his profound belief that fundamentalism is better
controlled within than outside the political system.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Ozawa says his political donations were legal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Ichiro Ozawa, the most powerful man behind Japan's coalition government,
yesterday admitted to receiving millions of yen from a disgraced
construction company but said this was legal.
Mr Ozawa, co-leader of the Japan Renewal party, second largest partner in
the seven-party coalition, admitted he had received donations from Kajima,
one of Japan's top construction companies, whose vice president was arrested
last month on charges of bribing local politicians for contracts.
Even if, as is likely, the donations received by Mr Ozawa were technically
legal, this will embarrass the government, as it attempts to pass laws to
reform the scandal-ridden political system.
Coalition and LDP negotiators yesterday held a first meeting to seek a
compromise on political reform plans, on which Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister, has staked his job.
This episode will also hamper Mr Ozawa's attempts to acquire a clean public
image, a condition for his re-entry into national politics.
Mr Ozawa, joint leader of the former LDP faction that brought down the last
government, was instrumental in the formation of the coalition, but
preferred to remain behind the scenes to prepare his next move. He also
needed to give the public time to forget his links to former LDP political
godfather Shin Kanemaru, Mr Ozawa's mentor, who is on trial for tax evasion.
Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, a senior vice president of Kajima, told prosecutors he
gave Mr Ozawa Y5m (Pounds 31,200) every six months for the past two to three
years, according to the Asahi Shimbun daily newspaper.
Under current law, individual politicians are entitled to receive Y1.5m per
year from a single donor. Political groups may receive Y100m. Mr Ozawa's
denial implies that the cash was destined for the LDP, not him, and
therefore was legal.
More than 20 executives from six leading companies and four local
politicians have been arrested during an eight-month inquiry into corruption
in the construction industry, a big source of political funds. But so far
public prosecutors have stopped short of charging national politicians or
officials.
However, public prosecution officials did let it be known last week that Mr
Kiyoyama also handed cash to Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former LDP prime
minister. Mr Kanemaru also received money from the company, say Japanese
press reports.

Mr Deng's remarks, published yesterday in the Chinese press, are certain to
deepen concerns among pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong about possible
reprisals against public figures who have expressed misgivings about
Beijing's intentions. He defined 'patriots' as those who supported the
'motherland' and did nothing to hurt Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

A Barcelona judge investigating corporate tax evasion in Spain yesterday
ordered the imprisonment of senior executives of a leading insurance group
pending charges linked to false invoicing in order to reduce profit figures
and the creation of funds of 'black' money beyond the reach of the fiscal
authorities, Tom Burns reports from Madrid.
The judge refused bail for the chairman and the managing director of La
Estrella and for the chief executive of Grupo Vitalicio, two big insurance
firms owned by a holding company controlled by Banco Central Hispano,
Spain's biggest commercial bank. Five other businessmen were arrested, two
of whom were allegedly involved in recent real estate operations in
Barcelona.
The detention orders appeared to be a breakthrough in a series of
painstaking inquiries over the alleged wide use of fictitious receipts in
Spanish business circles. Judicial officials say the Barcelona court is
examining the accounts of 350 companies and that the total amount of tax
allegedly evaded in this particular fraud case could total some Pta10bn
(Pounds 50m).

A bill creating the National Agency for Information and State Security will
go before parliament this month and is expected to be passed by the end of

Allegations by jailed agents that senior figures including President Oscar

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S health minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, was yesterday facing angry
criticism from doctors and health agencies for allegedly unleashing 'mass
hysteria' among former and future patients over the danger of HIV-infected
blood products.
In the face of a sharp drop in donors giving blood to collection agencies,
Prince Botho zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, president of the German Red Cross,
appealed for the whole debate to be 'de-emotionalised'.
'The current Aids debate has led to great insecurity among millions of
fellow citizens,' he said. 'Countless patients are refusing essential blood
transfusions, for fear of a possible Aids-infection. Many donors are asking
anxiously what is happening to their blood.'
The Red Cross confirmed that there had been a 10 per cent drop in blood
donors in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg and a 5 per cent decrease in North
Rhine-Westphalia, perhaps out of fear of giving blood alongside Aids
sufferers.
In Koblenz, the local authority said yesterday that 88 hospitals and blood
distributors, including one company in Austria and one in Switzerland, had
been contacted since October 27 to warn them about possible receipt of
HIV-infected blood from the UB Plasma laboratory in the town.
Any plasma from the laboratory in the affected hospitals had been seized by
the police, the authorities said. Four members of the company, including the
chief executive, have been arrested and face charges of negligence in
failing to ensure adequate HIV-testing of blood products.
Evidence of inadequate testing at the laboratory, and suspicion that others
could also be involved, has precipitated a national panic over blood
products. A suggestion by Mr Seehofer on Wednesday that any former patient
who had received blood in recent years should have be tested for HIV has
caused pandemonium on hospital switchboards.
The Marburger Bund, a federation representing some 57,000 hospital doctors,
accused Mr Seehofer of acting 'over-hastily' and without any scientific
basis.
In Berlin, Dr Ellis Huber, the chairman of the city medical council,
denounced what he called a 'federal mass hysteria about Aids' which had been
unleashed, he said, by Mr Seehofer's 'false alarm'.
Professor Hans Pohle, a leading Aids specialist, announced his resignation
from the national Aids advisory council in protest. In a letter to the
minister, he said there had been no reason to arouse a mass phobia.
Mr Seehofer, who has previously enjoyed a high political reputation,
particularly for pushing through drastic savings in the health service,
angrily rejected the criticism as 'irresponsible'. 'It is better to take one
preventive measure too many, than to run the risk of a single HIV
infection,' he said.

The fraudulent receipts at the root of the scam, allow companies to hide
profit totals and then transfer the money denied the tax man into a 'black'
money account. Double accounting is believed to be especially rampant in
property deals where the declared purchase prices, which are subject to tax,
are a fraction of the real total and the balance is paid in 'black' money.

FT  06 NOV 93 / German unemployment tops 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Germany rose above the 3.5m level in October, the highest
level since the second world war, reaching 7.6 per cent in the west and 15.3
per cent in the east, as the current wave of industrial redundancies took
its toll on the labour market.
The latest figures were greeted with a grim warning by Mr Rudolf Scharping,
leader of the opposition Social Democrats, that the rapid rise in
joblessness was a threat to the country's peace and social stability.
He called for an aggressive new labour market policy by the public sector,
involving direct wage subsidies to employers for a limited period, and
active measures for job creation.
However the prospects of a big wage confrontation in Germany's vital
engineering industry this winter loomed closer yesterday when the
Baden-Wurttemberg region of the IG Metall trade union tabled a claim for a
6.0 per cent pay rise.
On Thursday, North Rhine-Westphalia put in for 5.5 per cent.
Both claims have been flatly rejected by the engineering employers, who have
said that only a wage freeze would enable the industry to cut its costs.
The regions hardest hit by the latest increase in unemployment are the
formerly wealthiest states in the federal republic - Baden-Wurttemberg and
Bavaria - where Germany's machine-tool manufacturers, motor industry
suppliers, aerospace and other high technology employers are concentrated.
The figures published yesterday by the Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg
show unemployment in west Germany reached 2,358,847 last month, a
seasonally-unadjusted increase of 70,800 from September, and up almost
528,500 from one year ago.
The deterioration was less sharp in east Germany, where the number of
jobless reached 1,165,736 at the end of October, up 6,570 on September, and
up 68,300 on October 1992.
Short-time working in the west increased by 69,300 to 659,700, twice the
level of a year ago. It dropped marginally in east Germany, down 8,300 to
135,100.
Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the labour office, said that the rise in
unemployment in the west was a reflection both of the economic recession,
and of structural changes in industry.
In the east, however, it showed that labour market measures - such as job
creation schemes and retraining - were no longer capable of holding down the
absolute level of unemployment.
If all those in east Germany occupied in job creation schemes, retraining
and short-time working, and early retirement are added to the unemployed, it
suggests an underlying 'real' unemployment figure of more than 2.45m, which
is higher than for the whole of west Germany.
Mr Scharping's attack on the government's employment record came in a debate
on the German economy in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German
parlia-ment.
He called on the government to put unemployment as its very highest
priority, and urged the creation of a broader consensus among employers and
trade unions, government and opposition, to forge a common policy.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that the German economy needed to create 5m
competitive jobs. That required an 'innovation offensive' by German
industry, and a concerted effort to reduce the cost of labour.

FRANCE, Germany and Belgium yesterday inaugurated the Strasbourg
headquarters of the Eurocorps, designed to have 35-40,000 troops at its
disposal by 1995 and to form the possible nucleus of a future European army.
The defence ministers of Germany, Belgium and even France stressed that the
Eurocorps's aim was not to weaken the Nato alliance, but to strengthen its
European component.
The force will be at Nato commanders' disposal - though France has insisted
they must use it as a single unit - as well as providing forces for the
Western European Union, the intended defence arm of the newly-created
European Union.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, hailed the Eurocorps as 'the
central building stone' of a European defence, while saying: 'We do not want
to act separately from our American friends.'
But one difficulty quickly emerged yesterday when General Helmut Willman,
the Eurocorps' first commander, rebuffed the Belgian defence minister's
request that Dutch should be added to the corps' working languages of
French, German and English (which is used in Nato). 'Three languages is the
absolute maximum,' he said. The Belgian army operates bilingually in French
and Dutch.
The language problem has dogged the creation of the Eurocorps, whose kernel
is the 4,200-strong Franco-German brigade. When it was first set up in 1989,
the brigade tried speaking French and German on alternate days. When this
speedily proved impractical, soldiers in its tightly integrated units were
instructed to speak the language of the person they were addressing - in
other words, a French soldier is supposed to speak to a German colleague in
German, and vice versa.
The new joint force may prompt changes in the armaments industry.
In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Mr Henri Conze,
responsible for arms procurement in the French Defence Ministry, suggested a
joint Franco-German arms agency to help produce standardised equipment for
the Eurocorps.

FT  06 NOV 93 / French confidence in currency returns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE monetary authorities of Germany as well as France believe that 'sooner
or later' the French franc will strengthen on the foreign exchange markets
enough to return to its set central rate of FFr3.35 to the D-Mark, France's
Treasury chief, Mr Christian Noyer, claimed yesterday.
Mr Noyer's declaration to the press was the first time since the August
upheaval in the European Monetary System that the French authorities have
dared to detail publicly their hopes for the franc's future rate.
His statement reflects a return in official confidence, following recent
indicators that the French economy's current recession may not be as deep or
long as previously feared, and after a meeting of the Franco-German economic
and financial council this week.
Referring to the meeting, Mr Noyer claimed: 'There is not the shadow of a
doubt in the minds of all those in the German Finance Ministry and in the
Bundesbank that the equilibrium rate (for the franc), to which one will
return sooner or later, is the central rate.'
The August crisis in the EMS did not alter the franc/Mark central rate, but
widened the margin, from 2.25 to 15 per cent, by which the two currencies
could fluctuate either side of this central pivot. The franc, whose
pre-August floor against the D-Mark was FFr3.43, has since several times
sunk to a rate of FFr 3.50 or more, but was yesterday trading at FFr3.47.
Voicing a renewed confidence that, over time, France's lower inflation,
solid trade surplus and comparative competitiveness would work in the
franc's favour, Mr Noyer said that if real purchasing power were taken into
account, the franc's rate could even be above FFr3.35.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Ukraine nuclear 'tragedy' warning: Deteriorating warheads
pose threat of disaster 'worse than Chernobyl', visiting Russian minister
claims

<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S nuclear warheads have deteriorated to the point where 'a tragedy
worse than Chernobyl' could result, according to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
Russian foreign minister.
Mr Kozyrev, on a visit to Ukraine, told the official Russian news agency
Tass that he had been given 'extremely alarming information about the
technical state of a number of rockets' by Ukrainian officials soon after
arriving in Kiev yesterday.
He gave no details of the information but Russia has complained about the
130 ageing SS-19 strategic missiles and 46 more modern SS-24 missiles in
Ukraine, suggesting they are being kept in unsafe conditions.
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry confirmed last week that 20 of its older
generation SS-19 strategic missiles should be destroyed immediately.
'We know ourselves that 20 missiles are now reaching the end of their
operational life. The question has already arisen of how to destroy them and
where the money is to come from to do so.'
Ukraine, concerned about political instability in Russia, is now dragging
its heels about transferring the weapons and says it wants more compensation
and firm security guarantees.
The issue of destroying the missiles is involved a struggle between Ukraine
and the US government, which has agreed to put up the money needed for
dismantling but only in stages while Ukraine carries it out. Ukraine argues
that it should know the total financial package before it embarks on the
project.
Agreements were made between the Kiev government and Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state, at the end of last month during the latter's
visit to Kiev - but none has been put into practice.
Ukraine has promised to become a non-nuclear power, to sign the
non-proliferation treaty and the Start 1 and 2 agreements but has yet to do
so.
President Leonid Kravchuk, who has often shown impatience with the refusal
of his parliament to sign the necessary agreements, is under pressure from
nationalist politicians not to get rid of the 176 missiles but to retain
them as a deterrent to other powers, especially Russia.

FT  06 NOV 93 / UB Plasma scandal seen as 'isolated aberration'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BLOOD and the products made from it can never be completely safe,' says Dr
Harold Gunson, medical director of the UK National Blood Authority. 'The
nature of blood means that it may carry infections.'
Yet Dr Gunson and his European colleagues who are responsible for the safety
of blood supplies insist the risk of infection from a contaminated product
is less now than it has ever been. They regard Germany's UB Plasma scandal
as an isolated aberration.
The European blood industry, which has an estimated turnover of Pounds 1.5bn
a year, is a complicated mixture of private, public and charitable
enterprises. The UK, France, Belgium and Netherlands have relatively
centralised collection systems, run by the state or the Red Cross. They rely
on volunteers to give blood or plasma (the protein-rich liquid in which
blood cells float).
In the fragmented German system, however, state agencies, the Red Cross and
companies such as UB Plasma all collect from paid donors. A German typically
receives DM35 (Pounds 14.20) per donation.
Some of the blood or plasma is used directly for transfusion and some is
processed into a range of medicines such as factor VIII, immuno-globulins
and albumin. For example, Immuno AG, an international pharmaceutical group
based in Austria, incorporated material from UB Plasma in products sold in
several European countries. These were withdrawn from sale yesterday.
In the UK, the Medicines Control Agency told doctors that Immuno was
recalling eight batches of immuno-globulin and albumin.
'This measure is purely precautionary and is to ensure total patient
safety,' said Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's Chief Medical Officer.
'There is no evidence that HIV has been transmitted by these two products.'
But Europe as a whole produces only half of the 6.3m litres of plasma it
consumes each year. Most of the remainder is imported at a cost of Dollars
650m (Pounds 430m) a year from the US, where it comes from paid donors.
The EC has been committed since 1989 to eventual 'self-sufficiency through
voluntary unpaid donations', on the grounds that volunteers are less likely
to be infected with organisms such as HIV, the Aids virus. Although little
has been done yet to implement the policy, the EC is under pressure from the
European Parliament to take stronger action to boost local production and
phase out imports
The commercial sector is lobbying strongly against import restrictions. It
says regulations imposed by the Food and Drug Administration mean that
procedures for screening donors and eliminating infection from plasma are
superior in the US.
But, in principle, all industrialised countries now maintain similar safety
precautions for blood products. The first barrier is to make sure that
donors - whether paid or not - have neither a medical history nor a
lifestyle associated with high risk of infection. Questionnaires and
interviews are designed to exclude drug addicts and homosexuals.
Then the fresh plasma or blood is tested for syphilis, hepatitis B and C,
and HIV. These tests are not infallible. Dr Gunson estimates that there is
about a 'one in a million' chance that HIV will escape detection in any
given donation; there is a period of several weeks after an individual has
been infected with HIV, during which the antibody tests used for the virus
give a negative result.
Since HIV testing started in 1985, there has been only one known case of
contamination in the UK. It resulted in two Scottish patients becoming
infected with HIV.
If the plasma is processed into medicines, further safety precautions are
taken, including 'pasteurisation'.
But Dr Robert Westphal, medical adviser to the International Federation of
Red Cross Societies in Geneva, says viruses occasionally slip through even
the current pasteurisation techniques. He worries too about new unknown
viruses. 'Remember the early 1980s, when we didn't know that Aids was caused
by the HIV,' Dr Westphal warns. 'What's out there now?'
In the long term, the only way of guaranteeing that blood products are free
of contamination will be to make them artificially from non-human
ingredients. That will not happen on a large scale until well into the next
century.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN police have arrested 14 supporters of Mr Vojislav Seselj, in a move
to destroy popular backing for the one-time ultra-nationalist ally of Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, in the run-up to elections next
month.
A police statement on Thursday night said those arrested were members of the
Serbian Chetniks, the paramilitary wing of Mr Seselj's Radical party, and
were charged with committing violent crimes against civilians.
The arrests represent the most direct admission by Belgrade that
paramilitaries from Serbia committed what amount to war crimes, including
murders and rape, on Bosnian and Serbian territory.
But instead of reflecting a crackdown on war criminals, the arrests appear
merely to signal the settling of scores by Mr Milosevic against Mr Seselj.
Indeed, Serbia's state-run media are promoting Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known
as Arkan, another MP who commands a fierce paramilitary group.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Heavy falls hit stock markets: FT-SE 100 drops 63.4 points
but Wall Street recovers at close
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARP declines in US and European bond and stock markets this week have
prompted fears that the strong performance of both this year could be
reversed.
US Treasury bond prices fell for the sixth consecutive day yesterday,
dragging European bonds down with them, while most of the world's leading
stock markets also fell heavily.
In London yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index dropped 63.4 points to close at
3,085.6, the biggest single day's fall since a 103-point slide on October 5
last year. Share prices in Paris, Frankfurt and other continental European
markets also suffered large declines.
'We are at a crossroads for all the markets, but I'm not sure we can say we
are into a bear market,' said Mr Kirit Shah, a market strategist in London
with First Chicago.
The immediate weakness was triggered by a sell-off in the US Treasury bond
market, where strong economic data have fuelled expectations that short-term
interest rates may start to rise again next year.
This persuaded traders and investors to take some of the profits they have
accumulated in this year's rally by selling some of their US bond holdings.
Profit-taking in the US bond market was quickly imitated in Europe, even
though most European economies show little sign of economic recovery, and
are expected to benefit from further short-term interest rate cuts in the
coming months. 'We are approaching the end of a year which has truly been
the year of the bond,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international strategist
at Midland Global Markets. 'People have made spectacular profits from this
year's bull market and they want to lock them in.'
US bond prices fell sharply yesterday after a stronger-than-expected October
employment report. In late New York trading, the benchmark 30-year bond
yield had reached 6.21 per cent, the highest since mid-August. In two weeks,
the 30-year yield has now risen by nearly half a percentage point. Price
falls in European bond markets yesterday ranged from a slight drop in
Germany to more than a point in UK gilts. Prices in France, Italy and Spain
lost several points during the week.
'The US market is a nasty magnet for Europe, but it's the first real
correction for European bonds in six months,' said Mr Gordon Ross, director
of invest ments at Lombard Odier Invest ment Mangement, the Swiss bank's
London-based fund management arm.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell by 36.89 to 3,624.98 on
Thursday, was undermined yesterday by further weakness in the US bond market
in early trading. Bargain buying, however, and a renewed focus by investors
on the good economic news, helped the Dow rebound from its early 25-point
loss to end the day up 18.45 at 3,643.43, but still well below its record
high of 3,697.64 on Tuesday. Profit-taking has spread to stock markets
because of fears that dividend yields will appear unattractively low if bond
yields rise too far.
France's CAC-40 index lost 2.6 per cent yesterday and nearly 5 per cent over
the week. Germany's Dax index, which celebrated its high for the year as
recently as Tuesday, lost 2.4 per cent yesterday.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share index fell 1.9 per cent to 18,590.46, a drop
of 5.6 per cent on the week and more than 12 per cent since its September
high.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Weinberg plans fresh assault on insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR MARK WEINBERG, one of Britain's leading innovators in the sales of
financial products, is to have another attempt at shaking up the country's
insurance industry.
Sir Mark, the prime mover behind the successes of Abbey Life and Allied
Dunbar, yesterday announced the creation of a venture which aims to take
over existing life insurance companies and link with a bank or building
society to sell financial products to its customers.
The venture will be backed by St James's Place Capital, the investment
company run by Sir Mark and Lord Rothschild, Scottish Amicable, the mutual
life insurance company, and J Rothschild Assurance Holdings.
Scottish Amicable already has links with the group since it carries out
administration for J Rothschild Assurance, of which Sir Mark is also
chairman.
The venture plans to acquire life companies, stop selling new policies and
manage their funds more efficiently by streamlining the administration. It
will also seek to create a joint venture with a bank or building society,
taking a minority stake. The two elements of the business might eventually
be run separately.
Mr David Beynon, a long-time colleague of Sir Mark at Allied Dunbar, will be
chief executive of the project. He said yesterday that the UK life insurance
industry faced 'a tremendous amount of restructuring'.
By the end of the decade, he predicted, the number of companies would have
dropped by about one-third from the present 195.
Overcapacity is widely recognised as a problem and next year companies will
face new rules under which sales agents will have to give potential
customers more information about their products.
Traditional life companies are also facing growing competition from
'bancassurance', the sale of life insurance products through banks and
building societies.
The entry into the market of the new venture will add to the pressures which
these trends are already exerting to reduce costs. It should intensify
companies' efforts both to retain existing customers and attract new ones by
cutting margins and developing a wider range of products.
Mr Beynon said there were some 20-25 life companies in the market, and that
he was 'looking actively' at eight as possible acquisitions.
He said existing policyholders would benefit from the closure of a fund,
since it no longer had to carry the costs of attracting new business, such
as training and maintaining a large salesforce.
Mr Beynon resigned earlier this year as managing director of Midland Bank's
personal financial services division to head the new project. He had
previously worked for Sir Mark during 17 years at Allied Dunbar.
Sir Mark, 62, set up Abbey Life - one of the first companies to introduce
unit-linked assurance policies - in 1961. Ten years later, he founded Hambro
Life, which was subsequently renamed Allied Dunbar.
His links with Lord Rothschild led to his departure in 1990 from Allied
Dunbar after it was bought by BAT Industries. Lord Rothschild had
participated with Sir James Goldsmith and Mr Kerry Packer in an unsuccessful
bid for BAT.
In 1991, Sir Mark helped to set up J Rothschild Assurance, to which he
brought some of his former colleagues from Allied Dunbar.

FT  06 NOV 93 / QMH non-executive directors resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, PEGGY HOLLINGER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO remaining non-executive directors to survive a reshuffle in June at
Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group which last week reported losses of more
than Pounds 1bn, resigned abruptly yesterday amid allegations that they had
been misled over the company's financial position.
Mr David Howell, MP and former cabinet minister, and Mr John Gale, a retired
senior executive with National Westminster Bank in the US, departed after a
week of questioning over the directors' responsibilities in the running of
the company under previous management.
Mr Howell said: 'I have sought to perform my non-executive duties
conscientiously throughout my appointment and particularly during an
extremely difficult period for QMH in recent months. In certain significant
matters I believe non-executives were clearly misled.'
QMH last week released figures restating a Pounds 90.4m pre-tax profit for
1991 as a Pounds 56.3m loss, and alleged that the company had in the past
paid illegal dividends without adequate resources.
The company said the two non-executives had previously agreed to requests
from the new board to stay on to assist with management changes and
restructuring. These changes followed months of negotiations with bankers.
'With this phase under way (they) have agreed to stand down,' the company
said.
Separately, Morgan Grenfell, now the merchant bank for QMH, revealed the
extent of a breach of the deed of its debenture stocks after a revaluation
of the properties which provided security for the bonds. The 1991 accounts
show the company has Pounds 215m in mortgage debenture stocks secured
against assets including 27 of the group's hotels.
The deeds require that the security should be worth at least 150 per cent of
the nominal value of the stock outstanding. But the valuation by Jones Lang
Wootton received by the trustees on Thursday showed security of only 67 per
cent of the value - a shortfall of Pounds 178.5m. The trustees would
potentially have the right to demand repayment of the bonds.
The company has appealed to stockholders to waive temporarily this breach of
the trust deed.
A meeting is scheduled to be held soon to seek their approval.

FT  06 NOV 93 / Yeltsin scraps election pledge: Term of parliament's
deputies cut as Russian leader looks to make his position impregnable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has secured a deal with Russia's regional leaders
designed to make his position and powers unassailable before the end of
1996, according to a close aide.
Mr Boris Zolotukhin, his aide on the constitution, said yesterday Mr Yeltsin
had withdrawn his pledge to hold presidential elections next year and had
cut the first term of parliamentary deputies from four to two years.
The agreement reached this week between the president and leaders of the
country's 88 republics and regions appears to seal his total authority over
the country for at least two years. It will appear in an addendum to the new
draft constitution, due to be published next week, and will take effect if
approved by a simple majority in a referendum, due at the same time as
parliamentary elections on December 12.
The agreement will:
limit the period of the first parliament, or federal assembly, to two years
rather than the four previously announced;
see members of the upper house, or federation council, elected for the first
session only - thereafter the upper house will be composed of delegates
nominated by the regions;
let ministers who are elected as deputies keep both their ministerial and
deputies' seats, at least in the first parliament;
include in the constitution a clause saying the republics and regions are
'sovereign', but only so that this 'sovereignty' does not weaken the
sovereignty of the federation or other regions.
This clause was included to save face among the republics, but is seen by
the presidential side as meaningless. The net effect of changes will be to
strengthen both the presidency and the regions, at the expense of the as-yet
voiceless parliament.
It also makes a presidential election next June 'very unlikely', according
to Mr Yeltsin's close advisers.
However, the presidential press office said it had no official confirmation
of this, and that the position remained that he would stand for re-election
next June. Mr Mikhail Mityukov, head of the presidential Commission for
Legal Projects, told the Sevodnya newspaper that if the constitution was
approved by the referendum 'any question of pre-term elections of the
president falls'.
The addendum to the constitution defines a two-year 'transitional period',
throughout which the president must carry out his functions, Mr Mityukov
said.
Mr Yeltsin has already heralded agreement with the regional leaders on the
main body of the draft constitution.
Reuter adds: The US will not press Mr Yeltsin to run for re-election in
June, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told the House foreign
affairs committee yesterday. The US regarded the referendum and the
parliamentary elections as the important events, he said.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: London SE issues leaks guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday issued proposed guidance intended to
curb the selective leaking of price-sensitive information to market
participants which can give rise to insider dealing.
However, the guidance stops well short of either defining price-sensitive
information or requiring quarterly financial reporting, two measures sought
by investor groups.
Requirements for unaudited quarterly reporting were also supported by many
members of the Exchange's own Large Companies Advisory Committee,
particularly those whose shares are traded on US exchanges and have coped
easily with quarterly reporting requirements there.
The guidance is the result of efforts begun in late summer, in conjunction
with the 100 Group of Finance Directors and shareholder and industry analyst
associations. The move followed the exchange's first-ever censure of a
traded company, LIG, for telling a group of analysts about its financial
condition and concerns about the nature of insider dealing rules contained
in the new criminal justice bill.
Shareholders have urged more frequent public reporting, saying the longer
price-sensitive information is kept inside the company the greater the
opportunity for individuals to profit from public ignorance.

<TEXT>
NORGESKREDITT, the Norwegian private sector mortgage bank, yesterday
announced a sharp rise in nine months pre-tax profit to NKr219.8m (Dollars
29.9m) from NKr98m, helped by an increase in net interest income and
securities gains.
Group nine-month net interest income rose by NKr52.3m to NKr229.6m as last
year's NKr7.8m in securities losses were transformed into gains of NKr71m
this year.
At the net level, profits more than doubled to NKr158.3m from NKr70.6m.
Operating costs rose to NKr48.7m from NKr41.1m as losses on loans and
guarantees fell to NKr41.6m from NKr47m. Norgeskreditt said the aggregate
principal amount of loans in default for more than 90 days rose to NKr175.5m
from NKr156.7m.
'These loans are not in default with regard to the payment of the agreed
interest,' Norgeskreditt explained.
Mr Trond Wennberg, president, forecast the bank would achieve growth of 5 to
10 per cent in loan volume by the mid-1990s. Demand for loans has been
higher this year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group after Munich
Reinsurance, is raising up to SFr700m (Dollars 466m) in 1994 and 1995
through option-based rights issues.
These would be in addition to the previously announced 1-for-10 rights issue
later this year to raise SFr575m.
Mr Arnold Saxer, chairman, said that the funds were needed to strengthen the
group's capital base, whose growth was not keeping pace with that of premium
income.
'These capital-raising plans are important. We would not undertake them if
we did not have confidence in the future,' Mr Saxer said.
He forecast that 1993 net income would be at least 10 per cent higher than
last year's SFr281m. Premium income was expected to rise 15 per cent. Last
year, premium income was up 25.6 per cent to SFr21.9bn.
Losses from catastrophes were expected to be lower this year and income was
being boosted by premium rate increases in the accident and liability areas.
The capital raising for 1994 and 1995 is by way of two sets of options that
will be given to shareholders, one exerciseable until the end of 1994, the
other until the end of 1995.
The options will be distributed on the basis of one option of each type per
bearer or registered share held following imminent 5-for-1 splits. Every 20
options will entitle the holder to purchase one registered share from the
group treasury at a price to be fixed on November 24.
This year's conventional rights issue is on the basis of one new bearer or
registered share for every 10 shares (post splits) or participation
certificates. The price, expected to be about SFr475 a share, will be set on
November 24.
Movenpick, the Swiss restaurant and hotels group, said its sales in the
first nine months rose 3.7 per cent and it anticipated a 30 per cent rise in
1993 net income over last year's depressed SFr6.5m.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Gloom as Japanese stock market falls 2.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM over the Japanese economy deepened yesterday as the Tokyo stock market
plunged 2.2 per cent, closing below 19,000 for the first time in eight
months.
The fall is another blow to Japan's financial system, which is already
staggering from the failure this week of Muramoto Construction, the biggest
postwar corporate collapse.
Last week's partial listing of East Japan Railway, the semi-privatised
railway group, is being blamed for the weakness. The Tokyo market has
declined in six out of seven trading days since the flotation, losing 1,300
points, or 6.7 per cent.
Officials and brokers had hoped JR East would restore the confidence of
investors. Instead, they were discouraged by the halt in trading of its
shares last week, as selling orders for the stock jammed the computer system
at the Tokyo stock exchange.
Since hitting Y600,000 at its initial trading price, JR East has fallen 18
per cent. The declines have dragged down the Nikkei, which retreated 431.45
to 18,949.79 yesterday.
Brokers also blamed the market's fall on the absence of stock purchases by
public pension funds, which have actively supported share prices since last
March, only to disappear after the listing of JR East.
Meanwhile leading blue chip companies have started to announce large-scale
staff cuts.
The recent spate of corporate interim results has indicated further
deterioration in profits, as many companies have revised down earnings
estimates for the year to March. 'This loss of confidence among business
managers is really frightening,' said a fund manager at Nippon Life, the
leading life assurer.
However, with ministry of finance officials wishing to offload other
state-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining regional
railway companies, the stock market may see another round of public pension
fund support.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Early policy role urged for monetary institute: Belgium
proposes agenda for new body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned European Monetary Institute could start actively co-ordinating
the monetary policies of Community member states with low inflation after it
begins operations in January, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance
minister, suggested yesterday.
At a seminar on economic and monetary union organised by the Federal Trust
for Education and Research and Salomon Brothers International, Mr Maystadt
floated the idea of low-inflation EC countries agreeing a common monetary
growth target. The EMI could then use this to organise monetary
co-ordination and monitor progress towards the achievement of durable price
stability in the Community.
The minister, who is current president of the European Community council of
economics and finance ministers, also suggested the EMI might take over
announcing policy decisions such as interest rate changes of member central
banks agreeing to a common monetary target during the second stage of Emu
which begins in January.
The EMI, which will be based in Frankfurt and is seen as a forerunner of a
European central bank, has so far been given only vague guidance on the
scope of its operations and Mr Maystadt's remarks yesterday represented an
attempt to set an agenda for the institute.
In view of the 'rather long' second stage for Emu, it was important to
launch a qualitative step towards further European integration and to ensure
that the EMI is not perceived as an empty shell, he said. Mr May-stadt said
that national central banks would continue to make independent monetary
policy decisions. But he admitted his idea of an EC monetary target would
push the bankers and the EMI towards the 'ultimate goal of conducting a
single monetary policy at Community level'.
Not surprisingly, his approach gained no UK support. Mr Christopher Taylor,
the Bank of England's chief European adviser, said the EMI's role should be
advisory and consultative.
Mr Maystadt warned the EC against trying to operate the European exchange
rate mechanism with widened 15 per cent fluctuation margins until full
monetary union. The approach of Emu could trigger competitive currency
depreciation and threaten the EC single market, he said.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Kopper defends banks' success in recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S leading private sector banker yesterday delivered a ringing
defence of the role of banks in the country's economy.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, denounced 'the sweeping
disparagements' of newspapers and politicians who have denounced the power
and prosperity of the the big German banks amid the country's worst
recession since the second world war.
Germany's big commercial banks enjoyed a record year last year and the
increase in profits have been sustained this year, despite a worsening of
the domestic credit environment, because of buoyant conditions in world
securities markets.
This has been in marked contrast to the ill fortune of the industrial sector
and has led to criticism that the banks are profiteering at their customers'
expense, for example by not passing on the benefits of falling interest
rates.
Mr Kopper delivered his remarks to an audience of senior businessmen
gathered to celebrate the opening of the Trianon tower, the bank's third
skyscraper in the heart of Germany's financial district. The ceremony was in
itself a celebration of the bank's immunity to the downturn.
Mr Kopper told his guests that the stability of the German banking system
was the envy of the rest of the world. He reminded them that banks which did
not make profits ended up being bailed out by taxpayers, pointing to the US,
where taxpayers have had to find Dollars 180bn to rescue the savings and
loans organisations.
The German universal banking system  - which allows banks to undertake all
manner of financial services business under one roof  - may have its faults,
Mr Kopper conceded, such as lack of transparency. But it was still the best
banking system in the world.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of asylum applicants seeking refuge in Germany last month
totalled 16,660, nearly the same as the previous month, but two-thirds lower
than the same period last year, the federal interior minister announced
yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The figures are expected to fall further in view of the new asylum law,
scrapping article 16 of the constitution giving asylum seekers an automatic
right to stay in Germany, which came into force in July. It also cut the
monthly living allowances to asylum seekers on Monday, from an average of
DM589 (Pounds 239.40) to DM440. There were further cuts in clothing and
medical funds.
Nearly half the refugees entering Germany last month came from the former
Yugoslavia, a trend which has continued unabated since the war erupted in
June 1991. Germany has provided refuge to over 460,000 inhabitants from the
region. Since January, over 72,000 refugees, including 18,200 from Bosnia,
have settled in the country.
Romanians account for the second largest group. Over 72,000 have entered
Germany since January, including 1,400 in October. Many of the refugees
belong to the Gypsy community, or are poor.
The interior ministry said these numbers were slowly decreasing largely
because amendments to the law meant border guards could send back
individuals if they entered from a third, safe country. The authorities have
decided on 41,000 cases, of which 4.4 per have been allowed to stay.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is unlikely to receive further funding from the international
financial institutions or the Group of Seven industrial countries this year,
according to senior G7 officials.
This is in spite of strong pressure from Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance
minister.
Introducing a new package of austerity measures yesterday, he said the
second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the systemic transformation facility from
the International Monetary Fund should be paid by the end of the year  - a
much-needed sign of confidence in the reform process.
However, foreign observers say inflation, at between 21-24 per cent in
September alone, is not yet on a firmly declining trend, while the budget
deficit will reach at least 10 per cent of gross national product this year
in spite of efforts to trim it.
The provisional budget deficit for the fourth quarter  - set at Rbs5,200bn -
is seen as unachievable because it would invole cuts to agricultural credits
and other programmes which cannot be reduced without grave damage to the
country's economy.
This means the IMF's second tranche is unlikely to be seriously considered
until early next year, by which time a new government will be in place as a
result of elections on December 12.
The government has been working to an economic plan which was agreed with
the IMF for the final three months of the year, but has met few of the
targets for inflation, budget deficit or credit flows. Hostility between Mr
Fyodorov and Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, remains
strong, hindering efforts to achieve an agreed level of credits and to
co-ordinate the fight against inflation. Russia is pressing for a meeting
with G7 finance and foreign ministers in Moscow in either December or
January, to review the progress of reforms.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Lithuania and Poland haunted by old conflicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HISTORY'S ghosts are again straining relations between Lithuania and Poland.
The latest dispute, ironically, centres on a prospective friendship treaty
 -and illustrates the barriers to co-operation and potential for friction
across eastern Europe.
Since negotiations began in July, Lithuania has demanded that Poland admit
the 1920 annexation of Vilnius, the capital, by the Polish General Lucjan
Zeligowski was illegal.
The temporary loss of Vilnius remains a bitter pill in Lithuania, and a
potent symbol for the right.
On the barricades around parliament, left over from the television tower
battle with Soviet troops three years ago, a large hand-scrawled slogan
reads 'Ribbentrop-Molotov-Zeligowski', drawing together the German, Russian
and Polish figures who cut up the Baltic country this century.
But the Polish government refuses to take the historical blame, partly out
of concern that this would place the legal rights of the Polish minority  -
around 18 per cent of Vilnius' and 8 per cent of Lithuania's 3.7m population
 - in jeopardy, in that they could be be seen as illegal colonists.
The roots of the conflict go back to 1385 when the two states united and
eventually formed the formidable Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which ruled
from the Baltic to the Black Seas. By 1920, Vilnius had an overwhelming
majority of Polish and Jewish residents, and few Lithuanians.
Today's Polish community is a fraction of the pre-war population, and
presses for political and language rights.
But at the Polish-Lithuanian border, the dispute over Gen Zeligowski's
annexation has held up progress on opening the frontier. Cars and trucks
still queue up for as long as a week, holding up trade at an important link
between central and northern Europe. Partly as a result, the Via Baltica
project, a 1000km super-highway connecting Germany with the Balts and
Finland, remains a distant dream.
Lithuania's tattered economy has benefitted little from a common border with
Poland, its wealthiest neighbour. Foreign investment, essential to recovery,
has been a disappointment: Poland still has the most joint-ventures in
Lithuania, but total capital inflow will be only Dollars 40m this year,
according to World Bank estimates.
A fifth round of negotiations with Poland's government is expected to start
soon.
Mr Czeslaw Milosz, a Polish writer and Nobel laureate who grew up in
Vilnius, says the Lithuanian right has opened a 'Pandora's box' on the
issue. 'There comes a time when we have to say: no more, for the common good
of these nations.'
But Mr Tomas Venclova, a leading Lithuanian poet and Yale literature
professor, believes quite the opposite. The whole world, including Poland,
must see 'that Vilnius belongs to Lithuania,' he recently told Kurier
Wilensky, a Polish language daily.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Yeltsin accused of impeding fair Russian election: EC
delegation hears litany of complaints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is thwarting a free and fair election by depriving
opposition parties and groups of media coverage and facilities to organise
ahead of the polls due in December, a European parliamentary delegation was
told in Moscow this week.
Allegations of corruption have also been made against some of the parties
trying to collect the required 100,000 signatures needed by midnight tonight
to qualify for registration.
At least 32 main parties are trying to gather the signatures and most are
likely to qualify.
Ms Magdalena Hoff, leader of a delegation of European Community
parliamentarians which visited Moscow this week, heard a litany of
complaints about the electoral process, the most serious from parties on the
communist left and nationalist right.
The strongest allegation came from Mr Sergei Baburin, leader of the Russian
National Union and a former hardline deputy, who said that his telephone and
those of many of his colleagues had been cut off and he had been told he
could meet foreign correspondents in his home only with the permission of
the authorities.
Mr Baburin said that the home telephones of all those deputies who had
stayed in the Russian parliament throughout the siege had been cut. He said
the loss of communications made it difficult to organise the collection of
signatures.
Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, said he had
written to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, asking for a
meeting to protest against media bias  - but had received no reply.
'At the moment, news broadcasts begin with (Mr Yegor) Gaidar (the first
deputy prime minister and head of the liberal Russia's Choice group) and end
with Gaidar.'
Like Mr Baburin, he complained bitterly about the continued suppression of
far right and left papers, such as Sovyetskaya Rossiya and Den.
From the centrist groups, Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the Civic Union, said
that the press  - much of it still subsidised by the state  - was heavily
biased in favour of the pro-presidential groups, such as Russia's Choice. He
had told Mr Hoff, he said, that 'we don't need observers on election day, we
need them now'.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party, said the presidentially
appointed heads of administration in the regions and republics had been told
to use their offices to gather signatures for themselves.
He said calling elections on a tight schedule with unclear rules 'had one
justification  - securing the legitimacy of the current power. It is
political piracy'. He admitted, however, that it could avert a social
explosion.
Most of the main groups now claim to have or be near to securing the
signatures needed for registration  - but there are numerous allegations of
buying votes.
Mr Volsky said votes were being bought for packets of cigarettes (though not
by his group)  - while the daily Izvestia gave a number of instances,
witnessed by its correspondents, of candidates paying what appears to be a
going rate of 100 roubles (about 6p) per signature.

FT  05 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mitel bounces back
to profit

<TEXT>
Correction (published 8th November 1993) appended to this article.
MITEL, Ottawa-based maker of switches, semiconductors and other
telecommunications equipment, has continued its recovery with a
second-quarter profit of CDollars 5m (USDollars 3.7m) or 4 cents a share
against a loss of CDollars 3.7m or 6 cents a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 115m against CDollars 98m.
Six-month earnings were CDollars 8m or 6 cents against a loss of CDollars
10.7m or 16 cents.
British Telecom sold its 51 per cent control of Mitel to Schroders, the UK
merchant bank, for CDollars 40m in June 1992. Schroders has since reduced
its interest.
CORRECTION
A COMPANY advised by Schroder Ventures purchased 51 per cent of Mitel last
year, and not Schroders, the UK merchant bank, as wrongly stated on Friday.

FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Medeva unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in Medeva was in a state of flux yesterday after a court ruling over
its patent battle for its Hepatitis B drug took many by surprise.
Early in the session Medeva shares rose strongly on speculation that the
ruling, which had been widely tipped to be announced yesterday - a few weeks
earlier than expected - would be positive for the company. The price moved
up and even as some unofficial news filtered into the market that the ruling
had gone against Medeva, traders found it difficult to believe and the rise
continued. The shares hit a high of 135p, from 125p.
But a sell-off began as nerves started to grip the market and turnover rose.
Official confirmation of the ruling accelerated the slide and the price
rapidly headed towards its day's low of 109p.
A rally was mustered as the market digested the company's statement that it
would appeal against the judgment on its patent dispute with Biogen.
Turnover at the close was a hefty 14m, putting Medeva as the fourth most
heavily traded stock yesterday in the market.
One analyst said that the panic reaction to the ruling was understandable as
the company's medium and long-term future largely hinges on its Hepatitus B
drug. The shares closed at 119 1/2 p.
Other pharmaceuticals had a fairly unremarkable day. Wellcome continued to
bounce back after its poorly received figures with a rise of 11 to 716p.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' moved up 2 1/2 to 418p and Zeneca, still enjoying
positive sentiment over its heart drug, added 3 at 771p.
Figures from Boots sent the shares tumbling, before rallying as analysts and
institutions returned from what was seen as a positive post-results meeting
with the management. They were eventually 6 ahead at 511p after turnover of
8.8m.
Although the headline figure was at the bottom end of expectations, there
were a number of exceptional costs and the underlying performance from the
group's core businesses was considered generally satisfactory by many stores
analysts. Most edged their full-year forecasts up to around Pounds 470m.
Food retailers remained under a cloud as the sector reeled from the results
from J. Sainsbury on Wednesday and the supermarket group's talk of price
cuts and tight margins. A number of brokers were negative towards the
sector, although there were few fundamental changes of view. Sainsbury
slipped a further 9 to 376p in big turnover of nearly 7m. Argyll Group
declined 5 to 269p and Kwik Save 6 to 614p.
Food manufacturers were a similar story, with shares falling on the
continuing poor sentiment. Associated British Foods retreated 8 to 477p,
with Kleinwort Benson and James Capel said to be negative. Dalgety receded 9
to 442p as a big placing of 4.9m shares at 430p was recorded.
Shares slipped back in the telecoms sector as the market digested two sets
of results. Figures from BT were said by analysts to be generally pleasing,
but the level of dividend growth disappointed some. The fully-paid shares
fell 9 to 467 1/2 p, while the partly-paid slipped 10 to 217 1/2 p, the
latter on 23m traded.
BT's comments about the growth of fibre optic cabling helped BICC rise 6 to
403p. There was also some talk of BT using its brand for Cellnet, a hint
that some in the market took to mean that BT was about to buy out
Securicor's share of the cellular system. Securicor put on 5 at 1120p. BT
was also said to be distancing itself from recent speculation that it was
eyeing Thorn EMI, which eased 3 to 968p.
Results from Hong Kong Telecom, 58 per cent-owned by Cable and Wireless,
came in line with expectations, but C&amp;W shares were reined in by
profit-taking, losing 13 at 480p.
Royal Bank of Scotland put on 3 at 367p after reports that Smith New Court
was positive.
SG Warburg, which announces its interims next Tuesday, ended 9 off at 909p,
after dipping below 900p at one stage.
Some nervousness ahead of impending interim results left BOC Group 11 down
at 651p in a generally weak chemicals sector. Its results are due in just
under a fortnight. Courtaulds, which posts its half-time figures the
following day, weakened 11 to 480p.

FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest soared in British Petroleum after much better than expected
third-quarter figures, and the shares climbed 9 1/2 to a two-year high of
356 1/2 p.
Activity expanded rapidly to 25m shares traded, making BP the market's top
turnover stock of the day. Most analysts moved swiftly to upgrade their
forecasts after the figures were released.
Some notes of caution were struck in the generally enthusiastic reception,
with one analyst suggesting that the fourth-quarter figures were unlikely to
be as exciting.
A spot of US selling was also seen as those transatlantic investors who have
been supporting the stock recently saw an ideal chance to bail out with a
profit. UK institutions were reported to be more than keen to mop up the
outflow from the US sellers as they rushed to remedy underweight positions
in the stock.
One cautious stance came from Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, who said
the brokerage firm would retain its overvalued rating on BP in spite of the
figures, arguing that the share price had pushed past a reasonable level.
The gloss from BP rubbed off on some other oil stocks. Shell Transport,
which reports third-quarter figures next Thursday, rose 8 1/2 to 723 1/2 p
in healthy volume of 7.3m. Enterprise Oil, in which 10m shares were traded -
the bulk of which came through three block placings totalling 8.8m at 476
1/2 p - firmed 3 to 479p.

FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters upset by Ofwat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER shares moved erratically after the much-vaunted report from Ofwat, the
regulatory body, over the industry's future pricing policies. Although the
rate of return that will be allowed after 1995 was considered disappointing
by some water specialists, there were other elements of the report which
were thought to be more positive.
The fact that there is to be no clawback of previous revenues, as had been
feared by some, gave the shares an initial spurt as the Ofwat announcement
was made to the market. Analysts also garnered some satisfaction over the
length of time allowed for in converging the companies and Ofwat target rate
of returns.
However, the shares began slipping back as analysts studied the detail of
the report. There was also a rumour - not helped by the fact that brokers
received the couriered report at different times - that Ofwat was planning
to control the rate of dividend increase. This was not the case, but the
weight of the report did reinforce the conclusion for some analysts that the
water companies faced a new and tougher environment.
Recommending an 'underweight' investment position, Ms Angela Whelan at BZW
said: 'The glory days for the water stocks are over. Their attractions are
diminishing and the pace of dividend growth in the rest of the market is
fast catching up.'
Meanwhile, SG Warburg took a more positive view, reinforcing its stance with
the issue of a warrant - a tradeable derivative giving investors the option
to buy shares in the future - on selected water stocks. The broker, assuming
some weakness in the sector following the issuing of the Ofwat report,
issued the warrant in the afternoon session. Thames (6 shares), Severn Trent
(6 shares), Southern (3 shares) and Yorkshire (3 shares) are the basket
stocks chosen, with a strike price of 98p for an underlying price of Pounds
99.81. Yesterday, the warrant price had slipped to 97.5p, although the
underlying shares stayed around the same price.
Severn Trent shares closed 10 down at 548p, as did Thames, at 540p, with
Yorkshire off 11 at 552p and Southern the same amount at 571p. The Recs were
also weak on concern that Offer, the electricity industry body, could adopt
a tougher regulatory regime.

FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE steep declines throughout many equity markets undermined confidence in
stock index futures, during a session of intense activity which saw the
premium of the future over the cash market shrink to around two points,
writes Steve Thompson.
A weak overnight Wall Street, plus flurries of selling across European
markets, triggered heavy downside pressure in the Footsie December future at
the outset of trading. The contract fell through the 3,150 level to the
day's low of 3,143 in mid-morning.
Thereafter, a good rally set in, with December pushed up to the day's high
of 3,167 over the lunchtime period, as traders anticipated a steady opening
by Wall Street, before sliding back during the late afternoon to close at
3,153.
Dealers said most of the big activity had been concentrated in the 3,150 to
3,160 band, with bears said to be increasingly worried that any further
weakness in US bonds could trigger a rise in US interest rates and shift
back substantial US funds from Europe to the US market. 'There is a real
concern that some of the 'hot money' in this market could move elsewhere,'
said one leading trader. Turnover expanded to more than 12,000 contracts.
BP headed the list of most active traded stock options, with 2,400 lots
dealt after the group surprised the market with much better than expected
third-quarter results.

<TEXT>
A WORLDWIDE decline in equity markets engulfed a UK stock market regarded by
many observers as overvalued and drove share prices sharply lower yesterday.
However, a rally, prompted mainly by a relatively steady opening on Wall
Street, left the London market well above its lowest levels by the close of
trading. Dealers said London had been upset by fears that a move to
repatriate US funds could follow a shift to tighter monetary policy in the
US.
Helping the market kick against big losses throughout Continental bourses
was an excellent set of third quarter figures from British Petroleum,
triggering an all round good performance from the rest of the all-important
oil sector.
The FT-SE 100-share Index ended a volatile session a net 13.3 lower at
3,149.0, while the FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem, closing 16.9 off at
3,500.4.
Big falls in the world's most important stock markets overnight and early
yesterday set the tone for what was always going to be a difficult trading
session in London. Wall Street retreated sharply from its record high level,
troubled by another sizeable decline in US bonds which in turn triggered a
flurry of selling pressure in US equities.
Far eastern markets took their cue from the US with Tokyo sliding 430 points
on the Nikkei index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng - a weak market in recent
sessions - losing 147 points.
The FT-SE 100 index began the session almost twenty points lower and staged
a minor rally during the first hour of trading, picking up to show a 5 point
decline before coming under another bout of downside pressure. This drove
the 100 index down to the day's low point of 3,133.9 in mid-morning.
Wall Street's better-than-expected opened helped UK prices stabilise towards
the close, although dealers noted signs of more selling pressure building up
during the last 30 minutes of trading when one of the leading UK
marketmaking firms was thought to have executed a substantial sell
programme, including big blocks of telecom and financial stocks.
Turnover yesterday reached a heavy 784.1m shares, well above the levels seen
earlier this week. The value of customer business transacted on Wednesday
was Pounds 1.29bn.
Senior traders in London agreed that London had performed exceptionally well
yesterday in face of the big falls across the world's markets. All of them,
however, voiced caution about Wall Street's vulnerability. 'If Wall Street
holds or closes up on the session we should be OK; but if it wobbles and
goes down then we will test the downside levels,' was the view of one head
of marketmaking although he said he still felt confortable with the market.
A welter of important trading statements from some of the UK market's
leading companies plus a number of big moves around the sectors kept dealers
busy. BP, the oil group, unloved and shunned by UK domestic institutions
just over a year ago when it cut its quarterly dividend payment, extended
its recent oustanding performance after releasing third quarter numbers well
in excess of market forecasts, pulliing other oil stocks with it.
On the other hand, BT upset the big income funds by putting a question mark
over future dividend growth and its shares dipped accordingly.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market worries keep Dow
depressed

Wall Street
US SHARE prices posted big declines for the second consecutive day as heavy
selling in the Treasury market pushed long-term interest rates sharply
higher, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 36.89 lower at 3,624.98.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 5.53 to 457.49, while the American SE
composite shed 4.17 to 477.53 and the Nasdaq composite, hardest hit by the
selling, retreated 15.69, or 2 per cent, to 757.26. NYSE volume was heavy at
323m shares.
Wednesday's steep declines - the Dow fell 36 points and the Nasdaq composite
12 points, or 1.5 per cent - were prompted primarily by concern about rising
long-term interest rates. The bond market has dropped sharply in recent
days, pushing up longer-dated yields, because fixed-income investors are
worried that resurgent economic growth could eventually lead to higher
inflation and tighter monetary policy.
Those worries were again evident yesterday, with the 30-year bond falling
well over a point and the yield climbing to 6.2 per cent. Higher yields, in
turn, triggered fresh selling of stocks. Investor sentiment was so weak that
the markets ignored the news that jobless claims fell by 10,000 in the final
week of last month.
Banking issues, which have taken a hammering recently because of rising bond
yields, were again lower. Chemical receded Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 ,
Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 3/8 , Citicorp Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 34 7/8 and JP Morgan Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68 1/2 .
Retailers were in varied form following an inconsistent batch of sales data.
Gap Stores, where sales declined slightly last month, fell Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 34 1/8 , and Sears Roebuck firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 5/8 on
news of stronger same-store sales, while the Limited eased Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 20 7/8 and JC Penney slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 .
Among Dow stocks, the biggest decliners were General Electric, down Dollars
2 3/4 at Dollars 93 5/8 , McDonald's, off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 54, and
AT&amp;T, Dollars 1 3/8 lower at Dollars 55 1/2 . Some cyclical stocks were also
weaker: Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 103 1/4
and Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 89 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, technology shares were mostly lower. Intel dropped
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 59 and Microsoft Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 1/2 , but
Apple bucked the trend, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 .
Canada
THE Toronto market tumbled in active trading, in line with other major world
markets. The TSE 300 index fell 31.0 to 4,213.7. The index, which had been
steady for most of the session, lost ground in the final two hours of
trading.
Declines led advances by 413 to 379 after volume of 82.4m shares valued at
CDollars 668m. Golds bucked the downward trend, advancing 1.98 per cent as
the bullion price rose USDollars 5 an ounce in New York.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls as

SHARE prices plunged on late afternoon arbitrage trading, and the Nikkei
average fell 2.2 per cent, closing below the 19,000 level for the first time
in eight months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-share index ended 431.45 down at the day's low of 18,949.79, having
risen to a high of 19,433.24 in the morning. Selling centred on Nikkei 225
stocks which had not been included in the new Nikkei 300, and the Topix
index fell less sharply, by 17.79, or 1 per cent, to 1,604.08. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.90 to 1,277.58.
Analysts expect further selling of Nikkei 225 stocks as investors shift
positions to the new index. 'There is more than Y1,400bn in outstanding
arbitrage buying positions, of which 60 per cent is held against the Nikkei
225,' said one fund manager.
Volume came to 230m shares, against Wednesday's 206m, and falls overwhelmed
advances by 902 to 118, with 142 issues unchanged.
East Japan Railway came under selling pressure along with other railway
issues, and fell Y3,000 to Y492,000. Keisei Electric Railway shed Y92 to
Y892 and Tokyu Y42 to Y730.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone closed Y11,000 lower at Y829,000. Other
telecom issues were also weak, with KDD slipping Y200 to Y12,400.
Margin traders who had bought stocks at higher levels six months earlier
were forced to liquidate holdings. Tokyo Electric Power declined Y50 to
Y3,390 on margin-linked selling, as did Sumitomo Metal Mining, Y27 lower at
Y803.
Nikkei 225 components not adopted for the 300-issue index fell back, Mitsui
Mining by Y29 to Y513 and Toagosei Chemical by Y36 to Y469.
Financials, which held up against overall selling during most of the day,
eased just before the close. Sakura Bank lost Y10 to Y1,690 and Nikko
Securities Y20 to Y1,160.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 250.08 to 21,239.69 on selling by margin
traders, in volume of 19.1m shares.
Roundup
A WAVE of profit-taking left the region mostly lower.
HONG KONG lost ground for the second consecutive day but met support at
lower levels.
The Hang Seng index finished 147.23, or 1.6 per cent, down at 9,204.88 after
bargain hunters pulled it back from a day's low of 9,189.
MANILA retreated on a long-awaited correction, with Phillipine Long Distance
Telephone's overnight fall on Wall Street triggering a bout of
profit-taking.
The local price of PLDT dipped 55 pesos to 1,855 pesos and the composite
index shed 20.8 from the record high established on Wednesday, to 2,446.74.

three weeks, in spite of continued hopes that the central bank might decide
to ease credit further at its board meeting this afternoon. The weighted

Active foreign buying was seen in Acer, which moved ahead 60 cents to
TDollars 27.30.
BANGKOK's SET index finished 18.46, or 1.4 per cent, down at 1,284.93 in
turnover of Bt18.16bn, but after having picked up from a day's low of
1,257.64.
AUSTRALIA ended weaker for the third consecutive day, although some late
bargain hunting enabled the All Ordinaries index to pull back from its worst
level to finish 6.8 lower at 2,101.6.
SINGAPORE relinquished some ground as profits were taken after Wednesday's
record high. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 3.58 to 2,123.85.
KUALA LUMPUR was unable to maintain an early positive tone and the composite
index fell 4.97 to 977.06.

bought banking stocks. The composite index climbed 16.50 to a year's high of
500.75.

Rp700 at Rp8,800.
