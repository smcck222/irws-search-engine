OWNERS of Scottish estates will no longer have to pay non-domestic rates on
their deer forests, salmon rivers, grouse moors and other shooting, Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday.
In a parliamentary answer he said that sporting rights would be exempted
from non-domestic rates from 1995, bringing Scotland into line with England
and Wales.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Arrest warrant for Brazilian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARRANT has been issued for the arrest of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the man
allegedly at the centre of a multi-million dollar corrupt fund-raising
scheme for Mr Fernando Collor, the disgraced Brazilian president.
The Brazilian embassy in London said yesterday that a warrant was issued
after the British government agreed to start extradition proceedings against
Mr Farias, Britain has no formal extradition treaty with Brazil.
The embassy said the case was not linked to that of Mr Ronald Biggs, who
escaped from Wandsworth prison in 1965 after being convicted of the August
1963 'great train robbery' and now lives with his son in Rio de Janeiro.

SIR Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI, the specialist
engineering group, yesterday told Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, that it was time to start treating British broadcasters as
'winners' rather than a problem, Raymond Snoddy writes.
He was one of the few non-broadcasters at a meeting with Mr Heseltine and Mr
Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, called to look at ways of
maximising UK programme production and programme exports.
Others at the meeting included Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general of
the BBC, Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Mr Leslie Hill,
chairman of Central and the new chairman of the ITV Association, and Mr
Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications.
A main theme of the meeting was the need for further deregulation if
Britain's broadcasters are to compete in a world of media giants.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Sinn Fein conditions 'sank peace plan'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British and Irish governments flatly rejected the Hume-Adams peace
initiative for Northern Ireland because it attached conditions to a
cessation of violence by the IRA, according to high-ranking British
officials.
On the eve of a Downing Street meeting this afternoon between Mr John Hume,
the SDLP leader, and Mr John Major, the officials said the initiative linked
an end of IRA terrorism with a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA.
That link - implying that IRA violence was being rewarded with a role for
the nationalists in any future settlement - could not be accepted by London
or Dublin.
Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last week
rejected the initiative put forward by Mr Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, president
of Sinn Fein, as a basis for their efforts to restore peace to the province.
They instead pledged to press ahead with their own initiative, although
Irish officials said it might incorporate 'elements' of Hume-Adams.
Neither government has been ready to discuss the details of the plan or the
reasons for its rejection since it was handed to Mr Reynolds last month and
later reported by him to Mr Major at their Brussels meeting last Friday.
Mr Hume, who insists that it represents the best hope for more than 20 years
of a permanent cessation of violence, has stressed repeatedly that the plan
offered the prospect of a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign.
Colleagues of Mr Hume have suggested that he will consider publishing his
agreement with Mr Adams if the two governments continue to rebuff him. For
his part Mr Major will seek this afternoon to draw the SDLP into round-table
talks proposed for the province's constitutional parties.
But the officials said the Hume-Adams proposals left unanswered a range of
questions about the intentions of Sinn Fein. Mr Adams appeared unwilling to
modify the nationalists' central claim - which is anathema to London - that
the future of Ulster should be determined by the majority of all Ireland.
Even if those differences could have been 'finessed', the proposals
contained the fatal flaw of assuming that an end to IRA violence could be
part of the process in which Sinn Fein was drawn into negotiations.
Mr Major agreed with Mr Reynolds last week that a permanent end to IRA
violence would receive an 'imaginative' response from the two governments.
But the officials said that both prime ministers had agreed there could be
'no question' of any understanding with Sinn Fein in advance of such a move.
Mr Major was determined any cessation should be unconditional and permanent,
a stance accepted by Mr Reynolds in the two leaders' joint statement.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan wants anti-dumping unit expanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is pressing
for the Commission's anti-dumping unit to be doubled in size to help improve
the speed and efficiency of investigations into unfair trade.
Proposals for increasing staff, shortening inquiry deadlines and
restructuring the anti-dumping department will be voted on today by his
fellow commissioners. However, trade lawyers in Brussels fear they will not
improve the transparency of anti-dumping investigations and will make it
more difficult for companies accused of dumping to respond to Commission
findings.
'Even if they publish decisions which are twice as long as they are today,
the real reasons for the decisions will always remain to some extent
secret,' said one lawyer.
Commission officials hope plans for improving efficiency will please all
member states, even though there is deadlock over the more sensitive
question of whether to give Brussels more power to push through anti-dumping
duties.
They also believe the improvements will reassure those southern member
states reluctant to abolish national import quotas unless the EC sharpens
its trade weapons.
The plea for more personnel was issued yesterday in the Commission report on
anti-dumping activities for 1992, the first to appear under Sir Leon's
stewardship. The report argues that the Community anti-dumping services are
'critically understaffed' compared with those in the US, Canada or
Australia.
Sir Leon is proposing that all anti-dumping investigations be concluded
within 15 months, and that provisional duties should be imposed, if
necessary, within nine months of the start of an inquiry.
He is also planning to strengthen the involvement of consumer organisations
in inquiries, and split the anti-dumping department into units investigating
dumping and injury, as in the US.
According to the 1992 report there were 158 anti-dumping duties in force at
the end of last year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S government yesterday took steps to crack down on the booming trade
in counterfeit goods, many of them fakes of French fashion designs or luxury
products, David Buchan and Alice Rawsthorn report from Paris.
It has proposed a law, virtually assured of parliamentary approval, which
would increase sharply the penalties for manufacture, sale or import of
counterfeits and give customs and police officers scope to take quicker
action.
The maximum fine for counterfeiting would be increased from FFr20,000
(Pounds 2,300) to FFr500,000 (Pounds 57,000), with a possible two years in
jail. Companies convicted of producing fakes could have their factories
closed indefinitely and be fined FFr2.5m.
An EC regulation to crack down on the counterfeit trade within the Community
has been drafted by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, France's commissioner
responsible for customs matters. It is due to come into force early next
year

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Mexico gives way to US over Nafta -
Decision reflects government's desperation to have pact passed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US said yesterday that Mexico had made concessions over trade in sugar,
citrus, vegetables, flatglass, wine and home appliances in a move seen as an
attempt to win US congressional passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, broke the news after extended
negotiations with Mexican officials, ending a long-running US effort to
correct perceived weaknesses in the three-nation pact with Canada and
Mexico. Most of the changes have been included in the administration's
implementing legislation, delivered to Congress yesterday .
The Mexican government's decision reflects its desperation to have Nafta
passed. In giving in to US pressure, it has in effect broken its repeated
promise not to reopen the original treaty. However, the pact has become the
cornerstone of foreign and economic policy. Were it rejected, the political
and financial costs for President Carlos Salinas's administration could be
significant.
There is a presidential election next year and rejection of the treaty would
play into the hands of the nationalist opposition. Failure of Nafta could
also destabilise the peso.
Mr Kantor said Mexican officials had agreed to negotiate accelerated tariff
reductions on flatglass, wine and appliances on the first day of Nafta
implementation. Speaking later, Mexico's trade minister, Mr Jaime Serra
Puche, said the reductions would only apply with the agreement of affected
industries.
Mr Kantor added that production formula had been agreed to prevent a surge
of sugar imports into the US. On vegetables and citrus, tariffs would be
increased if import prices fell to an agreed level.
The concessions on sugar, although nominally made by Mexico's private sector
sugar industry, were without doubt given on the orders of the government.
While Mexico is a net importer of sugar, US producers had been concerned
that it would turn to sweetening soft drinks with corn syrup and export the
resulting surplus in sugar to the US. Under the Nafta, Mexico and the US
agree to eliminate all barriers to sugar trade within 15 years.
The concession on glass may come as a blow to Vitro, the near monopoly glass
producer, and one of Mexico's largest industrial companies. It had fought
tenaciously for a long phase-in period for free trade in flat glass
products.
The US administration has been having great difficulty cobbling together the
necessary 218 votes in the House of Representatives by November 17, and
strategists say it is vital to get at least the appearance of momentum.
President Bill Clinton yesterday hosted another in a series of White House
extravaganzas, featuring Nafta endorsements from every living recipient of
the Nobel Prize for economics and dozens of former cabinet officials.
Yesterday, Mr Kantor announced two new Democratic converts. By the
administration's count, this brings pro-treaty votes to about 197.

closed indefinitely and be fined FFr2.5m. Customs officers and the police
would also be given stronger powers to seize suspect goods.
According to the French government, counterfeit products account for some 5
per cent of world trade. Turkey, North Africa and, increasingly, Southeast
Asia are the main sources, but some originate in other European Community
countries, such as Italy.
An EC regulation to crack down on the counterfeit trade within the Community
has been drafted by Mrs Christiane Scrivener, France's commissioner
responsible for customs matters. It is due to come into force early next
year
The French luxury goods industry claims that 70 per cent of such faked
products are based on their designs, for instance: Hermes scarves and Chanel
T-shirts. Mr Christian Blanckaert, chairman designate of Comite Colbert, the
industry body, told a Paris conference yesterday that counterfeiting was one
of the industry's main problems.
He also signalled that the French luxury industry was coming out of
recession. He estimated that the combined sales of Comite Colbert member
companies would total FFr30.5bn (Pounds 3.48bn) this year, against FFr30bn
in 1992. The industry has benefited from strong growth in Asia - now
accounting for 26 per cent of sales against 18 per cent in 1986 - and the
fledgling recovery in the US.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY two-thirds of the Japanese public thinks Japan either will or must
end its ban on imported rice, according to a newspaper survey.
Among the justifications given for an open market were more choice for
consumers, cheaper rice and an improved international image.
This throws doubt on government claims that it would be politically
difficult to replace the import ban with tariffs, a condition for concluding
the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
Government officials say they will feel under no pressure to decide until
the EC and the US settle their differences over farm subsidies, another big
barrier to a Gatt deal. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is thought
likely to leave a final decision until close to the December 15 deadline for
concluding the talks.
Japan's ability to sustain self-sufficiency in rice has thrown into question
in the past few weeks by the worst harvest since the war, which has obliged
it to import rice for the first time in nine years.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan wants larger anti-dumping unit -
Brussels to vote on proposals to speed unfair trade investigations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community's trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is pressing
for the Commission's anti-dumping unit to be doubled in size to help improve
the speed and efficiency of investigations into unfair trade.
Proposals for increasing staff, shortening inquiry deadlines and
restructuring the anti-dumping department will be voted on today by his
fellow commissioners. However, trade lawyers in Brussels fear they will not
improve the transparency of anti-dumping investigations and will make it
more difficult for companies accused of dumping to respond to Commission
findings.
'Even if they publish decisions which are twice as long as they are today,
the real reasons for the decisions will always remain to some extent
secret,' said one lawyer.
Commission officials hope plans for improving efficiency will please all
member states, even though there is deadlock over the more sensitive
question of whether to give Brussels more power to push through anti-dumping
duties.
They also believe the improvements will reassure those southern member
states reluctant to abolish national import quotas unless the EC sharpens
its trade weapons.
Dumping occurs when products are exported to the EC at unfairly low prices
compared with the price in the home market. The Commission can only act if
these cheap imports are causing 'material injury' to the EC industry.
Sir Leon could face opposition from fellow commissioners today because staff
numbers are under extreme pressure. A plea for more personnel was issued
yesterday in the Commission report on anti-dumping activities for 1992, the
first to appear under Sir Leon's stewardship. The report - much more
detailed than usual - argues that the Community anti-dumping services are
'critically understaffed' compared with those in the US, Canada or
Australia. The number of professionals handling cases at the Commission
dropped from 94 to 89 last year, making a total of some 130 including
support staff. Officials estimate that the US operates its anti-dumping
policy with some 500 professionals.
Sir Leon is proposing that all anti-dumping investigations be concluded
within 15 months, and that provisional duties should be imposed, if
necessary, within nine months of the start of an inquiry. At present complex
investigations can take well over 18 months.
He is also planning to strengthen the involvement of consumer organisations
in inquiries, and split the anti-dumping department into units investigating
dumping and injury, as in the US.
According to the 1992 report there were 158 anti-dumping duties in force at
the end of last year, of which nearly 30 per cent were against state trading
countries such as China. However, measures against Japan still represented
70 per cent of the total trade value of all measures in force. Since 1988
the chemicals and electronics sectors have been the most heavily implicated
in anti-dumping actions.

That in a nutshell, is the logic behind a Dollars 1.65bn (Pounds 1.11bn)
project to transport natural gas across the Andes through a 700-mile
pipeline linking the Neuquen fields in Argentina with industries and homes
in Chile's principal cities.
For years it has been just talk. But now, given Chile's rapidly growing
economy, signs of greater stability in Argentina and a new-found
determination to improve bilateral relations, that talk could become
reality.
A significant step forward was taken last week with the naming of
Houston-based Tenneco Gas and British Gas as the technical operators of the
transmission and distribution elements respectively. The two companies had
beaten off opposition from other multinationals, including Enron, Enserch
and Utilicorp of the US, BHP Petroleum of Australia, and Canada's Novacorp
International and Transcanada Pipelines.
British Gas and Tenneco, which earlier this year formed a strategic alliance
for Latin American projects, are prepared to take out a significant equity
stake, pending results of a year-long feasibility study. Construction is due
to begin in late 1994, with a target completion date of 1997.
The pipeline is expected to cost Dollars 600m, and it is estimated that the
distribution network, perhaps up to 5,000 miles long, will cost Dollars
450m.
A vital piece of the jigsaw still needs to be put in place. This is the
construction of three thermo-electric generators, separate but intrinsic to
the project. The generators, which would cost a total Dollars 600m and have
a combined capacity of 700MW, would consume 45 per cent of the gas.
Mr Rudolf Araneda, general manager of Gas de Chile, the project developer,
hopes the generators can be built in tandem with the pipeline and
distribution network. He believes the foreign companies that showed interest
in those project elements may wish to play a role in the construction of
generators.
Serious obstacles remain. Toughest will be securing financing for a project
which, consortium officials say, will involve six years of negative cash
flows and a 20-year pay-back period. At least Dollars 700m will have to be
invested before a therm of gas is sold.
Banks may baulk at sinking money into a long-term project with such obvious
political risk. Although Chile won an investment grade rating last year,
Argentina has only recently witnessed the return of economic stability.
Relations between the countries, although recently much improved, have often
been tetchy and a resumption of tension could imperil the smooth supply of
gas.
Mr Chris Duhon, international vice-president at Tenneco, insists that such
eventualities have been thoroughly evaluated. 'We are very comfortable with
the political elements,' he says.
Mr Araneda says: 'We will be looking for the whole mixture of financing
sources - multilateral institutions, export credit agencies, and commercial
loans. It is likely to be 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent loans.'
The project depends on finding markets, a task to be undertaken by British
Gas. In particular it will be necessary to persuade Chilean industry to
convert from other types of fuel. Furthermore, plans to extend the network
through to 2015 assumes the continued growth of Chile's economy.
There is also the question of forming a legal framework for the supply and
sale of gas. Chile's regulations were framed in 1931. Given the pace with
which much legislation crawls through congress and the potential for
political manipulation, agreement on a suitable regulatory framework could
be a lengthy process.
Executives admit there are many imponderables. However, Mr Richard Souchard,
a project development manager at British Gas, says: 'We wouldn't be
interested if we didn't think the scheme had a fairly good chance of coming
to fruition.'
The trump card being played by Gas de Chile is environmental. The consortium
claims that converting thousands of industries and up to 600,000 homes to
gas will help significantly in cleaning up the air in Santiago, fast
becoming Latin America's most polluted city.
Mr Araneda admits there are many hurdles to overcome. 'Chile is far away and
it is a relatively small economy. But all the macro-economic elements are in
place and we have a stability lacking in other potential markets such as
Vietnam, India, Brazil and China,' he says.
'Here it is possible to predict steady, long-term growth. That makes this
part of the world very interesting.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WILDFIRES continued to rage out of control in Malibu and other parts of
southern California yesterday, after a night of spectacular destruction.
Walls of flames roared out of the Santa Monica mountains and down canyons
toward the Pacific ocean, consuming at least 350 buildings overnight.
In Malibu, a city of 15,000 that winds along 27 miles of beachfront and
includes some of the most expensive homes in the region, hillside mansions
burst into flames, palm trees became giant torches and cars exploded from
the heat.
The Malibu fire was the biggest of four new blazes that broke out on
Tuesday, only 13 days after 13 huge firestorms swept through the region,
destroying an estimated 780 homes and other buildings and charring 180,000
acres from Los Angeles to the Mexican border.
In addition to the Malibu fire, blazes were reported to the east and south
in Riverside County, San Bernardino County and San Diego County.
Driven by 50mph Santa Ana winds, the fires raced through the coastal hills
and canyons of Malibu on Tuesday night, thwarting the efforts of more than
3,000 firefighters and hundreds of volunteers who attacked the flames from
the ground and air.
Authorities estimated that damages would run into hundreds of millions of
dollars.
Among the victims of yesterday's Malibu blaze were several Hollywood
celebrities, including Sean Penn and Bruce Willis, whose homes were
destroyed.
Some 2,500 people were forced to evacuate the area, with many more leaving
voluntarily.
An evacuation was ordered for the exclusive 'Malibu Colony', home to many
celebrities, including Larry Hagman, Johnny Carson, Barbra Streisand, Steven
Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman and Sylvester Stallone. 'The fire is making
progress. I can't say that we are,' Mr Brian Gordan, Los Angeles Fire Chief,
said yesterday morning. Some 56,000 acres have already been consumed, he
estimated.
New flare-ups threatened Pepperdine University yesterday morning and parts
of the Pacific Coast Highway, which winds along the coast, were on fire,
preventing firetrucks from reaching areas in danger.
At least 10 people were injured, including British screenwriter and director
Duncan Gibbins, who received severe burns over most of his body when his
home above Malibu was engulfed in flames as he was trying to rescue his cat.
Water-dropping helicopters were ordered to fight the Malibu blaze for the
first time at night.
Officials said yesterday morning that the situation remained extremely
volatile.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Democrats lose the one that counted: Jurek Martin on the
lessons of regional US elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE was one constant message emanating from the White House and from
national Democratic party strategists in the weeks before the off-year
elections on Tuesday it was that the only truly representative contest was
for the New Jersey governorship.
New York and Virginia were special cases, they all said, while mayoral races
and other public policy issues on ballots across the country merely proved
that all politics are local. Their contention was based on the confidence,
reflected in opinion polls, that New Jersey Governor James Florio, the
Democratic incumbent, would win and thereby demonstrate that pursuing tough,
tax-raising policies did not necessarily translate into defeat.
Governor Florio lost. He did not go down by much to Christine Todd Whitman,
the Republican challenger, but his defeat, combined with the victories of
Rudolph Giuliani in New York and George Allen in Virginia, meant Republicans
swept Democrats out of office in the three most widely watched and partisan
confrontations.
This means the Democrats have lost all the six big races since Mr Clinton
was elected last November - Tuesday's three, plus the Los Angeles mayoralty
and Senate contests in Georgia and Texas. More than that, voters in Maine,
in New York City and in two New York counties showed their displeasure with
incumbents by approving limitations on the number of years or terms their
elected representatives may serve in office. In New Jersey a proposition
subjecting politicians to recall also won approval.
Term limits is a popular cause among Republicans, who remain the minority
party in most of the country. So is law and order, which again was
vindicated in Washington state, where an initiative mandating life
imprisonment for felons convicted three times was approved, and in Texas,
which backed a Dollars 1bn bond issue to build more prisons.
Not everything on the conservative/Republican wish list was granted. In
California, Proposition 174 was defeated by 70-30 per cent. It would have
issued state vouchers, worth Dollars 2,600 a child, for parents to use at
schools, state or private, of their choice. It had been vigorously opposed
by Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, and President Bill Clinton.
In Washington state, one drastic anti-tax initiative to roll back most of a
recent Dollars 1.2bn tax increase went down by 56-44 per cent. The fate of a
more modest alternative, tying future tax increases to rises in state
personal income, hung in the balance yesterday.
The significance of these Republican gains can be over-emphasised. Both
off-year elections and those that take place in the middle of a presidential
term, more often than not go against the 'in' party, though the latter
elections, encompassing all the House, a third of the Senate and a majority
of governorships, are much the more important.
Nevertheless, it is possible that incumbents facing elections next year will
construe the results on Tuesday as a warning not to buck local opinion if it
does not like presidential or national party policies. This may make it
harder for some Democratic congressmen to come off the fence and support the
North American Free Trade Agreement later this month.
In New Jersey and in Virginia it was apparent the quality of campaigns
mattered a lot. Mrs Whitman's critical decision was to shake-up her staff
operation last month and vest full authority in Mr Ed Rollins, the veteran
Republican consultant. He cast her image in a far more positive light and
induced her to attack more directly Mr Florio, who, under the guidance of Mr
James Carville, President Clinton's election mastermind of last year, had
turned a big deficit into a measurable lead with two weeks to go.
In Virginia, Ms Mary Sue Terry, a former Democratic state attorney general,
ran what is universally agreed to have been a truly terrible and mostly
negative campaign against Mr Allen, converting a 30-point summer lead into
an 18 point loss.
In a significant sub-plot of the campaign, Mr Michael Farris, the
Republican, lost his bid to become lieutenant governor by 54-46 per cent. A
pure product of the religious far right, he was sufficiently encouraged by
his showing to announce that he would run again.
This was immediately taken as evidence that ultra-conservatives are thinking
of splitting from the national Republican party three years from now. If Lt
Col Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, wins the Senate race in Virginia
next year, now a distinct possibility, the state will become the centre of
this movement.
At least Mrs Whitman's victory gave the lie to one of the more popular
pre-election theories - that the advance of women to elected offices so
evident last year was going to come to a juddering halt. Mrs Whitman seems
to have run at least as well among New Jersey male voters as its women.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Mixed message from mayors of new generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY'S elections have brought in a new generation of mayors in many of
the largest US cities and mixed up some of the traditional maxims about
racial and ethnic divisions in urban politics.
Although only a handful of incumbents lost at the polls, in cities like
Detroit, Boston and Minneapolis the voting brought down the curtain on an
era with the retirement of long-time mayors.
In Detroit, Mr Dennis Archer, a former judge running on a low-key platform
of good management, defeated Ms Sharon McPhail, the preferred candidate of
Mr Coleman Young, who retired after 20 years as mayor of the city.
In Boston, Mr Thomas Menino, who became acting mayor when Mr Ray Flynn, the
long-time incumbent, was appointed US ambassador to the Vatican, won the
office in his own right, breaking a 60-year stranglehold by politicians of
Irish descent.
In Minneapolis, Ms Sharon Sayles Belton became the city's first woman mayor,
after the retirement of Mr Donald Fraser, 14 years in office.
In Atlanta, Mr Bill Campbell won 49 per cent of the vote and appeared
strongly positioned to win a run-off on November 23 against Mr Michael
Lomax. Whatever the outcome Atlanta's new mayor will represent a changing of
the guard from Mr Maynard Jackson and Mr Andrew Young, the civil rights era
leaders who dominated city politics for the past 20 years.
New York was one of the few cities to stage a straightforward battle between
a Republican and a Democrat. In many US cities, clean government reforms
instituted in the 1920s ban party labels from mayoral elections, while in
others - such as Pittsburgh, where Mr Tom Murphy, the Democratic candidate,
will succeed the retiring Mayor Sophie Masloff - one party dominates so
completely that the race is effectively over once its candidate has been
chosen.
Although Mr Dinkins lost in New York to Mr Rudolph Giuliani, and an outsider
defeated Ms Carrie Saxon Perry, mayor of Hartford, Connecticut, for the last
three terms, other incumbents were re-elected.
Mr Bob Lanier in Houston, Mr Norm Rice in Seattle and Mr Mike White in
Cleveland all proved that incumbency was not a fatal handicap in this year
in which many voters seemed ready for a change.
Mr Dinkins's defeat, following the retirement earlier this year of Mayor Tom
Bradley of Los Angeles, means for the first time in two decades, none of the
five largest cities in the US will have a black mayor.
The messages sent by this election about the importance of race and
ethnicity in urban politics are, however, blurred. Ms Belton in Minneapolis
and Mr Bill Johnson in Rochester proved, like Mr Rice in Seattle before
them, that black candidates could win in cities with mostly white
populations.
Similarly, Mr Menino proved you no longer had to be Irish-American to win in
Boston, while in Tuesday's run-off in Miami there is a chance a non-Cuban,
Mr Steve Clark, may win.

FT  04 NOV 93 / A Dollars 7m curtain callfor Degas' dancers: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 14 x 19 inch pastel by Degas of two young dancers taking a curtain call
sold for Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.76m) at Christie's in New York on Tuesday
night. The price, almost double the pre-sale estimate, helped to confirm the
slow improvement in the international art market.
Christie's auction of 60 lots brought in Dollars 51.37m, (Pounds 34.7m) and
only 15 of the lots on offer failed to find a buyer. But among the
casualties was the second most important painting in the sale, 'Maternite'
by Renoir, depicting his wife breast-feeding their son. It was bought in at
Dollars 4.8m.
An encouraging feature of the auction was the breadth of buyer interest for
works fresh to the market. The Monet went to a private European collector
while the second highest price, Dollars 3.96m, was paid by an American
collector for a Pissarro view of Dieppe.
Most major lots sold on or near estimates. Mondrian's minimalist
'Composition avec bleu, rouge and jaune' made Dollars 3.5m; a rare landscape
by Kandinsky, showing him moving towards abstraction, sold for Dollars
2.75m; and a typical work by the Fauve artist Derain of boats at the port of
Collioure realised Dollars 2.6m.
The auction, the most important this winter by Christie's, suggests serious
collectors are being tempted by fresh works, carrying resonable reserves.
The speculative frenzy of the late 1980s is quite absent.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Abrasive Giuliani takes on volatile New York: Martin Dickson
on the city's new mayor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW Yorkers have elected a white former prosecutor who talks tough on crime
as their first Republican mayor in a generation in the hope that he can
improve what many perceive to be a declining quality of life in America's
largest city.
But Mr Rudolph Giuliani, who defeated Mr David Dinkins, the black, one-term
Democratic mayor in Tuesday's election, will face formidable hurdles -
political, economic and fiscal - in pursuit of his pledge to put a shine
back on the Big Apple.
Mr Giuliani, the 49-year-old son of a bar owner in the borough of Brooklyn,
won 51 per cent of the vote to Mr Dinkins' 48 per cent, reversing the
outcome of the previous election in 1989, when Mr Dinkins won by a mere 2
per cent.
The voting pattern was very similar to 1989, with Mr Giuliani picking up
some 75 per cent of whites (who made up about half the voters), Mr Dinkins
taking virtually all the blacks (about 28 per cent of voters) and gaining
around two-thirds of the Hispanic vote (around 13 per cent of voters).
The crucial difference from 1989 appears to have been the defection to Mr
Giuliani of enough educated white voters and Hispanics to give the
Republican candidate the edge. And those voters were particularly concerned
about the quality-of-life issue.
New York is slowly emerging from a four-year recession which has wiped out
nearly 400,000 jobs, it has a high (though recently falling) crime rate, and
its constant struggle to balance its budget in recent years has left it with
a rotting infrastructure.
Race relations are always liable to sudden flare-ups, though they are less
tense than in many other American cities, thanks to the heterogeneous nature
of New York's population.
Mr Giuliani, the first Republican mayor since Mr John Lindsay, who ran City
Hall from 1966 to 1973, comes to this volatile set of problems with a slate
of new, if sometimes vague, policies, and a mix of advantages and drawbacks.
Perhaps the greatest question mark facing his administration is whether he
has the personality to build the broad coalitions necessary to run New York
smoothly.
Educated at New York University's law school, Mr Giuliani sprung to
prominence in the 1980s as a tough crime fighter. He served for a time as
number three in President Reagan's Justice Department before becoming US
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he vigorously pursued
the Mafia and Wall Street insider traders.
In these jobs and in his pursuit of City Hall in 1989, he came across as a
distinctly puritanical, impatient man, with a short temper and a lust for
publicity.
During this autumn's campaign he has presented a more mellow, less wooden
appearance, but he still lacks the charisma of the handsome, aristocratic Mr
Lindsay, which helped him govern a city whose elected officials remain
overwhelming Democratic.
However, Mr Mitchell Moss, who heads the Urban Research Center at New York
University, argues that Mr Giuliani will have the advantage of a
co-operative Democratic City Council, not least because voters on Tuesday
also displayed their dissatisfaction with the political establishment by
approving a measure limiting elected officials to eight years in office.
In another sign of unhappiness, the overwhelmingly white inhabitants of the
borough of Staten Island voted to take the first step towards secession from
the rest of New York City.
Mr Giuliani also has to show he has the character to reach out beyond his
white electoral backers to the black community, which is deeply distrustful
of him and will be smarting from the defeat of Mr Dinkins, the first black
mayor of a major US city to lose his first re-election bid.
Mr Dinkins, a kindly, gentlemanly figure, failed partly because of poor
campaign strategy and partly because of the reputation he gained in his term
for very mixed administrative abilities. Nevertheless, he did manage to ease
a great deal of racial tension in the city. The fear is that Mr Giuliani's
abrasive personality could exacerbate it.
Mr Giuliani's campaign advisers were almost entirely white and male, though
in his victory speech early yesterday he promised that 'nobody - no ethnic,
religious or racial group - will escape my care.'
On economic, fiscal and business matters Mr Giuliani could prove much more
effective than Mr Dinkins, who is widely faulted for failing during his term
to do more to bring the city's vast Dollars 31bn budget under control.
The new mayor has promised to reform the city's tax structure and bring a
'managerial revolution to City Hall' - a reference to the new fashion among
US municipalities for the privatisation of services or incentives to improve
worker productivity. He has promised to cut the city's payroll by 34,000,
but has not spelt out how he will do this.
Budget cuts will certainly be necessary - and quickly, for when he takes
office on January 1 Mr Giuliani is expected to inherit a shortfall of
several hundred million dollars in this year's budget and gaps of some
Dollars 2bn in each of the next three years.
As he starts to hack, every community will be watching, ready to denounce
him for the merest hint of ethnic or political bias. For Mr Giuliani, no
less than Mr Dinkins, the great American melting pot promises to remain very
hot.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Packwood appeal rebuffed: Senate votes to obtain diaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENATOR Robert Packwood's attempts to limit Senate investigation into his
private affairs was firmly rebuffed by his colleagues on Tuesday night after
two days of painful, and sometimes emotional, floor debate.
The full Senate voted 94-6 to back the request of its own ethics committee
for an unlimited subpoena to obtain Mr Packwood's private diaries.
Earlier it rejected by 77-23 an amendment by Senator Alan Simpson, the
Republican from Wyoming, that would have made only 'relevant' materials
available to the committee, leaving the balance in the custody of an
independent judge.
Mr Packwood's lawyer intimated yesterday that legal challenges to the Senate
action might still be taken. Never before has the chamber taken such
sweeping action against one its own members.
Mr Packwood was already under investigation for charges of sexually
harassing more than 25 women over a 20-year period.
The committee has also said it may have evidence of additional offences by
the Republican senator from Oregon.
In the debate one leading senator went so far as to advise Mr Packwood to
resign. Mr Robert Byrd, the Democrat from West Virginia and a staunch
defender of the integrity of the Senate, put into words what many of his
colleagues are known to be thinking.
'None of us is pure or without flaw,' Senator Byrd declared, 'but when those
flaws damage the institution of the Senate it is time to have the grace to
go.'
The Simpson compromise amendment, which Mr Packwood said earlier he could
accept, was supported by Senator Robert Dole, though the Republican leader
also voted in favour of upholding the ethics committee's request.
On that vote, one Democrat joined five Republicans, including Senator
Packwood, in opposing the blanket subpoena. He was Senator Dennis Deconcini
from Arizona, himself censured by the ethics committee for his involvement
with Charles Keating, the savings and loan executive.
All seven women in the Senate voted for the subpoena, though Mrs Nancy
Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, disagreed with Senator Patty Murray, the
Washington Democrat, that sexual misconduct was the most important issue at
stake.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Fujimori scrapes home in Peru poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POPULAR approval on Sunday for Peru's new constitution in an apparently
clean poll puts the country back on the democratic track President Alberto
Fujimori abandoned on April 5 last year.
It gives him the backing he needs to continue with his sweeping programme of
economic reform, and will permit him to stand for a second presidential term
in 1995. However the government squeezed home by an uncomfortably narrow
margin. Counting has yet to be completed, but it is clear earlier
predictions of a 70-30 per cent government win were wishful thinking and the
margin of victory is likely to end up at around 5 points.
The 200-article constitution proved a challenging topic: Mr Fujimori claims
Peruvians have given an example to Latin America of popular democracy but
the vast majority of voters had little idea of the issues.
A yes vote, at least in a view encouraged by Mr Fujimori, demonstrated
approval of the government's three-year track record, while a no hinted at
an 'unhealthy absence of patriotism.' Yet Mr Fujimori proved incapable of
transferring his own popular approval rating - currently around 70 per cent,
at least in the metropolitan area - to the constitutional cause.
The result underlines the historical divide between Lima and the provinces.
Voters in the capital, where a third of the population is now concentrated,
were almost 2-1 in favour of the new constitution. But more than half of
Peru's 25 departments rejected it.
Opposition groups, which include the still unpopular traditional political
parties and the debilitated trade unions, immediately claimed the
constitution lacked legitimacy. They point to 30 per cent abstentions,
similar to the level in last November's constituent congress elections which
the major parties boycotted in protest at Mr Fujimori's seizure of increased
powers.
The business community, however, breathed a sigh of relief. Peru's 12th
constitution enshrines the free market policies Mr Fujimori has followed
since his election in 1990. It sharply reduces the role of the state,
encourages competition and introduces modern work practices.
But even if Sunday's vote demonstrates broad support for Mr Fujimori the
government would do well to take the substantial protest vote seriously.
Many Peruvians want decentralisation and an efficient public administration
to promote development and jobs rather than a strong head of state who
brings them occasional gifts.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Protest vote may decide NZ election result: Nikki Tait
reports on the likely fortunes of the main parties and their alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH three days until the election and the opinion polls still in his
favour, Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, is campaigning the safe
way.
A typical day in Wellington includes lunch with a local chamber of commerce,
a visit to a leather goods company which has already won commendations for
export performance, and a tour around a sparkling new supermarket.
Schedules like this produce few challenges. 'I'm not asking for any lollies,
but perhaps in your second term, you could look at the state of the
hospitals,' is the extent of the 'critical' questioning at the lunch.
The style of Mr Mike Moore, the one-time builder's labourer who heads the
opposition Labour party, is different. He stands on a wind-swept industrial
park in Christchurch and tries to sell a community jobs scheme to a group of
unemployed youngsters. Shouting over the rumble of a dual carriageway, he
talks almost exclusively about social issues, and the rising tide of petty
crime which he links to the 9.9 per cent jobless rate.
'Everywhere you go, the most pressing problem is unemployment. One in four
teenagers is unemployed and that is unacceptable. Productivity, growth can
lift, but jobs go down. Unless we break this, there will be generation of
New Zealanders who will never have a job, never have a home. This country
can do better . . . . I'm ashamed of some the things which have happened
here. Maybe, they've got some excuse in Los Angeles or London, but it (urban
violence) shouldn't happen here.'
Most New Zealanders find Mr Moore's style far more engaging and the
opposition leader wins hands down in the personal popularity stakes. But
this has yet to translate into backing for Labour itself, which is tainted
with creating some of the problems Mr Moore deplores, and whose policies are
viewed as barely distinguishable from Mr Bolger's National party.
Throughout the campaign, National has kept a slim edge on its main opponent
and there are some signs that the gap is increasing in the final days. The
National party has been drawing 37-39 per cent support among 'decided'
voters, Labour 32-34 per cent. The latest poll, released this week, put the
figures at 39 and 32 per cent respectively.
This leaves a large number of undecided voters - about 14 per cent in the
latest poll - and two fairly credible 'alternative' parties. They are the
Alliance, a coalition of five left-leaning, green and Maori parties, and New
Zealand First, headed by Mr Winston Peters, a former National party MP.
Under the present first-past-the-post system, neither is expected to pick up
more than two or three seats in the enlarged 99-seat, single-chamber
parliament. But they may yet hold the key to the next New Zealand
government. If floating voters decide that they are so fed up with both
National and Labour that they would prefer to register a protest vote, Mr
Moore will have difficulty securing the 6 per cent swing he needs to oust Mr
Bolger. If support for the two alternative parties fades at the last minute,
Labour may be in with a chance.
Over the past few days, the former has looked the more likely, with the
Alliance, in particular, gaining ground. The coalition is led by Mr Jim
Anderton, who broke away from the traditional Labour party in 1989 and
formed the New Labour party, one of the five Alliance coalition partners.
The Alliance talks of progressive income taxation and a top marginal rate of
49 per cent, compared with 33 per cent at present. It would raise taxes on
fossil fuels and companies, and phase out goods and services tax in favour
of a new 'financial transactions tax.'
On the other side of the ledger, the Alliance promises to pump about
NZDollars 1bn (Pounds 375m) in infrastructure works, creating 40,000 jobs;
restore welfare benefits cut by National; abolish the new regional health
authorities, and insist on free health care for everyone; repeal National's
labour market reform legislation; and more.
The problem for Mr Moore is that Mr Anderton's message seems to be selling
well in marginal electorates, especially around Auckland, which Labour badly
needs to win.
New Zealanders are not just voting for a new government on Saturday. They
are also voting on whether to alter the electoral system in 1996 to a
proportional representation one, under which only about half the 120 MPs, in
an enlarged parliament, would represent specific electorates. The remainder
would be drawn from a national 'party list.' If the system were up and
running today and the opinion polls correct, Mr Anderton would be looking at
15-20 seats.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Hosokawa beating off the old guard: William Dawkins on Japan
PM's drive to rid electoral system of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GRAND old men of Japanese politics are fighting to tone down the new
government's plans to reform the scandal-prone political system. Their
comfortable jobs are at stake.
Thanks to their efforts, prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's radical plans to
change the electoral system and curb political funding have been delayed.
But they still look set to get through parliament, in one form or another,
by his self-imposed deadline of the end of the year.
Mr Hosokawa might have to extend the current parliamentary session, due to
end on December 15, by 10 days or so. But most people are betting that he
will not have to resign, as he has implied he would do if he misses the
deadline.
It is the only issue that holds together his unstable seven-party coalition,
brought to power in an election in July with the LDP's defeat after 38 years
in government, triggered by public disgust with its failure to enact
political reform.
Moreover, more than 85 per cent of lower house members want reform,
according to a recent poll. The big unanswered question is exactly what kind
of reform?
Currently, the lower house of parliament is elected on a multi-seat
constituency system, a consequence of which is to pit candidates of the same
party against each other, so encouraging politicians to use money and
influence rather than policies to attract votes.
The proposals would create a 500-seat lower chamber, in place of the present
511 seats, of which 250 would be in single-seat constituencies and 250
chosen by proportional representation. Voters would cast two ballots.
Corporate donations to individual politicians, an obvious source of
corruption, would be banned. Companies would, however, be allowed to give
cash to political parties. To ease the pain for individual politicians,
there would be a state subsidy of Y41.4bn (Pounds 258m) a year to parties to
dole out to candidates.
Mr Hosokawa was hoping to get these plans through the lower house of
parliament by Friday to ensure time for them to get through the upper house,
where his coalition also has a majority, by the end of the session.
However, the coalition has accepted an opposition LDP demand to delay public
hearings on the bills - a legal requirement for passage through parliament -
until November 8 to 11.
Mr Hosokawa now hopes to get them through by the middle of this month, so
that he can present the results to US President Bill Clinton, a keen
advocate of Japanese political reform, when they meet in Seattle on November
19 at a summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation council.
The LDP's interest in delaying the bills appears to be to enforce as many
amendments as possible by pushing Mr Hosokawa close to the deadline. It is a
high-risk game.
'If the LDP were seen by the electorate to block reform again it would be
the final disaster. The party would have to break up,' says Mr Jeff Young,
political analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia. The party's image is already
being further damaged by allegations that it received funds from the
scandal-ridden construction industry, in which public investigators have
begun to circle around Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former LDP prime minister.
The LDP's capacity to carry out a rational strategy is limited, however, by
its internal divisions.
Officially, the LDP wants to shift the balance towards single-seat
constituencies, in which well-funded parties such as the LDP, which is still
the biggest with 227 lower house seats, fare best.
It has tabled a counterplan for a 471-seat lower house, of 300 single-seat
constituencies and 171 under proportional representation. Mr Hosokawa has
indicated that he is prepared to compromise.
But there is a hard core of between 60 and 70 LDP members of parliament,
mainly older politicians, who oppose the whole principle of single-seat
constituencies. They have worked for years to build up local constituency
support groups and do not relish having to compete against younger people
for a single party nomination.
However, the eagerness of Mr Yohei Kono, the new LDP president, to avoid
upsetting the old guard rather than aggressively pursue the party's official
pro-reform policy has frustrated reform-minded younger members.
Former LDP members now at the top of the coalition are doing their best to
woo these ex-colleagues to their camp.
The coalition is also divided. Some members of the Social Democratic party,
the largest coalition partner, are unhappy with single-seat constituencies,
not because they share the LDP traditionalists' preference for the
multi-seat system, under which the former Socialists lost half their seats
in the July election, but because they feel they would do less badly under
proportional representation.
'Inevitably, Mr Hosokawa will have to water down the package to get it
through parliament,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of politics at
Tokyo University. The vested interests that will have to be satisfied are
important because they provide an indication of the problems in store for
the next stage.
Once those bills are passed, the parties will have to meet in committees to
redraw Japan's electoral boundaries. They will have to decide how to split
the large multi-seat constituencies into small single seaters and how to
shift the disproportionate weight of the rural vote - which counts for
roughly three times the urban vote - to the cities.
That process will take at least six months of behind-the-scenes power play.
If, as seems likely, Mr Hosokawa is still in a job by then, he is expected
to call an election under the new rules around next July, as soon as the new
boundaries have been agreed.
The coalition's chance of winning an election after political reform rests
on its ability to sink its differences and campaign on a single ticket.

Korean weapons

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has offered to help Japan to defend itself against a possible North
Korean nuclear attack.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said after a meeting with Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, that he had offered Japan at least
three options for obtaining a missile defence system. They included buying
one of the US's own theatre missile defence programmes currently under
development, exchanging technology or launching a new joint development
project.
'If they think of another alternative, of a way that they would like to
participate, we'd be willing to listen to that too,' said Mr Aspin. US
intelligence indicated that North Korea did have a nuclear weapons
programme, but the evidence on exactly how close it was to producing nuclear
weapons was 'mixed,' he said.
The offer of co-operation is not new. The US and Japan already lead
international efforts to persuade Communist North Korea to accept inspection
of two suspected nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
However, Mr Aspin's latest gesture has fresh relevance in Japan, where
public anxiety over North Korea's military ambitions has reached new
heights. The latest source of alarm came last May, when North Korea
test-fired into the Sea of Japan a long-range missile that could have
reached Tokyo.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Iraqi shot dead in border kidnap bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A KUWAITI surveyor shot and killed an Iraqi policeman, wounding a second, in
a skirmish inside the Gulf state's United Nations-defined northern border,
UN observers said yesterday. The incident is among the most serious for nine
months on the border, the demarcation of which Iraq has refused to accept.
The UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (Unikom) said the shooting occurred on
Monday afternoon after three Iraqi policemen crossed into Kuwaiti territory
2km west of Umm Qasr port in an apparent attempt to arrest six Kuwaiti
surveyors. The Kuwaitis were making a survey of properties along the border
strip.
The spokesman said the Iraqi police ignored Unikom warnings to leave the
area. One then opened the door of a car in which the Kuwaitis were sitting
and the Iraqis fired three shots in the air. One of the Kuwaitis then drew a
gun and shot at two of the Iraqis, wounding one in the hand and hitting
another in the chest. The two wounded men were taken to the Unikom
headquarters in Basra, southern Iraq. The UN spokesman said the more
seriously wounded Iraqi later died.
More than 300 unarmed UN observers have sustained a 24-hour watch over the
15km demilitarised zone saddling the Iraq-Kuwait border since the end of the
Gulf war. UN officers said yesterday that there have been sporadic
shootings, from both sides, over the border, but described Monday's incident
as among the most serious since since January, when teams of Iraqis made
organised incursions into northern Kuwait in an attempt to retrieve military
hardwear left after the war.
However, the UN officials said the incident did not appear to signal rising
tensions in the border area. Kuwait is nearing completion of a 3m-deep by
5m-wide trench along the length of its 207km border to prevent Iraqi
incursions.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Indian export surge slows down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT surge in India's exports slowed down considerably in September,
bearing out forecasts that the pace of previous months would prove
unsustainable.
Exports in September rose by just 6.6 per cent year-on-year, in marked
contrast to the increase of 24.3 per cent recorded in April-August, the
first five months of the 1993-94 financial year, according to figures
published by the commerce ministry this week.
The slowdown was partly caused by widespread lorry drivers' strikes. But
economists also believe that the summer surge benefited from the temporary
effect of the shipping of orders postponed from earlier in the year when
cities including Bombay, the commercial capital, were hit by civil unrest.
Nevertheless, both government and private sector economists believe that the
rate of export growth will remain fairly strong and hit 15 to 20 per cent
for the financial year as a whole. They point out that, after allowing for
the September slowdown, export growth in the first half of the financial
year hit 21 per cent, a record for India.
Finance ministry officials say companies are benefiting from economic
liberalisation and from currency devaluation carried out since 1991. Exports
of food and agricultural products, textiles, garments, gems and jewellery
are all performing well above expectations.
Exports in the six months to September totalled Dollars 10.35bn (Pounds
6.8bn). Imports were Dollars 10.79bn, leaving a trade deficit of just
Dollars 440m.
The finance ministry is satisfied with the performance of the trade account,
which is helping raise India's foreign exchange reserves to record levels of
over Dollars 7bn.
However, economists are concerned at the stagnation in imports, which fell
3.4 per cent in the six months to September. This reflects poor demand from
recession-hit industry which is suffering from a dearth of orders from the
state sector.
State enterprises are being forced to make savings due to a squeeze on the
government help they once received.

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA said yesterday it would boycott a key meeting today with South
Korea, setting back hopes for a resolution of its dispute over nuclear
inspections.
North Korea's cancellation of the talks came as senior US and South Korean
defence officials met in Seoul to consider whether to suspend their joint
Team Spirit military exercise scheduled for next spring.
Pyongyang has demanded that Team Spirit be cancelled before allowing the
resumption of routine nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).
But the US is unlikely to cancel Team Spirit as long as North Korea fails to
achieve progress in talks with South Korea about additional mutual nuclear
inspections.
US and South Korean officials had hoped that today's inter-Korean meeting
would break an impasse, with the two countries agreeing to exchange
presidential envoys who would discuss nuclear inspections and other
bilateral issues.
US and South Korean officials believe that the North Korean nuclear
inspection issue may now be reaching a critical stage.
Mr Hans Blix, the IAEA director-general, told the UN earlier this week that
agency's ability to monitor activity at North Korea's nuclear facilities is
in danger of being broken if Pyongyang continues to deny access to IAEA
inspectors.
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, and Mr Han Sung-joo, the South
Korean foreign minister, agreed yesterday in Seoul that whenever the IAEA
declares the safeguards to be broken, they would stop negotiating with North
Korea and ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions on
Pyongyang.
'The most important variable right now is Blix's judgment on when the
safeguards are broken. Seoul and Washington believe this judgment is
entirely up to the IAEA,' said a South Korean foreign ministry official.
North Korea has warned that it would take 'appropriate counter-measures' if
it is threatened with sanctions, implying a military response.
Pyongyang's refusal to meet Seoul appears to be in reaction to the UN
General Assembly's overwhelming approval of a resolution on Monday urging
North Korea to co-operate immediately with IAEA inspections.

He said the army had reached the agreement with Ms Sylvie Kinigi, the

Remnants of Mr Ndadaye's government have taken refuge at the French embassy

The surviving ministers have said they will come out only if an estimated
1,000 foreign troops are deployed to protect them.
The army, controlled by the relatively small but powerful Tutsi tribe, had
previously opposed foreign troops intervening.

February 1993. He faces 22 charges stemming from the deals, which involved
antiques and art pieces.
Mr Yeo, who is also the chairman of NatSteel and the Empress Place Museum,
both in Singapore, recently chaired the board of advisers for an

FT  04 NOV 93 / Rabin warns over defeat in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YITZHAK Rabin, Israeli prime minister, warned yesterday the defeat of his
Labour party and of veteran Mayor Teddy Kollek in Jerusalem municipal
elections would have a damaging impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process and on Arab-Jewish relations in the holy city.
His warning came after preliminary results of the Jerusalem poll last night
showed a substantial victory by Mr Ehud Olmert, the right-wing Likud
candidate, over Mr Kollek, the moderate mayor who has led the city for 28
years. Mr Olmert said yesterday the preliminary results showed he had
defeated Mr Kollek by 59.5 per cent to 34.6 per cent.
Elsewhere in the country the Likud party kept control of Tel Aviv, Israel's
commercial capital, and took six other councils from Labour. Labour won
three councils from Likud.
The results of the Jerusalem election are a big boost to the demoralised
Likud party and a setback for Mr Rabin who had, unwisely according to
political experts, turned the municipal polls into a vote of confidence in
his peace policy.
Mr Olmert, a 48-year-old former cabinet minister, campaigned on an
aggressive policy of Jewish settlement anywhere throughout the divided city
and has raised fears of increasing Arab-Jewish tensions at the heart of the
most sensitive issue for future peace talks: the control over the disputed
city.
Last night Mr Olmert, who has opposed the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord,
said he strongly supported solidifying Jerusalem as a united city under
Israeli sovereignty. He said he firmly backed the right of any residents of
Jerusalem, Arab or Jew, to buy property anywhere in the city. In practice
experts say this would open the door for ideological Jewish settlement in
Arab neighbourhoods.
Senior Palestinian politicians warned that Mr Olmert's election would
exacerbate already strained relations between the two communities in
Jerusalem.
Mr Rabin yesterday warned against the dangers of Mr Olmert reviving past
efforts by Likud to settle Jews in Arab areas. 'If there will be a
repetition to what the Likud did in the past in sneaking to apartments in
the Old City, Silwan and the City of David it can cause a great harm to the
delicate fabric of relations.'
Mr Olmert last night criticised Mr Rabin for politicising his elections and
sought to reassure Jerusalem residents and said he would treat Arabs as
equal to Jews in the allocation of resources. 'We will invest more in
improving the quality of life of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem. This
is our elementary obligation as human beings.'
Mr Olmert however stressed that he expected to be deeply involved in
negotiations about the future of Jerusalem due to begin within two years and
would insist on no territorial concessions to Palestinians.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Russia switches tack on nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has approved a new Russian defence doctrine,
abandoning the 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and permitting the
stationing of troops abroad.
Russia's Security Council approved the outlines of the doctrine, which for
the first time specifies the role of the post-communist armed forces after
the cold war. Diplomats and military observers in Moscow said the decision
'merely brings Russian in line with other nuclear states'.
The 'no first use' policy, promulgated by the Soviet Union, was used as a
propaganda weapon with which to beat Nato countries which had no such
principle. 'The Soviet-era doctrine was a ploy in which Nato never believed
and which was a luxury which a state with overwhelming conventional
advantage could permit itself,' one senior western diplomat said yesterday.
General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said Russia would not use
atomic weapons against any non-nuclear state which had signed the 1968
Non-Proliferation Treaty - with two exceptions. Nuclear weapons could be
used in defence of Russia against non-nuclear states if they were allied
with nuclear states or had an agreement with one.
He said the doctrine said nothing on the subject of an attack from a nuclear
state - implying that Russia reserved the right for first use.
Mr Oleg Lobov, the secretary of the Security Council in which the doctrine
was approved on Tuesday, said in an interview with the daily Izvestiya that
'if war is launched against Russia or its partners in the union then we have
the right to use all the means we have to defend our most basic interests'.
However, he said 'the basic approach of the doctrine is that nuclear war is
senseless'.
Gen Grachev said that the military was concerned with the growth of
conflicts in neighbouring, former Soviet states - and said that 'we must try
to stop them earlier'. He said 'a new idea is that in the interests of
Russia and of other Commonwealth members there could be cases where Russian
forces and equipment are based outside of Russia'.
Russian troops are already in Georgia, guarding railways and roads, as a
struggle rages between government and rebel forces. In what might prove to
be a bold step deeper into the civil war, nine Russian warships off the port
of Poti were poised to put paratroopers, tanks and armoured vehicles ashore
at dawm today in an area which has changed hands several times during the
conflict.
Russian troops are also aiding the government of Tajikistan against rebels
based in Afghanistan, while Russian divisions remain in Moldova, Armenia,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrghyzia.
In the Baltics, troops remain in Estonia and Latvia - and Gen Grachev made
it clear they would stay on until Russian claims that the civil rights of
the large Russian minorities there had been satisfied.

ITALY'S President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday denied allegations linking
him with illicit payments from a slush fund in the 1980s, saying they were
part of an attempt to destabilise the country. In a live television address
which interrupted scheduled programmes the president said: 'I have a serene
conscience that I have always and only served the state in the absolute
respect of law.' His comments follow media reports that a jailed former
secret agent had accused him of receiving Dollars 60,000 a month from a
slush fund when he was interior minister in the 1980s.
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, could be back at work 'within
two or three days,' according to lawyers defending him against charges of
alleged corruption, writes Haig Simonian from Milan. Mr De Benedetti was
placed under house arrest on Tuesday after giving himself up to police in
Milan. The terms of Mr De Benedetti's detention at his home in one of the
most prestigious parts of Rome are relatively lax. Unlike some businessmen
implicated in the 21-month corruption scandal, Mr De Benedetti has been
allowed to receive visitors and to use the telephone to conduct his business
affairs.

FT  04 NOV 93 / European banks sceptical on monetary union targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN banks are highly sceptical about the EC's ability to forge a single
currency by the end of the century, according to a continent-wide survey
published yesterday.
Most banks confess that economic and monetary union (Emu) would not be in
their interest, since they hope to increase profits during the next few
years from dealing in financial instruments and securities in individual EC
currencies.
The survey highlights a drive to cut costs and bring in new technology
particularly in retail banking.
It suggests that banks in 21 countries will reduce employment by 250,000 by
the end of the decade, with a total of 20,000 branches likely to be closed.
Banks in the UK, Germany and France - all with large financial centres with
heavy interest in foreign exchange and interest rate trading opportunities -
are particularly sceptical about Emu.
UK respondents are the most dismissive, with some 95 per cent ruling out the
possibility that all of the EC countries will move to a single currency by
the year 2000.
Among the 400 banks and institutions surveyed, 86 per cent thought this goal
was unlikely. A total of 50 per cent termed as improbable the less ambitious
objective of full participation by all EC currencies in the 'narrow band' of
the exchange rate mechanism.
Underlying how banks intend to shift towards more sophisticated activities,
profits growth is seen highest in areas like derivatives, insurance and bond
and equity trading.
In contrast to EC hopes of smaller financial market fluctuations in the
future, banks in Germany, Spain, Austria, Norway and Luxembourg expect
greater exchange rate volatility within the EC.
However, banks in France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Den - mark - whose
governments are all committed to currency stability within the ERM - expect
lower volatility in the foreign exchange markets in coming years.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Oil industry critical of Norway's tax reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Norwegian government is drafting changes to its oil tax regime which
could increase the burden on foreign and domestic oil companies operating in
the country, according to tax specialists.
The minority Labour government aims to complete a draft of the proposed tax
reform by the end of the month, but it would be made retroactive to January
1, 1993.
On Monday, Mr Arne Oeien, permanent finance secretary, told a conference in
Oslo that Norway was considering reducing tax concessions to oil companies
that use high levels of debt to increase their tax allowances.
Industry reaction to the government move has been critical. 'This would have
a serious negative impact on the Norwegian oil industry as well as Norwegian
society as a whole,' according to Mr Mark Randle, finance manager of
Phillips Petroleum Norway. 'There should be no doubt that future investments
both onshore and offshore would be hurt by the proposal.'
'Also, the fact that the proposal is meant to be enacted with retroactive
effect from January 1, 1993, shows that the industry can have little
confidence in the Norwegian fiscal framework. There have been investment
decisions made with the expectation that the 1992 fiscal framework would
last longer than one year.'
Last year the government implemented a reform to the petroleum tax regime
but it created a loophole for foreign oil companies, allowing them to
repatriate funds to parent companies at the expense of the tax authorities.
The loss to the government is estimated to be several hundred million kroner
annually. At present, oil companies are allowed tax deductions of 78 per
cent on the interest payments on their borrowings. Tax specialists say this
has resulted in Norwegian subsidiaries repatriating substantial dividends to
their foreign parent companies, while at the same time running up
borrowings.
The government is now considering reducing the rate of tax deduction allowed
on interest payments to 28 per cent.
Mr Anders Utne, a senior executive with Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest
independent oil company, sharply criticised the proposed move. 'The
government will punish the Norwegian oil companies for the sins of foreign
oil companies' subsidiaries operating in Norway,' Mr Utne said.
Tax specialists said there could also be an increase in the special tax on
petroleum operations, which is currently a 48 per cent levy on extraordinary
income from offshore operations. That is on top of 28 per cent corporate
tax.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission still hopes to rush through proposals on the
restructuring of the Community's state-owned steelmakers in time for formal
approval by EC industry ministers in two weeks.
Senior Commission officials yesterday welcomed 'positive new elements' in
the Treuhand privatisation agency's plans for the sale of Ekostahl, the east
German steelmaker. They said they believed an acceptable deal could also be
struck with the Italian authorities on the restructuring of Ilva, the
loss-making producer.
But national officials believe that there may not be enough time to sort out
member states' remaining objections to the Commission's proposals and push
for unanimous approval of the Italian, German and Spanish steel
restructuring at the November 18 meeting.
Delaying a decision until December would further punish the EC steel
industry, which is groaning under the burden of overcapacity, slackening
demand and alleged unfair competition from outside the Community.
Wider EC plans to cut capacity and support the steel producers cannot take
effect until decisions have been made on the restructuring of publicly owned
steelmakers in east Germany, Italy and Spain. The Commission had originally
hoped to agree an overall plan for capacity cuts, financial and commercial
support, by the summer.
A senior Commission official said yesterday: 'We can't possibly postpone
this council (of ministers): either they come to a miraculous agreement (on
November 18), or we will have a very direct and dramatic exchange of views
which hopefully will clarify the situation and at least pave the way for a
final agreement.'
Both the German and Italian authorities are expected to submit formal plans
to the Commission for the restructuring of their problem steel producers in
the next few days.
According to Treuhand plans unveiled two days ago, Riva, the private Italian
steel group, is expected to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the
construction of a new hot-rolling mill. Brussels officials said yesterday
they would have to examine whether there was sufficient private investment
in the hot-rolling mill to avoid adding to problems with overcapacity.
Private steelmakers will not make the painful closures that Brussels
believes are required to restore the EC industry to health unless they are
sure competition is not being distorted by subsidies.
Ilva, meanwhile, has formally approved a plan to divide itself into three
separate operations, seen as a vital precursor to privatisation, or, in some
cases, closure. The three operations cover the group's big flat products
operation, based at Taranto in southern Italy; stainless steels, based at
Terni in Umbria. The third company incorporates all those activities and
assets due to be liquidated, along with a majority stake in the quoted
Dalmine tubes group, which is set to be privatised.
Commission officials said yesterday they were heartened by the privatisation
proposals contained in the Ekostahl plan.
To avoid accusations that the German authorities are covertly subsidising
new capacity, German officials indicated yesterday that a separate legal
entity, owned by Riva, may be set up to build the new hot-rolling mill at
Ekostahl. Riva, one of Italy's leading private steelmakers, is still
family-owned, is based in Milan and has most of its productive capacity in
northern Italy.

RUSSIAN authorities are preparing a mass of legislation to put a market
system firmly in place, on the assumption that the December 12 parliamentary
elections will return a reformist government, ministers said yesterday.
The reforms include:
Laws on foreign investment which would guarantee property rights and the
ability to remit profit.
A new phase of privatisation from July next year, covering sectors such as
energy and transport.
A decree allowing the government to set strict performance and profit
targets for state-owned companies.
The drastic reduction of the Ministry of the Economy, formerly Gosplan, to a
small agency concerned with analysis and forecasting - thus ceding top place
in economic management to the Finance Ministry for the first time since the
Bolshevik revolution.
The reformers, many of them on the ticket of 'Russia's Choice', the main
party of the right, are confident of securing a reform-minded parliament and
thus a radical government. Professor Richard Layard, who co-heads the Centre
for Economic Performance in Moscow, reflected their optimism when he said
yesterday that 'if Russia can stick to a course of tight monetary control
and bring down inflation, then by the end of the century it could have the
fastest-growing economy in the world'.
However, the figures produced yesterday by the Centre remain discouraging.
Inflation remained over 20 per cent in September, while the real exchange
rate of the rouble and output continued to fall.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, told a government session
on privatisation yesterday that the mass privatisation of enterprises by
voucher would continue until July 1 next year, after which 'a deep
transformation' of the programme would be set in train, aimed at
establishing strong companies and investment groups. The emphasis would
shift, he said, from the rapid distribution of state property to individual
programmes targeted on industries and companies.
Mr Valery Fateyev, deputy economics minister, said yesterday there were 'no
serious investors' in Russia, because there were 'no guarantees for
tomorrow'.

FRANCE and Germany will be able to demonstrate to their EC partners later
this month 'the credible convergence of Europe's two largest economies' by
the mid to late 1990s, Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister,
claimed yesterday.
Speaking a day after he and his German counterpart, Mr Theo Waigel, jointly
unveiled the thrust - though not yet the detail - of their medium-term
convergence plans, Mr Alphandery defended his government's estimate that the
French economy would recover to grow by an average 3.2 per cent in
1995-1997.
He said this estimate was tenable in view of France's growth record in past
decades, and of the fact that France would be bouncing back from its
1992-1993 recession. Mr Alphandery described the French and German
governments' joint preparation of their convergence plans as 'symbolic' in
the context of the Maastricht treaty's requirement that EC economies should
converge on spending and inflation criteria to qualify for monetary union.
EC ministers are to discuss their countries' medium-term plans on November
22, paving the way for the EC summit in December to set general guidelines
for economic convergence, as laid down in the Maastricht pact.
Convergence discussions with Germany, which started right after the monetary
upheaval of early August, 'have led us to adapt our own medium-term
projections,' Mr Alphandery said.
The French government had been working on the minimum assumption that
France's economy would grow by 2.8 per cent annually in 1995-1997, which
would at least bring its budget deficit under 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, as required by Maastricht.
But emboldened by official German insistence that Germany, which is France's
biggest trading partner, would have average growth of 3 per cent throughout
that period, the French government has now put possible post-1995 growth in
its own economy at up to 3.5 per cent.
In the much shorter term, Mr Alphandery scaled down his estimate of this
year's contraction in the French economy from 0.8 to 0.7 per cent, in line
with the forecast of Insee, the official statistics agency.

FT  04 NOV 93 / German prospects gloomy: Business community pessimistic on
the recovery

THE west German business community sees no sign of an early recovery from
the current recession, even if the decline in economic activity has slowed
down, according to the latest comprehensive survey of business opinion.
The autumn poll of 25,000 enterprises in east and west Germany, conducted by
the German chamber of trade and industry (DIHT), shows a continuing
improvement in the mood in the east, but an overwhelmingly gloomy assessment
of prospects in the vital western economy.
However, the federal statistics office released a more cheerful indicator
yesterday, suggesting manufacturing industry orders in west Germany
increased by 1 per cent in September, compared with August. The combined
level of August and September orders was still 5.4 per cent below the value
of the previous year, with the sharpest decline in the value of orders for
investment goods - down 6.7 per cent.
The key conclusions of the business survey are for a further decline in
investments in the coming year, and a continuing loss of jobs in the west,
although with a slowdown in redundancies in the east.
'There is still no sign of a recovery in the (western) economy,' Mr Franz
Schoser, chief executive of the DIHT. 'Signs of stabilisation at a low level
are emerging.' A marginal improvement in expectations for 1994 - with 20 per
cent of the enterprises expecting an improvement, compared with only 12 per
cent in the last spring survey - is based mainly on hopes for a recovery in
exports. Some 24 per cent expect higher exports, compared with only 16 per
cent in the spring. 'The frosty investment climate has grown more severe,'
Mr Schoser said. 'The consolidation measures in the public sector are
regarded as inadequate. Hopes for a cut in taxes are receding.'
One positive assessment was over the effect of the reduction in interest
rates, which should reduce business costs, and stimulate consumption.
However, the number of enterprises planning to increase employment in the
coming year shrank to just 5 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the
spring.

Germany came a step closer to introducing a modern regulatory infrastructure
for its financial markets yesterday when the cabinet approved the draft of
the second Financial Markets Promotion Law, writes David Waller from
Frankfurt. The long-awaited new law will make insider dealing a criminal
offence in Germany for the first time, punishing offenders with up to five
years in jail or a fine of up to DM500,000 (Pounds 203,252).

FT  04 NOV 93 / Yeltsin lays down the law to regional leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday told leaders of Russia's 88 regions and
republics to approve a new constitution stripping them of privileges and
rights and asserting the power of the presidency and the federal government.
In a toughly worded speech to the regional leaders, the Russian president
insisted on removing from the draft constitution all reference to the
republics as 'sovereign states' and to a right of secession - clauses which
had been part of earlier drafts before Mr Yeltsin's hand was strengthened by
his military victory over the Russian parliament a month ago.
He also said the 67 regions and the 21 republics must enjoy the same rights
and responsibilities - rather than, as now, a bias in favour of republics.
A group of regions, including Tatarstan, Yakutia, Bashkiria, Kabardino
Balkaria and Dagestan, have objected to these clauses and demanded changes.
Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, president of Tatarstan, said that 'this is the
constitution of a unitary state. People in the republics will not support
such a draft.'
However, after a day's argument, Mr Yeltsin ordered a six-man commission to
thrash out an agreed position - while making it clear through Mr Sergei
Filatov, his chief of staff, that he would not fundamentally alter the
disputed clauses and that if no agreement was reached he would push it
through in its present form.
The draft constitution must be completed and published by November 10, a
statutory month before elections which will also include a referendum on the
constitution.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Sainsbury cuts spark price war: Food retailing shares fall
as supermarket group announces reductions on 300 lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest food retailer J Sainsbury launched a supermarket price war
yesterday as it disclosed that it was indefinitely cutting the price of 300
of its most popular own-label products - accounting for 10 per cent of its
sales.
The move is the most important evidence yet of a significant shift in UK
retailing away from concentration on profit margins, towards offering lower
prices to drive volumes higher.
Shares in the food retailing sector were sharply lower, with brokers fearing
escalating price competition would damage profits. Sainsbury itself fell 15p
to 385p; Argyll, owner of Safeway, fell 18p to 274p; Tesco was down 4 1/2 p
at 195p; and Asda fell 2 1/2 p to 50 1/4 p. Kwik Save, the leading discount
chain, also fell 18p to 620p.
The move came as Marks and Spencer announced a 21 per cent increase in
interim profits after trimming gross margins and sharpening prices.
Mr Bill Currie, analyst at BZW, who predicted Sainsbury's move, said the
scope of the price cuts was bigger than expected. 'I think we are now in a
price war,' he said. 'This turns the screw in a big way on the competition.
They can either respond by cutting prices or they can lose sales.'
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said the move marked a long-term repositioning
on price. 'It is more than just something we do for a three-month period. It
(will) set the pattern for our future position in the market.'
He said other leading food retailers had responded to mounting competition
from discount chains such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and the UK's
Kwik Save and Shoprite by focusing on price at the expense of quality.
'This provides us with a significant opportunity,' he said. 'Our response
will be to press home our advantage by improving both price competitiveness
and quality.'
Mr Sainsbury refused to disclose the average size of the cuts or the
reduction they would cause in gross margins. He said their effect on profits
would depend on any increase in sales.
TV and press advertisements with the slogan 'Sainsbury's - Essential for the
Essentials' have been running since Sunday - a departure from the previous
campaign featuring celebrities' recipes. The first price cuts were made on
Sunday but their extent became apparent only yesterday, as Sainsbury
announced record interim profits of Pounds 434m.
Sainsbury's action will significantly step up the pressure on other
superstores, with Safeway probably forced to follow suit. Analysts said
Tesco, which introduced a cut-price 'Tesco Value' brand in August, and Asda,
which has sharpened its prices, might be cushioned, but Safeway would
probably be forced to follow suit. The biggest casualties are expected to be
weaker chains such as Gateway, Waitrose, the Co-ops and independent grocers.
The move comes a week after the UK's three biggest supermarket chains failed
in a High Court battle to block the opening by US company Costco of the
country's first warehouse club - which will sell a range of goods at very
low prices to fee-paying members.
Sainsbury said it would not appeal against the judgment.

FT  04 NOV 93 / New EBRD chief plans sweeping changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SWEEPING reorganisation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development will be announced on Monday by Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the
central banker who took over as its president just over a month ago.
The restructuring of the aid bank, whose former president Mr Jacques Attali
resigned this summer after the bank was criticised for its extravagance and
poor internal management, aims to make it more 'user friendly' and
responsive to the 'specific needs' of countries in the former Soviet Union
and eastern Europe, according to a board document.
The bank's most distinctive division, merchant banking, which uniquely among
international aid banks concentrates on privatisation, will disappear. The
presidential cabinet and the political department, two departments highly
valued by Mr Attali, are also being abolished.
The cabinet was an inner circle of executives advising the president and the
political department was a team of political specialists, who offended some
east European governments with analyses of politicial stability.
The press and public affairs department is also being cut back, with up to
half of its 18 staff going. There will be up to 50 redundancies out of a
total executive staff of 703.
The bank's board, which represents the countries and agencies that own the
bank, is expected to approve the reorganisation at a meeting on Monday. 'It
will then be put into effect immediately,' said a bank executive.
Mr de Larosiere's first working day at the bank was October 4. 'He has moved
incredibly quickly to make his mark,' commented an executive. 'We had a big
morale problem after all the criticism in the spring and summer. It was
important for staff to know how we were going to move forward.'
The merchant banking division will be combined with the development banking
division, which concentrates on financing and advising on infrastructure
projects, such as transport, banking and telecommunications systems. But
they will not be combined into a single division. Instead, one new
department will provide merchant banking and infrastructure services to
northern countries and another will be created for the south.
A board document explains that the 'need for enhanced country focus must be
addressed within the context of one operational strategy'.
It continues: 'The notion of limited resources forces the bank to focus on
its real priorities and to streamline its organisation in order to work in
the most cost-effective way.'
There will, however, be a new central unit to provide functions spanning
both the north and south departments, which will carry out marketing and
procurement.
Mr de Larosiere has also commissioned a team headed by the bank's new
economist, Mr Nick Stern, to carry out a fundamental review of the bank's
strategy and priorities.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Clinton plays down Republican wins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday put a brave face on election results which
saw Republicans sweep Democrats from office in New York City Hall and in the
governor's mansions in New Jersey and Virginia.
White House officials rejected suggestions that Tuesday's results would make
it more difficult for the president to obtain approval for the North
American Free Trade Agreement, on which the House of Representatives is due
to vote on November 17.
The administration yesterday sent to Congress the formal Nafta legislation.
Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader, who described the results as 'a big,
big defeat for the White House', said he was still confident that at least
110 of the 175 House Republicans would support the treaty.
Mr Clinton said broad conclusions from the Democratic losses should not be
drawn because 'voters are extremely discriminating, making judgments for
their own reason'. He added: 'I think what you can say is that the American
people want change and want results', and he was intent on delivering both.
The most disappointing loss for the president was in New Jersey where
Governor James Florio, the incumbent Democrat, went down by 50-48 per cent
to Mrs Christine Todd Whitman. Mr Clinton and his wife had campaigned for Mr
Florio, whose policies in raising taxes and seeking more stringent gun
control much resemble the president's.
In New York, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, former federal prosecutor, became the
city's first Republican mayor since John Lindsay left office 20 years ago,
ousting Mr David Dinkins, the black incumbent, by 51-48 per cent an almost
exact reversal of four years ago.
This result was not unexpected, given city discontent with the record of Mr
Dinkins, for whom Mr Clinton had campaigned. Voting patterns, very much on
racial and ethnic lines, were similar to 1989, but Mr Giuliani secured
enough defections from liberal whites and Hispanics, both traditionally
Democratic, to win.
Presidential involvement in Virginia had been minimal. Mr George Allen, son
of a famous football coach, trounced Ms Mary Sue Terry, a former Democratic
state attorney-general, 58-41 per cent to become the first Republican
governor in 12 years.
His running-mate, Mr Michael Farris, a favourite of the religious right, was
defeated.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Firestorm sweeps through Malibu mansions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRES swept across more than 35,000 acres of southern California yesterday,
driving 7,000 people, including film stars, from their homes. Exclusive
neighbourhoods were levelled and at least 350 buildings were razed.
The Malibu Colony mansions of actors Charles Bronson, Sean Penn and Bruce
Willis were damaged or destroyed during the night, according to news
reports. Actor Rod Steiger called a local television station from his Malibu
home and was given directions during a live broadcast on how to find his way
out of danger.
The fires, which spread down from the Santa Monica mountains to the Pacific
coast, were blamed on arsonists and it was estimated that the damage would
run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
One of the most seriously injured in Malibu was British screenwriter and
director Duncan Gibbins. He had escaped from his bungalow but was badly
burnt when he returned to search for his cat. Report, Page 4

FT  04 NOV 93 / Ministers fight for rail bill after Lords setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CREDIBILITY of the government's rail privatisation plans was dealt a
serious blow last night by a series of defeats in the Lords on the crucial
issue of franchises to run British Rail routes.
The defeats were immediately reversed in the Commons, but only after a rowdy
debate in which Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, faced angry
opposition demands for his resignation.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, said the passage of the
Railways Bill had degenerated into 'farce' because of the procedural
'trickery' deployed by the government.
The Lords still has to ratify the government's proposals before they can
become law. However, peers are expected to back away from further
confrontation when they reconsider the matter today.
Lord Peyton, the prime mover of the Lords amendments, said a further attempt
to defeat the government would raise the prospect of 'a serious
constitutional clash' with the Commons.
The drama began in mid afternoon, when the Lords voted three times to loosen
restrictions placed by the government on BR's ability to bid for routes
against private-sector companies.
The effect of the amendments would have been to resuscitate the spirit of an
earlier Lords amendment, overturned by the Commons on Tuesday, which
ministers had dismissed as an attempt to wreck the bill.
The series of defeats left government business managers facing the choice of
capitulating to the Lords, or bringing the bill back to the Commons for a
further bruising debate.
After a couple of hours' discussion, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the
house, told MPs that the scheduled business in the Commons would be
interrupted to make way for an immediate attempt to rewrite the bill.
The announcement provoked angry protests from the Labour benches, including
a protest by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy opposition leader, that she
was given only 30 seconds' notice.
Backbench Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs attempted to force the suspension
of the debate, at times coming close to shouting down Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse,
the deputy speaker.
When the debate finally began, Mr MacGregor nearly missed his opportunity to
speak by being out of the chamber when he was called. The exchanges
underlined the air of confusion which now surrounds the bill, which has had
a difficult passage through both houses.
However, the government was assured of a Commons majority for its attempt to
reverse the Lords defeats after the collapse on Tuesday of a threatened
backbench rebellion. In a division, the main Lords amendment was rejected by
301 votes to 260, a government majority of 41.
The votes in the Lords would have given BR an unfettered right to bid for
franchises unless the franchising director, who will supervise the bidding,
decided to exclude it. As a result of the Commons vote, BR will be able to
bid for franchises only if no credible private-sector bidder emerges.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Lords defeat is setback for rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S rail privatisation plans were in disarray last night after
an unexpected series of defeats in the House of Lords on the crucial issue
of franchises to run British Rail routes.
In a highly unusual move, the Lords voted three times to loosen restrictions
placed by the government on BR's ability to bid for routes against private
sector companies.
The effect is to resuscitate the spirit of an earlier Lords amendment,
overturned by the Commons on Tuesday, which ministers had dismissed as an
attempt to wreck the bill.
The series of defeats left government business managers facing the choice of
capitulating to the Lords or bringing the bill back to the Commons for a
further bruising debate.
After a couple of hours' discussion, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the
house, told MPs that the scheduled business in the Commons would be
interrupted to make way for an immediate attempt to rewrite the bill.
The announcement provoked angry protests from the Labour benches, including
a protest by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour deputy leader, that she was
given only 30 seconds' notice.
The exchanges underlined the air of panic now surrounding the bill, which
has had a torrid passage through both houses and is widely opposed by rail
passengers.
However, the government was virtually assured of a Commons majority for its
attempt to reverse the Lords defeats.
The prospects of a backbench rebellion appeared slim in the light of
Tuesday's debate, when a threatened revolt fizzled out in the face of minor
government concessions that would allow BR to bid for franchises where no
credible private sector bidder emerges.
Mr Tim Rathbone, a leading backbench critic of the bill, said anxious
Conservative MPs were largely satisfied with the government's 'very
positive' concessions on Tuesday.
The Lords is likely to back down rather than defy the government again, in
spite of the strength of feeling among peers in yesterday's debate. The
opposition and independent benches were unusually full and many peers,
including some Conservatives, appeared angry at the government's handling of
the bill.
The anti-government vote was also swollen by the high standing of the main
speakers - Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport secretary, and Lord
Marsh, a former chairman of BR.
However, Lord Peyton said last night that a further government defeat in the
Lords would raise the prospect of 'a serious constitutional clash' with the
Commons.
Lord Peyton's unwillingness to take on the government again will disappoint
opposition leaders, who had hoped that the future of the bill would be
threatened by further Lords defeats.
The government must act quickly, however, because the bill will fall unless
agreement is reached before the Queen's Speech opening the next session of
parliament on November 18.

stake

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPROVING fortunes of Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, have
prompted the Bank of Finland to sell more than half its remaining stake in
the company to domestic and international investors.
The disposal of 18m shares reduces the bank's stake in Tampella to 23.6 per
cent from 50.6 per cent, and raises FM443m (Dollars 76m).
It represents a further diversification of the company's ownership base
after the bank sold 25m shares to investors in New York, London and
Stockholm for FM600m in August. Prior to that it held 88 per cent of the
company.
Tampella was acquired by the Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, as
part of a broader rescue of Skopbank in 1991. The group has shown a strong
recovery since then, following extensive restructuring and cost-cutting
which has left it focused on power and drilling operations.
In the first eight months losses after financial items were cut to FM65m
from FM317m in the same 1992 period.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: French bank gives terms of
FFr1.5bn share issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Foncier de France, the French banking group, yesterday joined the
queue of companies tapping the Paris stock market for capital by announcing
the terms of a FFr1.5bn share issue.
The group, which said it had decided to raise capital to 'increase our
financial capacity and to help us with our development', is issuing 1.48m
new shares at FFr1,000 each.
Under the terms of the issue, Credit Foncier's existing shareholders will be
given preferential rights to subscribe for one new share for every seven
already held.
Credit Foncier, like other French banks, has recently come under pressure
because of the recession. It previously announced a 14.4 per cent fall in
interim net profits, to FFr404m (Dollars 68.13m) for the first half of 1993
from FFr472m in the same period last year.
However, the group also confirmed its performance was likely to improve in
the second half, thereby producing a more favourable result for the full
financial year.
The announcement of the FFr1.5bn issue follows the launch of similar
capital-raising exercises by other French companies, including the BSN food
group, the Lafarge-Coppee building materials concern and Schneider, the
electrical engineers. They have timed their issues to take advantage of
buoyancy in the Paris stock market.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton pressed the US Congress yesterday to impose a waiting
period before handgun purchases as 'the first step' to controlling violent
crime, AP reports from Washington.
'I think it's going to be very difficult for the Congress to justify
continued inaction on what millions of Americans believe is the No. 1
problem in their lives,' the president said. He appeared with Mr Jim Brady,
former White House press secretary to President Ronald Reagan.
Mr Brady and his wife, Sarah, are leaders of Handgun Control, an anti-gun
lobbying group. He was badly wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt
against Mr Reagan.
Mr Brady's espousal of handgun controls had left him estranged from the
Republican administrations of Mr Reagan and Mr George Bush. He was welcomed
back to the Oval Office he once frequented to help Mr Clinton build support
for the Brady Bill, which calls for a waiting period on handgun purchases of
five business days, when a background check would be required.
Mr Clinton predicted the bill would pass this year. It passed a House
Judiciary subcommittee last week.
Mr Clinton hoped the full judiciary committee would complete work on it this
week.
He said that it would be brought up in the Senate as a separate issue, apart
from a crime bill, 'so that no one will be able to hide behind other issues
and try to find clever ways to filibuster it'.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Illegal labour a growth business: Ariane Genillard on
Germany's problems with a cheap import
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 8am and Mr Herbert Botz, who heads the task force clamping down on
illegal workers at the labour office in Cologne, scans his first
construction site of the day in nearby Leverkusen.
'We have never found a clean construction site in the whole region,' says Mr
Botz.
In Leverkusen, as in most cases, a letter from a rival construction company
caused the surprise search. Three Polish workers are ordered to lay their
tools down a few minutes later, when overdue papers show they are not
entitled to be on site.
'Often, we just tell them to stop working. Sometimes, they are put back on
buses to eastern Europe,' says Mr Botz.
More than half a million workers from eastern Europe are believed by trade
unions and political organisations to be employed illegally in Germany's
construction industry. Gathered in parking lots, they wait to be picked up
by employers who are eager to pay less than 25 per cent of a German wage for
the same job, says Mr Peter Rack. Albanians, employed for DM3 (Dollars 1.80)
to DM4 (Dollars 2.40) an hour, are the cheapest.
With growing unemployment and bitter price wars for construction contracts,
the rising number of illegal job-seekers crossing Germany's porous eastern
border is pitting companies against each other and unionists against
politicians.
Meanwhile, as the number of unemployed in western Germany in the sector has
risen by 3,000 to 76,122 last year, profits in the construction industry
have surged by 5.6 per cent, mostly as a result of growth in the east.
Nearly 1,000 new construction companies were registered last year.
For IGbau, the construction industry union, the core of the problem lies in
labour exchange agreements signed between Bonn and eastern neighbours in the
wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
These allow 97,104 people from eastern Europe to work in Germany at any time
for specific contracts lasting up to a year. Most are employed in the
construction industry.
The unions say this has fostered the growth of middlemen from eastern Europe
who sub-contract their nationals to German companies.
'One middleman gets 30 permits through a contract. But three days later, he
exchanges legal workers against illegal ones. This way he can keep people
coming in although they don't have the proper papers,' says Mr Hanz Haber,
spokesman for IGbau.
Aware of the growing abuses, the authorities have been trying to control the
problem by targeting companies rather than workers. Since the beginning of
the year local officers can check construction sites without search
warrants.
IGbau, which wants the labour agreements cancelled and greater protection of
the local highly regulated labour market, claims the authorities are
deliberately turning a blind eye to the problem. It says the government,
which has already asked Poland and the Czech Republic to take back
asylum-seekers, is reluctant to apply further pressure.
Pressure on the government has also come from organisations representing
small and medium-sized companies squeezed by falling prices for construction
contracts.
'We want the government to allow a limited number of eastern European
workers per enterprise, depending on the labour force it employs,' explains
Mr Julius Louvenen, from the Christian Democrats' small business lobby
group.
Talks with the government, which started a year ago, have been fruitless,
prompting an IGbau threat to take the government to the constitutional court
to introduce tighter wage controls in the workplace.
Meanwhile, some attempts are being made to improve the control on the
workers on a construction site. Special passes have recently been issued to
facilitate regular check-ups. But fines for illegally employing workers have
not been significantly increased.
'We get caught, the boss pays the fines and we come right back. For big
employers, the fines are peanuts. They'll make the money back in one month,
if you ask me,' says one illegal worker before vanishing into the crowd.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (12): A guide for the businessman - What
to look out for on your visit, and what to avoid, how to get there, where to
stay and what to eat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The country and the climate
MOROCCO lies on the north-west corner of Africa, three hours' flight from
London. It is the oldest kingdom in the Moslem world, the present Alaoui
dynasty having been in power for more than three centuries.
The climate varies considerably, from the northern coast, which is
Mediterranean, to the old imperial city of Marrakesh at the foot of the High
Atlas mountains, which is a favourite winter resort for Europeans and boasts
dry, temperate winters and very hot summers.
Along the Atlantic coast, the temperature is usually mild and often very
damp, especially at night and during the winter. Morocco has a great variety
of mountainous ranges, the highest peak, Jebel Toubkal, rising to over 4,000
metres.
The region beyond Agadir is true desert climate, more pleasant to visit in
winter and spring than summer. The resort of Agadir is open all year round
and boasts 300 days of sunshine a year. Most of Morocco's 27m people are of
Berber stock and speak Arabic. French is commonly spoken, though not in
country areas.
Getting there
Most major western air companies fly to Morocco. Royal Air Maroc and GB
Airways between them provide daily flights from the UK. Visas are not
required for European Community citizens. The Dirham currency cannot be
bought outside Morocco.
Business hours
Moroccan companies and administrations work a five-day week, from Monday to
Friday, with a slightly longer lunch hour on Friday to allow those who wish
to pray. During the Ramadan fast, which lasts one month, it is best to avoid
travelling to Morocco. In winter, hours of business are 8am to noon and 2pm
to 6pm; in summer (end of June to end of September) the hours are 8am to
4pm.
Car hire
Cars are easy to rent at major airports and hotels, but do not expect them
to be in perfect condition. By European standards, car hire is expensive.
Roads between major towns are good, though often narrow. A fast and regular
rail service and a motorway now connect the political capital, Rabat, to the
economic hub of Casablanca, 100 kilometres away.
Hotels
Hotels are easy to find and in general not expensive, especially if you get
a discount from the official price. However, many four or five star hotels
do not deserve their rating.
In Rabat the choice is between an overpriced Hyatt Regency and the Tour
Hassan, whose five-star de luxe rating is a standard joke. In Casablanca,
the Royal Mansour remains true to its grand style and excellent service,
while the Sheraton and the Holiday Inn offer good value. The Idou Anfa and
Kandara hotels provide good average comfort and service. On the corniche,
just outside the city, the Riad Salam is an attractive hotel.
In Marrakesh, the world-famous Mamounia underwent a refurbishment 10 years
ago, which was not a success, though its reception rooms, restaurant and
garden remain very attractive. The four-star Hotel Nassim provides excellent
service at competitive prices.
Taroudant, in the southern foothills of the Atlas, boasts the Gazelle d'Or,
a perfect resting place for the seriously rich, set in gardens outside the
small walled town. In Fez the Palais Jamai provides spectacular views of the
old religious capital of Morocco, though the service it offers is unworthy
of its five-star de luxe status. The Minzah in Tangiers remains, arguably,
the most attractive hotel in Morocco.
Eating out
Moroccan cooking ranks, alongside Turkish food, as the most refined in the
Mediterranean. Good French and Italian food is also available in the large
cities. You can safely shop by the roadside and eat 'keftas', skewers of
meat sprinkled with saffron.
Casablanca boasts one outstanding French establishment, Ma Bretagne, on the
corniche just outside the city. Other good French restaurants include Neroli
(which has just been taken over by Pierre, as one of Casablanca's oldest
French master cooks is known), Le Pretexte, Le Volubilis in the Royal
Mansour Hotel and La Gondole in the Centre 2000, near the railway station.
This establishment is run by Pierre Viaud, who left the Le Cabestan, where
he was chef, to open his own restaurant. The food at Le Cabestan has not
recovered. For Italian food, try Le Valentino in the Hyatt Regency Hotel or
Le Fellini and for Moroccan food, Al Mounia. Le Pekin offers good Chinese
food and Le Beyrouth excellent Lebanese fare.
In Rabat, L'Entrecote et le Vert Galand offer good French food. In
Marrakesh, L'Orangerie offers fine French food, Villa Rosa good French and
Italian fare; for traditional Moroccan food, the Yacout and Tobsil are best.
Arts and crafts
The variety of crafts in Morocco remains great. Carpets are plentiful and
varied but the wool they are made from is not always of good quality. Good
pottery from Fez, which is famed for its intricate bleu patterns, can be
ordered from Hidaya Tazi in Casablanca (tel 445638); excellent pottery can
also be found in the Potteries de Sale which are to be found in Rabat, at
the foot of the old walled medina. The town of Safi also has very attractive
wares.
State-run craft centres exist in most big towns but haggling in the souk,
while time-consuming, can be rewarding. The Habous district of Casablanca
has a wealth of traditional jewellery and caftans. Casablanca also provides
scope for getting good leather artefacts, which are cheaper if bought
directly at the factory gate.
Morocco has many modern painters whose works are keenly sought in Morocco
and abroad. Galleries such as Bab El Rouah in Rabat and Meltem in Casablanca
are worth a visit. Unfortunately, no museum regularly displays such works,
which can best be seen in the private galleries of the Banque Commerciale du
Maroc or the Office Cherifien des Phosphates.
Economics
For economic information about Morocco, the best source is the weekly
L'Economiste, whose reports and analysis are very reliable. The Centre
Marocain de Conjoncture produces regular studies on the state of the economy
but they are rather too academic for the average businessman. New financial
services such as Upline (tel 985855) or the Casablanca Finance Group (tel
441244), both in Casablanca, are reliable and good.
Books to read
John Warterbury's Commander of the Faithful, unfortunately out of print
remains as good a guide as any to the monarchical system of Morocco. Wyndham
Lewis's Travel in Barbary is a wonderfully evocative description of the
Berber society of southern Morocco.
Remy Leveau's Le Fellah Marocain, Defenseur du Trone provides a good
political introduction to the kingdom while Bruno Etienne's Les Arcanes du
Sultanat recently published by the French cultural review Autrement
(September 1990), is a pointed analysis of how King Hassan exercises his
considerable powers.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (11): Recession in Europe hits industry -
After a tough year, the government's passive attitude is under attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AT THE implausibly named Bogart factory in the industrial zone just outside
the centre of Casablanca, the Made in Morocco label is diligently stitched
into children's Levi denim clothes destined for France. Mr Mohamed Tamer,
the factory's owner, says that he has been fortunate in the current
recessionary climate to have experienced stagnant rather than falling sales.
Morocco's industrialists have had a tough year. The country's gross domestic
product fell in 1992 in real terms compared to the previous year, while
total exports experienced a 9 per cent drop to Dh33.6bn (Dollars 4bn). The
government expects exports to fall further in 1993 although gross domestic
product should grow by 3 per cent. The second year of drought has taken its
toll on production and on domestic purchasing power while exports have
suffered because Europe, which is Morocco's main market, has been in
recession.
Members of the Office of the Federation of Industry set out their grievances
to the government, in the shape of Mr Abder- azzak Mossadeq,
secretary-general of the Ministry of Commerce, at a seminar in May.
The main complaints were the progressive removal of tariffs against imports,
the high cost of energy (including periodic power cuts which are
particularly disruptive to textile manufacturers) and high interest rates.
Externally, the industry representatives were unhappy about the trend
towards increasing protectionism in overseas markets, depressed worldwide
demand and competition from smuggled goods.
While acknowledging the grievances of the industrialists, Mr Mossadeq
inclines towards the opinion that there is not much that the government can
do. He says that real rates of interest are about 10 per cent and the
government itself is bor- rowing money from the World Bank at 10 per cent.
Though he admits that the cost of energy is high, that is a problem which
everyone faces in Morocco, which does not have the fortune to be a part of
the oil-rich Arab world.
With privatisation a buzzword, the state in Morocco is distancing itself
from the industrial sector. Mr Mossadeq says that the government no longer
has an industrial strategy because that implies dirigisme. Things have
changed since the 1960s when it was forced to intervene because of the lack
of a private sector.
'I was at an African ministers of industry meeting recently and everyone was
talking about privatisation. But you need a private sector before you can
privatise which is why the state first invested in industry and is now
retreating,' says Mr Mossadeq.
Although the government would like to see greater vertical integration,
part- icularly in the textile and garments sector which is heavily dependent
on the import of raw materials, Mr Mossadeq says that the government can
only try to create the conditions in which industry might prosper by
measures which include providing technical centres to improve the skill of
the labour force.
The manufacturing sector is the second largest contributor to the country's
gross domestic product, accounting for over 18 per cent in 1992 and
overshadowed only by commerce with a contribution of 21.4 per cent to GDP.
The main industries are agro-industry (food-processing), textiles,
chemicals, metallurgy/mechanics and electrical/electronics. Of these, the
agro-industry and chemical industries contribute the most to industrial
production, with a share of roughly 32 per cent each in 1991 but textiles
and leather are the largest industrial export, accounting for 38 per cent of
industrial exports in 1991.
With 180,000 employees, the textile and leather industry is also the largest
industrial employer, accounting for one third of all those employed in
industry.
The industry's labour costs are the lowest of any Mediterranean country with
privileged access to the EC. It also has the advantage over its south-east
Asian competitors of proximity to Europe, which means lower transportation
costs.
Manufacturers, however, are worried by increasing protectionism in Europe
since they are heavily dependent on the European market for exports. Some 50
per cent of goods manufactured in the textile industry is exported and 80
per cent of these exports are to France.
Mr Mohamed Lahlou, vice president of Manatex, one of the country's
longest-established textile companies, and president of the Moroccan
Association of Textile Industries, says that the industry has suffered as a
result of the devaluation of some European currencies, notably the Spanish
peseta, the Italian lira and sterling. The leather industry saw a 10 per
cent fall in exports in 1992, with shoe sales performing particularly weakly
with a drop of over 20 per cent.
Investment in the whole sector fell in 1992 for the second consecutive year,
partly as a result of high interest rates, and Mr Lahlou has criticised the
government for its passive attitude towards the problems facing the sector.
By contrast, the sector which enjoys the largest investment is the chemical
and pharmaceutical industry which accounted for 38 per cent of all
industrial investment in 1991. The sector includes the phosphate industry,
controlled by the influential state monopoly, the Office Cherifien des
Phosphates (OCP).
Phosphate exports dropped to Dh8.48m last year from Dh10m in 1991 and are
expected to fall further to Dh7.7m this year. The industry has not been
aided by a drop in international prices from Dollars 42.5 a ton at the
beginning of 1992 to Dollars 38 in May this year.
Despite a fall in the phosphate sector's share of total exports from 43 per
cent in 1983 to an estimated 24 per cent in 1993, Morocco remains the
largest exporter of phosphates in the world and the proprietor of the
world's largest phosphate reserves.
The most optimistic industry is the metallurgy, mechanical, electrical and
electronic sector which has seen production increase from Dh13.2bn in 1988
to Dh20.3bn in 1991, on the back of strong investment which has almost
doubled over the same period while exports have risen almost threefold. The
industry is hoping for further growth this year.
Although some industrialists are calling for a devaluation of the dirham to
help exports and the reimposition of higher tariffs to protect domestic
industries from outside competition, the government appears unlikely to
adopt either measure.
Industry will have to weather the recession both at home and abroad and hope
that the trend towards lower domestic interest rates will continue in order
to aid both production and investment in the coming years.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (9): Acts of faith in Western Sahara -
Francis Ghiles finds that the Moroccan government is determined to keep the
territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE edge of the small fishing port of Dakhla, 1,000 kilometres from
Rabat, the Moroccan capital, a small block of flats stands empty. According
to local officials, it awaits the return of the 'lost brothers', those
Saharaouis who, since Morocco took over the Western Sahara 18 years ago,
chose to flee to camps in south-western Algeria and fight King Hassan's
claim to the former Spanish colony.
The dispute is still far from being settled despite 10 years of intermittent
fighting and a UN peace plan launched just over two years ago. Progress on
the plan has been stalled by disagreement between the Moroccans and the
Polisario Front, which has been fighting for an independent Western Sahara
and over who would be entitled to vote on the future of the territory.
On the ground, however, everything has been done to ensure that the
Moroccans stay. True figures of investment are not available but a visit to
the capital of the territory, Laayoune, and to Dakhla, to the south,
underlines the extent of Morocco's determination.
Laayoune, which in 1975 boasted a governor's residence, a traditional
Spanish parador style hotel, a brothel and thousands of shacks for the
natives - indeed it was more reminiscent of the wild west than anything else
 -has been turned into a bustling town of over 130,000 people, thronged at
lunchtime and in the late afternoon with children going to and from school.
A new airport has been built, while a new and slightly vulgar hotel has been
added to the parador, where the availability of peanut butter at breakfast
is a sure way of detecting the Canadian and American members of the Minurso
(United Nations Mission for Peace in Western Sahara), whose headquarters lie
just below the parador.
UN marked aircraft at Laayoune and Dakhla airports also remind the visitor
of the dispute, as does the fact that his passport is checked on arrival and
departure for domestic flights.
Unofficial estimates of investment in roads, hospitals, schools, water ducts
and other civilian projects are put at between Dh20bn and Dh30bn. Even these
figures, however, are underestimates as soldiers are often used, at no cost
to the state.
To those Saharaoui town dwellers who chose to remain and pay allegiance to
the Moroccan crown were added the nomads who, in the late 1970s, were driven
to the towns by the severe drought endured by the Sahel region of Africa.
Despite Moroccan government efforts to help such people reconstitute their
camel herds, the nomadic way of life is, here as elsewhere, a victim of
modern political and social evolution.
The effort to spread literacy and ensure a minimum of health is impressive.
A second hospital is about to open in Laayoune, and the province itself
boasts a further four. Each has 220 beds. Four smaller health centres exist
in Laayoune alone.
Medicine and all consultations and operations are free in the Western
Sahara. Laayoune's hospitals appear well run, staffed by well-trained
Saharaoui doctors and Moroccans from the north.
The 900 children who went to school in Spanish days have become 32,000
today. Laayoune boasts 27 primary schools, five lycees and a teachers'
training college. The authorities say that 90 per cent of those in age to
attend school in Laayoune do. Spanish has been forsaken as a foreign
language to be replaced by French and, increasingly, English. No foreign
teachers, however, have yet been allowed to practise in the territory.
Dakhla, which is now twinned with Rambouillet near Paris, has been virtually
built from scratch. The pasha of Dakhla, the genial Si Mohamed Fadhel
Semlali, points to a few remaining Spanish buildings, including an ugly
1950s style Catholic church still inhabited by an old Spaniard who has
apparently decided he is going to die in the place, around which he said
that about 90 Saharaoui families lived back in 1975. Dakhla was taken over
by Mauritania then and handed over to Morocco in August 1978.
The town now has 30,000 inhabitants and sits near the tip of a
40-kilometre-long tongue of sand between the rolling Atlantic waves and a
deep laguna. It feels like the back of beyond but boasts one asset which,
were the status of the Western Sahara to be finally settled, could be of
great importance: some of the richest fishing grounds in the world.
Indeed, the oddest sight in Dakhla is that of two Japanese visitors.
Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish vessels fish offshore, some legally,
others not. The prize here is squid, a great favourite with Asian consumers.
In Dakhla itself a few small plants, such as Fishgod, set up by a Mr Salem
Amghayer in 1989 operate, but the absence of a fully equipped port means
that most of the fish or squid caught offshore is treated in Agadir or Tan
Tan, much further north on the Moroccan coast, in the Canary Islands which
lie offshore or on the ships themselves.
How much people who have traditionally been nomadic and turned their back on
the sea can be turned into fishermen and businessmen remains to be proved.
Fishing could also provide a basis for tourist activity, though to date
there is little of that other than passengers transiting through Laayoune to
and from the Canary Islands and northern Morocco. The Dakhla laguna, its
beaches and the opportunities for serious fishing might well attract an
international hotel group. However, such an outcome appears unlikely so long
as the dispute continues.
The authorities in Dakhla have built a four-star hotel but for some reason
have done so in the middle of the town, away from the beach and in such a
tight location that the compound boasts no garden, no large swimming pool
and no seashore to step out to. No wonder they are finding it difficult to
find a company willing to manage such an establishment which otherwise is
soberly decorated and built to high standards.
Dakhla has also to do a lot to ensure running water in most homes. The town
is lucky as it sits on a large underground aquifer of sweet water. On the
other side of the laguna the king has set up a farm where fruit, including
winter melons, and vegetables are grown using state-of-the-art irrigation
technology. Much of the produce is exported to France.
The rich phosphate deposits at Bu Craa, 70 miles inland from Laayoune, are
still exploited and the rock treated at a plant outside Laayoune before
being exported but the depressed state of the market currently makes such
wealth of little importance in providing new jobs.
The considerable resources that Morocco has poured into developing the
Western Saharan provinces - whose population includes Saharaouis and many
northern Moroccans who can earn tax-free salaries while working there -
constitutes an act of faith. Traditional ties of allegiance between the
Moroccan sultans and tribal chieftains have been buttressed by Rabat's
continuous efforts to reinforce its physical presence and win the hearts and
pockets of the Saharaouis. Whatever their innermost feelings might be, they
have been offered more in terms of health, education and general well-being
than many of their northern brethren.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (10): Hub of undeclared activity - The
importance of the informal sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH it has been suggested that production of goods and services in
Morocco's traditionally flourishing informal sector may amount to 70 per
cent of official gross domestic product, academics and businessmen believe
that 30 per cent is a more realistic figure. No one, however, is in any
doubt that this sector plays a key role, providing hundreds of thousands of
jobs. The fact that it thrives helps to explain why, despite two years of
drought and declining GDP, the kingdom has so far not witnessed any serious
social disturbances.
Morocco's national accounts revalue the statistics they receive by a
coefficient to take account of the informal sector: the value of
manufacturing is thus raised by 14 per cent and that of the building sector
by 15-20 per cent. This figure is reached by matching the number of permits
to build with the consumption of cement.
In some sectors, the percentage of activity accounted for by the informal
sector is more precisely measured - it accounts for 36 per cent of all
clothes manufacturing, 30 per cent of all food processing and tobacco, 16
per cent of manufacturing of upholstery, 28 per cent of transport of goods,
25 per cent of hotel business and 19 per cent of all activities grouped
until the broad name of 'repairs'. These estimates date from 1988 but the
Direction de la Statistique in Rabat feels they hold true today.
Under the name 'informal sector' may be found a multitude of sins. First and
foremost is the USDollars 2bn estimate of hashish exported every year to
western Europe from the north-west Rif mountains around Tangiers and Tetuan.
Not all that money is reinvested in the local economy, but the price of real
estate and the impossibility of finding builders in Tangiers, Nador and the
Spanish enclave of Ceuta are enough to convince any observer that a lot of
money is washing around.
Money from this source must be added to that made from illegal imports
through Ceuta and the other Spanish Mediterranean enclave of Melilla, which
it partly finances. Alcohol around these ports fetches one-third of the
price it does in Casablanca. Moroccan buyers have access to all the latest
hi-fi, computers and white goods they can afford on the free market in
Casablanca - these goods are much cheaper in the north. In recent years a
thriving market in cars stolen in Europe has developed, often brought in by
Moroccan emigres in France or Belgium who have been made redundant. The
Fnideq market near Ceuta handles an estimated 40,000 such vehicles a year.
Another source of informal money is the selling of fish caught by Moroccan
vessels to foreign fishermen on the high seas, in exchange for foreign
currency. Precise figures are impossible to obtain, but observers believe
that a few hundred million dollars would not overstate the volume of that
particular trade.
Customs officials are unable to prevent the smuggling nor do their modest
salaries - Dh1,600 a month with only a further Dh0.35 per extra hour of work
 -suggest they have the incentive to try. The figure of tonnage unloaded in
several Moroccan ports is thus believed to underestimate the true weight and
value of cargo.
An estimated 450,000 informal jobs exist in manufacturing, worth at least
Dh30bn. Moroccan industrialists readily admit that a third of what they
manufacture is not declared, pointing to the fact that tax inspectors are so
harsh in their treatment that they encourage people to cheat. As in Tunisia,
tax inspectors seem to consider private entrepreneurs a bunch of thieves.
Another reason why industrialists and those in the service sector conceal
their activities is the stringent nature of the labour laws, which make it
difficult and expensive to fire employees.
The reaction of local manufacturers to illegal imports varies. General Tire,
for instance, is not best pleased to see Goodyear tyres smuggled in from the
Canary Islands. Others are less worried because their own brand products
manufactured in Spain are brought in.
One important factor in all this is that Moroccans often prefer imported
products to locally manufactured ones, even if they have to pay more because
they reckon they are getting better value for money. They are not always
wrong. As for paying added value tax, wholesalers may have to, but the many
small shops do not. In a country where two-thirds of the population is
unable to read or write, imposing VAT across the board would not be
practicable.
It is important to bear in mind that local family networks dominate much of
Morocco's activity, even in large towns such as Casablanca. Many laws
enacted by the French or the new state were quite inapplicable from the
start. Today few Moroccan industrialists who are in dispute will go to court
because the legal system is erratic, slow and often corrupt. Rather, they
will resort to one of their peers who is respected both for his sense of
fair play and knowledge of the matter which is in dispute.
The consequence of the past two years of drought are interesting in this
respect. As farmers were forced to sell their cattle to make ends meet, the
price of red meat was pushed down. But official slaughterhouses did not
change their prices, thus forcing farmers into illegal slaughtering and
selling. Butchers thus bought directly, bypassing the slaughterhouses. Such
transactions are often agreed to by the powerful Mouktassib, the corporation
which traditionally checks the honesty of transactions, the quality of
goods, notably food, and their conformity with religious edicts.
Appointed directly by provincial governors, the Mouktassib, whose powers
were reinforced by royal decree 10 years ago, appear to many Moroccans to be
more attuned to the real needs of Moroccan society than many of the
bureaucrats.
The informal sector is in many respects a safety valve for Moroccan society.
It supplies flexible jobs at a fraction of the cost of the formal sector.
Yet, one of the tests of the progress Morocco makes as it modernises its
economy will be the authorities' capacity to ensure a more open and
accountable system. That does not simply mean bringing the private sector to
heel; it also means that the authorities will behave in a fairer and more
open manner with all Moroccan citizens and companies.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (6): Foreign policy stance seems
vindicated - The important role being played by King Hassan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOROCCAN foreign policy for the past three decades has not just been
consistent, but also consistently right, according to officials in Rabat.
The recent breakthrough in relations between the Palestine Liberation
Organisation and Israel is, for them, just the latest vindication of a
Moroccan stance taken and maintained whatever the external or domestic
pressures.
Support for the western coalition against Iraq culminating in the Gulf war
is cited as the best example of King Hassan flying in the face of domestic
opinion, while the takeover of the Western Sahara from Spain in 1975 is seen
as a lesson in how to defy international pressure.
For King Hassan there has been no historical contra- diction in sending
Moroccan troops to fight against Israel while also protecting his own Jewish
population and arguing for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israel
conflict. Meetings between Egyptians and Israelis in Morocco helped to
prepare for President Anwar Sadat's critical visit to Jerusalem in January
1977, and few obstacles have been put in the way of Israelis of Moroccan
descent who wish to return to their former homeland for holidays.
But, at the same time, officials in Rabat stress that Morocco stands
four-square behind the aspirations of the Palestinian people to achieve
self-determination, is proud to be the chairman of the al-Qods (Jerusalem)
committee of the Islamic Conference Organis- ation, and is a fully committed
member of the League of Arab States.
The visit by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to Rabat in
September on his way home from his historic handshake in Washington with Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, was an ack- nowledgment of King Hassan's
peace-making role. But it went no further than that. Israel's hopes for a
visit by King Hassan to Jerusalem and the establishment of diplomatic
relations were not realised, and are unlikely to be until there is
substantially greater progress in the peace process.
'Peace is not just a piece of paper. It is not just a matter of politics.
Peace is about changing people's minds, about changing the way they look at
issues. This is what we have been trying to do, and we shall keep on
trying,' says an official, who looks forward to early progress in Israel's
talks with Syria in order to demonstrate that the peace process has become
irrev- ersible.
Less publicly, but with even greater private satisfaction, there is a
growing sense in official circles that Morocco's 15-year military and dip-
lomatic struggle to confirm its occupation of the Western Sahara is, however
grud- gingly, winning international acceptance.
Algeria's mounting domestic problems, the weakening of the nationalist
Polisario Front, the preoccupation of the UN with other more pressing
issues, and the US concern at the spread of Islamic radicalism, are
combining to present a solution that will be acceptable to Morocco.
The key lies in who would be eligible to vote in a referendum on the
territory's future: just the 74,000 people included in the 1974 Spanish
census, as favoured by Polisario, or the additional 120,000 said by Morocco
to be of Saharan parentage or origin.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, said during a visit to
the region in June that he was pressing both sides to come to an agreement.
Whatever the outcome of any compromise, or a decision to go ahead without
Polisario agreement, the Moroccans will accept only a formula which they are
confident would produce a satisfactory result.
The risk, of course, is that a frustrated Polisario, which is recognised by
some 75 countries, could return to some form of armed struggle to continue
pressing its case. Much would depend on the attitude of Algeria: there have
been recent signs of a slight improvement in relations with Morocco.
There is little indication, however, that this will translate into a more
effective Arab Maghreb Union, the organisation which brings together
Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and Maur- itania. Formed in 1989, the AMU
has agreed a number of conventions but none has been put into effect.
Moroccan officials acknowledge that the organisation's chances of
development remain modest. There was disagreement between the five partners
over the Gulf war and this was heightened when the other members decided to
follow the UN ruling on sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the
destruction of an airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland.
Morocco's main attention, however, is concentrated on its negotiations with
the European Community. Earlier dreams of an eventual bid for membership,
and before that an agreement which would permit almost free trade in
agricultural produce, have reluctantly given way to a more sober assessment
of what might be possible.
Whatever the final outcome on improved economic co- operation, EC officials
see the biggest immediate gain for Morocco as political. 'The big gain for
Morocco is not in whatever is finally negotiated. The details matter less
than the heightened political visibility that Morocco will enjoy as a result
of closer links with the EC, and the impact this could have on inward
investment, not just from EC members but also from other industrialised
countries, such as Japan', comments one official.
Negotiations are certain to be tough over sensitive issues for southern
European countries, such as the access allowed to Moroccan tomatoes, but
diplomats in Rabat sense that King Hassan's desire to attach Morocco firmly
to Europe will eventually prove decisive.

Moroccan banking is based, like much else in the country, on the French
system. Until the Moroccanisation Law of 1973, which restricted foreign
ownership, French banks dominated the sector.
Today, the French legacy is one of structure so that the bulk of the
sector's assets are in the hands of only a small number of banks. Though
there are 14 commercial banks, only three - the state-owned Banque Centrale
Populaire, Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur and the Banque Commercial
du Maroc, the largest bank in the private sector - hold 60 per cent of the
banking system's assets. This makes it hard for newcomers or the smaller
banks to compete and is reflected in the weak penetration of the market by
the seven smallest banks which hold less than 10 per cent of banking
aggregates.
The system is highly regulated by the Bank al-Maghrib, the central bank,
which still fixes the maximum lending rate. As a result of these controls,
the banks have stuck to a traditional role of lending money and taking
deposits. About half the deposits held in the commercial banking sector are
in non-interest bearing accounts, so an easy way to make money has been to
increase the branch network. Just under 30 per cent of deposits are held by
Moroccans working abroad and Banque Populaire holds about 70 per cent of
expatriate accounts.
Although the domestic banks have competed fiercely for market share, they
are sometimes unkindly known as the sleepy giants. They are now being
steered into a more competitive environment with the introduction of banking
reforms and the passage of a banking law last year. The aim is to liberalise
the banking system, which is regarded as a necessity if privatisation and
competition are to take hold, which will inevitably result in a reduction of
control exercised by the central bank.
Nearly two-thirds of the candidates for privatisation are from the banking
and financial sector with the commercial banks representing 40 per cent. The
single largest company due for privatisation is BCP, the country's largest
bank.
The monetary authorities began liberalising in 1991 by lifting credit
ceilings imposed by the central bank. Interest rates were also liberalised
to the extent that banding was introduced and banks were free to set their
interest rates within those bands.
However, the result was that the money supply increased by 20 per cent in
1991 with banks, anxious to increase their credit market share, increasing
the growth of their loans by 35 per cent compared to the previous year. By
the end of 1992, the commercial banks accounted for 60 per cent of credit
compared to 53 per cent in 1990.
The strong explosion of credit prompted the central bank to intervene and it
did so principally by raising the banks' reserve requirement to 25 per cent
on demand deposits and by increasing the overnight borrowing rate. The
measures have had the desired effect and the rate of growth of the money
supply fell back to 9 per cent in 1992 while credits rose by 11.5 per cent.
The central bank eased the reserve requirement a year ago to 10 per cent
(although banks had to place the 15 per cent balance in treasury bonds
instead) and in June, the Ministry of Finance lowered the maximum lending
rate by 1.5 percentage points to 14 per cent, to help stimulate the economy.
The banking law, which has not yet been codified, is intended to improve the
supervision of banks by creating new regulatory bodies and a guarantee
protection fund for depositors. The banking reforms are aimed at
strengthening domestic banks and bringing them up to international
standards. New capital adequacy ratios were introduced at the beginning of
the year; banks must maintain 8 per cent of their capital against
risk-adjusted assets. Banks must also make provisions against a
non-performing loan after four months by making a 100 per cent provision
against the loan unless there is a guarantee. The measure is being
introduced gradually.
The banks also operate under one of the toughest legal lending limits in the
world. The limit is 7 per cent of net capital funds to a single borrower
compared to the usual limit of 25 per cent in other countries. While the
limit used to apply to each subsidiary of a company, it is now restricted to
the company as a whole.
The reforms are not popular with most of the banks, which claim they were
imposed too suddenly. 'The provision against non-performing loans is
terrible for us,' said one banker at one of the largest banks 'because we
have to increase our capital.' However, the banks are now obliged to do
their homework before they lend money by selecting businesses which are
well-managed and by looking for profitable loans or those giving the best
guarantees. While the reforms may seem a constraint to the bankers, some
Moroccan companies have traditionally found it cheaper to finance themselves
through debt, leading to an undesirable capital structure. The new reforms
should make it cheaper for them to turn to equities for finance.
Despite the proliferation of measures, there is some anxiety that change is
not taking place as quickly as it should. In his open letter on July 14 to
Mr Muhammad Karim Lamrani, the prime minister, King Hassan urged a
reformulation of financing policy to make access to international capital
markets easier for local companies. He also called for the development of
domestic capital markets through stock market reform and an increase in the
range of financial instruments available. Companies need the infrastructure
of suitable instruments, such as capital markets to gain access to foreign
investment.
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate devoted to
private sector investment in the developing world, is planning to establish
with the CPR group, the French investment bank, a Moroccan discount house
with six Moroccan banks before the end of the year. It will give advice on
the central problem of how to create greater liquidity on the debt
securities market.
Morocco returned to the international capital markets in July through a
Dollars 30m Euroloan arranged by Citibank International for Omnium Nord
Africain, the country's largest private company.
One international banker says that while there is a lot of interest in the
stock exchange from international institutions, progress has been slow which
are highlighted by the lack of a developed capital market. 'There is not
enough synchronisation,' he said. 'While banks and corporations are allowed
access to international capital markets and can borrow money overseas, there
is, as yet, no mechanism by which foreign exchange exposure risk can be
hedged.' Morocco also lacks a money market and a secondary market for fixed
income instruments.
The Casablanca Finance Group, established with backing from Paribas and
others, says that there is a lot to do before it can establish itself as the
country's first investment bank. It needs to convince investors to turn to
the capital markets instead of banks, and also a developed brokerage system
and buoyant stock exchange. It plans to launch the country's first
open-ended mutual fund by the end of the year.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (8): Madrid investors pack flights to
Rabat - Relations with Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH interest in Morocco may be measured by the fact that business class
passengers often outnumber those travelling economy on Iberia's usually
packed daily Madrid-Rabat flight.
Mr Alvaro Renfigo, the commercial attache at the Spanish embassy in Rabat,
knows all about the extra space that the airline has had to set aside for
Morocco-bound business people. At least 1,000 Spanish executives have passed
through his overstretched department so far this year and more than 400 have
made appointments to see him.
Mr Renfigo says he faces an 'avalanche' of potential Spanish investors in
Morocco.
The Spanish press regularly reports travellers, in just as many numbers,
moving in the opposite direction and under very different conditions. Hardly
a day goes by without a news story of illegal immigrants being arrested on
arrival from Morocco aboard tiny fishing smacks. Frequently, the news is of
bodies washed up on on a southern Spanish beach in the vicinity of
Gibraltar.
The Mediterranean 'wetback' saga has all the elements of a North-South
drama, mixing exploitation and futility. The Madrid-Rabat flights, which are
not nearly so fully reported, tell a tale of intriguing dollar-laden
developments shaped by enterprise and focused on a clear future plan.
Over the past four years, direct Spanish investment in Morocco has moved
between the Dollars 40m posted in 1990 to the Dollars 100m forecast for this
year. Direct investment already topped the Dollars 100m mark in 1991,
largely due to the outlay that year by the Insituto Nacional de Industria,
Spain's public sector holding, in Morocco's Fosbucraa phosphate group and it
will be back to the Dollars 100m level this year, having slipped to Dollars
40m again in 1992, thanks in part to a recent investment by Banco Central
Hispano (BCH), Spain's largest private bank, in Banque Commerciale du Maroc.
These figures should be compared with those of the second half of the 1980s
when direct Spanish investment in Morocco was in the Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m
range. Spain's business invasion of Morocco is comparable only to the one it
is waging in Portugal.
What is most revealing is that new investment by Spain in Morocco has now
outstripped that by France. Whereas French finance entering Morocco is
mostly aimed at consolidating existing positions, Spanish capital is fresh
and acquisitive.
By Mr Renfigo's reckoning, the evidence of Spain's investment drive is to be
found in more than 500 Moroccan companies which now have Spanish partners.
Madrid's stamp on Morocco has been emphasised by the trickle-down effect of
a 1991 bilateral friendship agreement that has lured major Spanish companies
into big Moroccan civil engineering projects on the back of soft credit
lines worth Dollars 70-80m a year.
Meanwhile, it is estimated that this year Spain's quota of Morocco's foreign
trade will rise from 8 to 12 per cent while France's will fall from 23 to 21
per cent. Mr Alfonso de Pedro, the representative of the savings bank Caja
de Madrid in Casablanca, echoes a widely shared opinion among the expatriate
Spanish business community when he claims there is a specific local interest
in 'redressing the French weighting in the Moroccan economy'.
In the main, Spanish business finds itself on familiar territory in Morocco.
The present state of Morocco's development, as well as its regulatory
environment, is not unlike that of Spain in the 1950s and 1960s. There are
similarities in the bid to have foreign investment fuel a great leap
forward.
Mr de Pedro is at present building up a consultancy and venture capital
business on behalf of Caja de Madrid and in partnership with Banque
Commerciale du Maroc. He has recently given the green light to five
investment projects that deal mostly with hotel, hypermarket and office
developments and he has a further 12 under study, encompassing potential
businesses in the agriculture and textile sectors.
Spanish investment falls broadly under two groups. The first seeks a low
cost production base for goods aimed at the Spanish and the European
markets, while the second is looking for openings in the domestic Moroccan
market.
The two investment models are present in most sectors. Spanish agricultural
groups are developing strawberry plantations south of Larache which will get
the first crops of the fruit across to Northern Europe before Christmas, two
to three months ahead of the early strawberry harvests in southern Spain.
Other groups, in contrast, have imported Spanish rice transformation
technology to supply the Moroccan market with improved and competitive
products.
In the textile sector the Madrid-based Cortefiel group has begun
manufacturing in Morocco in order to supply its large retail network in
Spain. Algodoneras San Antonio, the denim material producer, one of the
prestige Spanish investments in Morocco, has however ignored the cheap
labour possibilities and established a highly automated plant which services
the local clothing industries.
The clearest indicator to date of the potential of Spanish investment in
Morocco came in July when Banco Central Hispano invested Dollars 43.3m to
raise its equity in Banque Commerciale du Maroc from 5 to 20 per cent and a
further Dollars 6.9m to acquire 2.5 per cent of ONA, the Moroccan financial
holding group that also owns 20 per cent of Banque Commerciale du Maroc.
The Spanish bank's new relationship with ONA, and its joint interest with
the financial holding in Banque Commerciale du Maroc, will allow the
strategic penetration of Morocco by the wide-ranging industrial interests
that come under Central Hispano's umbrella. Some Central Hispano companies,
such as the construction firm Dragados, are already well installed in
Morocco but others, such as those in the energy, the agribusiness and the
communications sectors will assuredly soon be booking their executives onto
the Madrid-Rabat flight.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (10): 'Upstart' airline has cause to
celebrate - Profile: Emirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT are they doing in Dubai?', a senior official at the Gulf Co-operation
Council secretariat in Riyadh asked in October 1985, shortly after Emirates
Airline had made its maiden flight to Bombay.
The question was put with more than a hint of exasperation, and the
inference was clear; that Dubai, through its upstart airline, was in some
undefined way breaking ranks within the UAE - and by extension with its GCC
partners - by injecting an unwanted element of competition among Gulf Arab
states confronted with the Iran-Iraq war.
After all, the misconception was widespread that it was the UAE as a whole,
and not just Abu Dhabi, which was one of four shareholders in Gulf Air -
then, as now, the main regional rival to Emirates. So what business did
Dubai have in starting another airline - its own - when there were enough
airlines to go around?
Last month, the 'upstart' airline celebrated its eighth anniversary by
implementing a marketing agreement with United Airlines, one of the three
biggest US carriers, in a further move to expand its international network.
This now directly spans 30 destinations in 24 countries. And far from
undermining the GCC, Dubai's airline has brought more and new business into
the region, and competitors have been forced to improve their own services
to keep up.
The marketing alliance with United, in effect a code-sharing agreement,
means that the two airlines can use each other's flight identification code
to book passengers in computer reservations systems. The logic of the
arrangement is that Emirates' network, which has focused on the Middle East,
the Indian sub-continent and Asia, can now dovetail with United's
transatlantic and US domestic routes.
To link with United, Emirates now has two daily flights to London's
Heathrow, which replace a previous service to Gatwick.
Emirates has never received subsidies from the Dubai government, which
continues to insist on an open-skies policy and looks with equal favour on
the 61 airlines which now fly into the emirate. The government does not
regulate fares.
Emirates' start-up capital was used to buy two second-hand Boeing 727s from
Dubai's Air Wing. Emirates shares head office premises with Dubai National
Air Travel Agency to which it pays a cross-charge for rental. 'That is all
Emirates ever received in government investments or grants,' according to Mr
Dermot Mannion, the airline's corporate treasurer. And Emirates gets no
guarantees from the government when negotiating bank financing for new
aircraft leases or acquisitions.
In the western context of the distinction between the private sector and the
public-state sector, Emirates is an anomaly, for it is simultaneously in
both of these. In common with all seven emirates forming the UAE, as well as
with other member countries of the GCC, the Dubai government is 'private',
consisting of the ruling family and, lower down, its nominees and officials.
In this sense Dubai Inc is a private company. At the same time it is very
much the State.
The airline is thus the private sector commercial extension of the
government and its campaign to promote the emirate of Dubai, as part of the
UAE, as the predominant regional business centre and transit point between
Europe and Asia. Not for nothing is the airline's chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Bin
Said Al Maktoum, a member of the ruling family, also chairman of Dubai's
Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, an autonomous government agency, as
well as president of Dubai's Department of Civil Aviation.
But to finance the leasing of its fleet of 13 aircraft, the airline has had
to rely on its own resources and return on capital. The fleet consists of
eight Airbus A310-300s, and five A300-600Rs. The average age of aircraft in
the fleet, including the two original 727s, is less than 3 1/2 years.
The airline releases figures on a selective basis only to institutions
involved in loan negotiations. But according to the journal Airline Business
last April, Emirates, based on fleet size, a 1992 kilometre total of 5.52bn
and a load factor of nearly 70 per cent, had 1992 revenues of between
Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m.
The airline has been profitable for six out of its seven full financial
years, according to Mr Mannion. In the period April 1992 - April 1993
capacity increased 54 per cent and six new routes were added.
All of its fleet of 13 Airbuses have been financed by commercial bank
borrowings, including the first-ever Islamic lease - for one Airbus -
arranged by Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation. To
do this, Al Rajhi set up a special purpose company which owns the aircraft
until the expiry of the lease, at which time Emirates has an option to buy
the aircraft. Western commercial bank arrangements also allow for the banks
to own the aircraft until the revenue is generated which pays off the loan
plus the interest.
There is, says Mr Mannion, a pool of liquidity available in Islamic banks.
The only hurdle has been regional investors' reluctance to commit liquidity
for as long as 10-15 years instead of the five to seven years they prefer.
Al Rajhi is one of the institutions Emirates is approaching to finance the
purchase of seven Boeing 777s which are on order and due for delivery
starting in March 1996. The airline also has an option on a further seven
777s. Discussions have already started with Eximbank over airframe financing
and with Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department over a Dollars 400m
contract which Emirates signed last July for 35 Rolls-Royce Trent engines.
After the heady expansion of its fleet and new routes since the beginning of
last year, the airline could be looking for a period to build up its cash
reserves in advance of the delivery of the 777s, and to continue to
streamline some of its existing routes.
For example, Rome, a recent addition as a stop-over point to Zurich, is now
a stand-alone destination, drawing both tourists and businessmen to Dubai.
On existing routes, flights to Hong Kong and Singapore now leave daily,
while the frequency to Manchester has been increased.
Emirates generates 40 per cent of total traffic movement through Dubai's
international airport. Renovation and modernisation plans have been on the
books since 1988 when Bechtel prepared the first studies. The Dubai
government is considering, but has not yet decided, on the scale of the
proposed redevelopment.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (9): Focus on 'quality' sectors - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARELY 10 days after the departure of thousands of businessmen expected at
Dubai's International Aerospace Exhibition next week, thousands of a
different kind of visitor are scheduled to pour into Dubai from India,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to hear pop star Michael
Jackson at a sell-out concert in a local soccer stadium.
Such is the magnetic pull of Dubai and its government-sponsored promotional
organisations - notably the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, the
Dubai National Air Travel Agency, and the travel management division of
Emirates, Dubai's airline.
Attendances at both exhibition and concert are almost certain to be inflated
thanks to the timely decision last month by the Dubai government to open the
emirate for short visits to white-collar residents of all Gulf Co-operation
Council countries regardless of nationality. Previously only citizens of GCC
countries - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia - had been
allowed into Dubai without a visit or transit visa provided by a Dubai-based
sponsor.
Dubai's success in selling itself as a tourist and conference-exhibition
centre is reflected in the aggregate figures for local hotel occupancies.
These show the total number of visitors - business and tourist - increasing
by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1992, despite the temporary but dramatic
fall-off caused by the Gulf war.
The majority of these visitors are staying in deluxe or first-class hotels,
but the biggest proportional increase in the same period - more than 250 per
cent - have been visitors at the lower-income end of the market.
Dubai's Promotion Board now maintains offices in seven countries for North
America, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan. An example of its success is that
Dubai now features on the books of 38 German tour operators alone. The
general manager of Frankfurt-based Airtours said in September there had been
a steady increase in the German demand for holidays to the Emirates. But the
reasons he gave - 'very high standards of quality, service, and security,' -
apply to all the countries where Dubai has made a visible impact on both the
summer and winter tourist markets. And because Dubai is a cosmopolitan city,
language is not a problem for any visitor, regardless of nationality.
Russians and citizens of other former Soviet republics are a fairly recent
addition to Dubai's tourist market. They descend by the planeload on Dubai
and neighbouring emirates, not wearing uniforms, but selling them - along
with medals, Russian dolls and other paraphernalia. Dubai's traders welcome
them. They barter the Russian goods for television sets, radios and all
kinds of consumer durables.
Those who have seen the Russians' departure say there is not a square inch
of aircraft aisle or emergency exit which is not packed to the ceiling with
man and metal for the home market.
Many of Dubai's existing five-star hotels are expanding. The luxury Jebel
Ali hotel could be adding 100 rooms to its present 275; and the Hatta Fort
hotel, an oasis in Dubai's desert and mountain hinterland, has doubled
capacity and added a conference facility. J. P. Marriott opened a five-star
hotel last September and a new Forte Grand opens next April. The luxury
hotel construction spree is probably not over yet.
The chief executive of Dubai's Promotion Board, Mr Khalid Bin Sulayem, says
his organisation's efforts are moving towards 'quality' tourism and
incentive travel visitors. It was the Promotion Board which intitiated the
new entry freedoms for GCC residents, an initiative which has already been
endorsed by GCC regional chambers of commerce.
But the icing on the cake for Dubai's leisure market must surely be the
three all-grass golf courses, and their related facilities. Emirates Golf
Club, opened in 1988, is the home to the PGA Desert Classic. Dubai Creek
Golf &amp; Yacht Club, completed only last November, has a flood-lit three-hole
course and driving range in addition to its 18-hole course. The newest of
all, Dubai Golf &amp; Racing Club at Nad Al Shiba on the desert outskirts of
Dubai city, has a nine-hole flood-lit course next to the racetrack and
paddock.
Dubai Racing Club, which owns and manages the race course will have its
first full season this winter. It is internationally recognised, which means
pedigrees of owners appear in catalogues everywhere and jockeys registered
in Dubai can race anywhere.
Thoroughbreds trained in Dubai are now entering - and being placed - in
races in Europe. And Dubai Racing Club's facilities for club members and
sponsors, including hospitality boxes, make facilities at Europe's
traditional race courses seem very inadequate by comparison.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (4): Quiet revolution is under way in
farming - Now the country must co-ordinate its agricultural reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN years ago, 57 per cent of Morocco's population lived and worked on the
land. That percentage has declined to 50 per cent and is set to continue its
downward trend.
However, fewer than half of all the jobs in Morocco are on the land, as
between one fifth and one quarter of all farmers are seriously
under-employed. Overall, this sector contributes nearly 20 per cent of gross
domestic product, yet the average income of those who till the land amounts
to half that obtained in the towns.
Imports of foodstuffs account for 12 per cent of Morocco's trade deficit
which in 1990-92 averaged Dh3bn a year. Yet exports of farm produce average
17 per cent of total exports and are growing, though in erratic fashion
because very contrasted climatic conditions (the country has suffered badly
from drought since 1991) makes the sector's contribution to national wealth
volatile.
Many difficult problems confront the Moroccan countryside. It remains
under-equipped in many ways. Few small farmers have electricity, let alone
running water, and little has been done to improve communications with
outlying areas. The land remains extremely fragmented, with the average
farms no more than 4.8 hectares, the average age of farmers is over 50 and
between two-thirds and three-quarters of the population remains illiterate.
Yet despite these difficulties, a quiet revolution is under way. Much of the
credit for these changes rest with Mr Othman Demnati, who left the
government earlier this year after a decade during which his reputation was
steadily enhanced, an unusual outcome for someone occupying a ministerial
portfolio in Morocco for so long.
A private landowner himself and a man of common sense and determination, Mr
Demnati set about changing a policy which, in the 25 years after
independence in 1957 had seen fit to make the farming sector pay for the
development of industry. Luckily, such a policy was not pursued, as in many
other Arab or African countries, with the kind of ideological drive
displayed in neighbouring Algeria.
Furthermore, the monarch had no intention of impoverishing the countryside,
from which he still draws considerable support. Throughout his reign, King
Hassan has insisted that investment in water was essential.
It is thanks to this policy that 10 per cent of all usable land is
irrigated. Production from such land today accounts for 45 per cent of the
added value of farm production and 90 per cent of the value of exports.
In 1984, after three years of very severe drought, King Hassan decreed that
farming would be exempt from taxes until the year 2000. Though it
discriminated between rich and poor farmers, the decree was more than
justified because the old agricultural tax yielded less than it cost to
levy. A 50 per cent devaluation of the dirham over 10 years has provided a
strong boost.
The results are remarkable. The diversity of Moroccan production has grown.
Potatoes, courgettes, winter melons, strawberries, artichokes grown from
seed, peas, chilli peppers, mange-tout and cut flowers have been added to
the traditional list of tomatoes and citrus.
Even more remarkably, half of all exports now go to markets outside the
European Community, notably to Canada and Scandinavia. Within the EC,
Moroccan exporters have targeted the UK and Germany, markets where they were
hardly present a decade ago, successfully. They are now taking their produce
directly into Portsmouth through Geest, a large UK shipping, distribution
and packaging company and into Bremen in north Germany. They are selling to
eastern Europe, in exchange for hard cash.
Where exports have not been diversified, difficulties remain. Sixty-five per
cent of all tomatoes are exported to France, where they risk being destroyed
by irate French farmers. Spain and France are in direct competition with
Morocco but the EC has proved, overall, a good market for those producers in
Morocco who innovate and upgrade quality - in other words, are really
professional.
Around Agadir on the Atlantic coast of southern Morocco, the carefully
cultivated plain which boasts 300 days of sunshine a year looks from the air
like parts of California. The Soussi berbers are proof that some Moroccans
are more than able to hold their own in the modern world.
Joint ventures with foreign partners, many of whom are actively relocating
production, helps to explain this success. Near Agadir, one Swiss investor
has built 400 greenhouses at a cost of between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m
since 1990. The Spanish seem to be everywhere, in Larache near Tangiers in
the north and around Agadir.
British and French investors are present. In the vast irrigated Haouz
project around Marrakesh, which boasts a computer-controlled water
distribution system worthy of the best in the west. The Italians, the French
and the Dutch are, growing roses on 120 hectares of land in joint ventures
with Moroccans. Seventy per cent of the production is exported to Holland,
Canada and the US.
Not only is production increasing and getting very diversified, but more
added value is being put onto products in Morocco. French bulk importers of
Moroccan potatoes are now happy to treat and repackage Moroccan potatoes in
winter months because their profit margins are under pressure owing to the
recession.
This winter Morocco will start treating and packaging some of its own
potatoes before exporting them. Chilli peppers produced around Larache are
being turned into paprika before being exported.
Other factors have contributed to this revolution. One is that by
introducing Israeli seeds to Morocco a few years ago, the authorities have
in effect broken what was a virtual Dutch monopoly. Israeli irrigation
techniques, often trading under Spanish convenience names, are also openly
pointed to in Marrakesh and around Agadir. In the Haouz project, farms of
different sizes are integrated into the water distribution pattern, less
well-off farmers working side by side with wealthier ones. Some can afford
more sophisticated irrigation and fertilising methods than their neighbours,
but the result appears to encourage change rather than envy.
On all these fronts, King Hassan's domaines royaux are said to offer models
of what modern farming should be, but are virtually closed to outsiders.
Observers agree that the economic reforms which the rescheduling of the
country's debt forced on Morocco after 1983 have been the key to the current
changes. Indeed, the abolition of the state export monopoly of fruit and
vegetables and its replacement by private groups such as Atlas Fruit Board,
which handles exports from the king's domains, have made all the difference.
Another debate is now opening up which centres on why Morocco should be
self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs such as sugar. Two-thirds of the
sugar that Morocco consumes comes from the central Doukkala, Tadla and Gharb
regions. But small local farmers are increasingly protesting against the
local water boards that impose a pattern of water distribution, which is
only of use to those who grow sugar beet. So great is their obduracy that
some farmers have taken to sinking small wells and storing the water, thus
escaping the tyranny of the water boards.
Sugar beet is very labour-intensive and thus its cultivation reduces
unemployment. Against that rather political logic, a new logic is
increasingly rearing its head, that is the logic of the market and a real
appreciation of the costs of production. And water is a key here as Morocco
must manage its water resources with greater care. Needs are huge, while
resources are increasingly expensive to mobilise, but years of drought will
force, every few years, some water resources to be used for cereals rather
than fruit and vegetable crops.
Mr Demnati is believed to have left his post because he could not get the
government to agree to co-ordinate the different aspects of rural
development - bringing electricity, schools, roads and running water to what
remains a physically and tribally very fragmented countryside. He appears,
most notably, to have run into difficulties with the powerful ministry of
the interior.
Here, as in other sectors, the challenge Morocco faces in the next few years
is to co-ordinate reforms which to date have often been conducted sector by
sector and avoid what a recent strategic study on 'Rural Development' from
the Ministry of Agriculture describes as 'confrontation' between different
ministries and economic interests. Such a change would hold the key to
further rationalising and developing the farming wealth of Morocco.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (5): How to tempt the tourist - Hotels are
doing better, but the industry still has problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
TOURISTS ARE back in force and hotel managers are smiling again. The Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait three years ago was catastrophic for the tourist sector,
which remains Morocco's second largest hard currency earner, after
remittances from Moroccan workers living in western Europe. Last year's net
receipts from tourism, Dh11.7bn, were one third up on 1991 and this year is
expected to be even better.
France remains the leading source of visitors with more than 2m, followed by
Germany with 1.7m visitors, and then Spain and Italy. The recovery in
tourist numbers, notably in Marrakesh, has been helped by the war in former
Yugoslavia and attacks on tourists in Egypt and, more recently, Turkey.
Casablanca has also seen a larger flow of visitors, both tourists and
businessmen.
However, the gains may not be as great as they seem. Not only are European
tourists spending little outside their hotels, but the price of many tours
and hotel rooms for businessmen can easily be booked at discounts of 30 to
50 per cent.
In 1890, Lord Salisbury dismissed Morocco as an 'enormous amount of sand'
which he was happy to let the 'Gallic cockerel' have. That remark is very
unfair to the sheer beauty and variety of the lands ruled by the oldest
monarchy in the Arab world.
For those who seek sun and sea, good beaches abound along the Mediterranean
and Atlantic coasts. Around Agadir, one may enjoy 300 days of sunshine a
year. For those with more cultural pursuits, the old imperial cities of Fez
and Marrakesh offer the easiest exposure to the 'mysterious Orient'. For the
rapidly growing adventure holiday sector, walking and skiing in the High
Atlas mountains and motoring to the spectacular Saharan valleys around
Erfoud and Zagora offer endless scope.
Morocco has been spared the vandalising of its coastline so characteristic
of parts of Greece and Spain, yet its lack of visitors remains a puzzle. Why
does the country do no better than Tunisia, its small eastern neighbour,
whose scenery and traditions, however pleasant, are no match for its own?
Why does Morocco attract less than a fifth of those who visit the Canary
Islands? The two main reasons are not too hard to find.
First of all, foreign visitors are liable to harassment by flocks of teenage
touts and 'guides' almost wherever they go. Secondly, there is often no
obvious connection between the number of stars that a hotel boasts and the
quality of service that the tourist should expect.
1. More discerning visitors are also disappointed by the absence of any
serious policy to restore old buildings and cities and the lack of any
cultural activities, except for the most jaded of folk dances, which are
often a source of embarrassment rather than entertainment.
The authorities have often promised to crack down on unofficial guides and
beggars and on unscrupulous taxi drivers, whose endless expectation of yet
another tip helps to explain why, for so many European visitors, their first
visit to Morocco is their last. Begging has begun to be discussed more
openly in the media, notably on television. Nevertheless, in Marrakesh the
situation is so bad that many Moroccan nationals refuse to visit the city.
Repression alone will not provide an answer as the intricate network of
protection and corruption, built up over the years and taking in shopowners,
young Moroccan guides and the local police, makes the problem a complex one
to unscramble. Income disparities in Morocco remain great and the European
visitor is inevitably cast as the rich man, particularly in towns such as
Marrakesh and Fez, where one fifth of the population remains unemployed. In
Marrakesh one half of the population is believed to derive its living,
directly or indirectly, from tourism. The last two years of drought have
compounded difficulties as more people than usual flock from the countryside
to the cities, desperately seeking some means of earning a living.
Many Moroccans suspect that the aggressive attitudes shown to foreign
visitors are not susceptible of an easy cure. Morocco is paying for its high
income disparities and poor education system, which leaves two-thirds of the
population illiterate. The comparison with Tunisia is instructive - there
harassment is simply not a problem.
2. The second reason is equally complex. Morocco has always prided itself on
being an upmarket destination. Yet despite the 'beautiful' people who travel
to Marrakesh, most European visitors travel on package tours, like millions
of others around the Mediterranean. Yet they are often billeted in four- or
five-star hotels, which provide only what has been paid for, not that
demanded by high-class establishments.
The authorities have tried to downgrade certain hotels, but nonetheless the
visitor must be prepared for surprises. Some three-star hotels are
excellent, but many five-star hotels are not worth the money.
It is damaging to the country's reputation among tourists when hotels such
as the Hotel Palais Jamai, which dominates Fez and is meant for the
seriously rich, provide indifferent service or when the Tour Hassan Hotel,
the second best in the capital, Rabat, charges prices way above the service
it offers. Its five-star de luxe status is viewed, in Rabat, as a bit of a
joke.
The Tour Hassan is privately managed which shows that a privately-run hotel
can be as badly run as a public sector one. In general, Morocco's hotels are
burdened with a surfeit of stars; the older hotels suffer from lack of
upkeep and many establishments have a gung-ho attitude towards their
customers.
However, there are enough well-managed hotels to suggest that Moroccans are
capable of maintaining high standards. The Royal Mansour in Casablanca,
which is managed by Forte, and the Minzah in Tangiers, perhaps the most
attractive hotel in Morocco, are two prime examples. Further down the scale,
the Idou Anfa and Kandara hotels in Casablanca offer good service at a
reasonable price.
More recently, a new chain called Moussafir started to open hotels that
operated on a new formula. All are built at railway terminals and though
boasting only three stars they are competitively priced, decorated in a
simple style and provide good service. They enjoy a 75 per cent occupancy
rate. Eleven more are due to open in the next few years.
The Moussafir chain is the brainchild of the largest private group in
Morocco, ONA, which owns the hotels jointly with the Banque Commerciale du
Maroc and the Moroccan state railway company ONCF. Unlike many hotels in
Morocco, these hotels are staffed by professionally trained personnel.
ONA is also launching three large 'integrated' tourist projects in Cabo
Negro, near Tetouan, in the north, Casablanca and Marrakesh. All will have
golf courses and with luck will provide an example to others.
The difficulty of imposing modern standards of management in many hotels
stems from the fact that many private entrepreneurs who have made money in
one sector like to invest their savings in bricks and mortar. They often run
their hotels themselves, and do not allow the professionally trained
managers they appoint any real say in decisions. They do not see fit to
reinvest profits in the business and thus standards deteriorate over time.
Too many hotels are built for essentially speculative reasons.
Another, historical, reason explains this lack of progress. Until the Treaty
of Fez established the French and Spanish protectorates in 1912, Morocco was
as closed and unknown to foreigners as Tibet. The country had been an
independent kingdom since the arrival of Moulay Idriss, a grandson of the
prophet Muhammed in the 8th century AD. This independence had been fiercely
guarded until the the beginning of this century.
Being cut off from the outside world did, however, offer the great advantage
of preserving, far more than elsewhere in North Africa, old traditions. The
other side of the coin is that until recently, Morocco has not been as
successful at marketing itself abroad as it should have been.
Nor has the number of just over 84,000 beds increased: the figure is what it
was six years ago. However, some Moroccan observers argue that the tourist
industry's main task should be to raise its standards and to contain
harassment.
That means more professional staff and a willingness on the part of the
authorities to act rather than talk. Recent measures by Mr Hassan Abouyoub,
minister of tourism, suggest he is fully aware of what is needed. If the
problems which confront the sector are tackled with determination, the
pickings, in terms of foreign income and new jobs - not to mention a kinder
perception of Morocco abroad - will be rich indeed.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (8): Alternative sources needed - Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL but 2 per cent of Dubai's energy requirements are met by gas. But for
the government, with its strategy of creating a long-term self-sustaining
economy based on the tripod of traditional imports and re-exports, tourism,
and further development of Dubai as a regional services and light industries
centre, there can never be enough energy. Nor is it satisfactory for Dubai
to be dependent on only one or two sources of supply.
Some gas reaches Dubai's generators from the four off-shore oilfields which
provide the bulk of Dubai's oil and gas revenues - Fateh, South West Fateh,
Falah and Rashid. Output from the first two has averaged some 200,000
barrels a day and 190,000 b/d respectively. Output from the last two is some
10,000 b/d each. The concession holder is Dubai Petroleum Company (DPC)
consisting of the US's Conoco, the operator, France's Total, the Spanish
company Repsol, and two German companies: RWE, Germany's sixth-largest
industrial group and its biggest electricity generator, and gas company
Wintershall.
Conoco-DPC lifts and markets the crude; Dubai sets the price. It also
markets four or five cargoes a month, each containing some  1/2 m barrels,
so that when traded the government knows what price DPC should also be
getting. Dubai treats crude oil as just another commodity, with the sole
purpose being to maximise value. The approximate published price for
mid-October was Dollars 15.23 a barrel. Dubai gets its revenue from taxes
and royalties levied on DPC.
Since last April, a pilot scheme has operated to inject 100m cu ft a day of
gas to enhance recovery. Signs are that the scheme is proving positive and
that recoverable crude reserves are greater than originally foreseen. The
reinjection scheme is due to run until 2038.
Associated gas is also piped to Dubai Natural Gas Company's processing plant
at Jebel Ali. Most of the liquids - butane, propane, and condensate - are
separated and shipped to Japanese buyers. Some of the liquid gas goes to
Dubai's own products company, Emirates Petroleum Products Company, which
operates its own petrol stations.
A Dollars 2bn refinery with a capacity of 250,000 b/d - almost all of which
would be for export - at Jebel Ali is still being considered. Potential
markets are in India, east Asia and the east coast of Africa. Such a
refinery would also enable Dubai to be self-sufficient in petroleum products
 -or at least less dependent on Abu Dhabi - even allowing for the
anticipated surge in demand. Some of the dry gas - about 130m cu ft a day -
is used by Dugas itself; some goes to power generators at Dubai's aluminium
smelter and to Dubai city.
The onshore gas and condensate field operated at Margham by Atlantic
Richfield produces some 35,000 b/d of condensate and can produce 400m cu ft
a day of gas. This is all reinjected to maintain reservoir pressure except
when, in high summer, Dubai itself needs extra gas supplies for generators.
In this case up to 150m cu ft a day is available.
Most of Dubai's energy requirements are met by the neighbouring emirate of
Sharjah where the Sajaa gas and condensate field is operated by Amoco. Under
an agreement signed in May 1985, Dubai receives 140m-250m cu ft a day
depending on seasonal demand in Dubai. For this it is thought to have paid
something less than Dollars 1.25 per million cubic feet. Amoco has recently
found more gas and condensate. Other, smaller, gas supplies reach Dubai from
Sharjah's offshore Mubarak field.
Dubai's energy needs last summer averaged 315m cu ft a day, with the annual
average being about 230m cu ft a day. But energy demand is rising almost 20
per cent a year and one estimate puts Dubai's summer consumption in the next
few years at 500m cu ft a day if present growth rates are maintained.
For the time being, this demand can be met from existing sources, but the
narrow spread of suppliers is causing concern. Added to which, gas from
Sajaa and Margham may not last more than 10-15 years.
Dubai has to find other sources of energy. Sporadic talks have been held for
some time with Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Iran, but no agreements have yet been
reached.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (7): New curbs concern foreign banks -
Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT took just one well-intentioned directive from the UAE central bank to
change the complexion of future business opportunities for Dubai's foreign
banking community.
Until October 16, there seemed no reason why loan assets, deposits and
profits should not have increased over the next 15 months more or less as
they had since the beginning of last year - for foreign banks as well as for
the five locally-incorporated banks which originate and do most of their
business in Dubai.
But the five local banks - in common with the stronger local banks
throughout the Emirates - are not affected by the central bank directive in
anything like the same degree as their foreign counterparts.
The bombshell for foreign banks came with the announcement of new rules
setting a limit on loans to single borrowers or group of related borrowers
at 7 per cent of a bank's capital base. A key clause of the central bank's
directive identified a bank's capital base as the same as that used for
capital adequacy purposes based on the 1988 ruling of the Basel committee of
the Bank for International Settlements. This stipulated that banks worldwide
had to have an adequacy of 8 per cent capital relative to risk assets, to
ensure they had enough capital to cope with a crisis.
The calculation of total advances to customers is graded according to the
type of advance - a straightforward loan counts as a 100 per cent advance
while a letter of credit counts for less. The UAE and other Gulf states
except Saudi Arabia were listed as high risk country borrowers. And even
though the UAE is claiming average capital adequacy among its banks of 10
per cent - 2 per cent higher than that required by the Basel Committee - it
is not, yet, accepted by the Basel committee on a par with Saudi Arabia or
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
The latest UAE central bank restrictions follows a long list of regulations
issued since 1985 when UAE banks paid the price for some poor-quality loan
assets, and were either forcibly merged by emirate government decree or
bailed out with an injection of fresh capital.
In Dubai - as in Abu Dhabi - the combination of forced mergers and new
capital enabled new management, with support from the emirate government, to
start clawing back bad debts. Mr Sultan Al-Suweidi, the UAE central bank
governor, probably has more experience of this kind of exercise than all the
other UAE bank managing directors. Starting in 1982 with Abu Dhabi
Investment Company, Mr Al-Suweidi went on to manage the Bahrain-based Gulf
International Bank which had burned its fingers in Saudi Arabia; and finally
to Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank which inherited the problems left over from the
three banks from which it was created. Even without the BCCI fiasco, it
would be understandable, as foreign bankers in Dubai are the first to
acknowledge, if Mr Al-Suweidi has a bee in his bonnet about the quality of
loan assets.
Ironically for Dubai, a city-state which prides itself on its laissez-faire
approach, there now remains only one commercial bank out of five
Dubai-registered banks which has no government shareholding. This is the
Bank of Oman (renamed MashreqBank on October 1 for reasons of internal
strategy.
All the others - the National Bank of Dubai, Emirates Bank International
(EBI), Middle East Bank (MEB), and Commercial Bank of Dubai - are either
owned outright by the government or majority-owned by it. EBI is 80 per cent
government-owned, and EBI in turn owns 98 per cent of Middle East Bank.
None of these banks will have any serious problem with the central bank
circular. Mr Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, MashreqBank's chief executive officer,
pointed out his bank's capital adequacy was 17 per cent. After two years of
planned restructuring leading up to the change in name, its 1992 return on
assets was 2.1 per cent and 21 per cent on shareholders funds. Its liquidity
ratio was also high at 41 per cent. Profits last year exceeded Dh200m, up
more than 40 per cent from 1991. Eighty per cent of these derived from its
home base, Dubai; the balance from its branches overseas in New York,
London, Hong Kong and four other countries.
EBI is itself the result of government intervention in three former local
banks which were bailed out between 1983 and 1985. The bank, applying
lessons learned from the past, has its own internal credit restrictions
which, according to Mr Anis Al Jallaf, managing director and chief executive
officer, confine lending to below central bank limits. However, with
shareholders' funds of Dh1.17bn, the 7 per cent limit would still amount to
Dh80m.
Mr Al Jallaf is somewhat sympathetic to the position foreign banks now find
themselves in. He says: 'UAE national banks abroad can lend according to the
capital base of their group and work according to a country limit.' He and
others interpret the central bank's directive as a warning shot across the
bows of smaller, less viable banks to find more capital and merge.
The dilemma for foreign banks is all the more acute in that much of their
sizeable exposure is to contractors and traders dealing on a large scale.
They require cash facilities, guarantees and letters of credit which can
amount to one third or more of the value of a contract. If the credit
limitation is not modified, they would have to go to a syndicate of banks
rather than to one alone - much more expensive and time-consuming.
One foreign banker's reaction to the central bank circular was blunt: 'If
the central bank wants to get rid of foreign banks, it is going about it the
right way.' Business prospects are favourable enough, however, and foreign
banks are likely to stay even if between now and January 1, when the
directive starts coming into force, they do everything they can to get the
central bank to amend its directive.
Most of the 13 larger foreign banks have branches or are based in Dubai.
Their combined balance sheets for 1992 showed net profits soaring by some 32
per cent over 1991 to almost Dh300m. Loans and deposits were up 11.5 per
cent and 12 per cent respectively.
British Bank of the Middle East reported profits up 17 per cent compared
with 1991; Standard Chartered up 26 per cent; Citibank almost double the
profits of the previous year. Official figures show that loans by foreign
banks accounted for more than half their assets; those by local banks at 40
per cent.
If the central bank would accept that foreign banks could use their head
office or parent's global capital base as a yardstick, that, said one
foreign banker, would solve their immediate problem. Another possible
solution is for the bank's head office to increase capital funds allocated
to the UAE central bank as an interest-free deposit. If neither of these two
is acceptable to the central bank then one banker suggested larger loans
would go onto the books of off-shore banks, away from UAE rules.
The deadline for reporting large exposure is March 31 next year, but
extensions can be granted until the end of 1995. If the UAE economy in
general, and Dubai's in particular, remain buoyant, it is more than likely
that foreign banks will stay for a slice of the business.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (3): Investors may be attracted as target
looks set to be beaten - The country's privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY international banks and investment funds, the acquisition by a
French subsidiary of the Swiss Holderbank group of a 51 per cent stake in
the CIOR state cement company last July marked a watershed in Morocco's
ambitious privatisation programme.
Privatisation this year has so far brought USDollars 250m worth of foreign
investment into the country. By the end of the year, the authorities are
confident that they will have overshot their initial target by 40 per cent.
Last year, external financing in the form of direct investment covered the
whole of the Dollars 500m current account deficit, whereas foreign
investment financed only 50 per cent and 23 per cent of the deficit
respectively in 1992 and 1991.
The privatisation programme is on target and, if successfully pursued - 112
companies worth an estimated Dollars 2bn are expected to be privatised by
the end of 1995 - will play a key role in furthering the liberalisation of
the Moroccan economy, modernising the country's industrial sector and
strengthening the country's balance of trade. Its success so far is a
tribute to Mr Moulay Zine Zahidi, the minister of industry, and Mr Hassan
Amrani, his very energetic director of privatisation. The full backing of
King Hassan, an essential precondition for any successful venture in
Morocco, is assured.
Citibank, which recently signed the first international commercial loan in
10 years for a Moroccan company - USDollars 30m for the private ONA Group -
pointed out in a recent analysis of the Moroccan economy that it felt
'comfortable with the country's low level of commercial debt (19 per cent of
total external debt), relatively high level of foreign reserves and the
Moroccan administration's stated goals to pursue market orientated policies
and to re-establish normal relationships with external creditors.' The loan
for ONA comes 10 years after Morocco was forced to reschedule its foreign
debt.
A price tag of Dh1.2bn was put on CIOR whose sale dwarfed the privatisation
of CTM, an international bus company which was valued at Dh320m and
successfully privatised last June. Ten per cent of the shares were sold to
the regional authorities in Oujda and Fez in north-eastern Morocco where the
company's two plants are located. A further 30,000 shares were earmarked for
employees. Some 40 per cent of CTM shares were issued on the stock exchange
last June and the offer was oversubscribed.
The shares are currently trading at a 34 per cent premium to issue price.
The most interesting feature of that sale was the keen interest shown by
Moroccans living abroad who picked up one-third of the shares on offer. This
interest underlines the importance of the Dollars 2bn that Moroccan
immigrants remit home every year and which could prove a significant source
of capital for the privatisation programme.
The bourse has, since its creation by the former French colonial ruler,
played a very limited role in the economic life of the country. Apart from
an odd flurry of activity in French times, the bourse has been effectively
moribund by international standards for all its 65 years.
Moroccan savers traditionally invest in real estate or put their money on
deposit. Businessmen go to their banks or tap private sources of finance,
usually within the extended network of family companies and banks. Recently,
treasury bills with a yield of 13 per cent tax free have been a magnet for
individual investment.
The lethargy of the bourse today does not, however, reflect a lack of demand
but rather a combination of chronic shortage of supply, high cost of
transaction and inadequate disclosure of company accounts. The privatisation
process is thus expected to provide an impetus to the bourse and an opening
to foreign institutional investors, for two reasons. One is that it will
result in a large increase in liquidity. The second is that the Moroccan
government has learnt from other countries' experience and knows that
selling off a string of companies to multinational corporations may be the
easy way out but it is a method which is both short-sighted and fraught with
political risks.
To ensure a privatisation programme is acceptable politically, shares in
major companies must be widely distributed and a diversified body of
domestic shareholders created. As a report by Blakeney Management, the
investment adviser, notes: 'Neither of these goals can be achieved without
an efficient and liquid bourse as a medium of exchange.'
Today, there are still only 69 stocks listed on the bourse. Many of these
never trade. Many stocks go for weeks without trading and the last price may
not reflect current market conditions. Twenty institutional investors,
essentially banks and insurance companies constitute a comfortable and
rather cosy club.
Three factors however are conspiring to bring changes. First of all the law
passed last July on capital markets and mutual funds which will reduce
transaction costs and encourage greater demand as the wealthier middle class
bank depositors switch some of their funds. The second is the new-found
interest in acquiring some Moroccan shares shown by institutional investors
such as the US money management fund Templeton. Salomon Brothers and the ONA
Group are setting up a Dollars 200m private equity fund. Barings has
recently underwriting 400,000 ONA shares for its institutional clients.
Privatisation is encouraging the emergence of investment funds such as
Casablanca Finance, which is backed Banque Commerciale du Maroc. The
country's leading private bank, its aim is to develop corporate and
investment banking. Maroc Privatisation is backed by the Mutuelles du Mans
insurance group and the Societe Marseillaise de Credit. Two much larger
funds are the Dollars 24m Interfina fund, jointly owned by three Moroccan
banks, the International Finance Corporation Spain's Banco Exterior, Credit
Lyonnais Investissement and Proparco, the French equivalent of IFC. IFC,
together with Siparex, a Lyon based venture capital group and the Moroccan
commercial Wafa Bank, is in the process of setting up a Dollars 40m venture
capital fund to help bring equity capital to medium-sized Moroccan
companies.
Other interesting developments include the setting up by three young
Moroccans of the Upline group, which aims to provide foreigners interested
in Morocco with risk assessment studies and investment advisory services.

Owned by a small group of private investors, it sells 17,000 to 20,000
copies every week. Its senior editorial and management staff hold 44 per
cent of the capital and its publication marks a break with the traditional
type of Moroccan newspaper, which is highly politicised and usually
sensational in style in a country where the hand of the censor remains
heavy.
A further development should help boost Casablanca as a city of
international trade and finance. The ONA Group is soon to start building a
world trade centre whose facilities, it is hoped, will bring many Moroccan
companies into closer touch with what is going on abroad. The two towers,
whose architects are Ricardo Bofill and Elie Mouyal, should help embellish
the sky line of a city which over the years has grown in rather disorderly
fashion.
For the privatisation process to run smoothly and the opening of the
Moroccan economy to be confirmed, one factor is still missing: transparency
in business. As a recent World Bank summary on 'Developing Private Industry
in Morocco' underlines, a weak judicial process which is slow, opaque and
unpredictable in enforcing rules and resolving disputes is, in the view of
foreign companies 'an important obstacle to investment.'

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (2): Debt is under control but change is
still needed - Economic problems and achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
IN THE expanding high rise buildings of Casablanca, Morocco's industrial and
banking base, the whiff of dynamism and of an economy at work is strong. And
it is in Rabat, the seat of the king, his ministers and of decision- making,
that the quiet hum of satisfaction at the country's recent economic
successes can be discerned.
Morocco, which at one stage looked as if it would go the way of Latin
America, appears to have escaped the fate of countries that are saddled by
increasing debt and uncontrollable inflation. Instead, it presents an
impressive macro-economic record. It still faces an enormous challenge,
however, in trying to improve the country's social development record.
The origin of Morocco's debt problem is to be found in the severe bout of
overspending in the 1970s when, after the rise in the price of oil by the
oil-producing countries, the price of phosphates, Morocco's largest mineral
export, also increased. It went on a spending spree and invested heavily in
the development of the phosphate industry - three-quarters of the world's
phosphate reserves are in Morocco - but by the early 1980s the collapse of
world prices for phosphates, the cost of importing oil and a drought
conspired to make it turn to the IMF for help.
Morocco has followed a regime of structural reform since 1984 which has been
so well implemented by Mr Mohammed Berrada, the finance minister, that the
country has been held up by international institutions as a role model for
countries in chronic economic difficulties.
The government's budget deficit has been steadily reduced from around 12 per
cent of gross domestic product in the early 1980s to under 2 per cent in
1992. The current account deficit in the balance of payments has also been
brought down from 10 per cent to less than 2 per cent over the same period.
This, combined with steady export-led growth, has allowed Morocco to control
its total external debt of just over Dollars 21bn. The ratio of debt
outstanding and disbursed to GDP dropped from 113 per cent during 1984-87 to
73 per cent in 1992. The ratio of paid debt service to exports declined from
31 to 28 per cent over the same period.
Debt-service repayments with the Paris Club creditors, which account for
about half the debt, have been rescheduled several times in the 1980s and
what is billed as the last rescheduling took place in February 1992. Some
Dollars 2.7bn owing to Saudi Arabia was written off by Riyadh in thanks for
Morocco's support of the coalition forces in the war against Iraq.
Morocco hopes that another politically correct tactic will also prove
profitable. Rabat was the stopover for a press conference by Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign
minister, who lauded the warm welcome extended to them by King Hassan.
Morocco is hoping that the move will help attract foreign investment to the
country. Last year it increased to Dollars 514m from Dollars 330m the year
before.
The result of macro-economic discipline has been to save Moroccans from the
ravages of inflation. The inflation rate averaged 5 per cent last year,
compared to 8.2 per cent in 1991. The dirham has also held its value,
allowing the government to introduce dirham convertibility for international
transactions in January with full convertibility as the goal.
Despite the years of austerity and the cuts in government spending, the
economy has managed to grow, albeit erratically, due to its dependence on
the agricultural sector, which is in turn victim to the vicissitudes of
rainfall. Gross domestic product averaged 4.5 per cent over the period
1985-1991 but the economy contracted by 3 per cent last year due to a
drought which is now in its second year. The current slump has also been
exacerbated by recession in Morocco's main export markets, notably France,
which takes some 30 per cent of Moroccan exports.
The trade deficit therefore worsened in 1992 to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars
2.1bn in 1991, although higher tourism receipts as the sector recovered from
the slump caused by the Gulf War which, along with greater remittances from
Moroccans working abroad, is the country's main source of foreign exchange
earnings, narrowed the current account deficit to just over Dollars 500m in
1992 from Dollars 650m in 1991.
The government is now trying to accelerate a process of liberalisation and
privatisation to attract foreign investment. In an open letter in July, King
Hassan asked Mr Muhammad Karim Lamrani, the prime minister, to speed up the
implementation of the structural and administrative reforms to create a
favourable environment for productive investment but also to take measures
which will allow investors, in the short term, to cope with the vagaries of
the economic environment.
However, the success of the structural adjustment programme can mask the
very real economic problems facing the majority of the population. A recent
World Bank report highlighted lagging performance in social indicators and
labour absorption: despite recent progress in reducing poverty, such
indicators as child mortality, nutritional status for the lowest income
groups, access to safe water, and literacy and primacy school enrolment
rates, especially among women, remain well below averages for countries with
similar per capita incomes.
There has been some improvement since the mid-1980s but many Moroccans feel
that the government reacts only when it has no choice. One such time was in
1990, when violent protests against poverty and unemployment prompted an
increase in social spending by the government. The population of 25m is
young, with over 75 per cent below the age of 25 years. Unemployment, even
for university graduates, is a real problem and the most recent estimates,
for 1991, put unemployment at 20 per cent in urban areas, compared to 12 per
cent 10 years earlier.
Comparisons with neighbouring Tunisia are not flattering. While GNP per
capita in Morocco is Dollars 1,030, it is Dollars 1,523 in Tunisia. About
one in seven Moroccans lives below the poverty line (an improvement on one
in five in 1985) compared with one in 15 in Tunisia. The infant mortality
rate is 65 per 1,000 births compared to 43 per 1,000 in Tunisia and life
expectancy is 62 years against 70 years for a Tunisian.
About 45 per cent of the population in Morocco lives in the countryside and
the rural-urban gap is enormous. Primary school enrolment rates are 73 per
cent for boys and 54 per cent for girls, but as low as 35 per cent for girls
living in the countryside. Only 23 per cent of the rural population is
literate compared with 63 per cent in urban areas. The government is now
preparing a strategy to improve living conditions for the poor and has come
under pressure from the World Bank to do so, since the second tranche of the
Structural Adjustment Loan is dependent on the materialisation of the
report.
Some government members are unhappy about the pressure being exerted upon
them. 'Social development has become fashionable,' said one minister. 'But
how are we to control the economy and spend money on the social side? We
need to invest in social development but you can only do that if you have
money and for that you need growth.'
The government also faces criticism and resentment from its seemingly
prosperous business class. 'I'm appalled at all the stories about how
Morocco's economy is perfect when we all know there are so many problems,'
says one Moroccan industrialist unhappy at the country's weak industrial
structure. 'Why do you think foreign investors do not come to Morocco? It is
because the business climate is so bad.'
Businesses are suffering from a severe shortage of office space due to
property speculation which has left rents beyond the reach of all but the
very wealthy. As a result, buildings stand empty while accommodation is
acutely needed.
While good laws exist, some people complain that the judiciary cannot be
relied on to implement them and that it is up to the country's political
leaders to set an example.
Morocco will need change from the top if it is to capitalise on its
impressive record of structural adjustment and rely on the development of
its own productive resources to ease poverty and encourage an efficient
economy.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (3): Quality producers - Heavy industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUBAI'S manufacturing industries have developed on the back of the finest
sea and air communications in the Middle East. Dubai Aluminium (Dubal) and
industries located in the Jebel Ali Free Zone depend on the ports. These are
Dubai's lifeline. The tanker traffic and the commercial shipping in turn
create the business for Dubai Drydocks.
Manufacturing industries located in Dubai represent only about 25 per cent
of the country's non-oil manufacturing base, but what is lacking in quantity
is to a large extent made up in quality. Dubal; Dubai Cable Company, a 60-40
joint venture between the government and the BICC group of the UK which
operates and manages the company; and Dubai Drydocks are all industry
leaders.
In little more than two decades Dubai has become one of the top 15 shipping
centres in the world container port traffic league and the redistribution
hub of the Middle East.
In May 1991, the two ports of Mina Rashid and Jebel Ali, 35 kilometres south
of Dubai city, were merged to create Dubai Ports Authority (DPA), headed by
Mr Sultan Bin Sulayem who is also chairman of the Jebel Ali Free Zone
Authority (Jafza). By the end of that year, container traffic had increased
37 per cent to top 1m TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units), for the first
time. Last year, container traffic had increased by a further 48 per cent,
and this year throughput is likely to reach 1.6m TEUs.
Last year, DPA invested Dollars 100m to expand Jebel Ali's container
terminal and buy six new container cranes, and a further two are on order
for both Jebel Ali and Mina Rashid. The two ports together have 102
deepwater berths.
The cargo village at Dubai's international airport completed its first full
year of operations in July 1992 and, working in tandem with DPA, handled
more than 12m kilos of sea-air cargo. DPA claims that a Japanese
manufacturer using sea-air via DPA to reach Germany can save one third off
all-sea transport and more than 40 per cent off all-air costs.
Dubai Aluminium's production last year exceeded capacity for the first time
since completion of the smelter development programme in January 1991. Hot
metal production reached 244,605 tonnes, an increase of 5,575 tonnes on 1991
production. The aluminium industry as a whole suffered from the effects of
the recession in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries. Despite the tight market, Dubal sold more than 250,000 tonnes of
finished metal to 21 countries, with Japan continuing to account for the
largest percentage of sales.
Dubal is now applying for accreditation to the International Standards
Organisation under ISO 9002 for coverage of the entire smelter operation, in
readiness for exporting to the EC.
Last July, Dubai Cable Company became the first cable factory in the Middle
East to be awarded the ISO 9002 standard, widely used throughout the US,
Europe and Japan to ensure manufactured products meet specific high quality
standards. The European Community is planning to ensure that all cable
imports into Europe meet these standards.
The company says it achieved record sales in 1992 with a 12 per cent
increase over 1991. It successfully broke into the Asian market with a
Pounds 10m contract from Singapore's Public Utilities Board and last August
won another supply contract for low voltage cables from Hong Kong's China
Light &amp; Power Company. Mr Neil Chesworth, general manager for sales and
marketing, says products can be made in Dubai which are as good as anywhere.
The ingredients for success in Ducab's case are a growing market such as the
Middle East, a joint venture partner such as the Dubai government which
leaves BICC to run the company, and BICC's know-how.
The same 'hands-off' policy adopted by the government has also been a
winning formula in the case of Dubai Drydocks, the Dollars 400m ship repair
complex opened in 1979. It has three graving docks of 350,000dwt,
500,000dwt, and 1,000,000dwt, and for years was regarded as a white elephant
because by the time it opened the tanker market involving very large vessels
was undergoing one of its very depressed periods. In the 10 years it has
been operating, however, it has made a profit every year, according to Mr
Ernie Ware, chief executive.
During the Iran-Iraq war, a lot of vessels with minor damage were repaired
in Dubai, and once the war was over in August 1988, Dubai Drydocks began
seriously the job of building up industries related to the drydocks
themselves. It has attracted several contractors into the industrial estate
adjacent to the shipyard.
The number of vessels repaired between March 1992 and February 1993 was 103
with a tonnage of more than 20m. Since the beginning of March this year, 103
vessels have been in for repair with a total tonnage of nearly 16m.
Jebel Ali Free Zone has witnessed the same kind of success. The concept and
the scale of Dubai's ambition when the Free Zone Authority was established
in February 1985 was greeted with the same kind of scepticism as Dubai
Drydocks. But despite the Iran-Iraq war and the 1991 Gulf war - and fears
for the region's stability which curbed investor interest - Jebel Ali Free
Zone is now benefiting from the scale of the original concept.
It offers a long list of very attractive inducements to potential investors,
including a lack of red tape which is a businessman's dream compared with
the red tape in most neighbouring countries, and it has been vigorous in
promoting itself. By mid-October there were more then 560 companies with
licences to operate in the Free Zone. They came from 58 countries and
represented an investment of more than Dollars 1bn. Sultan Bin Sulayem,
Jafza chairman, said 'mega-companies' had been showing considerable interest
in applying for special offshore licences.
He says European companies are beginning to see the wisdom of manufacturing
products for sale in Europe, in Dubai rather than in Asia.
There are still obstacles to attracting the kind of manufacturing companies
the Free Zone wants. The first has been the conspicuous reluctance of
neighbouring countries which are prime re-export targets, particularly Saudi
Arabia, to accept that goods made in the free zone with a minimum 40 per
cent value-added content by a company owned at least 51 per cent by a GCC
national should pass as a locally-produced item, and therefore be liable to
a similar low rate of import duty as that payable by any other GCC onshore
industry. According to Mr Bin Sulayem, however, the problem is being
resolved.
But the bureaucratic hurdles have been formidable. First, the company
concerned has to get a certificate of origin from the UAE Finance and
Industry Ministry. Next, the paperwork has to pass through not only the
Dubai chamber of commerce - a relatively very straightforward process - but
also the GCC secretariat in Riyadh and then it must be approved by the Saudi
customs.
Meanwhile, because Dubai sticks to its belief in a free market and refuses
to protect its industries, the manufacturer has to compete with manufactured
goods from neighbouring countries, including Saudi Arabia, which benefit
from high domestic tariffs, cost more to produce but still sell at a profit
in their own domestic markets, which enable their owners to dump them in the
UAE. The cost disadvantages, frustrations and delays have deterred many a
would-be investor.
The other cloud on the horizon is the nagging possibility that Dubai in
general could not support a major industrial investment because it could not
satisfy long-term power needs. Talks are reported to have taken place,
however, with the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah, with Abu Dhabi, Qatar,
and Iran.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (6): Top-ranking regional event -
International Aerospace Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS many as 450 companies from 33 countries will be taking part in the second
International Aerospace Exhibition in Dubai on November 7-11. The degree of
interest shown by supplier countries and aviation companies has confirmed
the hopes of its organisers, the UK's Fairs &amp; Exhibitions, that 'Dubai '93'
 -held every two years - ranks, in the Middle East, on a par with
Farnborough and Paris for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development countries.
The Financial Times is organising a conference, also in Dubai, on 'World
Commercial Aviation' on November 8-10. Speakers include senior executives
from aviation companies, government organisations and commercial banks.
Some 75 civil and military aircraft which will be on display and will take
up the bulk of the one kilometre-long exhibition grounds at Dubai's
international airport. Equal numbers of civil and military suppliers are
expected and the exhibition is intended to reflect a trend for manufacturers
to display future aerospace technology rather than just existing products.
But the immediate interest lies in potential orders for high-technology
defence equipment from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Abu Dhabi are expected to spend more than Dollars 30bn over the
next seven years, in addition to existing orders, on advanced fighters,
helicopters and air defence systems.
A Kuwait Defence Ministry spokesman said on October 5 that the government
was still evaluating different options for helicopters, following reports
that Kuwait had followed Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi in having placed firm
orders for the McDonnell Douglas Apache attack helicopters.
Offset agreements, by which the supplier or the supplier government agrees
to invest 30 per cent or more of the contract value in the client country,
are now a standard part of large defence contracts.
Two factors have caused competition to intensify between traditional western
suppliers and companies from the former Soviet bloc countries. The first is
the expected decline in defence requirements from Israel and the Arab
front-line countries following the signing of the PLO-Israel accord in
September. The second is that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, whatever the
size of their budget deficits, are perceived to be the last remaining
countries with significant amounts of cash to spare and obvious
high-technology defence needs to compensate for their small populations and
defence establishments. Since the end of the 1990-91 Gulf war which exposed
their defence weaknesses, they have all embarked on expensive defence
procurement programmes.
The UAE in particular is concerned about the recent Iranian occupation of
the UAE Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Tumbs near the Gulf entrance to the
Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf states and the western countries with which they
have defence agreements have also commented on the Iranian acquisition of
two former Soviet diesel submarines at a cost of some Dollars 400m and at a
time when Iran is conspicuously strapped for cash.
Iran is reported to have an option on a third submarine. It is also reported
to have plans to assemble North Korean-made medium-range Scud missiles. The
Iranian government has denied recent Saudi newspaper reports that it was
planning to test-fire the North Korean missiles in the Dasht-e-Lut desert in
central Iran.
Russia and other CIS and eastern European countries will be represented by
some 40 companies. Russia also intends to put on display the giant Antonov
125 cargo carrier as well as the Mig-29 and the Sukhoi-27 fighters. Russian
companies also have a wealth of research and development experience, most of
which cannot now be afforded by their own government. Their weakness may be
their need for financing.
Among civil airline fleets, the most publicised customer, Saudi Arabia's
flag carrier Saudia, has yet to select suppliers to revamp its ageing fleet
of some 60 aircraft. Both Boeing and Airbus are vying for the deal. India is
expected to spend several hundred million dollars modernising its airports.
Dubai is also due to expand its airport - where the exhibition is being
held. The Dubai government is still examining different options, and it is
possible an announcement could be made at the air show.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (5): A stimulating environment - Nicholas
Hills takes a look at business law in Dubai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS HILLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UAE is an interesting business legal environment because of the
interface between the federal (UAE) legislation and regulations in force in
individual emirates, including, of course, Dubai.
The law is embodied in codified decrees published in either the Federal or
individual emirates' Official Gazettes, which then need application and
interpretation in the context of an active and established commercial
environment.
Businesses in Dubai are required to comply with federal legislation as well
as Dubai's own regulations, which are designed to attract responsible and
appropriate foreign businesses to Dubai, which itself has become a
significant regional centre.
In 1993, the Dubai government has established the Economic Department, which
now looks after, controls and facilitates the registration of businesses in
the Emirate of Dubai (other than in the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ). The JAFZ
has its own individual registration and licensing requirements and operates
under its own enabling legislation: an interesting recent development at
JAFZ has been the introduction in 1992 of a single-shareholder
limited-liability entity known as a Free Zone Establishment (FZE).
While there are considerable advantages and incentives in setting up in
JAFZ, many businesses still opt (or require) to establish outside JAFZ in
Dubai itself.
There are a variety of ways - many not mutually exclusive - in which a
foreign business may operate in or into Dubai under the auspices of the
Commercial Companies Law, some of whose provisions are at the moment under
review, or under the Commercial Agencies Law.
Care and advice needs to be taken over selecting how to establish. Outside
JAFZ, with very few exceptions, some local connection ( a sponsor, agent or
partner) is required. As a general rule, limited companies established with
foreign investment need 51 per cent local participation.
By far the most interesting prospective legal development in the UAE (and in
particular in Dubai as a commercial and financial centre) is the imminent
introduction of the Commercial Transaction Law, which will need to be
considered very closely in parallel with the existing civil law.
In the vibrant mercantile environment of Dubai, the introduction of
regulatory commercial legislation will be particularly relevant and, it is
expected, beneficial in terms of commercial activity. However, there is
bound to be a transitional period while the experienced business practices
will need to change to conform with the new law.
The new legislation is comprehensive and, although it is similar to
commercial legislation in other Gulf states, it has been carefully
considered in the context of local requirements. With the recent
introduction of intellectual property legislation, the UAE will, with the
new Commercial Transactions Law, have a more complete body of business law.
The development of business law and the constant inter-relation between
local and foreign interests, particularly in Dubai (as a regional centre),
will continue to provide a challenging and stimulating environment in which
there will be an increasing need for sophisticated, but nonetheless
practical, legal structuring and documentation.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (2): New strategy for a different era - The
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS reflected in trade statistics, Dubai's economy has rarely been so
buoyant. The timing could not be better to implement, through the
recently-created Economic Department, a strategy to take the emirate into
the era - still a long way off - when a self-sustaining economic base will
mean Dubai is no longer dependent on oil revenues.
If government aspirations are met, the self-sustaining economic base will
rest on three factors: traditional trade; the leisure and business tourist
industry; and the continuing growth in the number of companies choosing
Dubai as a regional services and light industries centre.
But four essentials must be met if these ambitions are to be realised.
First, there has to be regional political stability; secondly, there must
exist a coherent and effective legal framework within which all kinds of
business can flourish; thirdly, Dubai must have abundant energy supplies at
affordable rates; and lastly it must rest comfortably within the federation
even if it retains degrees of autonomy on different issues.
For the past five years, Dubai's non-oil trade - the traditional core of its
economy - has been growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent,
official statistics show. Dubai caters for 70 per cent of the UAE's total
trade. Just over half is with Asian countries; almost 30 per cent with
Europe. For 1992 alone, imports totalled almost Dh60bn and re-exports almost
Dh9bn.
The main entry and re-export points are Port Rashid, a large and extremely
efficient container port with an average re-export turnaround time of 24
hours; Jebel Ali, the largest man-made container harbour in the world; the
dhow traffic on Dubai's creek, the waterway on which it built its reputation
as an entrepot; and the air-cargo terminal which has a capacity at present
of 250,000 tonnes a year. Greatly expanded over the years and always being
improved, they allow Dubai's life-blood to flow.
The funds generated by this trade are several times greater - Dh70bn
compared with some Dh10bn - than revenue from crude oil and gas. 'The funds
for all this activity are entirely generated in the market,' says Mr Bill
Duff, chief financial expert at Dubai's Central Accounts Office. 'They are
not subsidised by the government whose oil revenues have to be concentrated
on improving the infrastructure to cope with the increase in load.'
Dubai's re-exports are greatly helped by periodic problems in Iran such as
the imposition of quotas which limit imports. These may make it more
difficult for other traders, but Dubai is near enough and with sufficient
experience to give its Iranian community the necessary flexibility to take
advantage of them. The Iranians themselves realise Dubai's special role, for
when they stipulated that all imports to Tehran and Bandar Abbas should go
direct rather than through middle men, Dubai was exempted.
But all this trade, as Mr Duff points out, is in cash investments 'which you
have to try to stabilise'. So to a very large extent is tourism and the
investments made by foreign companies which choose Dubai as the preferred
centre from which to service the wider Middle East and West Asia, the Indian
sub-continent.
Continuing political stability in the region, of the kind that has existed
since the end of the Gulf war, is therefore vital while Dubai finds ways to
attract more - and more valuable - investments.
The advent into Dubai of so many companies, particularly in the past 2 1/2
years, has in turn unleashed a property boom in both house construction and
rentals. Rentals, some businessmen insist, have risen more sharply than the
actual increase in business turnover and, more importantly, profits.
These, however, are cyclical factors. Of greater concern in the longer term
is that these markets - houses, service offices, commerce - could decline as
rapidly as they came if the right conditions are not established within
Dubai to tempt more fixed investment.
The government needs time to expand the infrastructure and the private
sector needs time to consolidate the commercial gains of the past few years.
Both of these factors are in play partly because the prolonged recession in
the west has encouraged more and more companies to venture into the
expanding Gulf market. Hence the phenomenal interest in regional
exhibitions, including the forthcoming Air Exhibition.
One answer to Dubai's (and the UAE's) need for more fixed investment in
non-oil industries is to acquire the high technology industries that come
with offset programmes. But as one visiting representative, in Dubai to
discuss offset proposals, said: 'High technology industries are not like an
invention. You cannot create one and then leave it. You need the talent
on-the-spot to run it and develop it further'.
A source close to the government added: 'Technology transfer and
diversification are all fashionable to talk about, but they have to be
viable before they set up here because they cannot rely on government
subsidies. Common sense and business acumen are Dubai's greatest assets, and
these are what we should build on.'
Overall strategy for Dubai's economic development for the next decade is
with the recently-formed Dubai Government Economic Department and Mr Mohamed
Alabbar, its director-general. Although best known to Dubai's business
community as the man expected to streamline the process of issuing business
and office licences (and the principal target of their complaints when
expectations are not immediately met), Mr Alabbar has an awesome task
dealing with many other issues, for which he has earned the title of 'the
government's economic troubleshooter.'
He is credited with having turned round the government's property and other
investments in Singapore which it inherited from the Dubai entrepreneur Mr
Abdul Wahab Galadari; and more recently with having rationalised the
structure at Dubai Aluminium Company, which he continues to direct. But the
Economic Department under his direction also has to oversee other government
onshore investments; and represent Dubai at meetings of federal committees
where all types of draft legislation are discussed, including the extent to
which individual emirates retain degrees of autonomy.
However the core of his responsibilities lies with trying to streamline the
licensing process for companies wanting to register or to renew
registration. His goal, he says, is to provide companies with their
registration certificates within 48 hours of application and requests for
information by fax on demand. This is ambitious to say the least given the
amount and complexity of forms required, and the need for his staff to
undergo 'customer service training.' But by and large the business community
acknowledges that progress has been made.
Mr Alabbar says that a lot of the work that is done is not visible to the
business community. His department is involved in continuous federal
committee sessions and it is in these where Dubai's voice is heard.
He is quick to point out that many of those who sit on federal committees
have been at school together, and that Dubai's relations with other emirates
at federal level are fundamental to its economic future.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (4): Facing up to realities - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER almost 22 years of federation, Dubai's defence is inextricably bound
up not only with that of the United Arab Emirates, but in a wider sense with
that of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) too. So defence forces stationed
in Dubai are referred to, by virtue of their geographical location at the
centre of the federation, as Central Military Command (CMC), even though
direct authority over CMC is via a chain of command containing only names
from Dubai's ruling family, the Al Maktoum.
CMC's ground forces consist of as many as 15,000 men, out of a total UAE
federal army of 50,000, according to the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies. Up to 80 per cent of CMC is comprised of
Omanis from the Batinah coast in the northern part of the country, and the
balance from Dubai.
The ground forces include an armoured regiment equipped with Italian-made
Ottomelara tanks of German design with 105mm guns and British Scorpion
light-track tanks; two infantry brigades; and an anti-tank regiment plus
artillery.
The air force includes an air defence regiment and the Air Wing which has
British-made Hawk and Italian Aeromacchi fighter-trainers.
CMC's titular commander-in-chief is Sheikh Ahmed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the
youngest of the four sons of Sheikh Rashid, Dubai's former ruler and brother
of Sheikh Mohammad, the UAE's minister of defence who was recently promoted
to full general by Sheikh Zayed, the UAE president and ruler of Abu Dhabi.
Sheikh Mohammad is reported to take a very close interest in CMC, as well as
exercising financial control.
The two deputy commanders are Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum and Sheikh Butti Al
Maktoum, brothers who are close relations of Sheikh Maktoum, Dubai's ruler.
Both deputy commanders have passed through Britain's officer cadet training
college at Mons near Aldershot. Of the two, Sheikh Butti is the one most
frequently referred to as the day-to-day commander of CMC.
All of the other senior officers, NCOs and warrant officers are from Dubai,
although there are Egyptian and Sudanese training officers plus a few
British, seconded or on contract.
The historical role of a Dubai army has been to protect Dubai itself and,
given the authority wielded by its ruling family, the tradition of retaining
command and control is very much alive.
But today's demands on the UAE impose their own realities on CMC to which it
has responded. During the Gulf war, CMC would have been in a state of
complete readiness. It also provided a large squadron - some 120 men - for a
battalion-size force which the UAE contributed to the US-led coalition. This
battalion was engaged at Khafji on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, and took some
casualties. Today, CMC has a large squadron as part of the UAE force
attached to the UN forces in Somalia.
Although Abu Dhabi is thought to bear some of the cost of maintaining CMC,
the overwhelming charge is to Dubai's account, and this represents a
significant part of Dubai's direct contribution to the UAE federal budget.
The fact that Sheikh Mohammad, the UAE defence minister, is from Dubai also
gives CMC a political dimension. Like other senior figures in the
federation, he is reported to be a strong supporter for greater defence
co-operation at more levels, especially where defence overlaps with
political and diplomatic issues.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (1): Press on the accelerator - Morocco is
more self-confident than in 1983 when a balance of payments crisis forced it
to reschedule foreign debt. King Hassan provides stability and there has
been some progress on liberalising the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
Morocco is in the process of reviewing its identity. Geo- graphically, it is
part of north Africa, but emotionally it is strongly tied to the Arab world.
Devotionally, it belongs to Islam, but economically it has decided that it
wishes to be linked to Europe.
The priorities given to those potentially conflictive characteristics, under
the leadership of what remains ultimately an absolute monarchy, is likely to
define Morocco's capacity to realise its considerable potential during the
remaining years of this century.
The one apparently sure thing is that the changes will be gradual and the
signposts may simultaneously point in different directions. King Hassan II,
who appears to sit more comfortably on his throne than at any time since he
took over from his father Mohammed V in 1961, exercises his power with
acknowledged skill but not always with the most obvious intentions.
The interpretation of royal wishes, like the sources of information and the
identity of the most influential advisers at the royal court, has long been
one of Rabat's most engrossing activities.
There are, however, certain imperatives which no monarch or government can
safely ignore. Morocco's population of some 26m (it could be a million or
two more) is growing by at least 2.2 per cent a year. Some 50 per cent of
Moroccans are under 20 years old and more than 50 per cent of adult males
are illiterate. Urban unemployment is unofficially estimated at 20 per cent
or more, while there is considerably greater underemployment in rural areas.
World Bank studies suggest that 13 per cent of the population lives below
the poverty line, with another 8 per cent only marginally above it. Income
disparities are substantial, particularly between town and country. Across a
wide range of social indicators, Morocco lags well behind other countries
with similar per capita incomes.
The need for social advancement, especially among the most disadvantaged,
has taken on greater urgency with the spread of Islamic militancy throughout
the Arab nations. The alarming social, political and economic deterioration
in neighbouring Algeria is an uncomfortably close reminder of what can
happen when an entrenched government fails to respond adequately to popular
demands.
Plentiful reasons can be advanced to explain why Morocco will continue to
avoid the pitfalls suffered by its neighbour. King Hassan enjoys widespread
respect, if not always affection. His judgment and policies on major foreign
policy issues, such as the Arab-Israel conflict and the Gulf war, have been
substantially vindicated.
The visit to Rabat in September by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, recognised the importance of King Hassan's long-term commitment to
a negotiated peace settlement. His support for the western-led military
action to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait flew in the face of popular
sentiment, but is now seen by many Moroccans to have been a politically
astute decision.
The 'green march' in 1975, which brought the Western Sahara under Moroccan
control, is still disputed by the international community but looks
increasingly irreversible and was, in domestic terms, arguably the single
most important decision of King Hassan's reign.
As Commander of the Faithful and a direct descendant of the Prophet, King
Hassan can also claim a religious authority which appears to be largely
unchallenged. Some Moroccans say they sense a growing Islamic militancy, but
are hard pressed to provide evidence of it.
The country's political parties are all, to a greater or lesser extent,
monarchist. When this embraces even the communists, the scope for
ideological debate is necessarily limited and confines itself to policy
priorities rather than fundamental aims.
The first round of elections for a new parliament earlier this year was
thought by independent observers to be relatively free. The second round,
for reasons that are not immediately obvious, fell miserably short of that
objective. But despite the disputed outcome, Morocco is advancing, however
slowly, towards a more representative form of government in which the prime
minister theoretically enjoys greater freedom of action.
Rather more impressive progress has been made during the past decade in the
structural readjustment of the economy along lines encouraged by the IMF and
World Bank. The budget deficit has been reduced to about 2 per cent of GDP,
the current account deficit has dropped sharply as exports increased,
rescheduling agreements have lowered the debt service ratio and inflation
has been reduced to around 5 per cent.
Windfall benefits, such as Saudi Arabia's agreement to wipe out debts of
more than Dollars 3bn following the Gulf war, have, however, been offset by
two years of drought which last year curtailed agricultural output and
caused an estimated 3 per cent fall in gross domestic product.
The vagaries of the weather, and the consequent sharp fluctuations in annual
GDP, lend even greater weight to arguments advanced by members of the
business community for a more vigorous approach to the liberalisation and
diversification of the economy. They acknowledge that the government is
edging in the right direction.
A range of measures over the past few years, including a reduction in
tariffs, lower import duties, an easing of licensing restrictions, the
convertibility of the dirham, financial sector reforms and the privatisation
programme is helping to make the economy more market-oriented.
One immediately beneficial result has been a sharp increase in direct
foreign investment which last year was estimated at Dollars 500m, more than
double the figure for 1990.
But whether this is happening quickly enough to create the hundreds of
thousands of new jobs that Morocco needs every year to satisfy new entrants
to the labour market is open to doubt. The pace of industrialisation remains
sluggish compared with many other countries at a similar stage of
development. It must accelerate if Morocco is to take full advantage of the
partnership agreement it is negotiating with the European Community.
The economic picture is additionally complicated by the ill-defined but
undoubtedly substantial 'informal sector', which ranges from an impressive
array of illegal imports to the flourishing production and export of
cannabis, said by some diplomats to account for about 30 per cent of
Europe's annual consumption and to be worth around Dollars 2bn a year. Such
trade can only complicate Morocco's desire to strengthen its links with the
EC, while also posing uncomfortable questions about the country's policing
and judicial system.
How keenly Morocco intends to address these issues depends heavily on King
Hassan and the legacy he wishes to bequeath. He is only 64 and in good
health, but the political dominance of the monarch is such that any
discussion in Rabat about Morocco's future cannot avoid the issue of the
succession.
The king's experience and skills in manipulating and balancing the diverse
centres of power and influence within the country are unlikely to be
inherited intact by Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, who may anyway wish to
pursue a less directly interventionist role. Many Moroccans accept that for
the next few years at least the country will need a strong, unifying force
at the centre.
If there is a vision and an example of how Morocco should evolve in the next
two decades, the most often mentioned is that of Spain, just 14 kilometres
away.
Morocco, like Spain in the 1950s and 1960s, is authoritarian, close to
Europe but far from it politically, agricultural but with huge industrial
and tourism potential, and with a growing nucleus of young professionals who
are internationally aware but increasingly frustrated by a cumbersome and
restrictive bureaucracy.
By the time of General Francisco Franco's death in the mid-1970s, the growth
of the Spanish economy and a burgeoning middle class had laid the basis for
a relatively smooth political liberalisation and eventual transfer of power.
It might seem wildly fanciful today to see Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed as a
future King Juan Carlos, but as a signpost for the future it points in a
general direction that most other Arab populations would envy.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (1): Mercantile capital of the Gulf -
Dubai's oil and business acumen have made it the second wealthiest state in
the United Arab Emirates. However, as the economic climate becomes more
complex, it is seeking new strategies to maintain its prosperity, as
described in this survey written by Robin Allen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO all appearances, Dubai is continuing to re-inforce its position as the
mercantile capital of the Gulf. Second richest of the seven states which
form the United Arab Emirates, over the years Dubai has earned for itself
the sobriquet Dubai Inc. by virtue of its business acumen and the shrewd
instinct, not only of its former celebrated ruler, Sheikh Rashid, but also
of the merchant community as a whole.
It has also benefited - and continues to benefit - from a healthy surplus of
capital from oil revenues, which has enabled the government, the ruling Al
Maktoum family, to build the best infrastructure that money can buy.
Under Sheikh Rashid, Dubai has also equipped itself with industrial
facilities on a par with the best in the world, a tradition continued by his
sons with the creation of a Free Zone Authority and industrial area at Jebel
Ali and the establishment on a commercial basis of Dubai's own airline.
The combination of capital wealth, personal commitment, and sheer hard work
have helped to provide Dubai with a freedom to make its own decisions within
the federation in its formative years, and have subsequently enabled it to
keep going through two regional wars and the collapse of oil prices in the
mid-eighties.
These conditions, not least the availability of continuing reserves of
capital, are changing, however. To compensate, the government is trying to
enlarge and improve on developments that have already taken place. The
government's Economic Department, set up in July 1992, but only really in
operation since June this year, has the job of overseeing the management of
some of the government's onshore industries, of representing Dubai at
federal meetings where legislation is drafted, and, of most immediate
importance to the business community and potential investors, of
streamlining the trade licence registration process, a source of
considerable ambiguity and frustration in recent years.
In addition, the government has been spending a lot of money to improve the
road network and other infrastructure; and its commerce and tourism
promotion board is waging an effective campaign to attract more investors
and tourists, the overall aim being to create an economy based on
self-sustaining tourist and regional services industries, for an era when
the cushion of wealth from oil revenues is no longer there.
On the investment front, it is intended that the Economic Department should
develop into a one-stop shop where it will be possible to establish a
limited liability company. Many businessmen still complain, however, about
the amount of time-consuming paperwork, and the cost - Arabic translations
at Dh100 (Dollars 27) a page - when it comes to the enactment of a coherent
legal code.
Taken together, these measures should ensure that Dubai retains its
prominence, if not its pre-eminence, as the mercantile capital of the Gulf.
But there are several conditions to be fulfilled and a number of potential
weaknesses which may make it more difficult to keep the strategy on course.
These include:
continued regional political stability;
the Economic Department's ability to live up to the demands made on it;
the progressive implementation of a coherent and effective business legal
framework;
the peaceful development of the federation and of Dubai's role within it,
a guarantee of continuing abundant sources of energy at affordable prices.
The successful resolution of the 1990-91 Gulf crisis removed doubts in
investors' minds over whether the west would intervene in a crisis, and
instilled a degree of confidence about the Gulf which had been previously
lacking.
Iran's occupation of, and claims on, three UAE islands near the strait of
Hormuz, has not so far led to anything more than curt exchanges of
diplomatic notes, and resolutions from foreign ministers of the six-member
Gulf Co-operation Council. Iran's apparent decision to invest in expensive
weaponry at a time when it is thought least able to afford it, and for
motives which are not clear, has certainly caused concern - but so far
nothing more.
These problems are so sensitive that in Dubai senior officials refuse to
discuss them. This is partly in deference to Abu Dhabi and the federation.
Foreign affairs comes within the jurisdiction of the presidency, that is to
say, Sheikh Zayed in Abu Dhabi, where it is reported there is a real fear of
Iran trying to extend its physical control over other Arab Gulf islands.
Dubai is thought to share this apprehension, but not to the same degree. The
trading links between Dubai and Iran are historically very strong, and the
relationship deeper and more subtle than that between Abu Dhabi and Iran.
Other matters of foreign policy, including the US policy of 'dual
containment' of Iraq and Iran, are not ones which Sheikh Mohammad Bin
Rashid, the defence minister, is prepared to discuss. But it is known that
as a result of the Gulf war, he is a leading proponent of a much greater
depth of co-operation between member countries of the GCC, and continuing
links with the US and the west. The UAE and particularly its president
Sheikh Zayed, was one of the staunchest supporters of the US-led coalition.
The outline peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation falls into the same category.
Critics of the modern form of tribal leadership, of which there are a few in
Dubai, contend that the system of government by word-of-mouth and by
telephone, is inadequate for the administration of a modern state. There is
no legislative assembly or consultative council within Dubai - where the
majlis, or open session held by the sheikhs, acts as an alternative forum
for discussion, and for petitions to be presented. To be present at one such
majlis is to see tribal democracy in action at its most basic level.
On the other hand even critics acknowledge that in a state as small as
Dubai, there is enough delegation of authority to individuals and
institutions for the state to function sufficiently well. By contrast with
some of its neighbours, Dubai's public administration is smooth and
efficient, and better than some European countries.
Where tribal leadership falls short - and Dubai is only one small example in
the whole of Arabia - is in its inability to decentralise authority, and to
make the most of existing opportunities. Industries such as Dubal, a
state-owned competitor on world markets; Dubai Drydocks, a successful and
apparently profitable alternative to Singapore's ship-repair facilities; and
Emirates Air, a fast-growing airline, are all in need of capital that public
shareholders could provide, but have never even published a balance sheet.
They should have been partly privatised long ago.
The UAE as a whole does not yet have a formal stock exchange. Private
capital, and not least that belonging to the ruling families themselves,
could be harnessed to gel with Dubai's sizeable and hugely wealthy business
community to create a state of shareholders.
There is indeed scope for the for the UAE - which last year saw such an
outflow of private capital that it ran a balance of payments deficit for the
first time since federation - to work with the GCC countries as a whole, to
create a GCC-wide capital markets.
For day-to-day government, Dubai's ruling family is more than adequate. It
is respected and the rulers have their their ear to the ground. There are no
Islamic pressures of any significance, at least for the time being. And when
it comes to relations with Abu Dhabi and the federal authorities, natural
evolution suggests that Dubai's autonomy will continue to lessen by degree.
The key long-term challenge for the leadership may be to instill in today's
youth the drive and commitment that has characterised the emirate for the
past 30 years. Several statements from anxious federal officials suggest
that the next generation is not being sufficiently prepared for the day when
the Dubai government will not be able to support so many subsidies, or
create so many opportunities by a simple expenditure of capital.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in the frame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Thorn EMI rocketed for a second session, although both
leisure and telecoms specialists continued to be sceptical on press
speculation of a possible takeover bid by BT. Many preferred to believe the
story from across the Atlantic that a US telecoms group was eyeing Thorn,
speculation fuelled by US buying of the group's shares yesterday afternoon.
They closed 23 ahead at 987p after turnover of 1.9m. Meanwhile, BT watchers
were not discounting an aquisitive move in the near future, with one senior
trader predicting that the move would come when BT took receipt of the
Dollars 2bn-odd for its stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, due shortly.
BT fully-paid shares advanced 4 to 469 1/2 p and the partly-paid 5 1/2 to
220p.
The property sector saw a burst of activity as a number of features excited
interest. Firstly, MEPC announced it was extending its US retail activities
with the purchase of American Property Trust, a property unit trust whose
principal assets are two shopping malls in the US, for Pounds 115m. Analysts
welcomed the deal, particularly in the extra exposure to the US retail
market and at an attractive price. NatWest Securities raised its net asset
value forecast for the group to 440p on the back of the deal. MEPC shares
jumped on the news but faded to close a penny down at 532p.
British Land extended its debt profile through a Pounds 150m bond issue. The
shares moved up 3 to 409p. The company, which is known to be on the
acquisition trail, was one being mentioned in connection with Stanhope
yesterday as speculation increased over the shape of its future financing.
Stanhope had confirmed weekend press reports that it is considering a
restructuring, and although there were few more details emerging in the
market yesterday - other than the attention of an overseas investment group
 -there was talk of some burgeoning dissent among shareholders. Under
preliminary plans, existing shareholders could see their holding diluted to
20 per cent. Stanhope shares steadied at 36p.
Barclays was the outstanding performer in the financials area of the market,
with a buyer of 750,000 shares mainly responsible for driving the stock up
14 to 583p. Dealers said news of the US Supreme Court's decision to review
California's unitary tax system, which they said mitigates against Barclays
in the US, had triggered the upsurge.
Legal &amp; General finished 2 firmer at 518p, after 521p, on exceptionally
heavy turnover of 7.1m, with interest stimulated by an agency cross of 1.8m
shares at 528p.
Milk products group Northern Foods gained 4 at 232p amid talk of the
unwanted attentions of a European competitor. BSN, the French food group and
a frequently named suitor on the UK food scene, was one name being touted by
dealers. Strauss Turnbull was also said to be recommending the stock.
Northern is currently subject to a strong two-way pull in the market between
those cautious ahead of the restructuring of the UK milk industry and those
who consider some good opportunities opening up as a result.
Leading oil shares showed resilience in the face of a steep decline in crude
oil prices. British Petroleum was unaltered on balance at 352 1/2 p, while
Shell Transport continued to attract overseas funds and moved up 6 1/2 to
718p on 4.2m traded.
Pittencrieff climbed a further 37 to 473p as US investors focused on the US
telecoms interests.
George Wimpey was said to have suffered a downgrading and shed 6 to 167p.
NatWest Securities upgraded its forecast for Ladbroke Group, the broker
taking into account the betting and hotel group's share of a Pounds 55m
dividend payment from SIS, the satellite service owned by the UK's leading
bookmakers. NatWest is now looking for Pounds 153m for this year, an
increase of Pounds 10m. The shares steadied at 172p in good turnover of
3.9m.
In the face of high-profile sell notes, ICI nevertheless proved a tough
customer and mustered a rally, adding 8 at 725p in reasonable volume of
3.6m. US interest was largely credited for the rise.
Wellcome began to fight back, moving forward 15 to 690p. Sentiment was
boosted by a company presentation at SG Warburg, its broker.
Fisons relinquished 3 to 156p as UBS reduced its forecasts, trimming current
year expectations by Pounds 10m to Pounds 100m.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters strong again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water stocks made further rapid progress, building on Monday's solid gains
ahead of the important document from the industry watchdog outlining its
broad methodology for setting new pricing levels for 1995 to 2000. Worries
about the content of the Ofwat document, which is expected to be published
in full in July next year, have cast a shadow over the sector in recent
weeks.
But the market adopted a more relaxed view of the contents of the document
yesterday, with a number of the leading brokers of the opinion that most of
the bearish factors have already been factored into share prices.
SG Warburg's utilities team took the lead in the market yesterday, advising
their clients to 'exploit any further weakness by increasing holdings'.
Warburg said: 'We expect nothing of fundamental alarm on Thursday to
jeopardise our view that an attractive real rate of dividend growth can be
sustained through to 2000; at a 130 sector yield relative, any downside on
toughening regulation is discounted.' Warburg has projected 'at least 3 per
cent real dividend growth from 1995'.
Warburg continued to recommend its 'core holdings' in the sector: Severn
Trent, 12 higher at 560p, Thames, 4 firmer at 554p, and Southern, 10
stronger at 589p.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte unsettled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Forte were unsettled by talk in the market that CIGA, the
loss-making Italian hotelier currently being courted by the UK group, had
been made a more attractive offer by Hyatt Hotels, of the US. Forte came off
7 at one stage, but rallied towards the close to finish 3 adrift at 216p.
Turnover was an average 2m.
Forte struck a management deal with CIGA last month, paying Pounds 33m cash
and inserting some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds
125m into an Italian operating company. However, the two groups were
undergoing due diligence, and leisure analysts have been told that the deal
is some months away from being finalised.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hong Kong hint pushes C&amp;W down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOUR that CITIC, the Chinese government's investment agency, is planning a
major placing of HK Telecom shares, perhaps as much as a 5 per cent stake in
the equity, after it announces its results tomorrow, badly upset the share
price of Cable and Wireless, parent company of the Hong Kong group.
C&amp;W retains a near 58 per cent holding in HK Telecom and dealers took the
view that any sale of CITIC's stock would trigger a slide in Telecom's share
price.
Shares in C&amp;W slipped at the outset of trading, reflecting the late sudden
downward movement of the Hong Kong market, which closed only marginally
higher after being substantially firmer at first. After reaching a peak 509p
on Monday, the shares opened easier yesterday at 502p, and moved lower to
close a net 11 1/2 off at 491p after another session of well above average
turnover of 10m.
CITIC acquired its near 17 per cent HK Telecom stake in December 1989, for
an average HKDollars 4.50 a share and, according to UK dealers, could seek
to lock in substantial profits now that the shares stand above HKDollars 17
apiece. 'The Chinese would be looking at a massive profit of over Pounds 1bn
from their holding,' said one specialist.
He mentioned 'a massive US appetite for Far Eastern and particularly Hong
Kong stocks in recent months'. Because of its 17 per cent shareholding in HK
Telecom, CITIC would be prevented from selling any of its HK Telecom shares
in London because of the 'closed period' rules.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in Footsie futures yesterday moved on a rollercoaster yesterday,
with several influences pulling on the December contract, writes Christine
Buckley.
US selling once again stalked the contract in the morning and it slipped to
a day's low of 3,166 early in the session. There was not much of a fight to
rescue December, with sellers outweighing buyers.
Later on some optimism fed across from a bouncy German market and the
contract moved up to trade in more positive territory. For a while it
hovered mainly in a small range between 3,185 and 3,187.
But the US sellers would not be deterred and returned to push the contract
down. It struggled to muster a rally before the official close when it
registered 3,174 - on a par with its fair value premium to the cash market
which stands at about 8 points.
Volume was improved on recent sessions at 10,602 contracts.
In after-hours trading the market was enlivened by the Bank of England's
quarterly bulletin which contained upbeat signals for inflation. The
contract advanced to 3,174 and looked poised to bounce in today's trading.
Traded options were steady at 29,904 lots. The bulk of the interest was in
index options with the FT-SE 100 option trading 9,416 lots and the Euro
FT-SE 100 option showing good interest at 6,747.

FT  03 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak close after an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in the New York bond market, quickly reflected on Wall Street,
undermined equities in London yesterday and wiped out an early round of
share price gains. But City confidence rallied after the official close of
the market when the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin took a more positive
view of domestic inflation prospects than had been feared.
It was an erratic session, with the FT-SE 100 Index gaining nearly 12 points
initially after reports that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, was winning the political battle inside the Cabinet for cuts in
public spending; this would reduce the pressures for increased taxation in
this month's Budget, according to City pundits.
However, the early morning Footsie reading of 3,176.2 proved to be the day's
best, although a further advance was mounted later on the back of a sizeable
trading programme which ranged across the market.
All came to naught when the Dow, having closed at a new peak on Monday,
opened 20 points down, and the London market retreated into negative
territory.
After allowing for a mild rally in the final minutes, the FT-SE 100 finished
just a net 0.3 points off at 3,164.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a
broad range of second line stocks, gained 1.8 at 3,522.3, benefiting from
the effects of the trading programme from a leading UK securities house.
Publication of the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin came too late for equities, but
stock index futures turned higher in very late deals as traders considered
that the Bank's views on inflation provide underpinning for a base rate cut
before the end of the year.
Although UK market strategists agreed that it was the New York bond market
that unshipped London, several believed that the logic might prove
short-lived. US bonds have been leading equities ahead in New York and
Europe since August. But yesterday's data confirming growing recovery in the
US economy checked the US credit markets and raised fears for global
equities - fears immediately reflected in the Dow's fall.
However, economic recovery in the US is seen by many analysts as more
significant, as well as more positive, for global stock markets than any
fears over any revival of inflationary pressure in the US .
By the close, market traders sounded more positive than the readings on
market indices might have suggested. The Footsie has bounced successfully
from the 3,150 area once again and trading volume continues to indicate
underlying confidence.
Retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.09bn on Monday and Seaq
volume jumped by nearly 43 per cent to 664.4m shares yesterday.
On the domestic front, the 0.4 per cent gain in October M0 money supply was
in line with market expectations. Attention continued to focus on the
prospects for the UK Budget due at the end of the month, with suggestions of
changes in pension fund taxation dominating lunchtime converations in the
City of London.
Banking stocks again attracted strong support, and hints that a large
international deal was pending in the telecommunications industry kept
institutional dealers on the alert throughout the trading session.

FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow overcomes profit taking
to set new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER posting early losses on profit-taking and rising bond yields, US share
prices rallied on the back of strong cyclical stocks to end the day at or
close to record highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen to 3,667.46 by
mid-morning, finished a net 5.03 ahead at an all-time peak of 3,697.64. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.66 off at 468.44, while the
American SE composite gained 1.71 at a record 484.28 and the Nasdaq
composite was finally up 1.89 at 785.66. New York SE volume totalled 305m
shares.
After Monday's record-breaking gains, when confidence in the economic
outlook pushed blue chip stocks to new highs, investors took the opportunity
to book some profits early yesterday. At one stage the Dow was down 25
points.
Also adding pressure to stocks was another rise in bond market yields. As on
Monday, news of strengthening economic activity depressed bond prices, and
pushed up yields at the long end to almost 6.1 per cent. The trigger for the
selling was the report of a 20.8 per cent rise in September home sales. The
increase, the largest since 1986, was well ahead of forecasts. The day's
other news - a 0.5 per cent increase in September leading economic
indicators - was also bearish for bonds but bullish for stocks.
Consequently, after suffering sharp declines in early trading, equity prices
returned to positive territory later in the day, aided by strong demand for
economically sensitive stocks. Analysts said the rise in bond yields, while
worrying, had not been large or rapid enough to offset the positive
implications of recent economic data.
The Dow was helped by a strong advance by IBM. Following a delayed opening
due to an order imbalance, IBM moved ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 7/8
in volume of 10.2m shares after brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
raised its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'very attractive'.
Among firmer cyclical issues, forestry product stocks were especially strong
for the second consecutive day. Louisiana-Pacific jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 41 1/2 , Georgia-Pacific climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 68 and
International Paper added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 . Auto shares were
also in demand, with Ford up Dollars 1 at Dollars 63 3/4 and General Motors
ahead Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 49, both in heavy trading.
WorldCorp surged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 1/4 on news that Malaysian
Helicopter planned to buy a 24.9 per cent stake in the company for Dollars
27.4m.
On the Nasdaq market, Geotek Industries advanced Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 13
1/2 in volume of 5.3m shares after stating that several big investors,
including the influential money manager Mr George Soros, were investing
Dollars 40m in the company to build wireless telecommunications networks
overseas.
Canada
TORONTO ended steady after extremely heavy trading. The TSE 300 index edged
up 2.3 to 4,250.3 and rises led falls by 482 to 341. Volume came to 82.8m
shares valued at CDollars 703.7m.
Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher, led by paper and real estate,
which rose 2.04 and 1.50 per cent respectively.

FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Action in drugs sector as Bombay waits
for a wind - A market currently in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When world markets dropped early last year, the Bombay Stock Exchange was at
the crest of a wave. But now, with global markets in buoyant form, and
feverish excitement in the Pacific Basin further east, India is in the
dumps.
The process of integrating India with the world economy has begun in
earnest, but the local stock market still moves in its own orbit,
unconcerned with world developments.
Bombay's bourse, India's largest, has been haunted for some time by the
controversy surrounding Mr Harshad Mehta, the key broker in India's Rs40bn
securities market scandal; it has current political fears, with Kashmiri
terrorists holed up in a Srinagar mosque under siege by the army.
It is two weeks since brokers concluded a four-day trading strike which shut
down the bourse after a judge delayed settlement of a dispute over shares
seized by tax authorities investigating the securities scandal. Since that
time, the market has looked unhappy.
Traders fear further interruptions in trading. The income tax department has
vowed to track down Mehta-owned shares sold on the market with the
connivance of some fellow brokers.
Meanwhile, the BSE index, which closed at 2,720.29 in a special trading
session on October 19 following the resolution of the brokers' strike,
dropped a further 52.46, or 2 per cent, to 2,621.28 on Monday, and stayed
flat yesterday amid a general lack of interest.
There have been bright spots. Pharmaceutical companies, especially
transnationals, have stood their ground after impressive gains over the past
three months: Abbott Laboratories jumped by two-thirds to Rs200 between
August and October, Boehringer Mannheim by nearly one half to Rs130 and E
Merck by a third to Rs115. Glaxo India was up to Rs293.50, from Rs230 at the
end of July.
According to James Capel, investors have taken a fancy to foreign company
shares. The market perceives that foreign companies have access to high
technology, resources and efficient management.
There are more specific reasons for the drug industry enthusiasm. Traders
have driven up share prices, expecting major changes in the draconian drug
price policy that stifled profitability and growth of foreign companies over
the past two decades; in addition, says Capel, there is a feeling that India
will join the Paris convention on patents. That would eliminate competition
from cheap imitations.
However, there are warning signals, of which Roche India is an example. This
year it peaked at Rs170, with a p/e of more than 40, and brokers said this
was a high price for a company which returned to black only last year, and
paid its first dividend in five years.
The bubble burst at the weekend when news leaked to the press that the
company's Swiss parent was less optimistic than Indian share traders on
Indian government drug policies - and sold its subsidiary to a local
businessman.
Carmakers have also attracted the traders' attention. Favourable comments by
General Motors on the Indian car industry boosted the Calcutta-based
Hindustan Motors, although it passed the dividend last year; and the
recession-hit Tata Engineering, the largest truck producing company, jumped
to Rs270 from Rs240 after Mercedes Benz hinted at a joint venture with Tata.
The broad market will have to reckon with the fallout from a special
parliamentary committee report on the securities scandal, due next month.
This could make it difficult to mount a major rally in the immediate future.
The fundamentals are more encouraging for the medium term. They include a
good monsoon, strong foreign exchange reserves (Dollars 8bn), good
half-yearly corporate results and the prospect of an IMF agreement to a
medium-term financing programme.
Lehman Brothers, in London, notes that the market has declined by some 40
per cent in local currency terms from its April 1992 'scam-induced' peak of
4,547. However, it likes India's sheer size, its growing middle class
population, its well developed local equity culture, its huge pool of cheap
skilled labour and the significant pool of non-resident Indian money.
Lehman, too, thinks that it is too early for a rally; but it says that this
is a good time to start building up Indian exposure to at least a neutral
weight position, to benefit from a possible pre-budget bull run towards the
end of 1993.

FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler fails to put brake on
Dax rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was the story of the day, but some other markets dropped back on
individual news, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had a phenomenal session, a surge of 33.46 in the DAX index to
2,095.58 taking its gain to nearly 36 per cent on the year so far, turnover
soaring from DM4.1bn to DM11.1bn and the Ibis-indicated DAX breaking 2,100
at one point in the afternoon before edging back to 2,086.40 at the
post-bourse close.
Mr Bernd Pinnicke, equity analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, forecast that
the DAX would rise to between 2,400 and 2,500 in the next three to six
months. Liquidity from abroad was still flowing in and many domestic
investors, he said, were still underinvested in equities.
The fundamental news was not good. Daimler indicated that it might be
considering a reduction in its 1993 dividend and this merely cost it a below
par share price rise of DM4.50 to DM752. Mr Harry Jaarsma, of Dresdner Bank
in Frankfurt, observed that the DB Research forecasts would put the market
on a prospective 1994 p/e of between 22.6 and 23.6.
Mr Jaarsma noted outperformance among second liners like AEG, up DM7.30 to
DM174.50 for a two-day gain of DM11.50, and among engineers where Linde rose
DM34 to DM874 and Mannesmann by DM10.90 to DM354.20.
PARIS drifted lower and the CAC-40 index settled just above the day's low,
down 12.24 at 2,169.71.
BZW's European equity strategists have recently upgraded their weighting in
France to overweight, arguing that the market's recent underperformance 'has
been driven by a deterioration of relative sentiment rather than
fundamentals'.
This positive attitude was echoed by Kleinwort Benson's research team.
Maintaining an overweight position in France against Germany, they suggested
that when the switch into equities does come - probably triggered by a
further easing in interest rates - it will be domestically driven and
therefore less vulnerable to US profit-taking.
Peugeot slipped FFr8 to FFr646 ahead of reporting an 8.5 per cent fall in
third quarter turnover.
STOCKHOLM declined on worries over Volvo's proposed merger with Renault of
France and a downgrade by Morgan Stanley of Astra, the pharmaceutical
company. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 11.9 to 1,425.9.
Volvo closed off SKr14 to SKr427 as it announced a one month postponment of
a shareholders meeting to discuss the merger proposals.
Astra lost SKr8 to SKr163 on the downgrade. Mr James McKean, pharmaceuticals
analyst at Morgan Stanley, reduced his estimate for earnings growth to 20
per cent from 25 per cent given 'the more difficult environment for
healthcare companies in the 1990s.'
MILAN focused attention on developments involving Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the
Olivetti chairman, and the Comit index eased 3.66 to 579.75, also reflecting
political concerns after the budget minister warned that the government's
proposals might not win parliamentary approval before the year-end deadline.
Olivetti was marked down 4.8 per cent before paring the loss to finish L49
or 2.7 per cent lower at L1,752 as the chairman surrendered to police in
response to an arrest warrant issued by Rome magistrates, investigating
alleged corruption.
ZURICH remained in record territory, with the firm dollar and interest rate
outlook again providing the conditions for a 15.8 rise in the SMI index to
2,742.9.
Winterthur bearers added SFr31 to SFr849 as the insurer forecast higher
profits in 1993. The positive tone helped Zurich Insurance, up SFr29 to
SFr1,387 and Swiss Re, up SFr50 to SFr3,820.
AMSTERDAM remained on the upward track with the CBS Tendency index adding a
further 1.3 to 137.7, although off the day's high of 138.5. VNU was a strong
riser in low volume, adding Fl 5.50 to Fl 154.00.
BRUSSELS recorded a new year's high with a substantial amount of foreign
buying being seen. The Bel-20 index rose 4.32 to 1,385.70 in turnover of
some BFr1.9bn.
MADRID's US quoted stocks reflected mid-morning weakness on Wall Street,
Repsol falling Pta40 to Pta3,995 as the general index closed 1.03 lower at
307.17.
ATHENS lost a further 1.6 per cent after Monday's decline of 1.5 per cent as
many investors continued to take profits. The general index fell 13.42 to
807.37. ISTANBUL settled down 1.9 per cent on fears that the coalition might
split. The composite index tumbled 267.1 to 13,668.1.

record-breaking run

SHARE prices edged down on position squaring ahead of today's national
holiday and the Nikkei average ended marginally lower on arbitrage-related
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 57.00 at 19,381.24 after registering a day's low of
19,342.03 and high of 19,549.15. The focus of attention was once again East
Japan Railway, which finished Y3,000 firmer at Y495,000, after moving
between Y491,000 and Y501,000.
Volume remained low, at 210m shares against 197m, and falls led rises by 518
to 438, with 199 issues unchanged, although the Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 2.12 at 1,621.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
gained 1.13 at 1,288.99.
The market remained generally resilient to news of the financial crisis at
Muramoto Construction, an unlisted contractor, which filed for court
protection on Monday with debts of Y590bn.
Daiwa Bank, Muramoto Construction's leading creditor, declined Y50 to
Y1,180. However, elsewhere in the banking sector, Sakura Bank rose Y10 to
Y1,700 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y2,360. Real estate and construction companies
were also lower, with Mitsui Fudosan down Y20 to Y1,290, Shimizu falling Y15
to Y853 and Sato Kogyo off Y10 at Y760.
Sumitomo Metal Mining retreated Y6 to Y830 after weak interim earnings on
Monday, and as margin traders, who had bought the stock six months earlier
on rising gold prices, liquidated holdings.
The rise in JR East helped other railway issues, Seibu Railway improving
Y150 to Y3,900.
Consumer electronics stocks were higher on bargain hunting. Matsushita
Electric Industrial firmed Y10 to Y1,470 and Sony Y10 to Y4,970. Toyota
Motor, which rose on foreign buying on Monday, shed Y30 to Y1,870 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 21.34 to 21,489.77 in volume of 12m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets continued their record-setting ways. Manila was closed.
HONG KONG again set a record closing peak, although late profit-taking had
wiped out much of the day's gain. The Hang Seng index was finally 13.72
ahead at 9,642.91, after reaching 9,716.38.
Profit-takers began the day by dragging the index down 68 points before
major buyers regained the upper hand, although buying slowed as the index
topped the 9,700 level.
Second and third liners led the active list: they were sought by retail
investors who have been trying to avoid expensive blue chips.
SINGAPORE picked up late in the day, taking the Straits Times Industrial
index 18.17 higher to a record 2,123.85. The newly listed Singapore Telecom
eased 14 cents to SDollars 4.00.
BANGKOK added another 2.4 per cent, with the banking sector selected by
investors. The SET index rose 31.59 to 1,357.75 in turnover of Bt26.7bn.
Among the actives, Thai Farmers Bank gained Bt7 at Bt117 and Bangkok Bank
Bt10 at Bt182.
NEW ZEALAND remained firm following good half-year results from Telecom,
which rose to an all-time high of NZDollars 4.69 immediately after the
announcement, but then fell back to NZDollars 4.57, down 3 cents on the day.
The NZSE-40 index closed at a four-year peak of 2,203.09, up 3.59 points, in
turnover of NZDollars 56.7m.
AUSTRALIA retreated for the first time since October 25, with the All
Ordinaries index losing 7.1 to 2,125.3. Turnover was ADollars 337.05m. A
weaker bullion price contributed to the change of sentiment and the golds
index fell 36.0 to 2,173.6.
Foster's Brewing, the day's most active stock, added 6 cents at ADollars
1.54, while BHP lost 6 cents to ADollars 17.80 and Western Mining 10 cents
to ADollars 5.46.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but trading was subdued due to investor caution
and trading restrictions by some stockbroking firms. The composite index
advanced 5.31 to 972.36.
Malaysian Airline System gained MDollars 1.30 at MDollars 7.55 amid
speculation that the government planned to place shares it holds in the
group. Malaysian International Shipping, in which the government also has a
stake, rose 55 cents to MDollars 7.20.
SEOUL finished lower as sales by institutions of issues with low
price-to-book ratios won a tug-of-war with buyers of blue chips in the
manufacturing sector. The composite index shed 2.34 to 759.42 in turnover of
Won941.48bn.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar gains at DM's expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING economic data from the US gave a lift to the dollar, which
recorded a significant rise against the D-Mark yesterday. The German
currency was also weak against several European currencies, particularly
sterling, which consolidated above DM2.50, writes Peter John.
The dollar tried to move higher in Tokyo trading but ended steady against
the yen and D-Mark after late profit-taking, apparently by Japanese life
insurers.
Then at the start of European dealing, the German Bundesbank announced that
today's securities repurchase operations would be carried out at a variable
rate. This gave hope that the repo would fall from its current 6.40 per cent
to around 6.35 per cent.
Belief that Germany will continue to cut rates was given additional impetus
by figures showing German industrial output was still very weak.
Switching from the D-Mark to the dollar pushed the US currency above DM1.70.
It slipped at midday, but when the US markets opened, figures were released
showing a surge in home sales and it moved higher again.
Ms Francoise Skelley of Credit Suisse said charts of recent buying trends
showed that the dollar was now well supported at DM1.6850 and DM1.6920,
while DM1.70 and DM1.7250 were resistance levels on the way up.
The dollar finished at DM1.6945, up from DM1.6935. Against the pound it
eased to Dollars 1.4825 from Dollars 1.4810, and against the yen it slipped
to Y107.50 from a previous Y108.20. At the close of New York trading the
dollar stood at DM1.7032 and Y107.75, with sterling at Dollars 1.4735.
Meanwhile, a weaker D-Mark was most strikingly reflected by the relative
strength of the pound. Sterling continued to build on its rise at the start
of the week as the argument against an early cut in interest rates
developed.
Previous statements by Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England,
and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to dampen speculation that the
base rate is set to fall. Yesterday's Bank of England inflation report did
little to support the case for a near-term cut in base rate.
Sterling reached a high of DM2.5157 in the afternoon before settling at
DM2.5125, up from DM 2.5075. Foreign exchange dealers now consider it can
quite easily rise as high as DM2.54 before there is any strong desire to
switch funds.
The D-Mark also declined against the Danish krone, falling below DKr4.0 to
close at DKr3.9990 from DKr4.0209. It slid against the Italian lira to
L967.40 from L975.30, with technical analysts saying it could reach L960
soon.
The German currency was easier against the French franc as Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the French finance minister, reaffirmed France's policy to
maintain a strong currency. In contrast, it gained against the Swiss franc
to finish at SFr1.299, up from SFr1.287.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bank dealings smooth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERBANK operations in the UK proceeded very smoothly, with the liquidity
shortage largely taken out at the earliest opportunity, writes Peter John.
This was in contrast to Monday when most of the shortage remained
outstanding until the end of the day. And the ease of yesterday's dealing
prompted suggestions that the Bank of England might have exerted its
influence by persuading some of the clearing banks to part with bills.
The Bank of England offered the money market an early round of assistance
after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.9bn, which was
later revised up to Pounds 2.1bn.
Among factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury Bills and
paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 1.35bn from the
system, bills for repurchase by the market which took out Pounds 743m and
Exchequer transactions which removed Pounds 55m. Offsetting these, a fall in
note circulation added Pounds 115m and bankers' balances above target
contributed Pounds 150m.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 1.65bn of early assistance, buying bills
for resale to the market on November 22 at 5 29/32 per cent, and gave an
additional Pounds 125m in the morning. This was followed by a further Pounds
198m of assistance in the afternoon, bringing total help for the day to
Pounds 1.973bn.
Short sterling took no cue from money supply figures which added to evidence
that consumer spending is driving economic recovery in the UK. The rise in
M0 - cash in circulation - to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year
to October was very much as expected and most dealers were waiting for the
Bank of England's quarterly bulletin later in the day.
The futures contract for December traded within a tight range and was two
basis points higher at 94.44 at the official close, but fell back later.
Euromark futures were firmer as an announcement that the Bundesbank's repo
today would be at a variable rate gave hope that it would fall slightly from
its current 6.40 per cent. That hope was further encouraged by German
industrial output data which showed that the economy was still very weak.
The Euromark contract for December hit a high of 93.87 before ending two
basis points up at 93.82.
The French short-term interest rate contract settled two basis points lower
at 93.60.

COCOA and coffee futures and options had another active month on the London
Commodity Exchange last month, lifting trading volumes 30 per cent compared
with a year ago.
The cocoa futures market, where average daily turnover was 8,226 lots, up 51
per cent on October 1992. Open interest - the number of contracts not
liquidated - was up 74 per cent at 149,589 lots.
Total options turnover rose 83 per cent, with particular interest in cocoa
options, up 187 per cent, and robusta coffee options (69 per cent), though
trading in robusta futures was down 20 per cent on a year ago.
Volumes overall were 24 per cent down on September.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Attacks on Agip halt oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGIP'S Nigerian oil operation has lost more than 270,000 barrels of
production since October 22, when attacks by local communities forced the
company to close its Obama and Clough Creek flow stations.
Agip says the violence stems from mishandling of compensation for the local
communities by a development commission set up by the Nigerian government.
The company has asked the oil minister, Mr Don Etiebet, to take action over
this and other disputes in Rivers state, Nigeria's main oil-producing
region.
'We need to make the government aware,' a company spokesman said. He said
some of the local communities' demands for compensation 'bear on revenue
allocation yet the commission has no programme which is binding'.
Agip operates five oil fields in the Niger delta, producing on average
150,000 barrels a day. It owns 20 per cent of the venture, along with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (60 per cent) and Philips Petroleum,
and plans to open a new 20,000 b/d field next year.
The trouble at Obama started when the development commission awarded money
from Agip, which was intended for the chief of the community, to a former
official of the government. The money was to compensate for pollution of the
water through dredging the local swamp.
Although Agip provided water and electricity for the area, villagers loyal
to the chief marched on the flow station, forcing Agip to close it with the
loss of 205,000 barrels by Monday. When a negotiation team arrived by
helicopter, the pilot was attacked and badly injured.
The dispute at Clough Creek is also over demands from rival communities.
When Agip built a school for the local village another community demanded a
health centre. The threat to oil workers led to a loss of production of
about 73,000 barrels last week.
Police were handling the dispute yesterday and Agip expected to resume
operations within 24 hours.
However, the company said there had been 'some agitation' at the Tebibada
flow station, but no loss of production. There had also been 'numerous
problems' at the Obrikom-Obiafu gas re-injection plant.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc producers plan smelter
closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN ZINC producers decided yesterday to press ahead rapidly with a
scheme to eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent closure of
one or two smelters. The cost of the so-called 'shut-down' scheme would be
paid for by the rest of the industry.
An independent assessor has been taking soundings during confidential
discussions with industry representatives for the past three months, and his
report, presented to senior executives yesterday, showed that the scheme was
feasible and that there were a number of smelters willing to be considered
for closure.
'This is a very serious project now,' one industry executive said after the
meeting in Brussels. The producers will now work on the difficult details -
how much capacity should be closed, how much it would cost and how the rest
of the industry would contribute towards the cost.
They must also get European Commission approval, but this should not prove
difficult because the Commission gave the go-ahead to a similar scheme in
1982. That scheme came to nothing because prices rose, easing pressure for
cuts.
However, last year Union Miniere, on its own account, closed its zinc
smelter at Overpelt, Belgium, and with it 100,000 tonnes of capacity.
Some zinc traders hoped to hear something more dramatic from the European
producers yesterday so, after touching Dollars 961 a tonne at one stage,
zinc for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange eased back to
close last night at Dollars 951, up Dollars 2.50 a tonne.
'The market was holding its breath and anticipating some sort of cutback
now, not more talks,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
He said a fundamental refined zinc supply surplus, likely to be about
420,000 tonnes this year, was putting severe pressure on prices, which
reached a six-year low of Dollars 927 a tonne in July. The closure of only
one smelter might not be enough to bring the market back into balance.
While European producers seem unified over the shutdown scheme, they are
split over whether to restrict imports from the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which are adding to the industry's severe difficulties.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria's burden of proof -
Arrests have been made but the state oil business has still to satisfy the
industry that its reforms are working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE interim government's purge of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) has stopped some of the racketeering that became rife
during former president Ibrahim Babangida's regime - but it will take more
than a few arrests to convince the oil industry that a reform of the public
sector oil business is under way.
After the discovery of unauthorised payments to store fuel in tankers
offshore, NNPC's managing director, Mr Edmund Daukoru, finance director Mr
O. Okwara, and company secretary Dr Beneni Briggs were arrested last month.
Mr Daukoru, Mr Okwara and five other senior officials were formally charged
yesterday with stealing Dollars 41m. About 20 senior officials in NNPC have
been suspended.
The plan to charter two very large vessels for storing about 1m tonnes of
fuel through Lenoil, an independent oil and marketing company, was approved
by Mr Chu Okongwu, who was oil minister in 1992. Although each ship was
costing Nigeria an estimated Dollars 49,000 a day, the so-called strategic
reserve never supplied any fuel.
Nigeria has adequate storage capacity on shore but its fuel shortages stem
from large-scale smuggling, and crumbling refineries and distribution
systems run by subsidiaries of NNPC.
Mr Philip Asiodu, who became oil minister in January this year, rejected the
chartering scheme and ordered instead the purchase of smaller tankers
secondhand, also through Lenoil. Although Mr Asiodu blocked a demand by
Lenoil for Dollars 62m, it is alleged that most of the payment went through
shortly after he left office in August, leading to the arrest of the NNPC
directors.
Mr Len Adesanya, managing director of Lenoil, was also arrested. Mr Adesanya
was to be in the new management following the takeover of Texaco Nigeria in
July. The deal was opposed by the minority Nigerian shareholders, who allege
that the buyer, TNP Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands, was
funded indirectly by the military regime. The takeover is under
investigation by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission.
Industry analysts say that close links between Mr Adesanya's operations and
Mr Babangida's military regime went right to the top and that Lenoil was one
of the two main operators in the smuggling of about 100,000 barrels a day of
fuel.
Since Mr Don Etiebet took over as petroleum minister in late August, the
boards of NNPC and its refining and marketing subsidiaries have been
dissolved, and the axe has fallen on several other deals agreed by his
predecessor. Mr Etiebet has cancelled all the crude oil lifting contracts
signed by Mr Asiodu. Mr Etiebet said the contracts were to be renegotiated
because 'people are hawking crude oil . . . we want to know the exact number
of people who are lifting and whether they comply with our objectives'.
Mr Etiebet has invited new applications to buy Nigerian crude oil from
companies established internationally as traders or refiners of oil products
or which are investing in upstream exploration in Nigeria. The minister has
also invited tenders to supply fuel from internationally recognised
companies.
The minister has cancelled 16 oil exploration licences awarded by Mr Asiodu
to indigenous prospecting companies. According to industry sources, the
approvals were rushed through without the normal procedures and many of the
licencees do not have the technology or resources to carry out exploration.
NNPC's acting managing director is reviewing the sale of an extra 5 per cent
stake in an oil production venture to one of its equity partners, Elf
Aquitaine, for around Dollars 520m.
The joint venture is operated by Shell and produces half of Nigeria's 1.8m
b/d oil output. July's sale to Elf broke the 40 per cent limit on foreign
ownership in oil joint ventures.
The private sector in Nigeria and international creditors would like to see
the shake-up in NNPC go further. Recommendations by an economic conference
chaired by Mr Ernest Shonekan in February, which included a reduction in
state control of the oil and gas industry, have not been implemented.
In a follow-up to that conference today the private sector will press for
the measures to be passed in the January budget. The budget monitoring
committee set up by Mr Shonekan to review government spending under the
Babangida regime has submitted the report. The document is highly critical
of dedication accounts that diverted about 110,000 barrels of oil from
central revenue into offshore accounts.
Mr Shonekan has made transparency in government revenue one of his
government's main target, but he has yet to show that he can bring oil
revenue under control.

News that OPEC cut crude OIL output in October failed to drive prices higher
yesterday. London December futures for the world benchmark Brent Blend crude
briefly fell below Dollars 15.90 per barrel, down 30 cents from Monday when
the market tried a rally. A Reuter monthly survey of industry estimates put
October production by OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries) at 24.67m barrels daily. This was down 140,000 from the Reuter
estimate for September and 450,000 lower than a year ago - when prices were
Dollars 4.0 higher. If OPEC has curbed excess supply, however, demand for
oil has remained stubbornly weak in a recessionary world economy and this
was cited as the other reason for the decline of 20 per cent in world oil
prices this year. OPEC leaders, however, believe that prices are poised to
head higher. GOLD attempted a tentative recovery after the sharp fall, lead
by silver, on Monday. But after being 'fixed' at Dollars 363 a troy ounce in
the afternoon, gold closed in London last night down another Dollars 1.75 an
ounce at Dollars 361. Silver closed another 3.5 cents down.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian freight tariffs up 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has raised rail freight tariffs by 50 per cent for oil, metals, coal
and other goods transported within the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) but export cargoes will not have to pay the higher fees, reports
Reuter from Moscow.
A ministry telegram obtained yesterday said the state pricing committee
decided on October 20 to raise tariffs within the CIS (including Georgia and
Azerbaijan).
But the increase did not apply to cargoes destined for export to non-CIS
markets 'through Russian railway stations located near ports or state
frontiers'.
The telegram, dated October 19, said freight charges would be based on
tariffs set in 1989 multiplied by 2,463 for wagon and container dispatches,
and by 4,922 for smaller deliveries.
With the exception of export cargoes, 20 per cent value added tax will be
maintained for all goods, the telegram said.
It was not clear if the new fees will also apply to imports, including metal
ores and concentrates brought to Russia for tolling - refining the metal in
Russia and selling it to export markets.
Many companies complain high rail tariffs, taxes and other costs are making
trade unprofitable.
Trade sources say there have been rumours of a further rise in freight
tariffs by 15 or 20 per cent this month.
One official source said there would probably not be any increases, at least
until December.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex energy futures system in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCESS, the electronic system for dealing energy futures developed by the
New York Mercantile Exchange, will go live in London tomorrow.
There are already 100 Access screens in the US, but the 10 screens in London
will be the first outside Nymex's domestic market. Nymex officials said 70
traders in London had been trained to use the screens, which operate outside
normal Nymex trading hours. The next stage is to install screens in the Far
East.
Average daily volume on Access reached 2,000 contracts in October, ahead of
targets.
According to dealers, the success of the system is partly due to the global
nature of the oil market. Oil futures can used by oil producers, and
companies which need to buy large quantities of oil, to hedge their exposure
to price changes.
Six leading brokerage houses have taken screens, which will give access to a
pool of around 100-150 accounts each, a Nymex official said. One of the
London screens has been taken by Mobil, reflecting interest among commercial
companies, as well as brokers.
Dealers said the arrival of Access screens was likely to boost volume on
London's International Petroleum Exchange, since it will allow dealers to
trade the spread between the IPE's Brent and Nymex's WTI (West Texas
Intermediate) contracts during the whole of the London trading day.
Currently, traders cannot do this until Nymex opens at 9.45 local New York
time.
Chevron Corporation of the US has been awarded exploration rights for a
1,820 square kilometre bloc in the East China Sea under an agreement signed
at the weekend with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Recruitment: How living costs vary worldwide - Survey shows
that at least 40 other cities rank ahead of London in expensiveness league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST the multitudinous globetrotters among the FT's readership can cease
tapping their hooves impatiently, not to mention telephoning to demand
'where is it?' What they've been waiting for is in the table down to the
right: the latest indicators of international living costs as calculated by
the P-E International consultancy.
The reason why they are appearing two months later than usual is that the
consultancy has expanded its regular survey to include far more than basic
cost data. To compensate for the delay, however, it is allowing the Jobs
column not only to print extracts from the study several days ahead of
official publication, but to give figures for 75 different places around the
world instead of 60 as before.
That is still barely more than half the number, 143 cities in 118 countries,
covered by the study. Anyone wanting information on other places should
contact Joanna Pawulska-Saunders of P-E's centre for management research at
Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel (0)784 43441, fax (0)784
437828. The price of the report is Pounds 500.
My table gives three figures for each of the cities included. The first is
an indication of the local cost of a 'basket' of goods and services
typically bought by executives, and represented by an index based on London
prices at 100. Next comes the most recent official rate of inflation to hand
when the data were compiled. The third - the exchange rate at which the
other currencies have been converted to sterling - will strike most readers
as having an antique and in some cases nostalgic look. After all, 172.75 yen
and even 1.52 US dollars are appreciably more than Pounds 1 will buy now.
The explanation is that the rates of exchange given in the table are those
which prevailed on the date when the original information on price levels
was collated: to wit, April 5. And my excuse for refraining from adjusting
them is not just pressure of work, but also a foreboding based on past
experience that, had I done so, something would have happened to change them
all again in hours. For instance, the appearance of the indicators three
years ago co-incided with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and my update of them
the following January with the onset of the Gulf war.
Besides, although the cost-index figures in the table reflect the April
exchange rates, there is a simple way of adjusting the indices in line with
changes in currency values. Except in countries with soaring inflation, of
course, the prices of the sorts of goods and services covered by the survey
change only slowly. So the basic cost data collected last spring should in
most cases remain a tolerable guide to reality until at least the end of the
year.
To compensate for currency-market movements in the meantime, all that is
needed is a two-step calculation. First take the exchange rate given in the
table, and divide it by the rate currently in force. Then multiply the
result by the table's index figure and, hey presto, you are up to date.
As an example, since the yen rate was down from 172.75 to 160.25 last Monday
night, Tokyo's index was up from 179.8 to 193.8, and Osaka's from 172.1 to
185.5. So whereas the difference between them from the Brits' angle was
previously 7.7 points, it is now 8.3 - the same as the gap between London's
100 and the 91.7 of Birmingham, which is included in the study for the first
time.
Another innovation is that the latest report provides some compensation for
a weakness affecting all surveys of world living expenses that I have come
across to date. It is that, because of the difficulty in devising an
internationally consistent yardstick of housing costs, the surveys take no
account of that important outlay at all.
While the same remains true of the indices I've printed, P-E has joined with
the Hamptons Relocation consultancy - which operates world-wide from its
base in Swindon - to give information on accommodation costs in 46 cities.
Here is a sample, showing the typical range of monthly rents apparently
charged for an unfurnished three-bedroom apartment (prices in sterling at
the exchange rates of April 5):

FT  03 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Weak Treasuries hit European sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKNESS of the US Treasuries market continued to dampen sentiment in
Europe's government bond markets yesterday.
In these unfavourable conditions, German bunds strongly outperformed other
continental European markets, with the Bundesbank opening the way for
further easing of market interest rates by announcing that today's auction
of 13-day securities repurchase agreements will be at variable rates. Weak
industrial production data also underpinned hopes that there could still be
room for easing.
'The bund market tends to hold on to its value better, when there is
uncertainty,' said Mr Adrian James, a bond analyst at NatWest Capital
Markets.
BOND markets in France, Spain and Italy, which were closed on Monday for All
Saints' Day, all fell yesterday, with Italy recording the sharpest decline
of about a point, which dealers attributed partly to political worries.
The Italian Treasury's latest issue of L4,500bn 10-year BTP notes were sold
at a gross yield of 9.16 per cent, up from 8.88 per cent at the previous
auction of 10-year notes on October 1.
Spain and Italy are 'the markets where investors have the the most to lose,
having notched up very high returns this year. It makes sense to get out of
the market, or move to the short end,' said one trader. Because these
markets are more volatile, they typically lose considerable ground when
traders become bearish.
The French bond market also struggled yesterday, losing half a point while
bunds posted a slight gain. This caused a further widening of the 10-year
yield spread between French and German bonds to 22 basis points, compared
with 14 basis points on Friday and about 5 basis points a week ago.
IN LONDON, gilts closed slightly higher after partially retracing earlier
gains. Details of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report were
released too late to have much impact on prices, but traders said that the
market may react negatively today, as the Bank's worsening inflation outlook
is bearish for the bond market.
The report said that the Bank of England's near-term inflation expectations
have risen and there is a 'slight possibility' that underlying inflation
could climb above 4 per cent next year, breaching the government's official
target range.
US Treasury securities continued to slide at both ends of the market
yesterday as investors reacted badly to news of stronger home sales.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at 102
15/32 , yielding 6.064 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 15/32 , to yield 4.139 per cent.
Recent evidence that the economy is picking up steam has put the bond market
on the defensive, and for the second consecutive day prices eased in the
wake of fresh economic data. The trigger for the selling was the much
bigger-than-expected 20.8 per cent surge in September home sales, the
biggest monthly increase since September 1986.
Although analysts said the big rise in sales was primarily due to one-off
seasonal factors, the number deepened concern among retail investors that
accelerating economic growth could drag interest rates higher and eventually
lead to a revival of inflation. At one stage the long bond was down a full
point, but short covering helped bring the market back from its session
lows.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling offer from British Land
finds favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME in the international bond market picked up yesterday as British Land
launched its widely-expected Eurosterling offering.
The commercial property group raised Pounds 150m through an offering of
30-year Eurobonds. The relatively generous yield spread on the unsecured
bonds ensured a favourable reception with investors. The bonds were priced
to yield 180 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent UK government bond due
2017.
Lead manager SG Warburg said that following this issue, the average maturity
of British Land's outstanding debt would exceed 20 years. Only a few years
ago, 70 per cent of the company's debt had a maturity of less than five
years.
The bonds, which were mainly placed with UK investors, had a fixed re-offer
price of 98.843. When they were freed to trade they eased to 98.69 bid, in
line with the weakness in the underlying UK government bond market. However,
the spread on the bonds narrowed to 178 basis points.
The Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia is expected to make its debut in
the international bond market today with a FFr1bn offering of 10-year
Eurobonds. Catalonia's Eurobonds, via CCF, are likely to be priced to yield
30 to 35 basis points over the underlying French government OATs.
By contrast, the forthcoming FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds from the
Spanish region of Andalucia is expected to have a yield spread of around 35
basis points.
Depfa, the German mortgage bank, is expected to achieve a yield spread of 20
to 25 basis points when it raises between FFr2bn and FFr3bn through an
offering of 10-year Eurobonds.
Catalonia's issue is the result of the region's decision to open new
channels for financing its debt. The region plans to fund up to a quarter of
its annual borrowing needs in foreign bond markets from next year.
The region also plans to raise Pta25bn before the end of the year in the
domestic Spanish market. The domestic issue and the Eurobond issue will
complete the region's 1993 borrowing programme of Pta93bn. Catalonia plans
to raise a similar amount next year.
Catalonia, which has a credit rating of Aa2 from Moody's, has chosen French
francs for its first Eurobond offering because of the low volatility between
the franc and the peseta. Between 30 to 50 per cent of the proceeds of the
forthcoming Eurobond issue will be swapped into pesetas.
In the Eurodollar sector, the Kingdom of Sweden increased its recent global
offering of floating rate notes by Dollars 500m to Dollars 1.5bn as
investors sought protection against the volatility in the US Treasury
market.
In the domestic sterling bond market, NatWest Capital Markets brought a
Pounds 125m issue of debenture stock due 2018 for Halos, a new special
purpose vehicle consisting of 10 housing associations. NatWest said that the
introduction of covenants relating to capital and income gearing and its
agreement to provide a 25-year loan facility representing 5 per cent of the
nominal stock were designed to meet any investor concerns about the long
maturity of the issue.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Futures trade in Europe beats
records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPANSION of European futures trading shows no sign of abating, with
Europe's leading futures exchanges continuing to set new volume records.
Both Liffe in London and the Matif in Paris, Europe's two largest futures
exchanges, have already traded more contracts than for the whole of last
year. Liffe traded nearly 83m contracts in the first 10 months of 1993,
compared with around 72m for 1992 as a whole. The Matif, meanwhile, has
traded more than 60m contracts so far, compared with 55m last year.
Last month, Liffe traded more than 10m contracts in a single month for the
first time, and open interest reached a record level of more than 4m
contracts. While the two largest US exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, continue to dominate the market,
European exchanges are narrowing the gap.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Efim bank creditors set for
repayments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK creditors to Efim, the Italian state holding company put into voluntary
liquidation in July 1992, may be on the brink of receiving their first
repayments.
A first tranche of more than L2,170bn should be paid shortly following the
signature in late October of a special decree by Mr Piero Barucci, treasury
minister.
The repayment will be made in the form of government bonds. The five-year
government bonds being paid to creditors will carry a coupon of 6.20 per
cent.
Once necessary bureaucratic procedures are completed, between L1,450bn and
L1,500bn will be reimbursed to around 20 Italian creditor banks.
Separately, Banca Commerciale Italiana, the bank which is to move from state
control into the private sector and which is an agent for Efim, will receive
about L700bn for on-payment to non-bank creditors.
The first of Efim's major repayments still leaves most foreign bank
creditors in the cold, however.
Last month, a separate treasury decree authorised preliminary payments of
L225bn, also in the form of government bonds, to a number of domestic and
foreign banks. However, the bulk of Efim's foreign bank creditors are
awaiting reimbursement of their loans, which are due to be repaid in a
variety of foreign currencies rather than lira bonds.
The latest decree opens the door to the first big reimbursement of creditors
since Efim went into liquidation.
In spite of the repeated promise of speedy repayment by Efim, reimbursements
have been bogged down by bureaucratic problems, notably the tussle between
the Italian government and the European commission in Brussels over alleged
illegal state aid.

Rodman
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANACO Casa de Bolsa, the Mexican securities firm, has ended a year-long
debate over the future of Chicago-based regional brokerage firm Rodman &amp;
Renshaw Capital by agreeing to buy a majority interest in Rodman for around
Dollars 23m.
Analysts said that if the purchase cleared regulatory review, it would be
the first time that a Mexican financial company has acquired control of a US
securities firm.
Rodman is the only remaining publicly-traded securities firm in Chicago. It
began seeking buyers in September and had been expected to accept an offer
from the New York investment company Josephthal, Lyon, and Ross.
Abaco's bid, at Dollars 10.50 per share for 51 per cent of Rodman's 4.3m
outstanding common shares, is understood to be about Dollars 1 above the
Josephthal bid.
The purchase will give Abaco, the brokerage arm of Monterey-based financial
services company Abaco Grupo Financiero, an unusual presence in the US. It
has an office in New York.
Rodman has 500 employees.

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the US bank due to open a fully-owned subsidiary in Moscow early
in 1994, sees a big potential in Russia's fledgling Treasury bill trade,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
'We believe there is potential for this market to grow and become very big.
As soon as we open we will be registered as a government securities dealer,'
said Mr Miljenko Horvat, who heads Citicorp's Moscow operation.
'We are very interested in seeing the securities market develop in Russia.
The T-bills give our clients with rouble balances an investment
opportunity,' he said.
Bankers say the accounts of foreign multinationals in Russia, many of which
have to fly in cash to fund operations in the absence of western-style
banking services, are up for grabs for western newcomers to the Russian
banking scene.
In the absence of competition, Russian banks are charging commissions of up
to 5 per cent per deal.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese oil refiners hit by
decline in prices

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REVENUES at Japan's leading oil refiners and distributors were hit by a fall
in demand due to the stagnant economy, and a fall in prices.
Cosmo Oil, a leading oil wholesaler, reported a 7.3 per cent slide in
non-consolidated sales to Y690.9bn (Dollars 6.4bn) for the first six months
to September, due to the 3 per cent fall in sales volume. However, the
company saw a 19.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits due to higher profit
margins for gasoline and kerosene.
A Y1.2bn fall in its financial deficit figure due to repayment of loans,
also helped profits. After-tax profits fell 22.5 per cent to Y5.2bn as the
previous year's figures were supported by income from land sales.
For the full year to March, Cosmo expects continued sluggish demand for oil
products, and forecasts a 5.3 per cent fall in sales to Y1,470bn and profits
to rise a marginal 0.6 per cent to Y32bn.
Nikko Kyodo, a mining and oil refining company which was established last
December through the merger of Nippon Mining and Kyodo Oil, saw interim
sales fall 8.6 per cent to Y664.2bn due to the fall in oil prices.
Pre-tax profits however rose 28 per cent to Y12.3bn, while after-tax profits
rose 78 per cent to Y7.2bn.
For the full year to March the company expects pre-tax profits of Y34bn on
Y1,400bn in sales. After-tax profits are expected to total Y1bn as the
company plans to book an extraordinary loss to liquidate Gould, its US unit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Telecom has announced plans to cash in on its existing
telecommunications system by setting up a cable TV and video-on-demand
service.
The move comes two days after the launch of Wharf Holding's HKDollars 5bn
(USDollars 647m) cable TV network for the colony.
Hongkong Telecom attempted to bid for the first cable network franchise
awarded in 1989, but the government decreed that it could own only 15 per
cent of a cable operator and could not use its telephone network to relay
the service.
The monopoly on domestic services disappears in 1995, and since Wharf is
planning to use its cable system as the basis for a second
telecommunications network, Hongkong Telecom expects to be allowed to do the
same, once Wharf's three-year exclusivity period expires in June 1996.
Hongkong Telecom anticipates that it would invest more than HKDollars 1bn in
building up a cable television system. It is expected to be joined by the
Hutchison Whampoa group in its application for the licence.
Mr Peter Howell-Davies, Hongkong Telecom's deputy chief executive, said: 'It
is the right strategic step for us to extend the range of our video services
to meet the needs of medium-sized business and domestic customers, as well
as the major corporations.'

nine months
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOVA, western Canada's most conspicuous corporate turnround of the
recession, reported a strong result for the first nine months of 1993.
The company said that capital spending would rise substantially to handle
growing demand for capacity in its natural gas pipeline system.
Nova, which is concentrating on building its core pipeline and petrochemical
businesses after a brush with failure two years ago, has put its Novalta
Resources gas production unit out to tender.
It expects firm bids later this month. Analysts value the unit at CDollars
200m or more.
Nine-month net profit was CDollars 159m (USDollars 121m), or 37 cents a
share, up 43 per cent from CDollars 111m, or 27 cents a share, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.4bn, an increase of 9 per cent.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 45m, or 10 cents, down 4 per cent from
CDollars 47m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 828m, up 10 per cent. The
decline was due to a lower regulated rate of return on pipeline operations.
The nine-month period included a 6 cents a share gain on the sale of its
interest in an Italian manufacturing concern. Nova also gained from a lower
Canadian dollar and lower level of debt.
Chemicals remained in the black in spite of depressed markets, and requests
for pipeline services in 1995-96 were up 'very significantly', said Mr J.
Edward Newall, chairman and main architect of Nova's revival.
Capital spending, mainly for the pipelines, will average CDollars
500m-CDollars 600m a year in 1994 and 1995 and could reach CDollars
600m-CDollars 700m in 1996.
Cashflow from petrochemicals was positive and Nova believes prices should
improve late in 1994.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is making its first foray into the nascent
market for hand-held computer/ communicator devices with the introduction of
Simon, a hand-held cellular telephone-cum-computer.
The device is to be sold in the US by BellSouth Cellular, one of the leading
US cellular telephone service providers.
Simon weighs just over a pound and looks much like an ordinary cellular
telephone, with a touch-sensitive display instead of the usual dial pad.
However, unlike earlier 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple's
Newton, Simon is primarily a communications device.
Its functions include: facsimile, paging, electronic mail, calendar and
appointments diary, address book, calculator and pen-based note pad, as well
as cellular telephone.
Unlike Apple Computer's Newton, which deciphers handwritten notes and turns
them into text, Simon stores the image of a written note and sends it via
the cellular network to a standard facsimile machine.
IBM has granted BellSouth Cellular exclusive distribution rights to Simon in
the US. The product will carry the BellSouth name.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Property is still the problem
for Japanese banks - The continuing trouble with bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Japanese banks established the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company
to clear the industry's problem loans, they housed it in a half-empty Tokyo
office building.
It was an apt reminder of the property market collapse that is blamed for
the banks' woes.
Almost a year later, the CCPC is still occupying one floor in a half-empty
building, and the banks' non-performing loans continue to increase. The
collapse this week of Muramoto Construction, a provincial contractor, has
added to the total; its outstanding debt is estimated at a record Y590bn
(Dollars 5.45bn).
The aim of the CCPC, established in January, was to buy the banks'
non-performing loans and oversee the sale of property collateral, enabling
them to write off the resulting losses. The banks hoped its valuations would
put a floor under property prices, which have fallen by as much as 70 per
cent over the past three years.
But the Muramoto collapse, which will leave deep scars at a few regional
banks, raises doubts over the CCPC's ability to assist those most in need.
One problem is that the CCPC buys bad loans with money injected by the bank
selling the loan, which means that weaker banks cannot afford to confront
their portfolios.
Mr Akira Miyagawa, managing director of the CCPC, said public concerns about
the heath of the banking system have eased over the past year. 'We had as
our objective a vehicle to handle the problem stage by stage, and I think we
are doing that,' he said.
However, the unexpected Muramoto failure has rekindled concerns. Doubt
remains over the extent of the damage caused by reckless lending during the
late 1980s, when banks competed fiercely and pumped money into speculative
property developments.
At the end of March, Japan's 21 leading banks declared that they had
non-performing loans of Y12,700bn, just over 3 per cent of total lending.
That figure is thought to have risen to about Y14,000bn by the end of
September. Actual exposure is widely estimated at Y30,000bn or more, if
lending by affiliates is included, but even that figure does not measure the
burden of loan repayments frozen by many troubled clients.
The Muramoto case highlights the 'hidden' liabilities carried by many
Japanese companies, some of which routinely exaggerated the value of their
land collateral and provided loan guarantees not reported in accounts.
Muramoto is said to have guaranteed loans worth Y150bn, leaving it more
vulnerable than the banks had realised.
Taking the official figure of non-performing loans, the CCPC has made little
impression on the total. Until the end of October, loans with a face value
of Y1,919bn had been purchased through the company for Y1,084bn - the price
is calculated by a valuation panel which assesses the property collateral
and other relevant assets. However, the company has been able to recover
only Y4.43bn of the Y1,084bn, meaning that most banks are unable to find
buyers for property collateral.
At least the banks can claim the loss on their sale to the CCPC as a tax
deduction; previously, they were virtually forced to wait until their client
was declared bankrupt before tax authorities would accept the write-off.
But the CCPC has not fulfilled its stated aim of stimulating the property
market.
Mr Miyagawa said the unexpected weakness of the economy, partly caused by
the yen's sharp appreciation, has worked against a recovery in property
prices - in all, 755 loans have been bought by the CCPC but property assets
have been sold in only 19 cases.
Nor are the banks helping the CCPC's cause. They have insisted on secrecy
for more than half their sales, defeating the aim of providing information
on property trends. And the pattern of sales, with a rush in the weeks just
before the interim and annual book closing, works against the desired image
of the CCPC presiding over an orderly resolution of problem loans. In the
period from April to September, 510 loans were purchased by the company; 414
were bought in September, just before the close of the first half. In
October, banks brought only 16 loans to the CCPC - suggesting that most
institutions see it merely as a vehicle to speed write-offs for tax
purposes.
Japanese banks, which will announce their first-half profits later this
month, are able to afford write-offs because of falling interest rates,
which have created a favourable spread. The official discount rate is now at
a record low of 1.75 per cent; without the good fortune of an interest rate
fall, the CCPC would be under more pressure and the banks in greater pain.
But the sudden failure of Muramoto Construction is a warning that Japanese
banks' bad loan hangover from the late 1980s is far from over.

<TEXT>
TELECOM Corporation, the New Zealand utility controlled by Bell Atlantic and
Ameritech, yesterday announced a 19.1 per cent increase in earnings to
NZDollars 251.4m (USDollars 139.5m) for the six months to the end of
September.
Dr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said the 'excellent' result was due to
cost-cutting, 'well focused, powerfully driven marketing initiatives' and
the benefits of the continuing restructuring.
In February the company announced plans to cut the payroll by 5,000, and
this process was running ahead of schedule, he said. The total employed had
so far been cut to 10,360 from 12,338.
Net earnings for the second quarter rose to NZDollars 133.2m, a 17 per cent
rise on the year-ago figure. However, the company warned against the
expectation of earnings continuing to rise at that rate.
The dividend is being raised to 8.25 cents from 7.25 cents. Operating costs,
excluding abnormal operating costs, fell by 4.8 per cent to NZDollars
797.5m.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis spin-off
approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, yesterday won
regulatory approval for its unusual and controversial plan to spin off its
mobile communications business into a separately quoted company.
The go-ahead from the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees
the industry, ended a dispute which had delayed the spin-off.
The commission's public advocacy office had demanded that Pacific Telesis
refund Dollars 1bn to its telephone operating companies for research into
cellular technology supposedly paid for out of telephone rates. In the end,
the commission insisted the company pay just Dollars 41.3m.
Pacific Telesis announced plans for the spin-off last December. The wireless
business, to be known as Pactel, involves the group's US cellular telephone
and paging businesses and its international mobile operations, which
includes ventures in Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Spain.
The group plans to sell 12 per cent of Pactel in a public offering which
could raise up to Dollars 1.2bn and will be completed by mid-December. It
will distribute the remaining 88 per cent of the stock to existing
investors.
Pacific Telesis, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies,
has a strategy very different from most of the other big local operators as
they prepare for the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and
media industries.
Its rivals are keeping all their operations under one corporate parent and
snapping up interests in cable TV companies and programme providers.
Pacific Telesis, with no significant television investments, argues that the
spin-off will allow Pactel to take greater advantage of worldwide wireless
growth, since it will free it from much of the regulatory oversight of its
traditional telephone business.
At the same time, the split will enable Pacific Telesis to play a much
larger role in personal communications services (PCS), a new kind of mobile
telephony which some advocates say may have greater mass market appeal than
cellular.

<TEXT>
SULTAN Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei collects luxury hotels like the rest of us
collect postage stamps.
But when you have a personal fortune of Dollars 37bn you can afford to be a
bit choosy about where you put your head down for the night.
The Sultan of Brunei (left) this week agreed to pay Dollars 202m for the
luxurious New York Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue. The Sultan and his family
also own the top of the range Beverly Hills Hotel in California and the
Dorchester in London.
Closer to home, the Sultan controls two Hyatt hotels in Singapore. When the
Sultan held a sit-down dinner party last year at his palace in Brunei for
nearly 6,000 people as part of celebrations of his 25 years on the throne,
Hyatt chefs and waiters were flown in from Sydney and Tokyo.
If the Sultan tires of hotel living on his frequent trips abroad there are
alternatives available. The Sultan's family are believed to have at least
two houses in Beverly Hills.
There are various houses and flats dotted round London. Then there is the
main British residence - a country house conveniently situated close to
Heathrow airport. The Sultan also has a mansion in central Kuala Lumpur.
The Sultan's latest acquisition has an interesting history. The New York
Palace Hotel was once called the Helmsley Palace, after Mrs Leona Helmsley,
once the most famous hotelier in the US and a leading New York socialite.
But the Helmsley hotel empire came crashing down in 1989 when Mrs Helmsley,
known as the 'Queen of Mean' for her treatment of hotel employees, was
sentenced to imprisonment for tax evasion and mail fraud.
As the Sultan of Brunei's investment advisers were putting the final touches
to documents buying the old Helmsley Palace, Mrs Helmsley herself was moving
into less salubrious hotel accommodation - a halfway-house low-cost hotel
just down the road from her old stamping ground.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: HK Telecom plans cable TV
service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Telecom has announced plans to cash in on its existing
telecommunications system by setting up a cable TV and video-on-demand
service. The move comes two days after the launch of Wharf Holding's
HKDollars 5bn (USDollars 647m) cable television network for the colony.
Hongkong Telecom attempted to bid for the first cable network franchise
awarded in 1989, but the government decreed that it could own only 15 per
cent of a cable operator and could not use its telephone network to relay
the service, due to its monopoly position.
The monopoly on domestic services disappears in 1995, and since Wharf is
planning to use its cable system as the basis for a second
telecommunications network, Hongkong Telecom expects to be allowed to do the
same, once Wharf's three-year exclusivity period expires in June 1996.
Hongkong Telecom anticipates that it would invest more than HKDollars 1bn in
building up a cable television system. It is expected to be joined by the
Hutchison Whampoa group in its application for the licence.
Mr Peter Howell-Davies, Hongkong Telecom's deputy chief executive, said: 'It
is the right strategic step for us to extend the range of our video services
to meet the needs of medium-sized business and domestic customers, as well
as the major corporations.'
Hongkong Telecom plans to launch a service whereby customers can dial a
number and have videos delivered to their TV set through the telephone
network.
Wharf Cable officials claimed such a service would provide only niche
competition, since it currently offers eight channels, of which only one
includes movies.
The push to launch a cable channel will cause greater concern, since
Hongkong Telecom would be in a position to set up a network more rapidly and
cheaply than any other company.
It has the obvious advantages of its existing network and its business
relationship with almost every family in the colony. However, the move does
underline the attractiveness of Wharf's new franchise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy products company which is the
focus of an ADollars 82m (USDollars 55m) bid battle, is recommending that
shareholders accept a ADollars 3.35 a share offer from QUF Industries in the
absence of a higher bid.
'Your directors regard the offer as fair and reasonable and recommend that
you join them in accepting this offer in the absence of a higher offer,'
Associated Dairies said in its formal bid response document filed yesterday.
Australian Co-Operative Foods (ACF) has launched a rival bid for Associated
Dairies, but this is currently worth only ADollars 3.25 a share.
ACF holds just under 20 per cent of its target's equity, shares which were
bought at prices significantly below the QUF offer terms.
This would allow ACF to walk away from the battle with a profit of almost
ADollars 6m, if it chooses not to raise its terms again.
Associated Dairies directors, however, advised shareholders to wait until
the last minute before accepting the offer from QUF.
'As your company has a unique position within the Victorian dairy industry,
it is possible that either or both of these offers could be revised upwards
in the days ahead,' they said.

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong-listed property and infrastructure group,
is to create a separately listed company for its power plant operations,
which will have an initial stock market value of HKDollars 12.75bn
(USDollars 1.65bn).
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA) will become the holding company for
all Hopewell's power generation projects. Hopewell was the first Hong Kong
company to construct a power station in China and it has expanded this
business into the Philippines.
It has completed three projects with a combined capacity of 1,010MW, and is
constructing two more plants which would add a further 2,715MW.
CEPA is to issue HKDollars 8bn of partly-paid shares to the parent company,
and a further HKDollars 4.7bn of shares to outside investors, including
Hopewell's largest shareholder Mr Gordon Wu and Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong
group. Peregrine International, the parent of the listed financial services
group, and the large Japanese trading group Kanemaru will also take minority
stakes.
The public offer will be valued at around HKDollars 1.5bn, based on the
projected issue price of HKDollars 10 a share. The Hopewell group's own
share placement will be issued on a partly-paid basis, but assuming full
subscription, it will control 63 per cent of the new company.
The capital raising will enable the group to fund an aggressive expansion
programme.
The company claimed that 'a separate listing of CEPA will enable investors
to assess the business of the CEPA Group and the other business of the
Hopewell Group independently which, in the opinion of the directors of the
company, will enhance the market rating of the Hopewell Group'.

SPAREBANKEN Nor, Norway's third biggest bank in asset terms, yesterday
disclosed it had returned to the black in the first nine months of this
year, posting a pre-tax profit of NKr1.034bn (Dollars 14m), against a
NKr210m loss last year.
The sharp improvement was helped by substantial gains on securities, lower
interest rates, and a decline in loan losses.
The bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, increased net
interest income by NKr315m to NKr2.29bn in the nine-month period as other
operating income - gains on securities and foreign exchange - more than
doubled to NKr1.55bn from NKr671m.
'About half the improvement is due to gains on securities,' Sparebanken Nor
said.
Group operating expenses rose slightly by NKr84m to NKr1.85bn as operating
profit, before credit losses and writedowns, more than doubled to NKr1.99bn,
or 2.82 per cent of average assets, from NKr875m. Losses on loans and
guarantees were cut by NKr124m to NKr944m.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kmart sells Pace warehouse
stores to Wal-Mart
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KMART, the second-biggest US retailer, is selling most of its loss-making
Pace Membership Warehouse clubs to rival retailer Wal-Mart Stores.
Although terms were not disclosed, Kmart said the deal would yield net
proceeds of about Dollars 300m in cash, equal to Pace's net tangible book
value. It said the sale price included a premium over net book value, which
will be used to offset the cost of closing some Pace stores not sold to
Wal-Mart.
Kmart will take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 450m against
fourth-quarter earnings.
Wal-Mart, which owns 326 Sam's Club warehouse stores, is buying 91 Pace
outlets. Pace operates 113 stores and had contracts for another 19 which
have not opened.
Wall Street had expected Kmart to shed its Pace stores. Kmart shares rose
Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 24 7/8 , while Wal-Mart finished the day up
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 27.
Kmart's foray into the deep discount market has been beset by problems. It
first struggled with Makro, a low-cost, warehouse-style retailer operated in
the US as a joint venture between a Michigan-based group and SHV Holdings of
the Netherlands. The Makro outlets were merged into the Pace business after
Kmart acquired Pace for Dollars 322m in 1989.
The timing of Kmart's Pace acquisition was also unfortunate. Shortly after
Kmart decided that clubs were more than a fad and expanded into the sector,
the industry started to show its vulnerability to competition and the weak
economy.
Pace, which had operating losses of Dollars 63m in the first half of this
year, has been criticised for operating inefficiencies.
In contrast, Wal-Mart was quick to spot the potential in the sector, opening
three Sam's Wholesale Clubs in 1983. By 1990, the company had more than 140
Sam's outlets.
Although the rate of same-store sales growth at Sam's has declined this
year, analysts have praised its sophisticated distribution system. They
expect it to benefit from the Pace acquisition.
The Pace deal will also strengthen Sam's position against the consolidation
of Price/Costco - the second- and third-biggest warehouse club chains which
agreed to merge this year.
Wal-Mart said the Pace clubs would continue to operate under the Pace name
until the sale was finalised.
The divestiture will help Kmart focus on its core discount-store operations.
In October, the company said it might sell 25 per cent stakes in its Sports
Authority, Borders, OfficeMax and Builders Square specialty chains through
initial public offerings.
In August, Kmart confirmed it was seeking bidders for its PayLess drugstores
chain. According to US press reports, Kmart has tentatively agreed to sell
PayLess for Dollars 1bn to a Los Angeles-based investment firm.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Visa to buy Plus ATM network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VISA International is to buy the 70 per cent of the Plus ATM (automated
teller machine) network it does not already own, intensifying the
competition for the international cash-withdrawal business with rival
Mastercard.
Visa said it would exercise an option to buy Plus in three years, and in the
meantime will run the system.
It took a 10-year option to buy Plus, which is majority-owned by the banks
which issue Plus cash-withdrawal cards, when acquiring its initial 30 per
cent stake in 1988.
The acquisition of 101,000 Plus terminals in 40 countries will take the Visa
total to 160,000. The payment organisation said it plans to take the total
to 250,000 by 1996 by absorbing other bank-owned ATMs into the system.
Mastercard, by contrast, made a big move into ATMs in 1987 with the
acquisition of rival network Cirrus, and now has 143,565 ATM machines
internationally.
Visa's aggressive plans to expand its network could lead to a greater
polarisation between the two ATM systems, forcing banks to choose between
issuing Visa or Mastercard debit cards (use of which leads to an immediate
debit to the user's bank account).
The expansion of the ATM network is part of a move to expand the use of its
debit cards, Visa said. It currently has 68m debit cards in issue, compared
with 318m credit cards, but plans to expand the number to 220m within two
years.
The availability of ATMs internationally, which allow users to debit their
accounts from abroad, is part of a move to enhance the attractiveness of the
Visa debit cards.

MERCK yesterday withdrew Roxiam, a schizophrenia treatment which was
awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. The move follows
the death of a patient in Europe, write Richard Waters and Paul Abrahams in
New York.
The drug, which has been marketed in Europe by Astra, the Swedish company,
for the past two and a half years, was said by analysts to have the
potential for peak annual sales of Dollars 100m-Dollars 250m in the US.
The withdrawal followed the development of a blood disorder in eight
patients taking the drug in Europe.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Case gets in shape for a
difficult harvest - Laurie Morse examines restructuring at Tenneco's
agricultural machinery subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE grain harvest is about three weeks behind schedule in the American
mid-west, and farmers are working overtime, pushing their tractors and
combines to the limit.
The machines are invariably the trademark green of John Deere, or the
distinctive red of the old International Harvester company, whose logo has
been assumed by equipment manufacturer J. I. Case, the Wisconsin-based unit
of Tenneco.
This year, with US farm income projected at 10 per cent above 1992's Dollars
62.5bn, Deere and Case are hoping farmers will end their self-imposed
austerity and make long-deferred purchases of tractors and other equipment.
For Case, always a distant second to Deere, the battle for market share will
be more difficult than usual.
The company, the largest division of Houston-based Tenneco, is
restructuring, with the aim of returning the unit to profitability. Case
delivered Dollars 4bn in revenues to Tenneco last year, and still logged a
huge Dollars 1bn loss.
Quality problems in manufacturing, a pricing policy aimed at maintaining
market share at any cost, and out-of-control inventories have plagued Case
for years. When turnround expert Mr Michael Walsh took the helm at Tenneco
in 1991, he hired an old friend, Mr Dana Mead, as president and asked him to
revamp Case.
Mr Mead tackled inventories that had jumped as high as Dollars 2bn, ordering
manufacturing cutbacks and reduced manufacturing time. He also cut the
workforce to 17,000 from about 30,000 in 1990.
Mr Mead also instituted stringent quality controls, and reviewed Case's
agricultural and construction equipment product lines model by model.
Some products were scrapped and others were re-tooled so that Case retained
only assembly functions, buying parts from outside suppliers. Production was
rationalised to meet customer demand, a new concept for Case.
This year 70 per cent of its output will be built to customer
specifications, rather than being manufactured wholesale and then customised
through costly rebuilding.
Mead also ended Case's customary sales discounts. This reform has reduced
volume this year, but profits have grown.
'Case forgot it liked to make money and just liked to make tractors,' Mr
Mead jokes.
Inventories fell by Dollars 719m in 1992, and are projected to be down
another Dollars 300m in 1993. Tightening quality controls at the factory and
in the sales process has saved the company about Dollars 200m this year,
according to Mr Ted French, Case's chief financial officer.
Mr Mead's policies are paying off. Case posted a Dollars 52m operating
profit at the end of the third quarter, up from a loss of Dollars 134m a
year earlier. Contrary to Wall Street projections only a few months ago,
Case is expected to show a profit for the full year.
Its production lines are gearing up for a 30 per cent surge this quarter, to
bring output in line with that of 1992. Meanwhile, Mr Mead says he intends
to continue to trim his workforce, and will squeeze out an additional
Dollars 34m in quality savings in 1994.
Still, analysts say the turnround is weak at best. Mr Frank Manfredi, editor
of Machinery Outlook, an Illinois-based newsletter, says Case's practice of
rolling earnings from the financing unit into profits boosted the
third-quarter bottom line. Without the credit subsidiary's contribution,
Case's year-to-date operating profit is a mere Dollars 12m.
The company's European cuts have been difficult, and markets there are
shrinking, while the US agricultural economy remains flat.
Mr Mead says it is not yet time to ease up. 'This is just the beginning of
the transformation,' he told analysts recently. 'It's been a long, tough
struggle and we're not getting any help from our markets.'
Indeed, Case is projecting sales of Dollars 2.8bn in North America this
year, and about Dollars 1.1bn in Europe, its second-largest base.
Of those sales, about 60 per cent will be agricultural machinery and 40 per
cent in construction equipment.
The late harvest has delayed the autumn selling season for big-ticket
agricultural items such as tractors by about three weeks in North America.
Meanwhile, farmers who are used to buying Case's shiny red tractors at juicy
discounts are finding value pricing hard to swallow. 'They're trying to wait
us out, looking for year-end mark-downs,' one dealer observed.
And while US farm income is up slightly this year, it is projected to be
down 8 per cent in 1994, a forecast that reinforces Mr Mead's determination
to raise operating profits even as sales decline.
In Europe, the situation is even more dismal. European tractor sales are
projected to fall to 106,000 units in 1994, down from 181,000 in 1990.
Industry-wide sales of construction equipment are flat to lower. And unlike
North America, competition is fragmented and intense.
The big German construction market remains depressed. 'We don't have any
idealistic views about the 1994 market,' says Mr Steve Lamb, Case's managing
director for Europe.
Case's policy of holding the line on discounts has not succeeded in Europe,
where Deere, also suffering from a shrinking market, is pricing
aggressively.
Case operates eight manufacturing plants in Europe, most of them the legacy
of Tenneco's acquisition of France's Poclain construction equipment and
International Harvester's agricultural divisions in 1985.
Several small manufacturing operations are being closed or reduced in size,
with redundancies of about 1,000 workers. That includes the 266 redundancies
at Case's French plants announced in September.
Given Case's ambitious restructuring plans and the struggling state of
Poclain's businesses, 'its a pretty safe bet that you'll see more closures
in France', where about half of Case's 7,500 European employees are
situated, Mr Lamb says.
The contraction is fundamental to the success of Case's turnround. 'It is
essential to get the size of production down to the size of the market,' Mr
Mead says.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron in German
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CINCINNATI Milacron, the US machine toolmaker, is to buy the Ferromatik
plastics-moulding equipment business from Klockner Werke of Germany for
DM94m (Dollars 56m).
The US company hopes the acquisition will bolster its moulding machinery
business, while giving it immediate access to the European market, the
world's largest for such equipment. The acquisition is expected to add
Dollars 100m to 1994 revenues.
The growing importance of the business to Milacron's bottom line was
underscored yesterday by the announcement of third-quarter results.
Stripping out extraordinary items, operating earnings were up 58 per cent at
Dollars 8.4m, or 25 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 301m, a 33 per
cent gain.
The improvement reflected in part one of the best quarters ever for the
plastics machinery group, which appeared to be on target for a
record-breaking year in new business and sales.
The strong performance in plastics equipment offset weakness in the machine
tools segment, which posted flat sales, lower earnings and a 'precipitous
fall-off' in orders.
'Our machine tools business continued to be hurt by the deep recession in
the aerospace industry,' said Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive.
The results include an Dollars 18.1m charge related to Sano, a supplier of
plastic film systems acquired in 1986. The company wants to sell Sano
because of problems of integration with core businesses.
With the one-time provision included, the company posted a net loss of
Dollars 7.9m, or 23 cents, against net earnings of Dollars 7.3m.

<TEXT>
A Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover asbestosis and environmental claims
pushed Cigna, the US insurer, into the red during the third quarter of the
year.
The company also took a Dollars 107m charge to cover 1,400 redundancies in
its health and property/casualty businesses, which have already been
reported, as well as a further 800-1,000 job losses expected in the next 18
months.
The latest charges led Cigna, one of the leaders in the US health and life
insurance businesses, to post a net loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, for the period, compared with a net profit of Dollars 50m, or 70
cents, a year ago.
The scale of the loss was reduced by a Dollars 48m benefit from the change
in the US corporate tax rate.
The results a year before had been struck after one-off items which led to a
net benefit of Dollars 42m.
Operating results during the period in health, pension and life businesses
had been strong, said Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive.

<TEXT>
QUEBECOR, the Montreal-based publishing group which controls North America's
second-biggest commercial printer, reported a gain in sales and earnings in
the third quarter, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Net profit was CDollars 17.5m (USDollars 13.5m), or 27 cents a share, up
from CDollars 16.1m, or 24 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars
789m, against CDollars 623m.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 52.6m, or 77 cents, up from CDollars 36.8m,
or 55 cents, excluding special items in both periods. Revenues for the
period advanced to CDollars 2.2bn from CDollars 1.8bn.
Quebecor is controlled by the Peladeau family. It owns Canada's
second-biggest daily newspaper, and weeklies and magazines. Much of its
income comes from the 55 per cent-owned Quebecor Printing. Talisman, the
former BP Canada, earned CDollars 4.3m, or 7 cents a share, in the third
quarter, double the total of a year earlier. For the first nine months it
earned CDollars 19.2m, or 33 cents, up from CDollars 7.5m, or 15 cents, a
year earlier.
The company has doubled oil and gas production and reserves this year
through a significant acquisition, and gas prices have risen steadily. A
lower Canadian dollar has also helped.
Bow Valley Energy, 33 per cent held by British Gas and expanding
internationally, earned CDollars 10.4m or three cents a share in the first
nine months, up from CDollars 7.9m or one cent a share, on revenues of
CDollars 178m, little changed.

<TEXT>
SPAREBANKEN Nor, Norway's third biggest bank in asset terms, yesterday
disclosed it had returned to the black in the first nine months of this
year, posting a pre-tax profit of NKr1.034bn (Dollars 14m), against a
NKr210m loss last year.
The sharp improvement was helped by substantial gains on securities, lower
interest rates, and a decline in loan losses.
The bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, increased net
interest income by NKr315m to NKr2.29bn in the nine-month period as other
operating income - gains on securities and foreign exchange - more than
doubled to NKr1.55bn from NKr671m.
'About half the improvement is due to gains on securities,' Sparebanken Nor
said.
Group operating expenses rose slightly by NKr84m to NKr1.85bn as operating
profit, before credit losses and writedowns, more than doubled to NKr1.99bn,
or 2.82 per cent of average assets, from NKr875m. Losses on loans and
guarantees were cut by NKr124m to NKr944m.
'Calculated on an annual basis, the loss ratio for the first nine months was
1.6 per cent of gross loans, while for 1992 the figure was 1.9 per cent,'
the bank said.
Sparebanken Nor has recommended a dividend payment of not less than NKr15
per primary capital certificate (PCC) for 1993.
PCCs are financial bourse-listed instruments, similar to preference shares,
which are traded like usual stocks and governed by the same legislation.
They are used by Norway's savings banks to raise fresh equity capital and to
expand their ownership to include a limited percentage of foreign
shareholders.

<TEXT>
GILDEMEISTER, one of Germany's leading machine-tool manufacturers, is to
double its capital base and cut its workforce in an attempt to stave off the
impact of deep recession in what was once one of Germany's most prosperous
industrial sectors.
The Bielefeld-based group said it planned to hold a near one-for-one rights
issue to raise DM40m (Dollars 23.6m) in new equity. The issue is to be
underwritten by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the house bank to the state of
North-Rhine Westphalia in which Gildemeister is based. In addition, banks
will be forgoing debts totalling DM32m.
Gildemeister plans to reduce its workforce by 380, the latest in a series of
job-cutting measures which have taken the group total to just over 2,000
from 3,200 at the end of 1991.
The group, which specialises in turning machines, added that it had devised
a new strategy to adapt further to difficult market conditions. It is
planning to reduce the number of products which it makes and to contract out
layers of manufacturing to third-party suppliers.
It gave no detailed picture of its operational situation, but the measures
imply a further deterioration in business conditions in the second half of
the year. At the end of June the order book was 45 per cent of last year's
level. Last year the group made losses of DM77m on turnover of DM470m; the
group has already warned that losses for the current year will be
substantial.

television network

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIA companies Time Warner and Tribune announced yesterday that they were
joining forces to launch a fifth US prime time television network - in
direct competition with Paramount Communications and Chris-Craft Industries,
which also unveiled plans for a network last week.
'There is room for one more broadcast network, but only one,' said Mr Jamie
Kellner, who will head the new organisation. 'This is it.' Mr Kellner played
an important role in the launch of the fourth US network, Fox, which was set
up in 1986 by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Programming for the network will be provided by Time-Warner's Warner
Brothers subsidiary, one of the leading suppliers of prime-time television
in the US. Tribune, which publishes the Chicago Tribune newspaper, will
contribute at least six of its seven television stations, covering some 19
per cent of US households. Time Warner's cable interests would take the
coverage to 29 per cent.
Paramount and Chris-Craft said stations they owned would give their network
access to 27 per cent of US households.
Both sides will be battling to affiliate the 280 independent stations in the
US which are not already tied into one of the three big longstanding
television networks - CBS, ABC and NBC - or Fox.
Yesterday, Warner said that it expected the network would initially cover 85
per cent of US households. It already had commitments from station groups
representing 40 per cent coverage of the country.
Analysts reckon that a network needs to achieve at least 70 per cent
coverage to attract the advertising necessary to support a large amount of
original programming.
They doubt there is room in the US for more than one more network, given the
limited pool of unaffiliated stations and increased competition for
advertisers' dollars.
Warner intends to start its network in the autumn of next year, while
Paramount's venture is due to start up in January 1995.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swedish bank back in profit

HIGHER revenues, cost-cutting and lower credit losses combined to help
Svenska Handelsbanken swing to an operating profit of SKr1.39bn (Dollars
170m) in the first nine months of 1993 from a SKr883m loss in the same 1992
period.
The bank's result has improved in every quarter this year, culminating in a
SKr552m profit in the July to September period. This recovery and the
SKr2.65bn proceeds of its October rights issue have left it in a strong
competitive position based on a 12.4 per cent capital adequacy ratio.
Total operating income in the first nine months was up 17 per cent at
SKr10.7bn. This followed a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to
SKr7.54bn and higher commission and property rental income. The bank also
realised SKr400m in capital gains on bond sales, compared with SKr80m last
time round.
Expenses were virtually unchanged at SKr3.98bn, with higher system
development costs and the weaker Swedish krona offsetting a 2 per cent fall
in personnel costs.
Another encouraging feature of the report was the 12 per cent fall in loan
losses to SKr5.28bn, equal to 2.6 per cent of total lending. Problem loans
fell to SKr12.4bn, or 4.5 per cent of lending volume, compared with
SKr13.2bn at the end of June.
Svenska Handelsbanken has weathered the Swedish banking crisis better than
its rivals, and was the only significant bank in the Nordic region which
neither received nor sought government assistance.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Time-out called as strains start
to show - Delay to Renault-Volvo merger reveals differences in emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE embarrassed mechanics rushing to fix a new model that stalls in the
showroom, executives from Volvo and Renault were quick to insist yesterday
that their ambitious plan to form a Franco-Swedish automotive powerhouse was
suffering from no more than a temporary hitch.
Both groups explained in soothing tones that Volvo's decision on Monday to
postpone a shareholder vote on the proposed merger of its car and truck
operations with state-owned Renault was simply a move to allow them more
time to answer the concerns voiced by Volvo's highly sceptical Swedish
shareholders.
But despite the attempt at reassurance, there was little disguising that the
postponement had revealed the strains involved in converting their
three-year old alliance into a full-blown merger and carried no guarantee
that Volvo will win a Yes vote from its owners at the re-scheduled meeting
on December 7.
A difference in emphasis was discernable between the French and Swedish
sides yesterday. Renault and the French government stressed that
clarification of the existing agreement, not renegotiation, was the order of
the day.
Volvo, however, did not rule out seeking at least some changes in the merger
deal after it had ascertained more clearly what its shareholders  - mostly
institutional investors - objected to.
Working out what the Swedish shareholders are demanding is a more difficult
task than it might at first sight appear. The opposition to the deal has
focused on the timing of the privatisation of Renault - set to take place
after the merger takes effect at the beginning of next year - and the French
government's intentions concerning the use of a golden share which it will
retain after privatisation.
A director of one leading shareholder fund said yesterday that these
questions had a vital impact on any analysis of the worth of the merger deal
for Volvo, which is set to have a 35 per cent share in the new Renault-Volvo
company.
'Renault is basically making a bid for Volvo's cars and trucks and paying
with its shares,' he said. 'As Volvo shareholders, we cannot assess what
those Renault shares are worth until Renault has a market value.'
He said the French government's plan to retain a golden share not only
contained a future threat to the level of Volvo's holding in the merged
company. It also amounted to a 'poison pill' which would entail a discount
in the share price of the merged company and thus also had an impact on the
worth of the deal to Volvo.
This shareholder would likely be satisfied by more information on the values
imputed in the deal by Renault and Volvo and more details - hitherto not
circulated by Volvo - of a mostly favourable 'fairness opinion' commissioned
from Credit Suisse First Boston.
However, some Swedish opposition goes well beyond this. It ranges from
demands that the merger be postponed until after Renault's privatisation, to
longstanding hostility to Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, and his
perceived sell-out to foreigners of Sweden's industrial crown jewels.
'Certainly there is a degree to which the privatisation and golden share
issues are being used as a smokescreen for more basic opposition,' said a
Stockholm investment broker.
The French government and Renault believe that the failure to persuade
Volvo's shareholders has been a problem of presentation rather than the
terms of the agreement.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, promises that the merged group
will be privatised as quickly as possible after the merger and that this
should be achieved by the end of next year.
The problem, however, is that such statements fall short of demands from
Swedish shareholders for a fixed timetable.
The French government says that because a successful privatisation depends
on the conditions in the financial and car markets it is unwise to set a
more precise date. 'Do you think shareholders would appreciate it if we went
through with a privatisation which flopped?' asked one economic official.
One solution would be to move the merger up the list of 21 publicly owned
groups slated for privatisation, or even to launch the privatisation at the
time of the merger - scheduled for January 3 next year.
The problem with this approach, say French officials, is that it is
necessary to establish a value for the merged company before it can be sold.
It would also be politically difficult to bow to Swedish pressure on the
timing of the sale of one of France's flagship public sector industrial
groups.
As for the golden share in Renault, the French government will retain the
right to limit any investor to 20 per cent of the merged company's capital
in the event of a breakdown of the shareholders' agreement. The government
says that the golden share would only be used to protect the group from a
hostile takeover.
Nevertheless, it enables the French government to ensure French control of
the group following privatisation - including, in theory, forcing Volvo's
share down to 20 per cent. Hence Swedish objections.
Persuading Swedish shareholders over the next month to support the merger
seems certain therefore to require more than a stronger sell of the existing
deal. At some point Volvo will turn to Paris for at least some degree of
renegotiation, or new concessions.
The importance of the deal for the French government and its privatisation
plans may ensure the door is open. But yesterday was much too early to
predict whether the new Renault-Volvo model restarts and makes it out of the
showroom.

FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Car chiefs try to defuse
opposition to merger
</HEADLINE>

RENAULT and Volvo said yesterday they would launch a concerted campaign to
defuse mounting shareholder opposition to their proposed merger after the
Swedish group was forced to postpone a vote to approve the deal.
Renault expressed confidence that the merger would go ahead on schedule and
said that Volvo's decision to postpone the vote from next week to December 7
would allow it to calm what it described as exaggerated concerns.
'Volvo has given itself time to show investors that the agreement is
indispensable for both companies', Renault said.
But Swedish investors continued to press for a clearer timetable for
privatisation and increased information concerning the golden share which
the French government plans to hold after the group is privatised. The
strength of opposition could increase pressure on the French government to
make concessions to Volvo shareholders to win approval for the deal.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, telephoned Mr Per
Wersterberg, his Swedish counterpart, to emphasise his government's
commitment to privatising the merged group as quickly as possible. He also
said that the golden share would be used to protect the combined group from
predators and not to ensure French control.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, said his company remained fully
committed to the plan to merge the two groups' car and truck operations. He
said Volvo would examine all questions raised by critics of the merger. 'We
take the criticism seriously and will try to deal with it in the best way.'
Volvo officials said the company would consult further with its key
institutional shareholders on their objections to the merger deal before
deciding what demands it might make on Renault and the French government to
help win over shareholder support.
A spokesman said Volvo was not demanding renegotiation of the merger
agreement but would keep open the possibility of making some changes.
French industry ministry officials said there was no need to change the
terms of the agreement. They blamed the opposition from Swedish shareholders
on a lack of information and said that clarification of the disputed points
should ease their concerns.
The merger, regarded by the French government as a necessary precursor to
privatisation, is one of the most important projects in the French
industrial policy.
The stakes are also high for Mr Gyllenhammar. He came under increased
personal criticism for having mishandled the Renault deal, a charge he
denied. But critics said that if the merger failed it would be the latest in
a line of failed strategic initiatives in his two decades in charge at
Volvo, and that he would not survive.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac's recuperation at a critical point -
The troubled construction group's progress on the road to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECUPERATION of Tarmac, the lossmaking construction and building
materials group, has reached a crucial point.
The announcement on Monday of plans to float off its Ruberoid roofing
materials subsidiary marks the end of a period of surgery during which Mr
Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive, will have raised almost Pounds 300m
by disposing of unwanted businesses.
The next step will be to see how Tarmac's remaining interests perform as the
construction market, particularly housebuilding in the UK, begins to
improve.
The group has savagely reduced costs and made substantial write-downs as it
has fought to regain financial health. Net borrowings at the end of last
year - including Tarmac's share of off-balance sheet finance of Pounds 100m
and Pounds 99.3m of auction market preferred stock - stood at Pounds 677m,
equivalent to 73 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 924m.
This is expected to fall to about Pounds 260m, compared with increased
shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.05bn, should Ruberoid raise Pounds 70m as
expected, and following Tarmac's Pounds 215m rights issue.
To continue the medical metaphor: the patient is recovered enough to get out
of bed but it remains to be seen if he will ever run again.
Tarmac's rise and fall has been dramatic. Between 1978 and 1988 its annual
pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 393m. Last year, after
write-downs, it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 350.3m.
The key to Tarmac's future will be the strength of its housebuilding
operations, says Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst for SG Warburg
Securities, the company's broker. He estimates that capital employed by
Tarmac in housebuilding has fallen from a peak of Pounds 750m at the end of
1988 to about Pounds 250m now. Overhead costs in the housing division have
fallen from more than Pounds 70m annually to an estimated Pounds 50m this
year.
Tarmac is already beginning to reap the benefit from this improved
efficiency.
Net margins on house sales are thought to be about 8 per cent this year
compared with a low of 2.5 per cent in the first six months of 1992.
Annual output of homes, however, has fallen from a peak of 12,000 in the
late 1980s to an estimated 7,500 this year.
This total is expected to rise again as the housing market continues its
recent recovery. Tarmac will therefore need to use its renewed financial
strength to replace its stock of housing land.
Elsewhere prospects look less bright.
Tarmac's strategy is to concentrate on the three core businesses of
housebuilding, construction and quarry products. These last two show limited
prospects for improvement, with little recovery expected in construction
output outside of housebuilding.
Competition for work could become even more intense if the government cuts
road building and other large scale infrastructure projects in its unified
budget later this month.
Cuts in public sector transport and housing investment might also have a
detrimental effect on attempts by the big quarry companies - Tarmac, Redland
and RMC - to force through higher prices.
A cause of the group's collapse was its failure to recognise the intensity
and duration of the recession.
This meant that management was slow to rein back housing land purchases and
investment in commercial property development when property values fell
sharply.
Tarmac has now announced a complete withdrawal from commercial property
development.
It has also sold a large part of its Econowaste waste disposal operations
along with other peripheral businesses, some of them expensively acquired in
the mid to late 1980s.
Still to be decided is the future of two other businesses described by Mr
Simms as 'non-core'.
These are the building materials division, which manufactures bricks and
concrete blocks, and the US aggregates and concrete operations in Florida
and the Carolinas.
The recent decision by Tarmac to swap its clay tile operations for the brick
making interests of rival building materials group Marley is seen by some as
a prelude to a sale by Tarmac of the entire enlarged brick business.
It may, however, decide to keep, or even expand, its US interests, given the
recent improvement in the outlook for the US economy.
Warburg is forecasting another pre-tax loss of up to Pounds 20m for this
year after further goodwill write-offs, mainly against Ruberoid which was
acquired for Pounds 141.3m in 1988. The investment bank, however, is
forecasting a return to profits of Pounds 95m for Tarmac next year, rising
to Pounds 150m in 1995.
Tarmac's share price since sterling left the European exchange rate
mechanism last September has more than doubled from 61p to 135p, matching a
similar rise in the FT-Actuaries construction and contracting share index.
The market appears pleased with progress so far but awaits evidence that the
company, having got this far, can produce good returns from its
reorganisation.
To switch from a medical to a legal metaphor: the jury is still out.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tunstall forecasts 21% growth to Pounds
6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCREASE of 21 per cent in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.4m and a 1p lift
in the dividend for the year ended September 30 1993 was yesterday forecast
by Mr Michael Dawson, chairman of Tunstall Group, the Yorkshire-based
supplier of emergency and security systems, as it announced big expansion
moves. The shares closed 20p higher at 560p.
The forecasts corresponded with the announcement of the formation of Mion
Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary, to take over the existing contract
design and manufacturing business.
Mr Dawson said the expansion of this division follows a year of significant
growth and a continuing strong order book by Tunstall Electronics.
Mion intends to build a 6,600 sq m factory near Barnsley, South Yorkshire.
Total capital expenditure over the next four years on land, buildings and
new equipment would be about Pounds 11m with a further Pounds 1.5m required
for working capital. It was anticipated that over 400 jobs would be created
within two years.
The funding would be financed by a regional assistance grant of Pounds 2.5m
from the Department of Trade and Industry and, subject to contract, by a
five-year loan of Pounds 5m from the European Coal and Steel Community.
Mr Dawson said the contract manufacturing activity had the potential 'to
produce significant profit growth' for the group.
Tunstall's estimated 1992-93 results for contract manufacture shows turnover
of Pounds 3.6m (1991-92 actual Pounds 400,000), percentage gross margins of
30 (23) and profits before interest of Pounds 500,000 (nil).
Pre-tax profits would total Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.3m), sales Pounds 44.5m
(Pounds 40.5m) and earnings per share 26.4p (21.6p).
Cash balances were expected to stand at Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4.3m).
The directors would propose a final dividend of 4.5p (3.75p) making a total
of 7p (6p).

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland seeks SE listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITHLAND, the Midlands car retailer, is seeking a Stock Exchange listing
through a share placing which will give the group a market value of Pounds
21.4m.
The placing involves 18.5m shares, about 70 per cent of the issued equity,
at a price of 81p each. Of this, 12.34m will be new shares, the sale of
which will raise Pounds 9.05m net.
The balance of 6.1m shares is owned either by NatWest Ventures, Swithland's
venture capital backer for the past two years, or Mr John Hayes, the group's
founder and chief executive, and members of his family.
Ionian Corporate Finance is sponsoring the placing, for which the broker is
Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks.
Trading in the shares will start on November 15, provided buyers have been
found for the issue of new shares. If not, the issue will be cancelled.
If the offering is completely sold, the Hayes family's holding in Swithland
will be 29.96 per cent.
The share placing represents both re-financing of the group and clearance of
the decks for expansion.
Of the Pounds 9.05m raised, Pounds 0.5m will be used to redeem preference
shares held by NatWest Ventures, Pounds 322,000 to buy from Mr Hayes a piece
of land over which the group has an option and about Pounds 6m to retire
debt, reducing gearing from 240 per cent to 40 per cent.
The balance of the funds will be kept in reserve for expansion. 'Over the
next three years we're looking to acquire another 10 retail operations, all
within the Central TV area', said Mr Hayes.
Swithland now has 16 retail centres in the Midlands; it specialises in
selling nearly new and used cars and, to 85 per cent of its customers,
providing related finance.
Expansion will take place against the background of concentration in car
retailing. 'Groups have been getting bigger over the past two and a half
years. Over the next five to seven years, about 20 groups will emerge which
will dominate the industry,' Mr Hayes said.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rexmore stages strong recovery to Pounds
688,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of its lossmaking timber businesses coupled with a reduction in
interest costs helped Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, to achieve a
strong recovery with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 688,000 for the six months
to October 2.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 143,000 last time and losses
of Pounds 1.36m at the previous year end. Turnover for the 26 weeks amounted
to Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 20.1m - including Pounds 5.25m from
discontinued operations. Comparisons have been adjusted to conform with FRS
3.
Interest payments for the interim period were cut from Pounds 322,000 to
Pounds 177,000.
Further reductions in borrowings and interest costs will materialise from
operating profits and as the deferred consideration due from disposals is
received, said Mr Michael Rosenblatt, chairman.
All operations performed well and indications were that the improvement
would be maintained, he said.
The interim is raised by 43 per cent from 0.7p to 1p, payable from earnings
of 4.44p per share (0.83p losses).
The shares closed 11p up at 82p.
Mr Rosenblatt, who founded the company almost 50 years ago, is to step down
as chairman but will continue to serve as a non-executive director.
Mr Michael Rosenblatt will become chairman and Mr Norman Rosen, managing
director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED by lower interest charges of Pounds 237,000, against Pounds 368,000,
pre-tax profits of James Smith Estates, the USM-quoted property investment
concern, improved from Pounds 689,000 to Pounds 775,000 for the six months
ended September 24.
After tax of Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 229,000) earnings per share were 3.37p
(2.99p) while the interim dividend is increased to 1.55p (1.4p).
The directors pointed out that gross rental income was affected by the
incidence of a small number of voids and fell slightly from Pounds 1.18m to
Pounds 1.16m. However, they believed that full-year results would show a
resumption of rental income growth.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: B Elliott calls for Pounds 5.4m and
acquires dies maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
B ELLIOTT, the electrical and mechanical engineer, is acquiring Deeming
Taylor, the specialist dies and tooling products manufacturer, for a maximum
Pounds 771,500 in cash.
Partly to fund the acquisition the company is calling for Pounds 5.4m net
through a 1-for-3 rights issue of 9.1m new ordinary shares at 63p each.
Yesterday the shares closed 3p up at 75p.
The issue, which is fully underwritten by Beeson Gregory, is also offered on
the basis of one ordinary share for every 2.13, 7.5 per cent preference
shares.
B Elliott has also announced a turnround from restated losses of Pounds
764,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.26m for the six months to October 31.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 40.7m against Pounds 45.8m last time which
included Pounds 10.6m from discontinued operations. Operating profits from
continuing operations improved to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.5m).
Earnings per share worked through at 3.42p against losses of 57.44p last
time. There is again no dividend.
Mr Somerset Gibbs, chairman, said the company had made excellent progress
since completing the refinancing at the end of 1992, when 24.6m new shares
were issued.
As part of its restructuring programme the group's machine tool businesses
had either been closed or divested and that process had concluded with the
sale of the assets and under taking of Butler Machine Tool in February 1993.
The continuing businesses were performing to plan and proceeds from the
rights issue would also be used to fund the retention of the Philidas and
Newall businesses, Mr Gibbs said.
For the year to October 31 1992 Deeming Taylor achieved gross profits of
Pounds 353,000 on sales of Pounds 853,000. The net book value of the trading
assets, plant and equipment being acquired is expected to be a minimum
Pounds 394,000, including some Pounds 90,000 cash.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day reduces deficit to Pounds 2.09m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER CARR, chairman of Amber Day Holdings for just seven weeks, said he
believed that the decks had been cleared in the results for the year to July
31.
Pre-tax losses were reduced to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 7.75m), despite
exceptional costs totalling Pounds 8.99m.
The exceptionals represented the costs of the withdrawal from non-core
businesses and the settlement of contractual obligations to Mr Philip Green,
the ex-chairman and chief executive who resigned in September 1992, and Mr
Stacey Ellis, who resigned as non-executive chairman this August.
The discount retailer has been dogged, Mr Carr said, by its past reputation,
and the job of the new management team - which includes Mr Keith Paskins,
finance director - was to 'change shareholders' fortunes'. However, there
has been a 'significant' cut in the final dividend from 2p to 0.25p making a
total of 1.35p (3.1p) for the year.
The group has now stripped down to the What Everyone Wants retail chain
which at July 31 was 52-strong but now numbers 56. Two more will open this
month and a further six are planned for spring 1994.
Mr Carr said the business plan he and Mr Paskins had drawn up showed that
discount stores were the fastest growing retailing sector - at about 10 per
cent a year.
WEW's market share had been broadened by the recession as consumers had been
forced to hunt for bargains. Its operating profits in the year rose from
Pounds 10.1m (expanded by a Pounds 1m one-off profit) to Pounds 10.3m.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 106.1m (Pounds 96.5m) with Pounds 1.53m from
discontinued operations - the imports and distribution division and the mens
wear side. The former accounted for trading losses of Pounds 2.37m and
closure costs of Pounds 3.21m. The latter, sold in 1991, accounted for a
further Pounds 3.32m of exceptional costs, and Mr Green and Mr Ellis were
paid Pounds 1.13m and Pounds 500,000 respectively.
Group operating losses before interest shrank to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 6.91m)
and the retained loss for the period came to Pounds 4.74m (Pounds 13m).
Losses per share emerged at 2.72p (7.61p), though on continuing operations
earnings would have risen to 3.89p (3.86p).

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ashtead rights to raise Pounds 20.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHTEAD, the plant and machinery hire group, has announced a rights issue to
raise Pounds 20.4m to fund expansion.
Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, explained that the board had seen a 'window of
opportunity. The recession has shaken the plant hire sector to bits' and, as
a result, 'there is no shortage of businesses to buy'. With the bulk of the
money raised, he foresaw 'a series of acquisitions' in the UK. The group had
waited until now, he said, when vendors were becoming more realistic about
the value of their businesses.
A-Plant, the core business, currently has 57 outlets, or 'profit centres',
and Mr Lewis estimates it needs 130 for full national coverage.
Some Pounds 4m of the rights money has been earmarked to broaden the group's
Sunbelt Rentals operations in the south-eastern states of the US. So far,
expanding Sunbelt to six profit centres had been cautious, Mr Lewis said,
but the business had now reached critical mass. Ashtead planned to double
the six to 12 by April 1995.
About Pounds 500,000 of the cash raised will go towards the opening of an
office of Ashtead Technology, the offshore services arm, in Singapore, to
complement the operations in Aberdeen and Dubai.
Ashtead said that trading conditions had improved in the current year. In
the five months to September, turnover rose by 24 per cent, mostly through
volume growth. The group is highly operationally geared, so profits should
respond sharply. A BZW research note has lifted the profits forecast for the
current year from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 5.2m. Last time profits were Pounds
2.76m.
The rights is on a 1-for-3 basis at a price of 280p per new ordinary. It is
underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The shares closed at 324p, up 1p on the day.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Casket shrugs off slow start from
Lotus-branded cycles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROAD-GOING versions of the high technology Lotus bicycle on which Chris
Boardman won an Olympic gold medal last year are not yet in the shops to the
disappointment of Casket, the UK company which bought the LotuSport brand.
However, interim pre-tax profits jumped 20.3 per cent to Pounds 2.13m,
helped by FRS 3 which meant the company restated the comparative figure at
Pounds 1.77m to include one-off costs amounting to Pounds 167,000 relating
to reorganisation and closures.
Sales climbed from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 51.8m for the six months to
September 30.
The board declared an interim dividend of 0.4p (0.3p) out of earnings per
share of 1.89p (1.56p).
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the six Lotus-branded conventional
cycles that the company launched in the summer 'had got off to a slower
start than expected'.
He said: 'We had anticipated bringing them out with the road-going version
of the Chris Boardman Olympic bike. Sales of the conventional bikes were
always planned to revolve around them.'
He said Lotus had had a 'certain amount of problems in making a sensible
road bike'. Casket will assemble the top of the range cycles from components
designed by Lotus Engineering: 'Lotus Engineering wanted a perfect design
before it went to the market,' Mr Smith said.
The setback would not hit results since the premium products had expected to
give low sales.
The cycles division as a whole, which includes names such as Townsend,
Falcon and British Eagle, returned operating profits ahead at Pounds 2.58m
(Pounds 2.45m) for the six months to September 30 on sales ahead at Pounds
28.6m (Pounds 27.4m).
This year the company expects to assemble about 60 per cent of its units in
the UK against 37 per cent in the comparative period.
Casket said imported bikes were now subject to EC duties totalling about 50
per cent, including an anti-dumping levy, while components attracted much
lower rates.
The clothing division returned reduced operating profits of Pounds 273,000
(Pounds 336,000) on sales up at Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 22.7m) as market
conditions remained difficult.
Gearing fell to 78 per cent (91 per cent) at the half-way stage as net
assets increased to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 13.1m) and borrowings fell slightly
to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m). Interest cover rose to 3.9 times (3.1
times).

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Body Shop dispute in Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY SHOP International, the retail group which operates largely through
franchisees, has become embroiled in a dispute with the head franchisee of
its Singapore operation, where the group has 11 of its near 1,000 shops. It
has been in Singapore for 10 years.
Ms Anne Downer, the head franchisee in Singapore, has issued a writ against
Body Shop in London claiming damages after Body Shop instituted proceedings
in Singapore. Body Shop claims Ms Downer's right to operate the Body Shop
business in Singapore, and in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Taiwan, has been terminated.
Body Shop said yesterday that it disputed all of Ms Downer's claims. One
analyst said that Singapore was insignificant in group terms.
The dispute echoes an episode concluded in July last year when Body Shop won
back control of six of its UK shops operated by Ms Pauline Rawle, a
franchisee.
In its international operations, Body Shop has in recent years been pursuing
a policy of moving to have each country's franchise operated locally rather
than grouping countries together.

CAPITAL House Investment Management, a division of Royal Bank of Scotland,
said it had acquired Brown Shipley Unit Trust Managers, which has Pounds 70m
in assets.
Capital House has also acquired Pounds 100m of Brown Shipley's institutional
funds, bringing its total of funds under management to just under Pounds
5bn. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
The acquisitions are part of Capital House's strategy of growing through
acquisition. Earlier this year it acquired the fund management businesses of
two UK life insurance companies.
Capital House will retain three of Brown Shipley's unit trust staff,
including its two leading fund managers, Mr Christopher Bomford and Mr John
Cornes. The company said that in line with the recent trend in the unit
trust industry, it would merge some of Brown Shipley's existing unit trusts
into its own funds.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Coal Investments bullish on prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of Coal Investments, the former Geevor group whose shares will
recommence trading tomorrow, has told shareholders that pits acquired by the
company will make operating profits immediately.
In a bullish statement, Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial
director, also predicted that the steam coal market in England and Wales
would exceed 50m tonnes by the middle of this decade, at the top end of
market expectations.
With imports expected to be low 'we are satisfied there is sufficient scope
for several efficient mines to operate profitably alongside British Coal
mines servicing core contracts (with generators).'
The shares are returning to the market following their suspension 18 months
ago at 4.75p. However, it is a considerably different company following Mr
Edwards' appointment as chairman and a restructuring.
A recent extraordinary meeting agreed the acquisition of a company which
owns the Cwmguili mine in south Wales and the raising of Pounds 1.35m
through a rights issue and shares placing.
Coal Investments will acquire any rights that arise from applications made
by Edwards Energy, a company owned by Mr Edwards, to operate five collieries
owned by British Coal.
Mr Edwards said the acquisition of mines should be complemented by the
development of inter-related businesses, including coal distribution in the
UK, coal trading overseas, and 'cautious investment' in coal mining
overseas.

ABACUS GROUP, a franchised distributor of electronics components, is coming
to the market via a placing of shares valuing the company at Pounds 40.6m.
A total of 10.71m shares, 37 per cent of its enlarged capital, have been
placed at 140p by NatWest Markets. The price represents a p/e of 18.9 and a
notional gross dividend yield of 3.1 per cent for the year ended September.
The flotation has raised a net Pounds 3.1m of new money which will be used
to repay a majority of Abacus' debt.
The company, which holds 25 distribution franchises from manufacturers such
as 3M and National Semiconductor, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.98m
(Pounds 1.76m) for the year ended September and earnings per share of 7.4p
(4.3p) on turnover of Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 23.4m).
Abacus was the subject of a Pounds 3.4m management buy-out led by Mr Brian
Murdoch, its current managing director, and three colleagues in 1989.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen ahead to Pounds 12.6m - Sales
reach Pounds 59m thanks to the Far East and North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of
screening and stone crushing equipment, yesterday reported a 12.5 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits helped by strong sales growth,
particularly in the Far East and North America.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 11.2m to
Pounds 12.6m - the 11th successive increase.
Turnover on continuing activities increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 59.4m
against Pounds 51.3m, which included Pounds 5.92m from discontinued
operations.
Earnings per share rose to 10.8p (9.7p) from which the interim dividend is
being raised to 2p (1.8p). The shares closed up 3p at 372p.
Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, attributed the profit improvement to the
success of the group's strategy of focusing on its core manufacturing
activities.
He said this had resulted in each subsidiary, with the exception of CPV
which was acquired in September last year and therefore made no contribution
to last year's interim results, producing increased turnover.
Powerscreen International Distribution, the biggest subsidiary which
manufactures screening equipment, managed to lift its turnover by 15 per
cent to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 18.9m) buoyed by increased penetration of the
Far Eastern market and the continued recovery in North America. Unit sales
rose from 613 to 710.
Sales of a new jaw crusher launched in February, together with an upturn in
the UK crusher market helped Brown Lenox lift its sales by 18 per cent to
Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 11m.)
However, Matbro, which was acquired in 1991 and makes telescopic handling
machinery for the agriculture and construction markets, recorded the biggest
relative increase in turnover helped by strong exports to continental
Europe. Sales jumped by 66 per cent to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.91m).
The introduction of the sub-contract labour system at Finlay, which
manufactures washing and screening equipment, lifted both turnover and
profits. Sales grew by 32 per cent to Pounds 7.71m (Pounds 5.51m).
The latest profit figures come after Pounds 700,000 of reorganisation costs
related to CPV, which manufactures pressurised vessels mainly for the
chemicals and food industries.
Overall, Mr McKeown said group order books remained strong, buttressed by
new products and strengthened dealer networks. The group ended the period
with net cash of Pounds 21.4m, up from Pounds 16.7m at the end of March.

FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti asks banks for further Pounds 7m
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI, the troubled defence electronics group, has asked its banks to
provide an additional Pounds 7m in funds while it seeks to persuade
shareholders to accept GEC's 1p-a-share bid.
Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti's chairman, said yesterday he was optimistic
that the banks would respond positively to Ferranti's request 'by the end of
this week.' The group made a presentation to the banks on Monday.
He added that the need to seek additional bank funds highlighted the
seriousness of Ferranti's position and reiterated that the only alternative
to GEC's bid, however unpopular, was receivership.
Nevertheless, Mr Anderson acknowledged that the recommended GEC offer faced
a number of significant 'hurdles,' not least the opposition of some
individual shareholders. About 10 per cent of Ferranti's outstanding equity
is held by some 40,000 investors.
Many individual shareholders have reacted angrily to the token offer by GEC
which promises them just Pounds 10m while at least Pounds 110m will go to
the banks. They have commissioned Katz Associates, a City investment
consultancy, to explore alternatives to the GEC bid.
GEC has made it clear that it is seeking the acceptance of at least 90 per
cent of all classes of shareholders for the bid.
Ferranti has a particularly complicated share structure, and this
requirement is acknowledged to be a significant obstacle by Ferranti. But
one Mr Anderson maintains must nevertheless be overcome.
Mr John Katz, who heads Katz Associates, met Mr Anderson on Monday to convey
shareholders' concerns about the terms of the bid. Mr Anderson in turn
emphasised that there was no alternative bidder for the group, and that the
GEC offer was 'better than nothing.'
Mr Katz said after the meeting that he had not been 'pacified.' However, Mr
Anderson said Ferranti planned to try and persuade shareholders to back the
GEC bid through a communications offensive, which would probably be launched
over the weekend.

FT  03 NOV 93 / MEPC doubles exposure to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, is to pay Pounds 115m for
American Property Trust, a unit trust controlled by UK pension funds that
owns two shopping malls in the US.
The acquisition is the first significant move by a UK property group into an
overseas market for some time, as the recession has put most companies in
the sector on the defensive.
While analysts say the APT acquisition is unusual because MEPC is paying a
discount to net assets, the deal shows that some property companies may be
beginning to consider buying assets once again, having bolstered their
balance sheets.
It doubles MEPC's exposure to the US property market, where it already has
interests in shopping malls. By issuing paper to pay for the deal, MEPC does
not expect to deplete greatly the Pounds 222m it raised in July through a
rights issue.
MEPC says the deal increases the proportion of assets in retail, rebalancing
the portfolio in line with a commitment made at the time of the rights
issue.
For APT's pension fund unit holders, the deal significantly increases the
liquidity of their investment while leaving them an interest in US property.
MEPC will be issuing up to 22.65m new shares but APT unit holders will be
able to take cash for up to 20 per cent of the consideration. The unit
holders have agreed not to sell their shares for at least 12 months. MEPC
will also take on Dollars 176m (Pounds 119m) of borrowings and preferred
stock in UK-American Properties, APT's main US investment vehicle.
In the year to June 30, APT had pre-tax income of Pounds 4.4m and year-end
net assets stood at Pounds 145.6m. The pricing represents a discount of just
under 10 per cent on the gross property value.
MEPC said the acquisition would enhance earnings per share and net assets
per share this financial year.
Mr James Tuckey, managing director, said the properties were expected to
yield about 8 per cent in their first year and at least 9 per cent
thereafter.
The two US shopping centres - one in California, the other in Georgia - that
make up most of APT's assets have a combined leaseable area of more than
2.5m square feet. The deal lifts the retail content of MEPC's portfolio to
31 per cent from 26 per cent.
MEPC said gearing would not be materially affected by the deal and the group
could make further acquisitions.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Lloyd's trusts press on with capital raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPONSORS of two of the biggest investment trusts at the Lloyd's of
London insurance market will today press ahead with plans to raise some
Pounds 400m in corporate capital, despite setbacks to smaller schemes in the
last few days.
Backers of the larger schemes, sponsored by Samuel Montagu and Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, will issue prospectuses today and are confident about raising
capital from a range of institutions, including pension funds and life
assurance companies, as well as retail investors.
Successful launches will bolster confidence in Lloyd's corporate capital
initiative, following yesterday's decision by Johnson Fry, the financial
services company, to scrap its Pounds 50m Corporate Insurance Recovery
Trust, which offered retail investors participation in a range of Lloyd's
funds. Johnson Fry blamed the 'limited time frame'. The trust raised Pounds
8m out of its minimum subscription level of Pounds 15m.
London Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit), sponsored by Samuel
Montagu and James Capel, will be the biggest of more than a dozen investment
trusts and companies seeking to raise at least Pounds 1.3bn for Lloyd's.
Names - the individuals who have traditionally supported the market's
capital base - approved plans to invite new corporate members last month.
Limit is aiming to raise Pounds 280m from about 60 institutions and retail
investors for a fund which will allow 98 syndicates to underwrite up to
Pounds 480m in premium income. 'We wouldn't be doing this if we were not
certain that we were going to find placees,' said Sir Laurie Magnus, a
director of Montagu.
The CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by BZW and backed by a subsidiary of
Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, has scaled back its capital raising
target from Pounds 200m to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m. This was
mainly because of difficulties in securing sufficient 'good quality'
capacity on Lloyd's syndicates, said Mr Michael Wade, CLM chief executive.
Like Limit, CLM will also target retail investors, including opening a
'share shop' in the Lloyd's building.
Johnson Fry's scheme was focused exclusively on the retail market. Mr
Charles Fry, chief executive of Johnson Fry, said that demand from private
investors 'is certainly there' and that 'with a longer subscription period,
we would have reached our targets.'
Two other Lloyd's agencies - Sturge Holdings and London Wall - have
abandoned plans to develop trusts with stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson and
Beeson Gregory respectively, mainly because anticipated shortages of
capacity have not materialised.
Last week another fund, HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust, scaled back its
capital raising efforts after institutions did not respond as well as
expected. Nevertheless HCG still raised Pounds 65m and two other funds -
Hiscox Select Insurance Fund and Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust -
experienced no difficulty in each raising Pounds 30m.
Six more trusts plan to issue prospectuses in the next two weeks, aiming to
raise capital through private placements and offers for sale via
intermediaries.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Sid urged to apply for share deals sans frontieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH farce yesterday took to the City of London to make the serious point
that British punters could profit as France privatises up to FFr360bn
(Pounds 42bn) worth of state-owned companies - thanks to European Community
rules.
A woman dressed up as a French onion seller handed out leaflets offering
this advice to commuters hurrying to work along Threadneedle Street.
The stunt was encouraging retail investors to exploit the European
Community's regulations which outlaw discrimination of any kind against the
nationals of one member state who apply for shares in the privatisations of
other member states.
This makes Sid eligible to apply for shares in an estimated Pounds 17bn of
companies due to be privatised in EC countries this year.
Of this total the French programme is one of the biggest and most
attractive. The leaflets were offering 'free advice' to UK nationals
interested in buying shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, due to
be privatised this month.
The government is committed to transferring at least 21 companies to the
private sector over the next five years.
The French economy ministry confirmed that retail investors who are EC
nationals are eligible to apply for shares in the tranche of equity
available to private investors. Applicants must have bank accounts in
France.
Under UK law the Rhone-Poulenc securities may only be offered for sale to
professional investors, although private investors are not prevented from
taking the initiative to apply through a bank or broker in France.
The stunt may rebound on its instigator, Mr Roger Trotman, a chartered
accountant and the sole trader behind Sutton-based Gloucester Trotman.
Last night the Institute of Chartered Accountants was studying his
'investment advert': 'We are looking at it from a regulatory point of view,'
a spokesman said.
Mr Trotman, who has formed a link with a French stockbroker to ensure
clients experience a smooth transaction, said he was not offering to sell
shares: 'I am simply offering a basic background of the details of the offer
and who to contact to take it further.'
This service was free but anyone who chose to use the French broker would
face administration charges, he said.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Pension fund as financier to public sector deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's pension funds have neglected to cultivate a powerful democratic
constituency which might offer protection against the whims of their
political lords and masters. Will they now pay the price?
A month ago the trade association for Europe's occupational schemes, the
European Federation for Retirement Provision, sent up distress signals from
Brussels. The new directive on pension fund investment, progressing slowly
through the European Commission, had been hijacked. Instead of delivering
the promised freedom of investment policy the directive might impose new
restrictions on funds in states where no serious constraints at present
exist.
Now the British funds are getting into their own domestic panic ahead of the
Budget on November 30. The UK's schemes in aggregate represent some 60 per
cent of the European total (although the Dutch and Danish funds are bigger
in relation to GDP). British funds were already hit for Pounds 600m last
March in Norman Lamont's Budget, when he cut the tax they could reclaim on
UK company dividends.
The initial lack of protest last March, when the pension funds at first
dismissed the change as an unimportant technicality, has now made them into
a soft target for a second raid. If tax relief on dividend income were
totally withdrawn, possibly over two or three years, the eventual annual
cost would be about Pounds 2.5bn.
Right across Europe, not only are governments reluctant to extend tax
reliefs but they see pension funds, where they exist, primarily as vehicles
to finance public sector deficits. Hence the row over freedom of investment.
Even the normally tolerant Dutch government, which allows private sector
funds to invest more or less how they please, has cavilled at the
prospective loss of the giant civil servants' fund ABP as a captive bond
investor.
It is easy for governments to dress up self-interested restrictions on the
basis, for instance, that they promote prudence, and therefore protect
pensioners. Even Norman Lamont was cheeky enough last March to claim that
his dividend tax measures were introduced to help corporate cash flow.
The underlying rationale for funded schemes (as opposed to pay-as-you-go
alternatives) is, however, that they create an extra flow of capital for
investment. This will either raise the domestic economic growth rate or, if
domestic opportunities are unattractive, will be channelled abroad and
finance a pool of overseas assets. Either way, the burden of paying for
future pensions will be reduced.
But only in the UK, where 57 per cent is invested in domestic equities and
30 per cent in overseas assets, has this been taken to anything like its
logical conclusion. The Germans, true, plough large sums back into company
balance sheets through the book reserve approach; but where separate funds
exist in Germany they can invest no more than 30 per cent in equities and 5
per cent abroad.
But if pension funds buy government bonds there is little long-term
justification unless the money is invested in physical infrastructure or,
just arguably, human capital. The danger now is therefore that governments
will view pension schemes as the convenient dumping grounds for otherwise
unsaleable debt. Certainly the Pounds 50bn a year now being raised by the
British government is almost entirely absorbed by current spending, with
very little investment content. Already, however, there is a larger tax
break for UK pension funds on government bonds than on equities, and the
pensions directive, as currently drafted, would allow the British government
to set upper limits on exposures to equities and overseas assets.
Some 23m Europeans are beneficiaries of funded pension schemes. Yet few make
any connection between size of their pensions and the regime of regulation
and taxation that governs the investment of the assets. It has suited the
sponsors to design their schemes so that the members are kept ignorant and
passive rather than knowledgeable and potentially troublesome.
But will half-hearted lobbying through official channels really be effective
when the politicians will respond only to the sight of thousands of scheme
members angrily on the march?

FT  03 NOV 93 / Daimler says it may cut dividend

DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, has warned that it may
reduce its dividend for 1993, apparently in response to mounting discontent
among the workforce.
Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, said in a radio interview that while the
company would try to avoid 'bitter disappointments' for shareholders,
employees could not be expected to be the only people to make sacrifices.
The prospect of a dividend cut was raised despite the company's claims for
most of this year that it would try to hold the pay-out at last year's DM13
 -drawing on reserves if necessary.
Daimler, embracing Mercedes-Benz, AEG electrical engineering and Deutsche
Aerospace, has recently provoked anger among its workers with plans to
extend an already heavy job cutting programme. The proposed closure of six
Deutsche Aerospace factories, service and logistics centres led to
widespread labour unrest, including demonstrations and warning stoppages.
All operating divisions are expected to incur heavy losses this year, and
the final result will be worsened by a DM1.5bn (Pounds 600m) charge for
rationalisation.
Daimler, reporting for the first time according to US accounting rules,
incurred a net loss of DM949m in the first half of this year compared with a
net profit of DM965m in the same period last year.
The group has ample reserves, including more than DM8bn in appropriated
retained earnings revealed in connection with its recent listing on the New
York Stock Exchange. Markets had been led to believe these would be used to
maintain the dividend, bolstering the group's attractions in advance of a
rights issue planned for next year.
It appears the board has now decided an unchanged payout would be
inappropriate while 44,000 jobs were being cut.
Analysts suggested a DM3 reduction to DM10 would be 'psychologically'
suitable while anything less would be cosmetic.
Daimler shares closed DM4.5 higher at DM752. Even so their progress lagged
well behind the blue-chip Dax index which closed at a record of 2,095.58,
and the gain was eroded in after-hours trading.

FT  03 NOV 93 / France and Germany set out economic convergence plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY and France yesterday jointly presented the broad outlines of
proposals to bring their economies together as part of plans for European
economic and monetary union by the end of this decade.
The joint presentation was designed to give some public impetus to economic
convergence, prescribed by the Maastricht treaty which came into force on
Monday.
However, it coincided with the emergence of serious differences within
Germany's coalition over European integration. Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian
prime minister and a powerful political figure in the Christian Social
Union, said the idea of Europe as a federal state was finished. The CSU is
sister-party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the
coalition.
The plans for economic convergence were released after a meeting of the
Franco-German Economic and Financial Council in Berlin, comprising their
finance and economics ministers and central bank presidents.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said plans to converge the French
and German economies by 1996 were 'crucial for the success of economic and
monetary union' among European Community member states.
French and German finance ministers plan to give more details of the plans
to their EC colleagues at a general discussion of European economic
convergence on November 22.
Germany has made little change to its earlier plan to bring its budget
deficit, currently the equivalent of 4 per cent of gross domestic product,
to within the 3 per cent guideline laid down in the Maastricht treaty by
1995. By contrast, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, and Mr
Nicolas Sarkozy, the French budget minister, set out for the first time
yesterday their country's medium-term goals.
Mr Sarkozy said France intended to reduce its budget deficit, around 4.5 per
cent of GDP, to about 2 per cent by 1997. The only previous indication which
prime minister Edouard Balladur had given of his government's medium-term
planning was a promise to reduce public borrowing to 2.5 per cent by 1997.
French and German ministers agreed that their economies should aim for 3 per
cent growth from 1995 onwards. French ministers said they were assuming
French growth would be between 2.8 and 3.5 per cent from 1995. They have
predicted that the French economy will contract by 0.8 per cent this year,
but expand by 1.4 per cent next year.
German growth is forecast at minus 1 per cent this year and plus 1.5 per
cent in 1994.
According to the Maastricht treaty, EC governments would make their first
assessment of whether their economies are ready for monetary union in late
1996.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC's shareholders may think it odd that just as the UK property market
starts racing away with itself their company decides to buy two shopping
centres across the Atlantic. Yet, MEPC is chiefly funding the deal with
paper. Thankfully, it is retaining most of the proceeds from its recent
Pounds 222m rights issue to refurbish its UK portfolio and make selective
acquisitions.
Moreover, MEPC sees scope to lift the shopping centres' yield to more than 9
per cent, increasing their capital value. It suggests this can be achieved
by raising leasing levels above 95 per cent and marketing the centres more
effectively. Any pick up in California's dull economy would also help, given
that rental payments are related to turnover. Yet many will doubt the
ability of an overseas investor to make capital gains in the ferociously
competitive US property market. The US has certainly proved a graveyard for
many UK investors.
But if MEPC's shopping centres do disappoint they are unlikely to inflict
much harm. The share issue will represent less than 6 per cent of its
enlarged equity base. Besides, MEPC's shares - like those of most other
property companies - are currently so highly rated that it would be a
challenge to buy anything that did not enhance earnings and assets per
share. That raises the suspicion that similar deals may follow. But it will
be difficult to find many pension funds willing to sell properties at a
discount to net asset value in exchange for paper which trades at a premium.

FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Muramoto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market barely flinched in its first trading session after
the failure of Muramoto Construction, an unlisted company but one with bank
debts of an estimated Y590bn (Pounds 3.7bn). Its insouciance may be partly
explained by the fact that Muramoto's debts have been parcelled out evenly
among its 50 or so lenders, so that none of them is in serious danger
despite the write-offs.
Yet it is worrying that such a small company, only Japan's 24th largest
construction group, can produce a collapse nearly half the size of Olympia &amp;
York and with so little warning. One can only guess at the liabilities
hidden in contractors many times Muramoto's size. Clearly, Japan's banks
need to root out problem loans and write them off fast, instead of seeking
to disguise them in their accounts as they have done so often in the past.
Present incentives are inadequate. The Co-operative Credit Purchasing
Company, which enables banks to speed up tax write-offs by selling bad loans
and buying them back at a loss, is only attractive to larger banks with cash
to spare. Financial market confidence also depends on support for smaller
fry, like Nanto Bank, the regional lender which is among the most exposed to
Muramoto. Perhaps the Bank of Japan should extend additional support in the
form of cheap loans, or Japan's notoriously tight-fisted tax office could
offer more generous tax treatment on write-offs.

FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is clearly plenty of pain to go round at Daimler-Benz. Mr Edzard
Reuter, the company's chief executive, admitted as much when he said that
shareholders as well as staff would have to suffer the pangs of
restructuring. At one level that hint of a dividend cut might be viewed as a
realisation of the depth of Daimler's difficulties. Yet the reasons for Mr
Reuter's statement are perhaps themselves a concern. If his purpose was to
soothe opposition from the workforce, then he may not have yet persuaded the
staff that radical surgery is needed. Having allowed costs to drift for too
long, Daimler can hardly afford protracted internal debate or lengthy
industrial action.
Most of Daimler's markets remain depressed. Airline losses may be slowing,
but new aircraft production is still being cut - particularly at Airbus -
and defence spending continues to fall. AEG consumer goods business is
wilting and its ICE train is losing out to the French TGV in export markets.
Daimler-Benz cars are too expensive to produce compared to the competition.
All of Daimler's operations suffer from the strength of the D-mark.
Besides, the company is hardly alone in its effort to cut costs. Its
Japanese competitors face equally hard markets and are busy retrenching too.
The risk is that most of the efficiency gains will be ceded to customers in
lower prices. Even if the plan works and the company can get back to peak
earnings of around DM 70 a share by 1996-97, the shares hardly look cheap.
That, and a lower payout, should give investors pause for thought if the
rights issue hat is passed round next year.

FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Massaging expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has a delicate task in presenting its latest views on
inflation. It would not presumably wish to risk a row with the chancellor if
he asks for interest rates to be cut in connection with the budget. But the
underlying rate of price rises has accelerated over the past three months
and the bank has to admit to the chance of the government's inflation target
being breached as a result of tax changes due to come into effect next
April. So it must also be concerned about its credibility in the fight
against inflation.
The report gets round this dilemma by forecasting that inflation will start
to fall again in the middle of next year and that any rise meanwhile should
be regarded as just a blip. That way the option is left open for a budget
rate cut to offset any fiscal tightening, even if this goes against basic
instincts. The bank's longer term forecasts, which show inflation slap in
the middle of its target range, lead to the claim that rates are about right
where they are.
Well, it would say that, wouldn't it? The main worry is that of preventing a
higher headline rate translating into higher inflationary expectations with
consequent pressure on wages. The bank admits that a higher real exchange
rate as a result of interest rate cuts abroad would help reduce inflationary
pressures. It follows that it would be reluctant to do anything which might
cause the exchange rate to wobble. Since Britain's manufacturing base is so
atrophied, it might easily think any possible contribution to growth from
exports boosted by a lower exchange rate is not worth the risk of higher
import prices.

FT  03 NOV 93 / De Benedetti under house arrest: Charge sheet describes
Olivetti chairman as 'socially dangerous'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo De Benedetti, one of Europe's best-known and wealthiest
businessmen, was placed under house arrest shortly before midnight after
being interrogated in prison by Rome magistrates investigating political
corruption.
Earlier, a visibly shaken Mr De Benedetti was driven to the capital's Regina
Coeli prison after giving himself up to police in Milan.
The detention followed the issue of a warrant at the weekend by Rome
magistrates against the Olivetti chairman, who has been implicated in
Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal. After two rounds of
questioning lasting until late last night, Mr De Benedetti was allowed to
leave jail for house arrest.
In the formal charge sheet prepared by Ms Maria Cordova, the investigating
magistrate in charge of the case, Mr De Benedetti was described as 'socially
dangerous' and accused of corrupting public officials for the past 10 years.
Until now, Mr De Benedetti has taken the line used by many other senior
businessmen caught up in the corruption scandal: that kickbacks were paid
only after repeated demands by public-sector officials and politicians, and
were essential for their companies to win business from the state.
That line of defence satisfied Milan magistrates, who interrogated Mr De
Benedetti in May. At that time, in a highly embarrassing admission just days
after asserting the opposite to Olivetti shareholders at its annual meeting,
Mr De Benedetti disclosed to Milan magistrates investigating post office
corruption that Olivetti had paid bribes.
The case is now being led by magistrates in Rome, who, contrary to the
decision of their Milan colleagues, have sought Mr De Benedetti's arrest.
The Rome magistrates say new evidence has come to light, suggesting that Mr
De Benedetti has held back information.
According to widely leaked comments in the press, the Rome judges argue that
Mr De Benedetti himself sought to corrupt officials. They claim to have
unearthed new evidence that the kickbacks stretch back much further than Mr
De Benedetti has admitted. Olivetti and Mr De Benedetti's lawyers have
strenuously denied such claims.
However, his incarceration has once again highlighted differences between
Milan and Rome magistrates in handling the political corruption scandal.
Some observers have suggested that the Rome magistrates, previously attacked
for dragging their feet compared with their northern counterparts, are now
trying to show their commitment.
It has even been suggested that politically motivated magistrates in Rome
have used a leading businessman such as Mr De Benedetti as a scapegoat to
get back at Milanese colleagues.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Steady Eddie at the bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE George, appointed this summer as governor of the Bank of England,
is working hard at his reputation. The new governor has assiduously
cultivated an image as an inflation-hater. But words alone will not persuade
the financial markets to forget the fact that his tenure as the Bank's
deputy governor coincided with one of Britain's two most destabilising
inflationary booms since the second world war.
Not that Mr George was personally responsible for the policy errors of the
late 1980s. But the scars clearly run deep, as does his determination not to
see the same inflationary mistakes repeated. Hence his warning, at the end
of last week, that a further cut in interest rates might not be compatible
with the government's target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per
cent a year. Now that the UK has a golden opportunity to lock into low
inflationary growth, he is not going to see the opportunity thrown away.
Curiously, the same defensive caution does not shine through the pages of
the Bank of England's latest inflation report. The Bank has clearly gained
in stature over the past year, while the quality of its quarterly inflation
report has boosted its analytical reputation in comparison with the
Treasury's monthly monetary report. But the Bank's report does not, at least
at first sight, appear to constitute the brief from which Mr George was
reading last week. If the government was considering a further cut in
interest rates to coincide with the Budget, it will find little in the
report to deter it.
The inflationary outlook, the report suggests, looks promising. Labour
market pressures are subdued, inflationary expectations have eased
substantially since the early summer, monetary growth is consistent with the
government's inflation objectives and there is room for several quarters of
above-trend growth before the economy will show any signs of overheating.
'There is a slight possibility that in the first half of next year inflation
will rise above the top of its target range,' the report acknowledges,
citing the end of summer price discounting, the effects of increases in
indirect taxes and the impact of the switch from the community charge to the
council tax. But, 'excluding those taxes, inflation is expected to start
falling in early 1994, and could reach a level close to the middle of the
target range in 1995'.
The Bank's analysis highlights two risks: first, that the government will
not take sufficient action to reassure bond markets by closing the fiscal
deficit; and, second, that tax rises to close the deficit will prompt
wage-bargainers to seek compensation and thus feed inflationary
expectations. Reassuring the financial markets on the deficit is chancellor
Clarke's territory.
Further fiscal tightening is almost certainly necessary, and the chancellor
would be wise, both economically and politically, not to delay the medicine.
But if he is considering a cut in interest rates to ensure that the recovery
is not aborted in the process, then, with the necessary caveats about being
prepared to react to future inflationary pressure, the report effectively
gives him a green light.
Presumably Mr George agrees with the Bank's analysis. So his statement last
week demands a more subtle interpretation. The governor is surely correct
that a cut in interest rates, without a substantial fiscal tightening, would
be a grievous error. But a cut in interest rates, balanced by tax increases
and combined with a commitment to raise rates if wage inflation starts to
pick up, would not jeopardise Mr George's anti-inflationary objectives. It
is this option that Mr Clarke should take.

FT  03 NOV 93 / On opposite sides of the great divide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marcy Kaptur from Ohio and Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma might seem prototypical
Clinton new Democrats, write Nancy Dunne and Jurek Martin.
She is 47, the same age as the president, a House member since 1982, while
he is 43, and from the class of 1980; like the president both studied at
British universities, she doing town planning at Manchester, he economics at
Edinburgh; she is from a union district, he from a union family; and both
are ambitious: she has her eye on the Senate next year, while he has already
considered running for the presidency and last year promoted himself for a
post in the Clinton cabinet. Yet Nafta divides them absolutely.
Ms Kaptur, a leader of the opposition, regrets having to fight Mr Clinton.
'It would have been nice after 10 years here to have had a Democratic
president who agreed with me on the most important issue in my district.
Nafta, though, is a life and death issue to us,' she says, citing the job
losses in her Toledo constituency.
She is proud of being a liberal and resents being called a protectionist.
'Trade can bring freedom,' she argues, 'but it can also bring exploitation.
If people do not have fair wages, free elections, rights of assembly, a
judicial system with fair trials, you have exploitation - and we will be a
party to it.' She sees nothing wrong with hemispheric free trade, so long as
it is linked to democratic reforms.
Her criticism of Mexico goes far beyond its democratic shortcomings. On two
recent visits she was shocked by what she saw. 'They have no running water,
no heat in winter, no electricity unless they have batteries.' Once, she
says, Mexican government agents trailed a delegation of congresswomen on a
tour south of the border and nearly ran one of them down.
To Dave McCurdy, a border state moderate like Mr Clinton, the Nafta debate
is all about the past (ageing, uncompetitive industries) versus the future
(a high-skilled, high-wage economy). 'The problem is that the
protectionists, isolationists and xenophobes who are building the case
against it are really basing it on fear of change and the unknown.'
Combative by nature, he was sufficiently unafraid in September to raid the
home turf of the Nafta opposition - a local General Motors plant - to hand
out leaflets. 'The management loved it. I'm not sure the workers did, but
they'd been getting their information only from one side.' Ross Perot ran
strongly in his district last year.
He has travelled a lot to South America, where he sees democracy taking
roots, 'though some of the sprouts are fragile'. He is impressed by changes
in Mexico. 'Ten years ago it was an anti-US command economy, socialist in
nature.' President Carlos Salinas 'has taken on the old system with a great
deal of courage. He deserves to be rewarded for that.'
He understands why some fellow Democrats find it hard to support Nafta,
especially after the great budget battle this summer. 'Some caught a lot of
grief back home and they're tired of explaining tough votes. But there are a
few of us who are committed to these free trade principles.'

battle to guide Nafta through the US Congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'They'd sell off bits of the White House lawn for a vote if they could'
 - Jim Jontz, head of the Fair Trade Campaign against Nafta 'It's one
president, all the living former presidents, 41 governors, 14 Nobel
Laureates and 284 economists versus Perot, Buchanan and Brown; it's your
choice'
 - Mickey Kantor, US trade representative
Barring the unforeseen, the latest addition to the matriarchy of all
political battles will be finally decided on November 17 when 258 Democrats,
175 Republicans, and one independent in the 435-member House of
Representatives (there is one vacant seat) vote on whether to approve the
North American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Mexico and Canada on
January 1. A simple majority of 218 is all that is needed. If it passes, the
Senate will almost certainly follow suit; if it fails, the upper chamber
does not have to act.
The stakes are enormous - for the political credibility of President Bill
Clinton early in his term and for the legacy of President Carlos Salinas as
he nears the end of his, for the evolution of the Mexican and US economies,
and for a global trading structure in which a Uruguay Round agreement
scheduled to be reached by December 15 may be unattainable if Nafta goes
down.
Conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war
now going on in pursuit of the 218-vote nirvana. More Republicans, perhaps
as many as 120 according to congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, far fewer
according to Mr Jim Jontz, a former congressman from Indiana, will vote for
than against, not least because the original Nafta was negotiated by the
Bush administration. This leaves Mr Clinton needing at most 40 per cent of
his own party to triumph - and therein lies the problem.
For the Democratic coalition that just - by one vote - sustained the
president in the great budget battle against unanimous Republican
opposition, is in tatters. In July it was the 'new' Democrats, especially
moderates from the south, who deserted Mr Clinton while the old liners -
labour, liberals, blacks - held their noses and held fast. On Nafta, the
positions are in good measure reversed.
According to Ms Lori Wallach, a leading co-ordinator of the 'anti-'
campaign, the 'no' camp already numbers 208-210 'including some leaners'.
Bill Daley, drafted from his Chicago domain to direct the 'yes' campaign,
disputes this estimate, counts about 195 in favour and says that some 55
Democrats are still undecided. Mr Jontz disagrees, reckoning there are now
more Republicans than Democrats on the fence. He thinks the freshman class -
66 Democrats and 48 Republicans - is particularly resistant to Nafta.
Both sides hail and blast each new convert. Democrat John Dingell of
Michigan came out for the 'noes' this week, but Mr Daley counters that he
could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different.
Ms Wallach is equally dismissive of the impact of the 'yes' declarations of
Democrats Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts and Esteban Torres from California.
The latter, she insists, probably could not carry the 18-member Hispanic
caucus.
The politics of Nafta have produced uneasy dalliances among political
heavyweights. In one bed lie the president, the Republican leadership,
including Newt Gingrich, a fervent conservative, the Senate majority leader,
the Speaker of the House, most leaders of big business, and some prominent
environmental groups: in the other can be found the House majority leader
(Richard Gephardt) and most of the Democratic House whips, including David
Bonior of Michigan, the chief anti-Nafta strategist, plus Ralph Nader, the
consumer advocate, most of the labour unions, Pat Buchanan, the right-wing
ideologue, and Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate.
Ms Wallach, who portrays the Nafta divide as one between 'populists and the
elites', says there is little top-level contact with Mr Perot, who first
spoke of the 'giant sucking sound' of US jobs going south to Mexico, but
that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses. Mr Daley
says that 'Perot's credibility is diminishing because he has become a
politician', an assessment borne out by several recent opinion polls.
Both sides agree that the role played by President Clinton himself is
crucial. 'He is my number one worry - never underestimate the power of the
presidency,' says Ms Wallach. He got off to a slow start. In the summer he
was consumed by the budget, and more recently distracted by healthcare,
Haiti and Somalia. Meanwhile the opposition was off and running early.
The administration pinned a lot of its midsummer hopes on Nafta's 'side
agreements', covering Mexican environmental and labour laws and guarding
against import 'surges', meeting most objections. But these were only
completed in mid-August, later than planned, and were only partly
successful. Six prominent US environmental groups came out in favour, but
union opposition became entrenched. Most important, Congressman Gephardt,
whose backing could probably have ensured passage, declared he was not
satisfied.
Mr Daley insists it does not matter that the president started late because
'in politics, decisions are only taken in the last few days'. Whatever the
merits of this argument, there is no questioning that the pro-Nafta campaign
is now in full swing, with plans that Mr Clinton himself do little other
than argue for the agreement in the next two weeks.
Every day brings a new media show. Last week saw Products Day on the White
House lawn, a display of 175 goods that would benefit from Nafta. Last
weekend the president went to Boston to maintain that JFK would have been
pro-Nafta. On Monday he appeared at an electronic 'town meeting' with
members of the American Chamber of Commerce. Later this week he is in
Louisville, Kentucky. On Sunday an hour-long TV interview is scheduled.
About twice a week he has 15-20 congressmen in his office for a Nafta
exhortation. He works the phones constantly, and all members of his cabinet
are fully engaged, sometimes inventively. Mr Kantor's latest pitch is that
Japan is against Nafta and would, along with Europe, seek to profit from its
defeat. The Nafta 'war room', operating out of the Old Executive Office
building next to the White House, co-ordinates it all and makes sure that
businessmen keep up the pressure on individual members.
Certain actions, both substantive and personal, get taken with Nafta in
view. Last week's creation of the North American Development Bank, with its
funds available for border clean-up, obviously helped Congressman Torres
come off the fence. At the other extreme, Congressman E Clay Shaw, a Florida
Republican, is demanding that the administration put pressure on Mexico for
the extradition of an accused rapist. Mr Daley says: 'We have made our views
known to the Mexican government on this, though they knew about it already.'
All this activity is matched with fervour and skill by the other side. Ms
Wallach claims to have kept a lid on vote switching. She points out that
Congressman Kweisi Mfume from Maryland, leader of the 38-strong black
Democratic caucus previously so loyal to Mr Clinton, is helping Mr Bonior
garner votes against Nafta, and that only one black congressman has come out
in favour. On broader policy issues, both camps were bombarding the media
with their respective spins after last week's Canadian election result.
'They've thrown everything at us, but it hasn't made a difference so far,'
she insists.
With two weeks to go, neither side will publicly admit the possibility of
defeat. Mr Daley says he will not sell the White House lawn, but seen
crossing it yesterday was a gaggle of living Nobel Laureates, including
Henry Kissinger, last seen being nice to Mr Clinton on Martha's Vineyard in
August. The grass seemed in place.

Japanese salarymen, believed to beat world records for workaholicism, may
soon be legislated into relaxing more often.
Some members of the new Japanese government think that too much work could
be a source of economic as well as personal exhaustion. So ministers agreed
yesterday to study proposals by Koshiro Ishida, a cabinet member heading the
management and co-ordination agency, to change the dates of national
holidays to Mondays or Fridays.
The aim is to encourage people to take long weekends more often, so that
they spend more money - badly needed in the recession - and 'enrich their
lifestyles', Ishida says. Japanese staff would never dream of using even a
mid-week public holiday as an excuse for an extra long weekend. Hence the
need for government action.
However, do not expect any progress today. This is culture day, when people
are encouraged to refresh their spirits with a good dose of art. But be sure
all will be back to work on Thursday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The city of Washington DC, whose depleted coffers are just a little fuller
today after the Israeli embassy forked out Dollars 63,000 in parking fines,
has Senator Jesse Helms to thank. For it was the ultra right-winger from
North Carolina who attached a rider to this year's US foreign aid bill
docking the amount of unpaid fines, plus a 10 per cent penalty, from the
assistance given to all recipients.
Presumably the fact that Israel, the largest beneficiary of US aid, was the
first to pay up was no mere coincidence. But, unfortunately for the
impoverished city, it is not the worst parking fine offender by a long
chalk. That accolade is reserved for the Russian embassy - even if much of
its Dollars 3.8m bill was clocked up by Soviet diplomats in the old days.
The Russians' excuse is that they are awaiting a new DC parking lot, given
Moscow did the honours for the US embassy last year.
Next in line comes the Nigerian embassy, which is incensed at its Dollars
77,830 bill. 'We do not park on fire hydrants,' Nigeria's press attache
Mohammed Sani complains.
'The bulk of the tickets are for expired meters. We are not parked at places
wrongly. There is just nowhere to park.' Obviously the same problem applies
in London. In 1992 Nigerian diplomats boasted 167 unpaid parking tickets,
making them the fourth worst offenders, after Turkey, Russia and France.

Why should an Irish horse-trainer be standing in a bar in Melbourne reciting
verses from A Bush Christening? Answer: it was Dermot Weld's damage-
limitation exercise in the wake of Vintage Crop winning the Melbourne Cup,
an Irish victory for the first time in the cup's history.
Vintage Crop, a 14-1 outsider, trained by Weld at The Curragh and owned by
Michael Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging impresario, won by three
lengths. To add insult to Australia's injury, Smurfit, who now lives in
Monte Carlo, was not even in Melbourne to collect the ADollars 2m winnings,
though his son and other members of the family were present.
Still, trainer Weld, who had obviously kissed the Blarney stone, impressed
his audience with his enthusiasm for Australia - begun as a child when he
was given a book of Banjo Paterson's verses, including The Man From Snowy
River. Meanwhile, in time-honoured tradition, business life ground to a halt
as all eyes turned to the finishing line. Who knows if it was the Irish
victory, but the stock market closed lower for the first time in a week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a visibly shaken Carlo De Benedetti who made his way yesterday to a
grilling in Rome's Regina Coeli prison on the shores of the Tiber.
The Olivetti chairman, fighting a separate legal battle over a six-year
sentence for his role in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in the 1980s,
faced questions about kick-backs to win public sector contracts, for which
the group allegedly paid about L10bn.
De Benedetti suffered the first embarrassment earlier this year after being
forced to backtrack on previous denials that payments had been made; now,
after the transfer of inquiries from magistrates in Milan to those in Rome,
comes the stigma of an interrogation in jail.
But at least the venue is appropriate. De Benedetti's inquisitors are
holding him in a prison that was once a convent - and both the investigating
magistrate and the public attorney who want to lead him to the confessional
for his putative sins are women.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN NORTH Korea threatened to become the first country to pull out of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty last March, alarm bells rang from Seoul to
Washington at the prospect of a nuclear arms race in east Asia. Although
Pyongyang withdrew its threat three months later after talks with the US,
the alarm about its purported nuclear ambitions is far from over. On
Tuesday, the UN General Assembly - by 140 votes to one - expressed concern
that North Korea is still refusing to allow full monitoring of its nuclear
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Today, Mr Les Aspin,
US defence secretary, is in the South Korean capital to discuss what to do
next about suspicions that North Korea is processing nuclear fuel into an
illegal stockpile of plutonium.
Pyongyang's defiance presents the world with a tricky dilemma. On the one
hand, it is vital to the credibility of international efforts against
nuclear proliferation that the IAEA be allowed to conduct unlimited spot
inspections of North Korean facilities. If not, suspicions that it is
violating NPT commitments will persist, with the potential to disturb the
regional strategic balance.
On the other hand, it is hard to see what more the UN can do to force rapid
North Korean compliance. Short of a lightning bombing raid on suspect
facilities - a course so perilous that no one is seriously contemplating it
 -economic sanctions are the weapon most frequently mentioned. But a
sanctions resolution would almost certainly fall to a Chinese veto in the
Security Council. And in any case, tightening the international noose on
what is already a pariah state would be at least as likely to result in
greater instability as to bring Pyongyang's paranoid leaders to their
senses.
Resolving the issue is complicated by the fact that no one can be certain
whether the North Koreans have any realistic prospect of building a bomb in
the near future, or what they ultimately want. It seems unlikely that
Pyongyang has stirred up the nuclear question purely for its own sake. More
likely, it is seeking, in return for opening up its facilities to
inspection, some concessions from the US: diplomatic recognition to match
Russian and Chinese recognition of South Korea, perhaps, combined with
cancellation of what Pyongyang sees as aggressive US military manoeuvres in
the south.
If that is the real aim, it suggests that the US, Japan and other interested
parties would be right to continue with their strategy of attempting to
negotiate with Pyongyang, rather than piling on more direct forms of
pressure.

THE LATEST problems with the proposed Renault-Volvo merger raise important
points of principle. In effect, the French government and Volvo management
are saying to the Swedish group's shareholders: trust us. We will conduct
the merger in a rational way. We will then privatise the result as soon as
possible.
Volvo's owners may be forgiven for hesitating: doubly so, given the French
government's damaging volte-face last week over Air France, whereby it
appeared to duck commercial realities in favour of political expediency.
From the Swedish viewpoint, consider what is at stake. The French government
argues, with some show of reason, that merger must come first, privatisation
second. Until the combination has been put in place, after all, it is hard
to set a value on the operation. But this necessarily means the process will
be at the mercy of politicians. This is not simply a matter of whether one
company's interests will be preferred to another's: that might happen in any
takeover. It is more a question of how far the merger will be structured in
the interests of votes rather than profitability.
The French could argue that the industrial realities point the other way.
Renault has undergone severe cutbacks since the mid-1980s. Between 1988 and
the end of last year, it reduced its workforce by 32,000. Granted,
non-French workers bore the brunt of these economies, but the Swedish unions
are apparently anxious enough about their future to carry on backing the
deal regardless.
The existence of a French golden share, which could in extreme cases reduce
Volvo shareholders' voting rights, is not calculated to soothe Swedish
sensibilities. But with a little good will, and some more concrete
assurances from the French side, none of this need be insurmountable. The
deal, after all, has one crucial argument in its favour: that its origins
lie in industrial rather than political logic.
This bears out a wider point: that the whole Renault-Volvo argument shows
why privatisation in Europe has become such an unstoppable force. Across a
broad range of industries - cars, telecommunications, computers, chemicals,
energy - mergers and joint ventures are becoming essential.
The reasons are various: recessionary pressure, the rising cost of R&amp;D, or -
as in telecoms - the changes brought by deregulation. In each case,
nationalised companies - awkward in their structure, doubtful in their
motivation - tend not to get invited to the party. The message for them is a
simple one: privatise or perish.

Sir, Liberty, the civil liberties group, is correct to suggest that personal
identification cards could be used to discriminate against certain sections
of society - those engaged in mischief. ('Plans for ID cards attacked,'
October 25).
For nine years I have lived as a British expatriate in societies which have
required me to carry their own identification papers. Magic] ID cards ensure
a swift passage through immigration; facilitate bank transactions; produce
registered mail from behind Post Office counters; smooth (as far as is
possible) relationships with the tax man; and even provide proof of
ownership for the dog's own, health-related, ID card.
IDs offer evidence of legal entry and authorised residence, and satisfy
policemen who use spot checks to 'discriminate' against criminals, drug
traffickers and illegal immigrants.
Resent my ID card? No. I wouldn't leave home without it.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Individual ways to coin it: Rising costs are forcing changes
in the financing of different welfare systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no single model of the welfare state in modern capital-ist
econo-mies. Different structures reflect the differing circumstances under
which countries created their welfare systems.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the pressures straining welfare states
across the world should manifest themselves in different ways. Each country
faces its own particular problems in funding pensions, social security and
health services.
Yet in dealing with the pressures, countries with very different benefits
systems are adopting similar solutions. There may be many more similarities
between the welfare arrangements of countries in the future than there are
now.
Welfare states fall into three broad types, according to Professor Gosta
Esping-Andersen, of the European university in Florence. He describes these
as the conservative, liberal and social democratic models.
The conservative model involves the sort of social insurance schemes found
in countries such as Germany, France and Italy. They were introduced by
governments such as Bismarck's in Germany in the 1880s, to reinforce society
and family life against the disintegrative pressures of the market economy.
Social insurance schemes focus mainly on employees, funding unemployment
benefit, sick pay and pensions through employer and employee contributions.
Strongly influenced by the social philosophy of the Catholic church, the
conservative model emphasises the role of the family, with family benefits
designed to encourage motherhood. Those outside the labour market, such as
women caring for children, often had few individual welfare rights.
The liberal model is based on the safety net approach to welfare, providing
state benefits for those in real need. Common in Anglo-Saxon countries such
as the US, Australia and New Zealand, liberal welfare states offer
subsistence benefits only to those whose means fall below minimum levels.
This reflects the belief of liberal economists that generous welfare
benefits will interfere with the efficient working of labour markets. It
also encourages the development of private welfare systems, with better-off
individuals either negotiating welfare benefits at work, or buying them from
insurance companies.
The third model is the Scandinavian social democratic welfare state, in
which all citizens have rights to benefits provided by the state out of
taxation. Benefit levels are usually generous. They are often related to
income, so that even middle-class professionals can rely on them.
This type of welfare state is typically underpinned by some sort of
employment guarantee, such as that, for example, which kept unemployment low
in the Scandinavian countries until recent years.
The architect of the social democratic model was Sir William Beveridge,
whose 1942 report provided the blueprint for a 'cradle to grave' welfare
state in the UK. This would not only redistribute income between those in
need and the better-off. It would also act as a savings bank, with
individuals paying in at times of prosperity and drawing out when sick,
unemployed or retired.
Yet shortage of funds is turning the UK social security system from a social
democratic model to a liberal one. An increasing share of welfare support
comes in the form of means-tested safety net benefits. These have been
insufficient for the people on higher incomes to live off, encouraging
private provision - particularly in pensions.
All three models of welfare state have run into problems as their costs have
climbed.
The first to feel the heat was the liberal model. Although less generous
than other types of welfare state, it is usually funded out of taxation. It
has therefore been an early casualty of the tax revolt in which better-off
voters have refused to support higher taxation to pay for the cost of a
welfare state from which they increasingly opt out.
Similar pressures have emerged in the social democratic welfare state, which
places enormous burdens on public funds. Countries such as Sweden were
initially able to fend off taxpayer revolts by generous provision for
higher-income groups. But the cost pushed tax rates to unsustainable levels,
leading to the election of governments committed to reducing welfare
benefits.
The conservative model is less susceptible to taxpayer pressure, since it is
largely paid for by employee and employer contributions. However, employers
have become concerned about the growing cost, which in Germany will next
year reach almost 20 per cent of earnings for both employees and employers.
Concerns over industrial competitiveness have forced such countries to
launch reforms.
Early responses to rising costs have reflected the particular
characteristics of the three models. The liberal system has found it easiest
to cut costs, through greater use of means-testing. Countries such as the
UK, US and Australia have also tightened up the rules for claiming benefits,
with longer waiting periods and closer scrutiny of claimants. Unemployed
people face more rigorous requirements to retrain and seek work. With
healthy private pension sectors, these countries have found it easier to
increase private provision.
Scaling down the demands of the social democratic welfare state has proved
more difficult. There is opposition from the losers, who include many in the
middle classes. Yet the level of benefits is being reduced in these
countries, and waiting periods for claiming them lengthened. Increasingly,
employers and employees are expected to make contributions to the cost of
benefits, as in other welfare states.
Countries such as France, Germany and Italy with conservative welfare
systems have attempted to control costs by weakening the social insurance
principle. Benefits are being reduced and no longer paid out as of right -
the unemployed must actively seek work to qualify. Coverage has been
extended to those not in employment. Some of the cost is being shifted from
social insurance to general taxation.
In the different types of welfare state, common themes are emerging as these
reforms progress. One is a greater emphasis on ensuring that social security
systems do not impede the reduction of unemployment. Lower benefits,
requiring the unemployed to undergo training, and workfare-type policies
involving work in return for benefits, are all designed to boost employment
levels.
Another is increasing pressure for people to make their own provision for
welfare. It is still largely the Anglo-Saxon countries that offer incentives
for private provision. But reductions in benefits in other countries will
encourage individuals to do more to provide for themselves. So, too, will
moves to restrict indexation of pensions to retail prices, which reduces
pensions as a proportion of average earnings.
A third theme is a widening of the funding base for public welfare schemes.
Countries which relied on employer/ employee funding are shifting some of
the burden to the government to control overall spending. Those that relied
on taxpayers to fund welfare are asking employers and employees to pay more
to reduce the fiscal pressures.
It is too soon to say that the welfare states of the advanced economies are
converging on a single model of provision. But most OECD countries are
looking to a mixture of welfare funding that includes contributions from the
state, employers and employees. Welfare benefits will be extended to all
citizens, though perhaps at less generous levels than in the past. Across
the advanced economies, individuals will increasingly have to complement
public welfare provision with their own resources.
This is the second article in a series on welfare states across the world.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Arguments for auditors' limited
liability do not hold water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government is facing pressure to limit the liability of auditors
within the UK. This, it has been suggested, might be achieved by allowing an
auditor to agree with the company and shareholders a fixed-figure limit for
liability by repealing Section 310 of the Companies Act 1985.
The justification for this seems to be, first, the large number of big
claims made in the US; second, the effect this has had on the global
indemnity insurance market; and, third, that the offshore mutual insurance
companies formed by the Big Six or Big Eight have been denuded by claims.
These arguments do not hold much water on inspection. First, the particular
legal structure and litigious nature of the US makes its experience
inappropriate for an EC member state. Second, the professional indemnity
market does take account of national differences, and, third, as the
financial status of the mutual insurance companies is not publicly
available, the validity of the last argument is not questionable.
Furthermore, the office of auditor is not like other contractual providers
of services. Dry cleaners may limit damages that can be awarded against them
on ruination of your Armani suit, but dry cleaners are not indirectly
regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry, and do not owe their
existence and income to government itself. The licensed monopoly on the
function of auditor is a privileged status for which the government should
continue to insist upon unlimited liability. A cap would devalue the
judgmental nature of the 'true and fair' view.
When government interferes in the market, the effect on competition should
be reviewed. Would the quality and the level of service be helped or
hindered by a cap on audit liability?
The lack of a cap means one of the major firms could become insolvent
leading to a major shakeout of that firm's clients and the ruination of the
partners. Such an insolvency might be beneficial since medium-sized and
other specialist players might be encouraged to enter the market for audit
of listed companies. The collapse would also encourage the unbundling of
services, and perhaps the level of standards of the remaining participants
in the market would improve.
Proponents of capping think that the more risky type of enterprise might
have set for it a high limit which would reflect the danger. The current,
somewhat random basis of charging audit fees suggests this is wishful
thinking. It seems to me that, the riskier the firm, the more likely the
limit would be set at the minimum level.
In conclusion, my feeling is: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The present
system has lasted well enough for more than 100 years, and there seems to be
no real pressure for change from the business community or from the public.
Parliamentary time could be well spent on simplifying legislation.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Rule by number not OK: Voting cannot change an ethnic
identity, in Belfast or in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My identity is 'national'. Yours is 'ethnic'. Those people over there are
'tribal'. No doubt there are text-books that define those three adjectives,
and distinguish them by objective criteria. But in everyday usage they
express a value judgment, or even a political prescription.
The word 'national' implicitly asserts a right to statehood. Irish
nationalists, for example, are people who are proud to be, or think they
really should be, citizens of an Irish state. A 'national minority' is a
group whose members do not share the national identity of the majority of
their fellow citizens. They may accept that situation as tolerable, but in
their hearts they identify with another state - which may already exist on
the other side of a frontier, or may as yet be only a dream.
If I call such a group an 'ethnic minority' I am implicitly distancing
myself from those aspirations. By calling someone an 'ethnic Hungarian', for
instance, I am saying: 'This chap likes to think of himself as a Hungarian,
and we must respect his culture and identity, but of course he is a Romanian
(or Slovak or Serbian) citizen and there is no question of that changing.'
So 'ethnic conflict' is something regrettable, in which the speaker is
implicitly neutral; whereas a 'national struggle' is something heroic, in
which there are goodies (a nation defending its right to exist and the
rightful frontiers of its state) and baddies (an imperial power denying that
right, or an aggressor violating those frontiers).
As for 'tribes', they are definitely uncivilised. A 'tribal' conflict is not
merely regrettable but deplorable and irrational. If I refer to 'tribal'
behaviour in a European context there is a strong overtone of racism: I am
saying that people who behave like that are not truly European. And if I
call a group's aspirations 'tribal', I imply that they need not be taken
seriously.
Most English people think of Northern Ireland as tribal. They see the
violence there as profoundly irrational; they make no distinction between
the different groups engaging in it; they tend to see Northern Irish society
and culture as producers of violence, more than as victims of it; and they
have little patience with, or interest in, the political programmes of any
of the Northern Irish parties.
Actually the issue in Northern Ireland is simple. It is a conflict between
rival national or (if we wish to be superior and neutral about it) ethnic
identities. One side feels Irish and would like to be part of a united
Ireland, though it is deeply divided about how feasible that is as a
political objective, and about what means are legitimate, or likely to be
effective, in pursuing it. The other side is deeply confused about its
national identity (British? Scots? 'Ulster'?) but is absolutely clear that
it is not part of the Irish nation and does not want to be part of the Irish
state.
The British instinct is that the matter should be settled in a sensible
British way, by a show of hands. Thus successive British governments have
said that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK so long as that is
what the majority wants, and at least twice this century referendums have
been held to make sure that the majority has not changed its mind.
Ironically the same mistake was made, with even more disastrous
consequences, by the European Community when it called for a referendum
before recognising the republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina.
It is a mistake to suppose that such questions can be settled by majority
vote, because the notion of a majority vote (and even more so that of
majority rule) presupposes the prior consent of the minority to be bound by
the result. In other words, both sides have to form part of a pre-existing
political community, committed to stay together whichever way they go. If no
such community exists, you cannot call it into existence simply by
establishing that one side is more numerous than the other - a fact that
both sides are usually well aware of already.
Democracy is not the same as demography. Even if, by virtue of differential
birth and migration rates, the Protestants one day find themselves the
minority in Northern Ireland, they will not thereby be convinced that they
should accept Irish unity or that it is a good thing - any more than their
grandparents were convinced by the fact that they were a minority in Ireland
as a whole.
Indeed, it is probably the fear of such a scenario, rather than 'blind'
revenge for IRA atrocities, that motivates the growing number of murders by
Protestant paramilitaries. Mowing down innocent people in a village in
County Londonderry, where Catholics and Protestants mix and Sinn Fein
scarcely gets a vote, makes no sense if the object is retaliation against
the IRA.
But it does make sense, in a horribly familiar way, if the object is to
drive the two communities further apart, persuading both that they can feel
safe only in ethnically homogeneous and militarily defensible territorial
blocs. 'Ethnic cleansing' is the ghastly price some people are prepared to
pay, or to make others pay, rather than let themselves be dragooned, even by
the ballot-box, into a nation-state they do not recognise as theirs.
How wise, then, of Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, to make the
consent of the unionist community, rather than simply of a majority in
Northern Ireland, one of the six 'guiding principles' for an agreement which
he set out last week. The Irish conflict is not about majorities and
minorities; it is about the co-existence, peaceful or otherwise, of people
with sharply different national identities.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The fight to close an unacceptable
pay gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MERIEL SCHINDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Landmark equal pay ruling is welcomed' (October 28),
highlights the immense difficulties faced by women who seek to bring equal
pay cases. It is surely unacceptable that Dr Pamela Enderby has had to fight
eight years even to establish her right to have her case heard by an
industrial tribunal. Every year, women lose out because of sex bias in
employment.
Women's work remains undervalued and underpaid. Across the board, women earn
only two-thirds of a man's average wage. Women continue to earn less than
men in both low-paid, low-status jobs and higher paid jobs. Equal pay
legislation has been in place for more than 20 years, yet the pay gap
persists, encouraged by a government which chooses inactivity over equality.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chunnel link needs bold move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R M BOSTOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There can be no doubt that the planned high-speed rail link between the
Channel tunnel and London could be a showpiece for the government's
initiative of attracting private capital to public infrastructure projects
('Chunnel link', October 29).
We believe it is important for the government to come up with a scheme for
introducing private sector entrepreneurial skills, management disciplines
and capital into this transport infrastructure project at an early stage.
In October 1991, the secretary of state announced the government's
preference for the route on the lines put forward by Ove Arup &amp; Partners;
this was a route approaching central London from an easterly direction. At
the same time he requested British Rail to develop this route to a standard
at which he could safeguard it. The route corridor has now been identified
and largely accepted through a successful public consultation process
carried out over the past six months by Union Railways, a subsidiary of
British Rail.
For the high-speed rail link to progress without delay now requires some
kind of joint venture between the private and the public sectors along the
lines outlined by the Treasury in its March 1993 guidance notes. This has to
be the most appropriate vehicle for the government to take the project
forward through its parliamentary process. Such an arrangement would require
the government to shoulder the political risks and the private sector
participant to develop the business aspects. These would include proposals
for full financing and would include the form and amount of the public
sector contribution. All the project risks other than the political ones
could be carried by the joint venture. The government's equity interest
would be disposed of at the time of full financing after Royal Assent.
The challenge facing the Treasury is to devise a method for selecting an
effective and credible private sector participant which would create strong
ownership of the project with the government. Such a venture should be put
in place now as the project goes to parliament in March 1994. Without a bold
initiative, doubt will remain about the effectiveness of the government's
intention of attracting private capital to public infrastructure projects.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Stiffelio' at the Met - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Met, as at Covent Garden, early Verdi suddenly seems to matter. I
Lombardi is to be presented by the company for the first time in December;
Stiffelio has just opened in a production which, at least in textual terms,
goes a step further than last season's Royal Opera House version towards
restoring the work that the composer refashioned as Aroldo in 1856, after
several years of having his original bowdlerised.
What we were hearing, indeed, was the first performance anywhere of what he
wrote. At its premiere, in Trieste, the piece was stymied by censorship
(unsurprisingly, given that it is set in Austria and puts clerics, albeit
Protestant clerics, on the singing stage), and in subsequent revivals the
minister Stiffelio became a prime minister, necessitating the wonderful new
title of Guglielmo Wellingrode. The Aroldo adaptation has generally been
regarded by Verdi experts as a desperate attempt to retrieve a messy
situation, and certainly the resulting score remains the least loved of
Verdi's post-Rigoletto operas.
According to those same experts, Stiffelio, written immediately before
Rigoletto, is the real thing. For them, then, this will have been an
occasion of some moment. Here at last is the piece, with the music not used
in Aroldo - music long thought ditched or lost, and recoverable only from
copies - played from a new edition that has benefitted from the rediscovery
last year of the autograph material.
Whether Stiffelio will now become as familiar as La Traviata, or even La
forza del destino, is, however, uncertain. It's a strange piece. Some of the
orchestral writing seems frankly experimental - not so much in the overture,
which is a miscellany (little wind pipings cruelly hard to play, a broad
trumpet tune, a bright unashamed dance), but certainly at the start of the
second act, where a moonlit churchyard calls up chromatic curlings from
divided strings and a jamming of unlike themes, or in the third, where
dissonance is an emblem of the doubt felt by two audiences - that in the
church on stage, and that in the theatre - as to what Stiffelio will do and
say when he goes up into the pulpit after the catastrophes that have
abruptly befallen him: learning of his wife's unfaithfulness, and having his
conciliation pre-empted by his father-in-law's murder of her lover.
Another curiosity of the opera is that these things aren't substantiated by
what we see. The lover, Raffaele, is an exceedingly shadowy figure. In the
first act he features prominently in just one tiny scene; in the second his
main function is to prompt the lady, Lina, from her cantabile into her
cabaletta; and in the third he gets killed almost without opening his mouth.
One has the impression of a character who is refusing to take part for fear
of incriminating himself. His silence, and his burying of himself in the
work's majestic ensembles (other characters are buried there too: Dorotea
and Federico), help to create the pall of guilt that gives the opera, right
from the start, a quite particular colour.
Or maybe this is only the pall of our own ignorance of the work, though I
doubt it, since Verdi seems here to be placing us quite actively in
ignorance, so that we may sympathise with Stiffelio in his gradual awakening
to the truth, and also in his moral resolve to deal with the present and not
rake over the past.
The role is, again, unusual. Lyricism is the way Stiffelio behaves under
delusion: in a beautiful barcarolle near the start, with an orchestra
mellowed by horn tone, he tells of seeing an amorous escapade which he does
not know involved Lina and Raffaele. Thereafter, along the line of his
discovery and self-discovery, his big numbers are all duets and ensembles,
and his vocalism becomes urgent, declamatory, baritonal. The part could have
been made for Placido Domingo at this point in his career: what might
otherwise be faults - the hefty projection, the top beginning to waver -
become the means by which he conveys the man's solidity holding against
extremes of pressure. There is no refuge here in piety: his great cry of
'Sacredote sono]' (perhaps not the likeliest words for Piave to have put
into the mouth of a Protestant pastor) sounds out with the force not of
self-restraint but of self-realisation.
The other leading principals in this production are Sharon Sweet as Lina and
Vladimir Chernov as her father Stankar. Ms Sweet makes a big and often
beautiful sound: she has no trouble in scaling above full ensembles, but she
does have problems when something more gentle might be useful, or something
more accurately on the note. Chernov, though asking our indulgence at the
opening performance on account of a throat infection, gave a magnificent
performance: his grey, severe tone was vigorously focused, his phrasing
pliant and moving, his pacing of the large-scale third-act aria unerring.
James Levine, conducting, lets us enjoy the score's extravagances and even
its banalities. The production is strong in both these categories too.
Michael Scott provides sets in the Met's fossilized naturalist manner (a
vast Gothick panelled library for most of the indoor action, a light-filled
creamy church interior for the final scene); Giancarlo del Monaco's work as
director is in the same vein.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Arts: Try the taste, for starters - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with television these days is the sheer quantity. Take a break
and when you come back there is so much to catch up on that the benefit of
the holiday rapidly evaporates. You can expect no sympathy, of course, if
you complain about being paid to watch television, yet a sense of panic can
set in when you sit down with the Radio Times at the beginning of a week and
realise just how much has to be watched. Even with three video recorders for
evenings when there is a four-way clash at 9.30, you still find yourself
hunched, red eyed on the old green sofa, zapping from one channel to
another, forever convinced that you are missing a masterpiece somewhere. The
danger is that in trying to get a taste of everything you do not get the
true flavour of anything. Still, in Week 1 of the return there was really no
choice: widespread sampling was a necessity.
MONDAY. BBC1's Watchdog under its new presenter Anne Robinson looks as
though it may be turning into yet another example of a 'people show' instead
of the consumer series it used to be, but we shall need to see more to be
sure. BBC2's The Incredible Shrinking Politicians is presented, of course,
by Martin Jacques. 'Of course' because nothing is so slavishly trendy as
television and left winger Jacques has taken over from left winger Peter
Kellner as flavour of the moment for political programmes. He is personable
enough but currently ridiculously over exposed. Moreover his thesis here,
that politics is in long-term decline, seems doubtful. More likely a blip on
the historical graph.
TUESDAY. Anyone who thought that the Beadle shows reached the limits of
cringe-TV ought to glance at The Hypnotic World Of Paul McKenna on ITV. It
is difficult in a free society to defend the now defunct IBA rule banning
hypnosis programmes; if the victims are willing and paid who are we to act
as nanny? Yet I would no more watch this voluntarily than pelt a victim in
the stocks. Without Walls on C4 has become just about the best culture
series on television. The item 'Reith To The Nation' seems unsure whether to
tackle the condition of the BBC or the weirdness of Lord Reith as revealed
by Ian McIntyre's recent book, but it succeeds moderately in both. Tony
Parsons' blast at Kubrick for banning A Clockwork Orange from British
screens is an excellent example of the arts polemic we have come to expect
from this series. It looks as though the second batch of Between The Lines
will confirm this BBC1 production as much the best current police series . .
. even if the idea of a cabinet minister removing his secretary's bra in
front of a brightly lit un-curtained window is laughable. You might have
thought it difficult to make a character as odd as Houdini vaguely boring
yet Omnibus manages it. Pirates And Emperors - Who Is The Terrorist? on C4
has a single unoriginal point to make but makes it well: that today's
vilified terrorist is tomorrow's respected government minister.
WEDNESDAY. The best comment about Margaret Hilda's appearance in Thatcher:
The Downing Street Years is made by Kenneth Clarke during an engrossing Late
Show on BBC2 which discusses history as print and as television. She is like
a jet turbine, he says: while an internal combustion engine can work at
various speeds, she is only capable of operating at 30,000 lb thrust. No
book will ever achieve what BBC1's Thatcher series is managing in conveying
the attitude, tone and presence of the former prime minister. On the other
hand it is hard to see the value of The Almost Complete History Of The 20th
Century on C4 which dubs 'funny' lines on to archive newsreel.
THURSDAY. The producers of The Music Game on C4 seem to have noticed that My
Music was hugely popular for many years even though the participants were
not great musical experts. Unfortunately they appear to have missed the fact
that Muir, Norden and the others were charming, funny and unusually
inventive. BBC2's Red Dwarf has always contained the sort of jokes which
delight first year undergraduates after they have drunk 12 Budweisers and,
judging from today's episode, this sixth series is not even up to that
standard . . . yet who would miss it? Gags in deep space make such a
refreshing change from Ding Dong Honey I'm Home. How splendid to discover
that I did miss today's episode of Absolutely Fabulous on its first
transmission: with Jennifer Saunders being so clever and Joanna Lumley
proving not just outrageously fanciable but such a natural comedian it is a
superbly entertaining series. Lumley's dismount from the motorcycle was the
highpoint of the week. In World Chess why does C4 not tell us the score to
date? Could it be such a disaster for Short that they do not dare? Having
been away perhaps I shall never know.
FRIDAY. ITV's drama series Demob, starring Griff Rhys Jones and Martin
Clunes as a couple of inept comedians in the postwar music hall, is
workmanlike and contains a straight (well, semi straight) performance from
the late, great Les Dawson. Yet the time drags and I cannot see myself
watching next week's episode. Eurotrash on C4 with Antoine de Caunes and
Jean-Paul Gaultier competing in zer farnee aggzents competition and items
concentrating on sexual trivia (the pubic hair stylist, a new show at the
Folies Bergere) is the sort of zany time-passing programme which you watch
late in the evening when there is nothing worthwhile elsewhere. Late Night
With Conan O'Brien on BBC2 proves that, with Johnny Carson gone and David
Letterman switching networks, the American chat show is in deep trouble.
O'Brien is awful and the show, because it seeks nothing from its guests,
even worse. Pessimistic reports about Danny Baker's new show filtered back
as far as Umbria, but surely his series must be better than this.
SATURDAY. It is. In fact, Danny Baker After All (BBC1) is very good Saturday
night entertainment, and if they manage to find one guest in six who is as
good a raconteur as Rik Wakeman today, this could become as big a draw as
the early Parkinson. Earlier in the evening Harry looks like a too-carefully
contrived vehicle in which Michael Elphick can merely carry on from his Boon
character, this time as a rough diamond journalist; formula drama which may
sustain the ratings but will never tell us anything we did not know about
the human condition. DA Pennebaker's documentary on BBC2 about the Clinton
election staff, The War Room, is good but not great. We have seen much of
this sort of material and you have to do something more unusual to stand out
nowadays.
SUNDAY. In the early evening there are three documentary series which could
keep me hooked for weeks. Theatre School on BBC2 may be at its most
fascinating in this opening episode with the auditions and some pretty
brutal interviews, but it is very nicely edited and promises much. If, like
me, you have bought and driven old German motorbikes then you will devour
every minute of C4's Classic Motorcycles and if not you will probably be
bored to tears; it seems to be dictated entirely by the availability of
archive footage. Locomotion on BBC2, however, is not solely for steam train
freaks since it seems far more concerned with the social implications of the
development of the railways, which makes a change. With Scarlet And Black
(what happened to the definite articles?) BBC1 faces a tough job: proving
that it really is best when it comes to the classic literary adaptation.
Stephen Lowe's decision to insert Napoleon into his dramatisation as a sort
of Tinkerbell, flying around offering our hero terse advice, scarcely makes
matters easy. But Stendhal was a good storyteller, the casting of Alice
Krige as the beautiful young wife, ripe for a love affair, is spot on, and,
apart from some nasty background music, all the ingredients are in place:
carriages, outsize top hats, sylvan idylls straight out of a margarine
commercial, and plenty of upstairs-downstairs jiggery pokery. A hit.

<TEXT>
What price beauty in times of poverty? Why work to revive the art of the
past when deprivation is all around? With lyricism and with poignancy, this
play by Mario Vargas Llosa addresses these questions. It has no answers;
this is not (thank heavens) a didactic play. At times, indeed, it is hardly
a play - more a great swelling funeral ode for the culture of the past. But
one watches it with a very full heart. A work of art is a testament to the
glory of the human spirit. How then can men so readily let art be destroyed?
Alas, they do so all the time.
Professor Brunelli, 'the madman of the balconies', is an old Italian who
lives in a scruffy old district of Peru and who, as old houses are destroyed
to make way for modern high-rise tenements, dedicates his life to saving
their balconies. Each old balcony is an example of artistic traditions that
speak of generations of Spanish and Arab craftsmanship - that speak of the
cross-cultural paths of culture itself. The professor leads a crusade of
enthusiastic young boys and old women - a crusade that fails. Modern town
planners reject the balconies as antiquated, native South Americans revile
them as examples of cultural imperialism, the old ladies are scared away by
the dangers of the slum districts, and the Professor's own daughter blames
him for sacrificing her life to his cause.
This Gate staging has designs by Marjoke Henrichs of aching beauty - with
shards of old-gold balconies in layer upon layer, foreground, midground,
background, against dazzling azure. Hettie Macdonald, directing, has caught
a sense of South American culture by qualities of intonation and gesture
throughout her cast of 15. She fills the stage with such depth and breadth
of character and colour that we are often contentedly suspended in a
situation that is nearly plotless.
The performance is dominated by Peter Eyre, who makes the Professor as
cultivated, as quaint, as significant, as one of his balconies. He rises to,
and reveals, the lyric threnody of Llosa's text with the greatest vocal
distinction. He employs an old tenor voice - now reedy, now mellifluous, now
suddenly descending into a deep, mellow baritone - and effortlessly strings
three or more sentences together on a single breath: all of which conveys
not virtuosity but feeling. Much of the play consists of his soliloquies -
which often are his tender address to the city of Lima itself, 'my little
whore'.
I wish the Gate supplied its audience with more information about this play
 -its date of composition, its previous performances, and so on; but I can
object to little else. The Gate's reputation is largely built upon its
stagings of foreign plays by dead authors, and it is good that (since Llosa
is alive and kicking) this production reminds us that the Gate also honours
world drama of the present day. Llosa never tells us that his balconies
symbolise anything. It is enough for him to make the Professor's world real
to us: admirable. Still, we may certainly take those balconies as symbols.
And among other things they symbolise the art of the Gate itself - the
little theatre that in impoverished conditions struggles to revive the past,

If you happen to be a soccer fan (you are? Well, it takes all sorts ..) you
have your work cut out. Professional spitting, shin kicking and team-mate
kissing will be featured in a two-hour Sportsnight Special (7.00) on BBC1
which covers Norwich v. Bayern Munich; in another two-hour slab on ITV, The
European Match (7.10) showing Arsenal v. Standard Liege; and in a 60-minute
programme, also called The European Match (ITV 10.40) which promises
highlights from all over the place.
For people with a different taste, Bookmark sends out Julian Symons in
search of traces of his elder brother AJ Symons who wrote 'The Quest For
Corvo', still in print 60 years after it was written, though its author has
been dead for 50 years (BBC2, 8.00).
Dispatches (C4, 9.00) appears to be aimed expressly at FT readers. It
investigates the managers who run our pension funds and discovers 'how the
unscrupulous can misappropriate funds entrusted to their care'.
BBC2 begins its four-part version of The Buddha Of Suburbia by Hanif
Kureishi, who wrote 'My Beautiful Laundrette' (9.25).

FT  03 NOV 93 / Management: Rewards for the top performers - Lucy Kellaway
asks if incentive plans are really all they are cracked up to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eat your greens and then you can have an ice cream. Do your homework and
then you can watch television. Work harder and then you can have a bonus.
The notion of offering a reward for good behaviour is embedded in
Anglo-Saxon culture. Parents do it and so do companies. Performance-related
pay, bonuses or other forms of incentive scheme are used by most British and
US companies. Those that do not are regarded as being in the managerial dark
ages.
Imagine the outcry when a respected management theorist suddenly announces
that all such reward systems are bound to fail and should therefore be
removed. Writing in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review, Alfie
Kohn argues that at the heart of performance pay lies a mistaken view of
what motivates people: rewards do not change attitudes or commitment to any
task. They simply, and temporarily, change what we do.
Kohn draws on dozens of studies in the US which show that at best rewards
buy short-term compliance. The more complicated the task, the more
ineffective the reward. He argues that incentives are equally hopeless at
motivating senior and junior employees. Both on the shop floor and in the
boardroom rewards are powerless to increase results. Surveys have failed to
establish any link between top pay and company performance.
Kohn cites the example of a mid-western manufacturing company, where an
incentive system for welders was suddenly dropped. Productivity fell
initially, but after a few months was back where it had been before.
Six reasons are advanced to support his thesis:
Pay does not motivate people. Studies have shown that if you halve
somebody's pay you demotivate them, but if you double it the reverse does
not happen. Moreover, if you ask people what matters to them most in their
jobs, money usually comes well down the list.
Rewards are like punishment. Managers have long known that punishment is
ineffective, but rewards are just as manipulative of employee behaviour.
Those who do not get a reward may feel as if they have been punished.
Rewards destroy co-operation between employees in the scramble to compete
for them. They also encourage people to suck up to the boss.
Rewards mask what is happening in a company. Managers frequently use rewards
as a substitute for dealing with the problems that cause low productivity.
It is easier to offer a reward than to treat workers well, to give them
feedback, support and freedom.
Rewards discourage people from being imaginative and from taking risks.
Instead, employees focus narrowly on the criterion for the reward, and may
even falsify records to ensure the reward is theirs.
Rewards divert attention from the job in hand, by encouraging workers to
concentrate on the reward rather than on the work. If the work is seen as a
means to an end, it becomes less desirable.
Kohn is not a lone voice. Other management thinkers in the US - such as
Robert Fritz, a composer turned management guru - are reaching the same
conclusion. He argues that people are really looking for involvement, not
for reward. 'If you have been raised to think: what's in it for me, you
can't be involved. Companies should encourage people to play the game for
its own sake,' he says.
Kohn's article, however, has drawn an angry howl from more traditional
management thinkers. Those who make a living from selling such incentive
schemes have been left apoplectic with rage. G. Bennett Stewart III of Stern
Stewart, a financial advisory firm, fears the very future of capitalism is
at stake. He has written to the Harvard Business Review protesting that: 'A
world without A's, praise, gold stars or incentives? No thank you, Mr Kohn.
Communism was tried and it didn't work.'
Jerry McAdmans of the US consultancy Performance Improvement Resources
claims that 'Kohn's article is a provocative exercise in attention getting
and niche marketing'.
Others have taken issue with parts of Kohn's thesis, while admitting that
there is good sense in some of it. Andrew Lebby of the Washington DC-based
consultants The Performance Group argues that although money is not a
motivation it may be valued by employees as a sign that employers appreciate
their work.
Still others dispute the notion that concentrating on money detracts from
the job itself. One reader quotes the poet Anne Sexton: 'I am in love with
money, so don't be mistaken. But first I want to write good poems. After
that, I am anxious as hell to earn money and fame and bring the stars all
down.' Another disagrees that incentives encourage employees to undermine
each other, arguing that rewards for teamwork are the answer.
It is one thing to dismiss incentives, it is another to come up with an
alternative system. Michael Beer, professor at Harvard Business School,
assumes the answer cannot be to pay everyone the same and offers his own
solution. Managers should not use pay as a means of motivating, but should
pay people equitably. There should be no quarterly or annual bonuses.
Instead, he argues, the best 10 per cent of employees should be rewarded for
outstanding, long-term performance. The worst performers should be 'weeded
out'. All the others should be praised and have their contributions
recognised.
Rather than hand out rewards, Kohn believes companies should offer employees
better job content, a share in the decisions and a climate of support. But
there is no hope of that as long as they go on treating their people like
pets.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Management: Rewards for the top performers - The curious
appeal of UK performance-related pay schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance-related pay in the UK is a puzzle. There is overwhelming
scepticism about its effects on performance, yet its progress seems
unstoppable.
Over the past few years this may owe something to government patronage as
PRP has been, or is being, imposed on the civil service, the NHS, the
education system and now the police force.
Yet government patronage is only part of the story. A 1991 study by the
National Economic Development Office found that about half of all
private-sector organisations in Britain were using PRP for some staff and
more than one third had been doing so for more than 10 years.
Despite its long pedigree there is considerable muddle about what it is and
how widely it has spread. PRP - not to be confused with profit-related pay,
which attracts various tax advantages - could cover anything from piece work
for manual workers, one-off merit pay schemes, or simply the promotion of
good performers to higher-paid jobs. But in practice it has come to describe
the linking of all, or part, of an individual's pay rise to a formal
performance appraisal system.
The most recent research from the Institute of Manpower Studies finds that
more than two-thirds of all UK organisations now have individual-based PRP
for at least some of their staff. The majority of schemes apply to managers
or valued 'core' staff, but the trend of the past few years has been for the
system to trickle down to white-collar staff.
It is still relatively unusual for manual workers, although Nissan's British
assembly plant is an exception, and the real extent of PRP can be easily
exaggerated. A glance at the government's latest New Earnings Survey shows
that productivity/incentive pay for all non-manual employees increased from
2.6 per cent of gross earnings to 3 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
It is difficult to tell how much of that 3 per cent is PRP as the NES does
not break down incentive pay into different categories. But even if PRP
accounted for a good part of it, it would still be far less than the
productivity pay arrangements that in 1993 accounted for 5.3 per cent of
manual workers' pay.
Also, although two-thirds of all organisations may have some form of PRP,
when settlement groups within organisations are examined, as they are by the
Industrial Relations Services pay databank of more than 1,000 such groups,
PRP coverage falls to only 20 per cent.
Nevertheless, PRP is on the march in the private and public sectors, and
most companies in sectors such as building societies, banks and insurers
have PRP for all their staff and usually for the whole pay rise.
Little work has been done on evaluating the effectiveness of schemes but,
according to the last IMS case studies, PRP does more to demotivate than to
motivate staff and neither helps to retain high performers nor dispatch poor
performers. Other studies find that the motivational effects of PRP are, at
best, neutral.
What explains its continuing popularity? First, for government ministers and
private-sector managers the introduction of PRP is a powerful signal for a
broader change of business culture. And it is often accompanied by other
moves towards individualising employer-employee relations - such as
team-briefings, profit-sharing and health schemes.
Second, as organisations become 'flatter', stripping out layers of
management, the ability to reward people through promotion becomes more
complex. PRP, and a widening of pay scales, is one answer.
Third, as Louis Wustemann of IRS points out, although PRP companies often
seem to make higher pay awards than non-PRP companies, many of them are
actually making substantial savings in salaries. That is because a
surprising number of companies in sectors such as finance and chemicals
still have service increments which can pay people about 2 per cent a year,
as they move up seniority scales, on top of an annual pay rise. With the
introduction of PRP these service increments are usually abolished.
There are more traditional arguments in favour of PRP which few people
disagree with in principle. Why pay the same rise to someone just avoiding
the sack, as to someone who is making a substantial contribution? Also, it
is inefficient to promote someone from something they are good at to
something they might not be good at because it is the only way of paying
them more.
The principle is fine but, as Wustemann says, PRP is something that is easy
to do badly. The fair and accurate measuring of individual differences in
performance is an art still in its infancy.
Most personnel managers say it is easier to measure performance for senior
staff with some autonomy or for clerical staff with clearly defined
functions. But for the growing number of middle-ranking, white-collar staff,
things are more complex and many such employees believe themselves to be
victims of bias in line-manager appraisals. There is also some doubt that
individuals will increase their effort to gain more reward, especially as
the sums involved are usually quite small.
Alan Wild, head of employee relations at Guinness, says 'PRP must be only
one piece of the motivational matrix.'
Most practitioners believe PRP is not a reincarnation of the bogus
productivity deals of the 1960s. There are, however, limits to its progress
as teamwork for both blue- and white-collar workers switches attention to
group reward systems. For senior staff it will, according to Wild, continue
to play a useful role in 'focusing' efforts.
Further articles on PRP will appear in the next few weeks.

FT  03 NOV 93 / People: Curry takes top meat job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Northumberland farmer by profession, Don Curry, 49, has been appointed by
the government as acting chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission; he
had been deputy chairman of the MLC since December 1991. The MLC's former
chairman, Geoffrey John, has moved to take up the post of chairman with Food
From Britain.
Chairing the MLC is a three-day-a-week job. Besides his farming interests,
Curry is chairman of a livestock marketing co-operative based in Ponteland,
also in Northumberland. He first joined the MLC in 1986, having attracted
ministerial notice through his work on the council of the National Farmers'
Union.
Although not full-time, the MLC is nevertheless a demanding job, with 'a lot
of public relations, meetings and committees to attend, representing the MLC
at various events,' says Curry. He describes it as 'a very important body
with an annual budget of Pounds 2m for research and development projects
aimed at improving the long-term efficiency of the industry'.
Probably the most publicly visible activity of the MLC in recent months has
been its controversial advertising campaign using the slogan 'Meat to live'.
'I don't think that is taking things too far,' says Curry. 'We take a
responsible view of our advertising. There is a lot of nonsense talked about
meat-eating. There is an awful lot of advertising which one could look at
and ask if what it is saying is actually correct.'
Curry says that 'when and if' he was asked by the government to stay on
permanently as chairman he would have to give it serious consideration. For
the moment Gillian Shephard, the new agriculture minister, has just begun to
get her feet under the table; the temporary nature of Curry's MLC post may
well change once Shephard has sorted out a few sheep from goats.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Technology: Haunted by Britain's industrial heritage - A new
report which proposes ways of cleaning up contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The twin issues of environmental liability and contaminated land are fast
becoming some of the most contentious for the business community in the UK.
Yesterday's proposals from the Confederation of British Industry are part of
an increasingly concerted effort by business, banking, insurance and the
property sector to fend off what they fear could be crippling bills.
'Business interest in this issue is strong and rising,' said Howard Davies,
the director general. The government is currently conducting a review of the
problem after being forced by industry pressure to drop a plan for a
contaminated land register earlier this year. This could lead to fresh
proposals, possibly a green paper, next year.
The 32-page CBI report is blunt about the problem: 'Liability for remedying
environmental damage may well become the key environmental challenge facing
business in the 1990s,' it begins, making clear that the fundamental
question is who pays for it. The report was assembled by a working party of
CBI members headed by John Wybrew, the director of public affairs and
planning at Shell.
As the CBI sees it, the UK has an exceptionally long industrial heritage and
this has left it with more contaminated land than probably any other
country. But the business community does not accept that it should bear the
cost of cleaning it all up, or that every hectare of it even needs to be
cleaned up to the same pristine standard.
The report is particularly critical of the legal and regulatory
uncertainties that surround environmental liability, and specially an EC
green paper issued last May that would try to harmonise it across the whole
community on the basis of strict liability.
Wybrew warns that these uncertainties are causing land to be left derelict
and deflecting demand for industrial sites into greenfield areas. 'We want
to harness the wealth creation process to environmental improvement,' he
said yesterday. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has already
denounced the proposal as 'unfair and unpractical'.
There are also side issues about the extent to which banks would be liable
to foot the bill for contaminated land owned by clients they lend money to
and the role of pollution insurance.
The CBI accepts that business should pay for any environmental damage
incurred in the future, provided there is a clear and fair legal framework.
But the real problem lies with past damage affecting as much as 200,000ha,
which would cost up to Pounds 1m per hectare to put right, or a total bill
of Pounds 20bn. A lot of the pollution is historic: no one knows who was
responsible, the land may have changed hands many times. Much of it was also
legal when it occurred.
Here, the CBI makes a number of proposals.
First, the government should establish priorities for cleaning up
contaminated land. Perhaps only 1 to 3 per cent of land needs urgent action.
It should also set standards because the requirements for different types of
land can vary widely. Dutch soil standards are widely used but these were
designed for a particular set of national circumstances and also require
land to be improved to a point where it can be put to any use, however
sensitive. The CBI thinks that is going too far.
Second, the government can help by linking remedial action to the planning
process and by encouraging development of new technology for measuring
contamination and carrying out remedial action.
Third, the government and the EC should explore grants as a way of paying
for clean-ups. 'Mixtures of public- and private-sector funding will be the
most effective way to bring land back into use where it is most needed,' the
report says.
But having made this statement, the report is strikingly vague about how the
private sector should play its part. It offers no estimates of how big a
contribution business might make, how it could be made and by whom, although
the report lists in detail the government agencies who might be able to
offer money and also gives a run-down of the amount of public money
available for land reclamation.
The CBI has rejected the idea of a compensation fund. John Cridland, the
environment director, said yesterday: 'The past is the consequence of our
industrial heritage, therefore the only appropriate way to pay for it is
through the exchequer. I cannot envisage any compensation arrangements that
would be fair and equitable.'
This weakness in the report was quickly seized on yesterday by environmental
campaigners who accused the CBI of trying to wriggle out of its
responsibilities and push the cost on to the taxpayer. They also said that
industry was effectively trying to secure a competitive advantage in Europe
at the expense of the public and the environment.
Friends of the Earth said that a tax should be levied on all potentially
polluting industries to create a fund to clean up land where the polluter
cannot be found. It also favours a contaminated land register and strict
liability.
But the picture is less clear cut than that. Local authorities, who are very
close to the problem, have had difficulty forging a common position on who
should pay.
'There are no easy answers' said an official at the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities.

FT  03 NOV 93 / People: Ex-surgeon to correct the balance at UBS healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more familiar names in the healthcare business has joined UBS as
a director, corporate finance. John Heap trained as a surgeon, specialising
ultimately in infertility treatments in obstetrics and gynaecology. But
since 1980 his instruments have been rather more metaphorical than
practical.
Heap has spent the past 13 years in a variety of senior European healthcare
positions, all of which have primed him for his new role, which will be to
assist UBS to steal a march on its competitors all fiercely engaged in
staying in the middle of the new business stream being generated by mergers,
floats and buy-outs in the now tightly squeezed pharmaceutical sector.
'One of the principal issues facing the pharmaceutical industry now is
research and development costs, which cannot persist at the level they have
reached,' says Heap. 'Globally, some Dollars 30bn is annually spent on R&amp;D,
which is an unsustainable figure when compared with generated sales of
perhaps Dollars 130bn. The ratio is wrong. Pharmaceutical companies will
either have to trim their R&amp;D costs, re-focus their research, or increase
sales enormously. The latter is very difficult, the first is very easy but
ineffective. What needs to happen is for companies to re-focus their efforts
and minimise their duplicated efforts,' argues Heap.
Heap's expertise has been gained through broad experience. On leaving the
national health service, he joined the Belgian company Janssen
Pharmaceuticals as a senior medical adviser. He went on to join the French
company Merieux, as medical director, helping establish it in the UK.
In 1983 he joined Lorex Pharmaceuticals as the board director covering
Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, and moved to Evans Healthcare in 1986.
UBS has busied itself in the healthcare market recently, recruiting a couple
of analysts in London as well as one each in New York, Tokyo and Zurich. It
recruited Heap in the belief that the pharmaceutical industry is about to
undergo the same sorts of upheaval over the next decade as befell the
computing industry in the past two.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Technology: A rebel among the copycats - A Japanese group's
new printer may establish a trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buy a laser printer and help save the world. Strange as it may seem,
newspaper readers throughout Europe are being urged to do just that in a
series of advertisements placed by Kyocera, the Japanese company with a
turnover of Y420bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Kyocera's core business is ceramics but
it also makes a laser printer which it claims is environmentally more sound
than those of its competitors.
The claims have caused scepticism among environmental campaigners and the
electronics industry. The campaigners cite Japan's poor environmental
record, especially its efforts to continue whaling and its high consumption
of tropical timber. The trade thinks it is commercial suicide to try to sell
products on their environmental credibility alone.
But Kyocera's printer, called the Ecosys, looks set to be in the vanguard of
a wave of greener products from Japan, such as industrial environmental
protection products and energy-saving devices. Consumer products are
expected soon.
'Japanese industry is particularly sensitive to environmental issues because
Japan has suffered from bad pollution in the past. The Minamata mercury
poisoning is just one example,' says Yasuo Nishiguchi, Kyocera's senior
managing director. 'I can understand that Japan is perceived as different
because of the whaling. But the Japanese attitude is changing.'
It was Nishiguchi's decision to promote the Ecosys on environmental
performance. He admits that some of his European distributors, especially
those in Spain and Italy, think he is wrong.
'I was concerned in April 1992 when we started the promotion because
everyone was saying that the printer's environmental performance was not
enough to win market share. But our message to the market is now accepted
and we have met our sales targets.'
Kyocera is a minnow in the worldwide office printer market, which is
dominated by Hewlett-Packard, with Canon providing the core technology for
most printers. The Ecosys is comparatively slower, more expensive and does
not produce the same density of print as the latest models from leading
competitors.
Kyocera decided that if it was to compete, it needed something to
differentiate its product from the rest. Ecosys's design provided the unique
selling point. Conventional printers use a replaceable cartridge that
contains the toner and the printing drum. The whole cartridge is thrown away
when the toner runs out.
While this gives high-quality printing, the throw-away design is both
profligate and environmentally unacceptable. Canon and H-P have responded
with recycling initiatives, but these have been largely ineffective because
dealers are not obligated to take back used cartridges.
H-P is about to launch 're-engineered' cartridges and a take-back scheme for
old printers, but its distributors are under no obligation to accept used
products from customers.
Kyocera's design has a longer-lasting drum (using its ceramics technology)
which is separate from the toner cartridge. The only part of the machine
that has to be replaced regularly is the toner.
While marginally more expensive to buy, Kyocera claims the Ecosys is more
economical to run. Each page produced costs two-thirds less than the
industry average. By dispensing with the disposable cartridge the design
holds the high environmental ground.
'Our printer differs from the rest because of its character that combines
ecology with economy. Our competitors cannot address this,' says Nishiguchi.
The competitors, understandably, do not want to be drawn on these arguments.
But it is clear they are doing everything possible to improve the
environmental profile of their products. New models are, for example, far
more energy efficient, are partly made from recycled materials, are packed
in recyclable materials and accept recycled paper.
Pressure to improve environmental credibility comes from diverse directions.
Certain government purchasing policies now insist on the best environmental
option. Kyocera recently won a big order for 1,000 printers from the German
Federal Office for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees in Germany, a
subsidiary of the labour ministry.
The US's Energy Star labelling system, which promotes energy efficiency, has
driven computer and printer makers to reduce the energy consumption of their
products if they want to win federal government contracts.
Some big companies are also beginning to demand environmentally better
products from their suppliers. Kyocera's heavy promotion - paid for by
corporate headquarters to support its marketing in other countries - has
underlined the issue in the printer market.
Nishiguchi says the Ecosys conforms with Kyocera's avowed commitment to make
products that benefit society and 'make a positive contribution to planet
Earth'.
'The Japanese have a desire to be leaders in everything they do and the
environment is one such area. They are very sincere about it but they are
also keen to extract competitive advantage,' says Alex Mayhook-Walker, a
Japanese specialist with ERM, the international environmental consultancy.
Japanese trade organisations, backed by government funds, have recently
commissioned research into environmental reporting, waste recycling and
disposal methods for used electronic equipment. Much of this work, according
to Mayhook-Walker, is linked to finding new markets.
Japanese companies clearly see opportunities to sell products into the
emerging environmental markets in the west.
Kyocera's stab at capturing a small part of the printer market by extolling
its green credentials could be an early warning to western manufacturers who
feel the heat has gone out of the environmental market.
'A lot of new green products will come out of Japan soon,' says Nishiguchi.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Construction outlook 'grim'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER job losses and falls in output are expected in the hard pressed
construction sector, according to a workload survey published today.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which published the survey,
described the mood among its members as grim.
The institution's study of quantity surveyors' order books showed that
workloads had fallen by 5 per cent during the three months to the end of
September compared with the previous three months. Workloads over the year
had fallen by 12 per cent. The institution said that 19 per cent of firms
expected to shed labour during the next 12 months.
Much of quantity surveying work occurs early in the construction process.
Order books therefore provide one of the best early indicators of future
workloads in the industry.
The report prompted further pleas to the government not to cut capital
investment in transport and housing when it announces its unified Budget at
the end of this month.
Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest
firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'The effects would be disastrous for the
construction industry, causing more redundancies in a sector which has
already lost more than 400,000 jobs since summer 1989.'
A joint letter to the chancellor from the Building Employers' Confederation
and the Federation of Master Builders says that construction output, which
has declined by 15 per cent in value since its peak, had fallen for 13
consecutive quarters. It says: 'Given this background we would urge the
crucial importance in the unified Budget of maintaining current capital
investment programmes.'

FT  03 NOV 93 / Boost to engineers' managerial skills urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institution of Mechanical Engineers is planning to expand sharply its
links with industry in an attempt to make engineers more 'promotable' by
helping them develop their non-technical skills.
Dr Richard Pike, who took over as director-general of the 76,000-member
institution in September, wants it to work more closely with companies to
resolve a problem widely seen as contributing to the UK's manufacturing
decline - a shortage of well-rounded engineers.
The prevalence of engineers who lack wider financial, personnel or corporate
planning expertise is often blamed on excessive specialisation in
engineering courses at universities. But Dr Pike believes that engineering
institutions should bear some of the blame.
The institution is planning a two-pronged approach to expanding links with
UK industry. First, Dr Pike wants it to have contacts at a much higher level
than previously, so that senior corporate executives understand the
contribution which engineers with a broad range of skills can make.
He also wants to increase its industrial liaison officers - individual
members who act as a link between the institution and a company - from 300
to several thousand.
Meanwhile, the Engineering Employers' Federation moved yesterday to fill the
gap left by the surprise resignation of its director-general Mr Neil
Johnson, who will be leaving at the end of this month. Mr Graham Mackenzie,
president, will take on the additional role of chief executive from November
30. The federation said the arrangement would last for up to six months.
The forthcoming departure of Mr Johnson had threatened to leave the
federation without a leader during a crucial period of discussions with the
Confederation of British Industry over a possible link-up.
The federation said it remained fully committed to the talks, which will
continue - as will consultation on the link with the EEF associations and
member companies.
Numbers of apprentices recruited by the engineering industry are likely to
fall by 24 per cent this year, says the Sheffield Association of the
Engineering Employers' Federation.
The association, which covers the industry in South Yorkshire and the north
Midlands, says its annual survey shows numbers of craft apprenticeships have
dropped. But only 5 per cent of companies reported serious skill shortages.
However, engineering companies are taking on 26 per cent more graduates,
while recruitment of trainee technicians is unchanged. The trends are
thought to reflect the changing nature of engineering skills. Recruitment of
manual operative and clerical trainees has also fallen.

AN industrial tribunal has taken the unusual step of ordering a company to
speed up its response to an equal-pay claim.
Vauxhall Motors has been told by the Bedford industrial tribunal to respond
by the end of the month to an independent report into an equal-pay claim by
sewing machinists at the company's Luton plant.
The company said last night that it had offered to respond at the end of
December. The TGWU general union said it was 'delighted' that a timescale
had been set.
The Equal Opportunities Commission argues that equal pay laws are
ineffective because of the complexity and length of cases which puts off

FT  03 NOV 93 / Jubilee Line contracts awarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday awarded a further Pounds 400m of contracts for
construction of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension, bringing to Pounds
800m the total value of contracts awarded in the past five days, Andrew
Baxter writes.
Mr Hugh Doherty, project director, said about 60 per cent of civil contracts
and more than 80 per cent of electrical and mechanical contracts would go to
UK companies. Additional civil contracts would go to UK and overseas joint
ventures. Further awards are expected in the next week.
'Even when contracts are with overseas firms, it is important to realise
that the vast majority of the money - in excess of 90 per cent  - will still
be spent in the UK, contributing to the national economy,' he said.
Yesterday's contracts cover everything from tunnelling to ticket machines.
Many of the construction-related contracts were already known.
These include two station and tunnelling contracts worth a total of Pounds
130m for the Aoki-Soletanche joint venture, which includes Japan's Aoki
Corporation. John Mowlem, Wimpey and John Laing won other station and depot
contracts as expected.
On the equipment side, GPT, the UK joint venture between GEC and Siemens,
has won a Pounds 60m communications contract, while German-owned O&amp;K
Escalators will supply lifts and escalators worth more than Pounds 50m.
A Pounds 50m contract for power, cabling and conductor rail was won by GEC
Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group which last week clinched a
Pounds 250m deal to supply 59 six-car train sets for the project. The orders
are a boost for the Anglo-French group after last month's defeat in the race
to supply equipment to British Rail under a special Pounds 150m leasing
facility granted by the government. The order went to ABB Transportation,
which will supply trains for Network SouthEast.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Notts colliery set to shut: Closure of 'reprieved' mine ends
long wait for British Coal's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL will today begin its long-awaited move to cut the UK coal
industry significantly by announcing plans to close the Calverton colliery
in Nottinghamshire.
The announcement will follow months of speculation that British Coal would
close all 12 pits, including Calverton, that were reprieved by the
government last March after a public outcry over their proposed closure.
In the five months to the end of British Coal's financial year in March, the
corporation is likely to close at least a dozen pits. In contrast to last
year's announcement of 31 closures, subsequently withdrawn, the corporation
will move cautiously.
British Coal indicated in meetings with union leaders in Nottinghamshire
yesterday that some of the 12 mines reprieved, but under renewed threat,
could survive if they performed better than the 19 pits which have never
been earmarked for closure.
The Calverton closure would be a blow for the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers, which represents most miners in the region. The union had hoped
for preferential treatment after it kept mines open in the 1984-85 pit
strike.
British Coal executives underlined the extent of the industry's problems by
disclosing that the amount of coal burnt in Britain's power stations this
year is likely to be 7m tonnes lower than expected, down from an anticipated
64m tonnes. Coal consumption has fallen 20 per cent on last year as nuclear
output has risen 12 per cent - equivalent to 3m tonnes of coal. Gas turbine
stations have taken away the market for a further 4m tonnes of coal.
British Coal signalled its intention to close Calverton as it began
consultations on the future of all 30 remaining pits under the industry's
revived colliery review procedure.
At yesterday's meeting, called to discuss the future of the nine
Nottinghamshire pits, British Coal said it was necessary to review further
the Calverton colliery which employs 640 men and has made losses of Pounds
6.3m this year.
Miners and management at Calverton are to meet this morning.
At least one more pit closure is likely next week after British Coal holds a
meeting next Tuesday to discuss Yorkshire region collieries.
In the following three weeks meetings will discuss Scotland, south Wales,
Staffordshire and the north-east. The most vulnerable collieries in these
areas are Silverdale, in Staffordshire, and Wearmouth, in the north-east.
Mr Neal Greatrex, UDM general secretary, accused British Coal of playing cat
and mouse. 'Miners at Calverton will have to wait another 24 hours before
they know finally whether their pit will close.'
The next meeting for Nottinghamshire pits under the modified colliery review
procedure is scheduled for January.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Halifax says house price rises stalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in house prices stalled last month after rising during the summer,
emphasising the fragile nature of the housing market recovery, Halifax,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced yesterday.
Halifax said that average prices, although unchanged between September and
October, were still 1.5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period
last year.
The society urged the government to do nothing in the Budget at the end of
this month 'which might damage the confidence of potential house
purchasers'.
On Monday Nationwide building society announced that prices had risen by 1.5
per cent in October, resulting in a year-on-year increase of 1.7 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 93 / High-tech jobs for former pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 600 high-technology jobs are to be created on the site of the
Cortonwood colliery near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. The closure of this
colliery sparked the national miners' strike nearly 10 years ago.
Tunstall Group will build an Pounds 11m factory to make electronic equipment
for Mion Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary. It will be partly financed
by a Pounds 2.5m grant from the Department of Trade and Industry and a
five-year European Community loan.
Tunstall already operates a factory at Whitley Bridge, Pontefract. During
the past two years it has built up a business making electronic products
under contract for other companies, such as domestic satellite decoders,
energy-saving devices and telecommunications equipment.
The Cortonwood site is in the Dearne Valley between Barnsley and Doncaster,
part of the core of the former South Yorkshire coalfield. The valley was one
of the first 11 areas to receive funding for economic reconstruction through
the City Challenge scheme devised in 1991 by Mr Michael Heseltine when he
was environment secretary. Tunstall's factory will be part of a new 16-acre
industrial estate.
Tunstall said it had chosen the site from several possibilities within the
EC because of its good local labour supply and the government grant. Some
400 jobs should be filled by the end of the year. A further 211 will follow.
Mr Michael Dawson, Tunstall chairman, said contract manufacturing was now
worth Pounds 1.4bn a year in the UK.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Critics of British Gas retreat from their success: The MMC
report has received little support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE consultation period for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
British Gas closes this week amid growing speculation that the government
will reject its recommendations.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will probably give
his decision by the end of the year.
In August the commission found that there was a conflict in British Gas
being a gas supplier when it owned the pipeline network. It recommended that
the company should be split by 1997, and that British Gas's monopoly of the
tariff (domestic) market be phased out by 2002. The cost of the changes
would be passed on to consumers, but they would gain as greater competition
brought lower prices and better service.
But although the recommendations went much further than expected, they
received little support in the gas industry. Even the departing gas industry
regulator, Sir James McKinnon of Ofgas, who triggered the inquiry, said he
did not believe that break-up was necessary to create competition. The
consensus was that the government should give priority to phasing out the
monopoly, leaving break-up as a later option if needed.
The independents want Mr Heseltine to bring forward the commission's
recommended timetable for introducing competition, although they propose
different target dates. Kinetica, a joint venture of PowerGen and the US oil
company Conoco, wants competition opened to the 2m or so consumers who use
more than 1,000 therms a year in 1995, with full abolition in 1998 to
coincide with the introduction of competition into the electricity industry.
But several other independents want access to the full tariff market of
about 18m gas customers by 1996.
Consumer associations have also been lukewarm over a break-up. Both the Gas
Consumers' Council and the National Consumer Council oppose the commission's
recommendation that customers bear the costs of a British Gas restructuring.
Alliance Gas, a joint venture between BP and Statoil of Norway, also argues
that increased competition is the main issue, but it believes that
'sustainable competition' requires a break-up. 'Chinese walls are not going
to work,' said Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director. Only a break-up will
result in a British Gas transport company which 'treats the independents as
valued customers'.
British Gas itself remains one of the few other institutions which still
favours break-up, in spite of its earlier bitter opposition. Mr Cedric
Brown, chief executive, said: 'We don't think break-up is necessary for
competition purposes, but given that the MMC recommended it we are prepared
to work with the government to help bring it about.'
The attraction for British Gas is that it would be able to realise some
gains for its shareholders who, it feels, have had a raw deal from a
regulatory regime which has favoured the consumer.
But if Mr Heseltine opts for ending the monopoly first, he will have to
satisfy himself on a number of points. The most important is that gas prices
really will fall, as independent gas companies claim. Twelve independents
recently claimed they could deliver average annual savings on gas bills of 8
per cent.
However, Dr John Wright, who specialises in utility regulation at
accountants Price Waterhouse, warns that prices could go up, at least in the
short term, as new competitors bid for supplies. Customers might also want
to avoid locking themselves into a supplier once they can choose between
several. This will create greater risks for gas suppliers, who will want to
be compensated by higher prices.
British Gas believes small consumers could face higher bills because of the
elimination of cross-subsidies. Mr Brown queries the calculations made in
the independents' report. 'They say that prices will come down, but they're
a bit thin on how they're going to do it. How can they make these claims
without knowing what the gas transportation charges will be?'
Confusion over whether competition will lead to lower prices last week
caused the Gas Consumers' Council to ask the government to delay any
decision on the commission's report until it could quantify the likely
impact on consumers of the various proposals.
The independents have made proposals which they say will ensure that
security of supply and social obligations to the elderly and disabled are
maintained. British Gas has commissioned Arthur D Little, the management
consultancy, to prepare a report on how a competitive market might be
organised, and how the transition should be made. It should be ready later
this month, and will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry.
There will also be continuing liaison between the DTI and Ofgas and its new
director-general, Mrs Claire Spottiswood, who has yet to give her views on
the report.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Rosyth workers warned of up to 40% job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORKFORCE at the Rosyth naval dockyard could fall by nearly 40 per cent
to 2,200 by the year 2005, employees were told yesterday.
Staff were warned that their present pay and conditions will have to be
renegotiated as the yard reduces costs and is fully privatised.
Babcock Thorn, which operates the yard on the Firth of Forth, yesterday held
the first of a series of meetings in which it is spelling out the yard's
prospects to its 3,600 employees.
This follows the government's decision in June to award the contract for
servicing Trident submarines to Devonport, while allocating Rosyth a
workload of surface ships which will decline after 2000 and end in 2005.
Early next year the Ministry of Defence will seek tenders for the full
privatisation of the two naval dockyards.
Mr Allan Smith, Babcock Thorn's managing director, said Babcock intends to
bid for Rosyth without Thorn EMI and is negotiating to take over Thorn's 35
per cent stake.
The workforce was told that submarine work would continue to 1996 and would
be followed by the refitting of two aircraft carriers as well as frigates
and Type 42 destroyers. By 2000 the workforce was likely to fall to 2,800.
After 2000 Rosyth will have to compete for most of its naval workload and
the labour force could drop to 2,200. The exact size depended on its success
in improving efficiency and reducing costs.
The workforce was told that Rosyth's wage, salary and overtime costs were
the highest in the ship refitting industry, and the company's contribution
to the pension fund was twice that of most of its competitors. The yard was
'top of the league' for holidays, the employees were told.
Mr Smith said that Babcock Thorn had taken over a dockyard that enjoyed
civil service conditions. Change would be necessary and would be discussed
with the workforce.
The yard is to be reorganised to cope with the new workload. About 70 of 270
buildings on the site may be returned to the MoD and 90 may be demolished.
Part of the site could be turned into an industrial estate.
The dock designed for Trident submarines could be used for constructing
sections of the proposed second Forth road bridge.
Rosyth already gets about 20 per cent of its Pounds 165m turnover from
non-MoD work, and would like to increase this to 30 per cent.
It refurbishes London Underground trains, builds boats and has a joinery
division which makes furniture and supermarket counters.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Employers' body picks new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Engineering Employers' Federation moved yesterday to fill the gap left
by the surprise resignation of its director-general Mr Neil Johnson, who
will be leaving at the end of this month.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, president, will take on the additional role of chief
executive from November 30. The federation said the arrangement would last
for up to six months.
The forthcoming departure of Mr Johnson had threatened to leave the
federation without a leader during a crucial period of discussions with the
Confederation of British Industry over a possible link-up.
The federation said it remained fully committed to the talks, which will
continue - as will consultation on the link with the EEF associations and
member companies.
The talks are exploring the potential for merging most of the federation's
central activities with those of the CBI's National Manufacturing Council,
creating the biggest UK lobbying group for manufacturing. A progress report
on the talks will be discussed at the next federation meeting on November
17.
Significantly, the federation said the work and roles of its 14 autonomous
regional associations would not be affected by any possible outcome to the
talks. There has been some opposition from association members, particularly
in the west Midlands.
Mr Johnson strongly supports a deal with the CBI, and is leaving to prevent
the possibility of talks becoming bogged down in personality issues.
Mr Mackenzie was formerly chief executive of UES Holdings, the
Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group, but lost his post in
September after a reorganisation.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Government seeks Pounds 630m EC funds for Merseyside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday asked the European Community for about Pounds 630m
over six years to help reverse the decline of Merseyside's economy.
It proposes to double the sum to Pounds 1.26bn by adding contributions from
the public and private sectors.
The money, which has to be finally negotiated over the next six months,
would go to Merseyside under the EC's Objective 1 status, which gives the
poorest and most lagging areas special help. The EC is likely to press for
the UK public and private sectors to give more than 50 per cent of the
Pounds 1.26bn.
The strategy document asking for the money is likely to raise doubts about
whether Merseyside's decline can be reversed. Growth would have to be 5.4
percentage points a year above the EC average to reach average EC gross
domestic product per head of population by the end of the century.
This figure is thought unachievable by government ministers, civil servants
and local authority leaders and officers. Even to reach 90 per cent of the
EC average level, local growth would have to average 3 percentage points a
year more than the rest of Europe.
With an unemployment rate twice the UK's national average of about 10 per
cent, about 6,600 jobs a year would have to created by 1999 to reduce the
jobless total to UK average levels - and 8,400 jobs a year to reach the EC
average.
The hope is at least to halt decline and start the process of catching up.
Merseyside appears to be falling behind faster than previously thought when
Objective 1 status was first mooted earlier this year.
Merseyside's per capita GDP is expected to have fallen to only 73 per cent
of the EC average when the figures for 1992 appear. In 1982 the figure was
95 per cent.
The region's population fell by 20 per cent to 1.37m between 1961 and 1991.
The strategy document hopes the rate of exodus will decline, to give a
stable population of 1.35m by 2001.
No specific projects are suggested at this stage. Nearly 47 per cent of
total spending would go on human resources, principally training.
The Northern Ireland Office is to prioritise human resource development in
its use of EC structural funds over the next six years, and emphasise the
importance of cross-border links with the Irish Republic, Tim Coone writes.
Northern Ireland's Objective 1 status for EC funds will entitle it to more
than Pounds 950m for the years 1994-99.
The office said there were three objectives: economic growth to achieve 'a
meaningful degree of convergence' between Northern Ireland and the more
successful regions of Europe'; promotion of internal cohesion by focusing on
the development of human resources and reducing community divisions; and
promotion of external cohesion to reduce the province's geographical
isolation through improved transport and energy infrastructure.
Spending will be allocated under seven sectoral programmes with human
resource development taking the lion's share of 28.5 per cent of the funds.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Fall in apprentice figures forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUMBERS of apprentices recruited by the engineering industry are likely to
fall by 24 per cent this year, says the Sheffield Association of the
Engineering Employers' Federation, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The association, which covers the industry in South Yorkshire and the north
Midlands, says its annual survey shows numbers of craft apprenticeships have
dropped. But only 5 per cent of companies reported serious skill shortages.
However, engineering companies are taking on 26 per cent more graduates,
while recruitment of trainee technicians is unchanged. The trends are
thought to reflect the changing nature of engineering skills. Recruitment of
manual operative and clerical trainees has also fallen.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Bank steps up plea for independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, yesterday
stepped up the Bank's campaign to take control of interest rates.
He said this would improve the UK's inflation record and help businesses and
householders plan their finances on a long-term basis.
Mr Pennant-Rea, giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee, said if the government agreed to give the Bank responsibility for
monetary policy it could be made accountable to parliament 'in an open and
transparent way'.
Mr Pennant-Rea said Britain's poor inflation record since the 1940s was 'a
consequence of having a non-independent central bank'. The government should
re-constitute the Bank as an 'executive agency' charged with 'pursuing price
stability', so removing political pressures from the job of setting interest
rates.
Control over setting interest rates would put the Bank in a stronger
position to influence the government over fiscal policy than the present
role where it advises the chancellor. This is because the Treasury would be
less capable of allowing a large fiscal deficit to be eroded over time by
inflation after a period of low interest rates.
While Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, has already suggested making the Bank
independent in monetary policy, Mr Pennant-Rea yesterday took the argument a
step further by sketching out how the arrangement would work. Government
ministers, however, are not convinced it would benefit the economy.
The Bank's case may be helped by the committee's report on its role, due
early next month. Mr John Watts, the committee's chairman, said after
yesterday's hearing that its members were 'moving in the direction' of
suggesting Bank independence.
Mr Pennant-Rea said it would be 'undesirable' to give the Bank control of
interest rates without involvement by politicians. So the broad statutory
requirement over price stability should be supplemented by a specific
strategic objective from 'government and parliament' to keep inflation
within a specific band, for instance between zero and 2 per cent.
Mr Pennant-Rea said this target could be changed depending on economic
circumstances. The government's current objective for underlying inflation
is to keep this between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.
The deputy governor shrugged off a criticism from Mr Quentin Davies, a
committee member, that by changing the inflation target government and
parliament could loosen the Bank's grip on monetary policy.
After the hearing Mr Pennant-Rea said letting politicians alter the target
would be 'prudent'. They would not be able to change it very much because
this would infringe the Bank's statutory responsibilities.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Evidence of consumer-led upturn grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY SUPPLY figures from the Bank of England yesterday added to evidence
that consumer spending is the driving force behind the recovery.
Cash in circulation, or M0, rose a provisional, seasonally adjusted 5.4 per
cent in the year to October, compared with 5.3 per cent in the year to
September. This was the sixth consecutive monthly rise in the annual rate
and the highest for three years.
The Bank said in its quarterly inflation report yesterday that a large part
of the strength of M0 was attributable to the cut in interest rates over the
past year, although it remains uncertain about the effect of this in the
short term.
M0 growth has been above the upper limit of the government's zero to 4 per
cent monitoring range since June, but the Bank said the range remained
'broadly consistent' with the inflation target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
Growth in narrow money tends to reflect a pick-up in retail sales. The rise
in M0 in every month since May - when it was 3.5 per cent - has coincided
with buoyant retail activity and the Bank yesterday described narrow money
as a 'good and timely guide for nominal demand growth'.
Other indicators, including a steady increase in consumer borrowing, point
to a consumer-led recovery.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese bank, said: 'What
has been established very well as the year has progressed is that the
recovery is largely one led by the consumer and these figures support it.'
For this reason, some economists are arguing that the government should be
cautious about cutting interest rates.
M0 is one of a number of variables tracked by the Treasury to monitor
inflationary pressures. Other monitored indicators have also picked up
recently.
Yesterday's figures from the Bank confirmed that M4 - which consists of M0
plus bank and building society deposits - has lifted above the floor of its
3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range. The 12-month growth rate in
September was 3.3 per cent.
The UK's official gold and foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 507m
last month, taking reserves at the end of October to Dollars 43,551m,
compared with Dollars 43,044m at the end of September. The underlying
increase in reserves was Dollars 32m.
The underlying change excludes a number of factors included in the total
change, including the proceeds from the quarterly tender of three-year Ecu
Treasury notes, proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu Treasury bills
and maturing UK Ecu Treasury bills.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Fall in company failures continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies entering receivership or administration continued to
decline last month, according to the trend in figures from the official
London and Edinburgh Gazettes analysed by accountants Touche Ross.
The October figure of 240, although up from a one-off low of 184 in
September, reflected a continuing fall in the number of company failures
during the past six months. It brought the number of receiverships and
administration orders to 2,808 for the first 10 months of the year, against
4,282 for the same period last year and 4,898 in 1991.
Touche Ross said the average size of businesses to which receivers are now
being appointed has fallen from earlier in the recession. The proportion of
appointments taken by the largest six accountancy firms declined to 45 per
cent this year from 50 per cent during 1992.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Inflation outlook loses its gloss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England's latest inflation report provides little comfort for
advocates of an early and substantial easing of UK monetary policy.
It also implies that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would face economic
as well as political problems if he chose to raise or widen significantly
the net of indirect taxes in his November 30 Budget.
The Bank believes that on present policies, both 'headline' inflation, as
measured by the retail prices index, and the underlying rate of RPI minus
mortgage-interest payments will rise until the middle of next year. 'There
is,' the Bank says, 'a slight possibility that in the first half of next
year inflation will briefly rise above the top of the target range' of 1 per
cent to 4 per cent for underlying inflation in the life of this parliament.
Both underlying inflation and headline inflation have risen since the
summer. Underlying inflation (dubbed RPIX by the Bank) was 3.3 per cent in
September, having been 2.8 per cent in June. Over the same period headline
RPI increased to 1.8 per cent from 1.2 per cent.
Information available since the last inflation report in August has led the
Bank to revise upwards slightly its forecasts of the 12-month inflation
rates to be expected over the next few months. The most likely path for RPIX
is a small rise until the first quarter of next year, 'peaking at an annual
rate above 3.5 per cent'. The Bank's central forecast is for inflation to
stay within the target range provided earnings growth stays moderate and
does not feed through into higher prices.
If inflation does break through the target ceiling this will partly be
because of changes in indirect and local authority taxes. It is largely for
this reason that the Bank would like commentators and wage bargainers to
look at another underlying measure of inflation which it calls RPIY.
This measure, which excludes value added tax, local authority taxes and
excise duties as well as mortgage interest payments, is expected to start
falling early next year and could be close to the middle of the target range
in 1995.
But it is unclear whether wage bargainers will be persuaded by such a
measure. Headline inflation, which is the rate that employers and employees
notice most, is expected to rise particularly sharply as past reductions in
mortgage-interest payments fall out of the 12-month comparison and mortgage
interest relief is restricted from next April.
By laying stress on RPIY, the Bank is indicating that it would not press for
an increase in base rates if inflation rises through 4 per cent next spring.
However, it could quickly change its mind if higher prices fed through into
wages.
It believes that 'sustaining the credibility of anti-inflationary policies'
will be important for ensuring that there is no inflationary wage-price
spiral, and that the government must steadily reduce the budget deficit to
achieve this. It draws comfort from a flattening of the yield curve for
gilt-edged stock since the summer which, it says, suggests that longer-term
inflation expectations now lie within the government's 1 per cent to 4 per
cent range.
This last observation could leave open the possibility of an interest rate
cut in the event of fiscal tightening in the November 30 Budget.

FT  03 NOV 93 / E Midlands urges interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in the east Midlands, one of the most diversified of the
industrial regions, are demanding further cuts in interest rates to
strengthen a weak and patchy economic recovery.
The latest regional survey of business performance shows that conditions
have not improved to the extent expected last spring. Yet despite this
finding the survey, produced by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse and
Nottingham Business School, says that trading is better than it was a year
ago.
Although 58 per cent of businesses reported higher sales during the past six
months and 43 per cent an increase in profits, financial pressures
continued.
Nearly two-thirds of companies reported either holding or decreasing their
selling prices. The speed at which bills are paid does not seem to have
increased.
The proportion of manufacturers using more than 90 per cent of capacity
declined to 20 per cent from 27 per cent last spring.
Similarly, the regional chambers of commerce have reported a fall in the
number of companies working at full capacity, alongside a flattening out of
domestic orders and a decline in exports.
The regional Confederation of British Industry is warning Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, not to choke what it calls 'the relatively weak and patchy
recovery' with his Budget later this month.
For individual businesses, however, the key stimulus to recovery would be a
further fall in interest rates. This is seen as a priority by 65 per cent of
companies in the Price Waterhouse sample.
The survey was drawn from a sample of 958 companies, 84 per cent of which
employ fewer than 200 people.

ECONOMIC developments among Britain's leading trading partners offer 'little
encouragement' to UK policy makers, the Bank of England says.
It points out that growth in the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and
Canada is likely to average only 1 per cent this year.
While the Bank's quarterly bulletin sees little prospect of recovery
stalling in the US, it warns that there are few signs of an upturn in
Germany or Japan.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Judicial body may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will probably decide against measures to set up an
independent body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice when its
criminal justice bill is introduced early in the next parliamentary session.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is understood to be anxious to keep the
momentum of the law and order initiative going by securing a second Commons
reading for a wide-ranging bill before Christmas.
The tight timetable and the complexity of the work needed before the
proposed investigating body can be set up acts against its inclusion.
The Home Office is also hoping to secure a second reading for the Sunday
trading bill before the new year.
A police bill will ensure there is a pronounced law and order theme in the
new session.
If the investigating body is not included in the first draft of the criminal
justice bill, it could possibly still be inserted either during that
measure's committee stage or as part of the police bill. Neither is thought
likely, however.
The establishment of an independent review authority to investigate alleged
miscarriages of justice and refer cases back to the Court of Appeal was
recommended by the royal commission on criminal justice in July.

FT  03 NOV 93 / CBI attacks EC clean-up proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMISSION proposals to impose stricter liability on businesses to
pay for pollution damage drew strong fire from the UK yesterday.
The Confederation of British Industry said they were 'ill-founded' and would
only result in contaminated land being left derelict. Mr Howard Davies,
director-general, said there was 'no case for harmonisation in this area'.
The CBI attack came as it issued a 32-page report on environmental
liability. It singled out an EC green paper issued last May which proposed
that EC environmental law be harmonised because pollution crosses
geographical borders. The green paper argued for strict liability that would
make owners responsible for cleaning up contaminated land regardless of
whether they had caused the damage.
The CBI's stance was supported by Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister. He
said yesterday: 'I share the CBI's view that the EC role needs to be
carefully regulated. I don't believe, on grounds of subsidiarity, that there
should be harmonisation of EC policy, and the UK has responded to the
European green paper saying that.'
Both the CBI and Mr Yeo also oppose suggestions that environmental groups
should have the right to take polluters to court.
Mr Yeo said: 'It is important to limit the number of people who can bring
civil action for loss. That would be a retrograde step.'
The CBI said that the government and the EC should rule out any moves to
create retrospective liability for pollution damage, or widen liability.
Where the polluter could not be found, the clean-up would have to be paid
for by a partnership between the public and private sectors, making use of
regeneration grants.
The CBI report was sharply criticised by environmental groups. Friends of
the Earth said the CBI was 'expecting the public to pay for the clean up of
its members' industrial pollution legacy. The public has the right to expect
the government to ensure that the cost of cleaning up is borne by the
polluter, not the polluted.'
The commission and the European parliament will be holding joint hearings in
Brussels today on the green paper when industry groups will put their points
of view.
Mr Humphrey Norrington, vice-chairman of Barclays, will be among those
testifying. Although he will be lobbying on behalf of EC banks, the UK
banking industry has been leading opposition to the EC proposals. Bankers
fear that they would be made liable for pollution costs incurred by their
borrowers.
Mr Norrington said last night: 'Banks are keen to help their customers be
good environmental citizens. But if the EC forces us into a straitjacket the
result may be the exact opposite.'

FT  03 NOV 93 / Dublin expects rewards for concessions to north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government goes into the Anglo-Irish conference meeting in Belfast
today having made important concessions to unionist opinion but still
determined to uphold parts of the nationalist agenda which are likely to
prove unacceptable to unionist leaders.
Last week Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in announcing a
six-point plan as a basis for renewed talks, conceded the principle of a
unionist veto over constitutional change in the north. Ambiguity persists
over whether this goes further than a straightforward majority veto, as set
out in Article 1 of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
The Irish foreign ministry says that 'majority consent' and 'unionist
consent' should be considered together and that Mr Spring's additional
proposal for a 'covenant of rights' will flesh out guarantees for the
unionists and protect their basic political rights even in the event of a
change in sovereignty.
Irish government officials have indicated, though, that in addition to
downgrading the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland to an
'aspiration' to satisfy what is a key unionist demand, Dublin would also be
prepared to incorporate the guarantee of a majority veto in the north over
constitutional change there, into its own constitution.
The price Dublin expects to extract for these concessions is that they would
form part of an overall package which would incorporate key nationalist
goals and would be put to a simultaneous referendum north and south of the
border.
The Irish constitution can only be amended by referendum. Dublin's objective
is that any agreement on governing structures should be approved by a
referendum in the north, while a simultaneous referendum in the republic
would amend the Irish constitution and approve the agreement reached in the
north.
Simultaneous referendums are a key element in the Hume- Adams peace
initiative, and acceptance of them by the British government is thought to
be the signal Sinn Fein is looking for as the minimum condition for the IRA
ending its campaign of violence.
It is the concept of simultaneous referendums, which would acknowledge a say
by the republic in the affairs of the north, which most alarms the
unionists, along with another element of Mr Spring's six-point plan which
states 'for many of us, of course, the freedom to determine our own future
by agreement should ideally lead to the possibility ultimately of unity on
this island'.
Hardline and moderate unionist opinion are united in wanting to close the
door firmly and definitively on such an eventuality.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Major orders review of Sinn Fein broadcasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday ordered a review of attempts by
television stations to circumvent regulations on broadcasts by Sinn Fein
spokesmen.
Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules
after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing.
Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading
synchronised scripts to get round the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which prevents
transmission of Mr Adams' voice except during election campaigns.
In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a vice-chairman of
the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, that the use of actors 'stretched
the present guidelines to the limit, and perhaps beyond'.
The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary,
who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law.
Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any
changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.
However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other
Conservatives to follow the lead of the Irish Republic, which bans all
broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein.
In Belfast, police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with
the massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry, on Saturday
night. A second is likely to be accused of withholding information.
Five men were arrested in connection with the Greysteel massacre yesterday,
but two were later released. Detectives are now questioning 11 people in
connection with the shootings. A policeman shot in the neck by an IRA sniper
died in hospital last night.
RUC reservist constable Brian James William Wood had been on traffic duty in
the border town of Newry, Co Down, when he was ambushed on Sunday.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Flat-owner plan fails to attract funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is having difficulty attracting private-sector finance to set
up an advisory service for flat-owners who want to buy a share of the
freehold of their building.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, said in July that the government
would be prepared to fund up to 50 per cent of the cost of the service
through the special grants programme but the remainder would have to come
from the private sector.
By the time the changes to leasehold law came into force on Monday there was
still a significant shortfall in the contributions.
In response to a parliamentary question Sir George admitted that although a
formal bid to run the agency had been received in early October, the initial
contributions from private-sector bodies had been very disappointing. He
said he had written to a number of the institutions again - many of which
would expect to be closely involved in the enfranchisement procedures -
seeking further financial support for the advisory service.
The Department of Environment said yesterday that it had not yet had any
response from the banks and building societies to Sir George's letter, but
the government still hoped to have the advisory service running by the end
of the year.
The reforms, which give owners of long leaseholds of flats the right to club
together and buy the freehold of their building and the individual right to
extend their leases by 90 years at market price, are said to be complex and
confusing.
Without freely available advice and assistance, lawyers and property
specialists predict that the take-up of the rights of collective leasehold
enfranchisement will be low.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Arms probe judge demands papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Scott yesterday demanded additional documents from the Ministry
of Defence after it emerged that ministerial notes relevant to the
arms-for-Iraq inquiry have not been made available.
The absence of the notes was discovered by the judge as he questioned a
senior MoD official about the approval of exporting defence-related machine
tools to Iraq in apparent breach of the government's guidelines.
The official, Mr Alan Barrett, referred to a memo which he had written in
January 1988 justifying the export of the machine tools on the grounds of
intelligence protection. He said it had a hand-written note of approval by
the private secretary to the then defence minister Lord Trefgarne. In the
copy of the memo which has been made available to the inquiry by the MoD the
handwritten note is missing.
In a sharp exchange with Mr Robert Keen, an MoD representative, the judge
said he found the discovery of the missing note 'astonishing'. He said he
thought the note was 'important' and asked that this and other relevant
ministerial notes be produced if possible 'within 24 hours'.
Mr Paul Regan said last night on behalf of the inquiry that the judge's
comment on the missing note reflected the 'seriousness' with which he was
treating the issue.
It is the first time that the judge has complained in public about the
withholding of information by a government department since the inquiry got
under way in May.
Last night Mr Keen was unable to explain why a document that had been copied
20 times had not included the Scott inquiry in its circulation.
Earlier, Mr Barrett defended his advice to ministers justifying the export
of machine tools in spite of intelligence warnings that they were going to
be used for munitions manufacture. He said the inquiry was tending to judge
events with the evidence of hindsight.
The hearing continues today.

advantage against competing buyers in the run-up to deregulation next April.
Many dairy companies plan to buy their milk direct from producers once the
Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised.
Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, president of the Dairy Trade Federation, said the
scheme would allow Milk Marque extensive access to confidential commercial
information, previously held by the board, about individual farmers' milk
production and quotas
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said producers and purchasers

A BANK of England executive director yesterday told MPs that there could be
a case for a single system of regulation for banks and building societies.
Mr Brian Quinn, giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee's inquiry
into the role of the Bank, argued that if restrictions on raising wholesale
funds and making unsecured loans on building societies were changed, the
case for maintaining two different regulatory regimes would need to be
looked at again.
Mr Quinn argued strongly that banking supervision should remain with the
Bank even if it gained more independence.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Standards authority faces criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS BY the British Standards Institution to make sweeping changes to its
constitution are expected to provoke a heated debate at its annual meeting
tomorrow, Charles Batchelor writes.
BSI, which co-ordinates the writing of standards for British industry, has
announced plans to give stronger executive powers to its board, and to
modify its charter and by-laws to give the board greater freedom to increase
directors' fees and to award directors additional payments for duties
carried out beyond their normal board responsibilities.
The proposed changes have prompted criticisms that BSI's board is seeking
exceptional powers to the detriment of its members, the 29,500 companies and
individuals who use its standards.
Mr Michael Sanderson, BSI chief executive until he resigned in June
following a disagreement over policies and management, said the changes
proposed were against the recommendations on good corporate governance
proposed by the Cadbury committee. They would reduce the powers of ordinary
members, he said.
Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman, said BSI's board had to respond
rapidly when Mr Sanderson resigned. 'We faced a stark choice. We just didn't
have the time to take a six-month holiday from executive action.'
BSI plans to recruit a chief executive next year but until then its affairs
are being run by an executive board of three, headed by Mr Thomas.
Mr Thomas said the changes to give the board greater powers to decide its
own remuneration would also bring it more into line with normal corporate
practice.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Commons clears way for rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S compromise proposals for rail franchising were approved by
the Commons last night, paving the way for the railway privatisation bill to
become law.
British Rail fought the proposals to the end. A leaked memo released at
Westminster revealed a ferocious behind the scenes battle between Mr John
Welsby, BR's chief executive, and Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister.
However, the government secured a comfortable majority in a series of votes
on amendments limiting BR's ability to bid for franchises to routes where no
credible private-sector bid emerges.
The main amendment, overturning an earlier Lords amendment giving BR
unlimited freedom to bid for franchises, was approved by 316 votes to 282, a
government majority of 34.
The government also had a comfortable majority for a further series of
amendments watering down its obligations to the railway pension fund.
In the main vote, a government motion to overturn the Lords amendment was
approved by 316 votes to 284, a majority of 32.
Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister, has tabled further
amendments to widen BR's right to bid for franchises, which are expected to
be debated in the Lords today.
The amendments raise the possibility that the bill will have to return to
the Commons again later this week if Lord Peyton wins the support of enough
peers to reverse some of last night's Commons amendments.
However, ministers are confident that the Lords will not back his attempt to
challenge the government.
The frosty state of relations between BR and the government became clear in
documents leaked by Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, which record
conversations between Mr Welsby and Mr Freeman. The documents show that Mr
Welsby warned the government strongly that its privatisation plans were
fundamentally flawed and risked backfiring.
Mr Welsby said: 'You are in a hole and still digging. I don't see how there
will be anything still to sell; certainly not the cake - just the cherries.'
The documents also reveal internal BR projections that trainload freight
profits will fall to zero in 1995/96 from Pounds 103m last year.

FT  03 NOV 93 / PM pledges reassessment of child maintenance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday acknowledged mounting cross-party concern about the
operations of the Child Support Agency and pledged to review the formula
used to assess maintenance payments by absent parents.
But the prime minister's comments, in response to a demand for changes from
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, came amid signs in Whitehall that Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, is opposing any fundamental reforms.
Mr Smith demanded an immediate review to take account of 'widespread anxiety
and dismay' over the 'rigid and inflexible' financial formula being imposed
on absent parents for the maintenance of their children.
He also attacked the agency's priorities, pointing out that of the Pounds
530m the agency was set to raise in its first year, only Pounds 50m would be
of direct benefit to children.
Mr Major defended the principles behind the agency, which from last April
replaced the system for fixing maintenance by agreement between parents or
through court orders.
He told MPs: 'The whole house recognises the need for both parents to
contribute to the bringing up of their children. The purpose of the CSA is
to ensure that fathers who desert their children face up to their
responsibilities.'
But with many Conservative MPs as critical as the Labour leader of the way
the agency makes its maintenance assessments, he acknowledged the need to
review the fact that the formula takes no account of past property
settlements or of the cost to an absent parent of exercising access.
Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the chief executive of the agency, told the Commons
social security committee yesterday that the agency's chief priority during
the first year of operation was to deal with new cases of maintenance.
But she acknowledged that in dealing with past cases it was giving priority
to cases where the parent with care of the children was in receipt of income
support and where maintenance was already being paid.
MPs have attacked the new system for failing to give priority to ensuring
that absent parents paying no maintenance were the first to be dealt with.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Anglo-Irish meeting may founder on nationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister arrives in Belfast today for
the Anglo-Irish governmental meeting, he can be confident that, having
sidelined the Hume-Adams peace initiative, any new initiative worked out
with the British will not bear the hallmarks of Sinn Fein.
But Dublin's attempts to uphold parts of the nationalist agenda leave
substantial obstacles.
The Irish government's six-point plan says: 'The people living in Ireland,
north and south, without coercion, without violence, should be free to
determine their own future.' But confusion has arisen over how this fits
with Mr Spring's statement last week that Dublin accepts the principle of a
unionist veto over constitutional change in the north.
The Irish foreign ministry said that 'majority consent' and 'unionist
consent' should be considered together.
Another question arises over the means by which the Irish may satisfy
unionist demands over their claim to sovereignty of the north. The Irish
constitution can only be amended by referendum. Dublin's objective, admitted
by the government, is that any new agreement on governing structures should
be approved by a referendum in the north, while a simultaneous referendum in
the Republic would both amend the Irish constitution and approve the
agreement reached in the north.
Simultaneous referenda are a key element in the Hume-Adams peace initiative,
and acceptance of them is thought to be the signal Sinn Fein is looking for
as the minimum condition for the IRA ending its violence.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Unionists keen on bilateral talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ULSTER UNIONISTS could be ready to take part in talks on Mr John Major's
proposed new peace initiative as long as Westminster does not insist on a
round-table format for the discussions.
Senior Ulster Unionist party MPs indicated yesterday they would discuss
whatever proposals ministers put forward in bilateral meetings.
Mr James Molyneaux, the party's leader, was yesterday still declining to
comment on the initiative, but ministers have drawn comfort from what they
see as the measured nature of his reaction.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared willing earlier
this week to go along with a bilateral approach - at least in the early
stages of new talks.
But he seemed to view this as a preliminary to further round-table
discussions. Bilateral talks, he said, could be a way to 'bank what is
bankable from last time and to see what ultimately is a really serious
obstacle. Then may be the time to sit around the table.'
A more serious barrier to a resumption of talks may come from the Democratic
Unionists. Their leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, again insisted yesterday
that Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader, must end
his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein.
'Mr Hume has to say that his talks with Gerry Adams are over,' Mr Paisley
said. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2 and 3 (of its constitution
which covers its claim to the North) there is no point in sitting down with
them.'
Mr Paisley said the DUP was waiting for Mr Major's response to its proposals
for 'breaking the logjam'. He said these dealt with both the cross-border
relationship with Dublin and internal institutional questions in the
province.
According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist's spokesman on Europe, the
British government should try to seize the initiative by discussing its plan
in bilateral meetings with the province's four constitutional parties and
then moving ahead to implement it.
Mr Taylor believes the plan's main elements should be the creation of a
Northern Ireland assembly to administer laws that would continue to be made
at Westminster and the formulation of 'some new basis of co-operation'
between Belfast and Dublin.
If these structures could be made to work, he would expect the effectiveness
of the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement - which his party opposes for giving
Dublin influence over part of the UK - to wither.
The Ulster Unionists' influence at Westminster has been strengthened by the
fragility of Mr Major's Commons majority.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Major orders review of Sinn Fein broadcasting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday ordered a review of attempts by
television stations to circumvent regulations which restrict broadcasts by
Sinn Fein spokesmen.
Mr Major also confirmed that he will meet the leaders of the four
non-violent Northern Ireland parties shortly for a round of bilateral
discussions on the peace process.
In Belfast police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with
the Hallowe'en massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry. A
second is likely to be accused of withholding information.
Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules
after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing.
Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading
synchronised scripts, to get round restrictions preventing transmission of
Mr Adams' voice.
In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a Conservative
backbencher, that the use of actors 'stretched the present guidelines to the
limit, and perhaps beyond'.
The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary,
who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law.
Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any
changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.
However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other
Conservatives for a ban on all broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein.
Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political
leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John
Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party.
The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with the Reverend
Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and Mr James
Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest unionist
grouping.
The round of meetings is intended to stress Mr Major's availability to all
political leaders in Northern Ireland who reject the use of violence.
It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting
from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr
Adams.
However, the meetings will also allow Mr Major to lay the groundwork for
round-table talks at which the government has promised to set out fresh
peace proposals.
Five men were arrested in connection with the Greysteel massacre yesterday,
but two were later released. Detectives are now questioning 11 people in
connection with the shootings at Gough Barracks, Armagh.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Whitehall 'could save Pounds 15m on telecom bill'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL SAVINGS of Pounds 15m a year are at risk because Whitehall is
failing adequately to monitor its expenditure on telecommunications, the
National Audit Office says today.
The government's spending watchdog complains in a report that four years
after it first recommended measures to improve the management of
telecommunications in government departments, which could save up to 5 per
cent of total expenditure a year, progress has been 'slow and piecemeal'.
'No department could provide a profile of telecommunications expenditure by
location and type since 1989 or could identify the full scale of savings
achieved,' the NAO says.
While there were specific cases where departments had managed to cut costs,
often by substantial amounts, there had been no systematic attempt to check
telephone bills or take full advantage of modern technological safeguards
including call-logging and call-barring.
Whitehall spends more than Pounds 300m a year on telecommunications for
day-to-day administration. The NAO investigated the Crown Prosecution
Service, the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Ministry of
Agriculture. Together they account for about Pounds 22m of the total.
Where modern technology had been used, there had been considerable savings.
Call-logging equipment installed in one Home Office building revealed that
78 of the 130 exchange lines to the site could be withdrawn without
affecting the quality of service at a saving of Pounds 12,500 a year.
Detailed monitoring of telephone usage revealed overcharging on rental at
the Ministry of Agriculture's office in Guildford, Surrey, extending over
four years. Some Pounds 175,000 was subsequently recovered by the
department. The NAO says, however, that it was concerned to find that
departments did not know what savings, if any, they had achieved since the
earlier report. 'In particular, departments and agencies need to be alive to
the advantages on offer from continued technological developments and from
the growth of competition,' it argues.
Its recommendations include the allocation of telephone management
responsibilities and bill monitoring.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TRADE officials yesterday praised the revised offers to liberalise both
goods and services trade recently tabled in the Uruguay Round, and expressed
optimism about the likelihood of getting a Uruguay Round deal finished by
the December 15 deadline.
'The Uruguay Round will not fail,' said Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy trade
representative. 'The US feels upbeat about the range and level of
commitments that countries will take at the end of the day.'
Speaking separately yesterday, Mr John Schmidt, the Uruguay Round
co-ordinator, said thorny relations between the US and EC were 'mostly a
passing phenomenon'. However, he said the EC's offer to reduce semiconductor
tariffs from 14 per cent to 7 was insufficient and its market access offer
on agriculture would actually reduce access.
Mr Schmidt said the US would continue to resist an EC 'fixation' that the US
reduce all of its textile tariff peaks - those over 15 per cent  - although
it would reduce many.
The US must have changes in the negotiating text in the areas of
anti-dumping, investment, and health and food rules. This procedure will
begin on November 15, when the Trade Negotiating Committee begins meeting
virtually in continuous session.
He also urged negotiation of a larger market access package than the
'minimal' deal agreed at the Tokyo economic summit. Australia needs a zero
tariff pact in non-ferrous metals; the Asean countries, in electronics; and
Sweden and Switzerland, in scientific instruments.

AIRLINES from the less developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America
yesterday united in a fierce attack on US calls for total deregulation of
the world's airline market.
Air Botswana called the strategy 'a thug's charter,' and Royal Air Maroc,
the Moroccan flag carrier, said it was a US attempt to boost its own airline
industry's profitability at the expense of other countries' national
interests.
The attack came at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport
Association in Dallas as airlines responded to US calls for an 'open skies'
policy allowing unfettered competition between the world's airlines.
Mr Rubel Thomas, chairman and chef eecutive of Varig Brazilian Airlines,
said deregulation in the US had caused the demise of carriers such as Pan Am
and Eastern and had brought combined industry losses surpassing Dollars 10bn
in the last three years.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL and China are moving swiftly to establish trade and business ties,
following the visit by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, to China
last month.
Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group, yesterday said it had
established correspondent banking relations with China during a high-level
Hapoalim mission to Beijing. The bank said the relations would help Israeli
and foreign clients of Hapoalim wishing to invest in and trade with China.
Bank Hapoalim's announcement followed the signing in Jerusalem of a
memorandum on agricultural co-operation between Israel and China. The
memorandum, signed by Mr Liu Jiang, China's agriculture minister, and his
Israeli counterpart, Mr Yacov Tzur, provides for the establishment of a
standing Chinese-Israeli agricultural committee, exchange of experts and
information, the strengthening of a joint training programme and the
establishment of a joint Israeli-Chinese model farm near Beijing where
Israeli agricultural experts can demonstrate Israeli technology to Chinese
farmers.
During Mr Jiang's eight-day visit to Israel, which ends tomorrow, a Dollars
1.5m deal was also struck between Plastro G'vat of Israel and Beijing
Plastic to sell irrigation equipment to China.
Israeli officials said strengthening economic ties between the two countries
was a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. China has always
supported the Palestinians and held up ties.
Mr Dan Proper, president of the Israeli Manufacturers Association, who
accompanied Mr Rabin to China last month, said yesterday further trade deals
and joint ventures were in the pipeline, especially in advanced agricultural
technology and irrigation, communications, telephones and electronics, food
conservation, and chemicals such as potash.

<TEXT>
YAOHAN, a Japanese retailing group, plans to set up a big computerised
distribution centre in Beijing with the Chinese government, to be completed
in 1995.
Mr Kazuo Wada, Yaohan's chairman, who moved the group's headquarters to Hong
Kong in 1990, said the plan was part of his strategy of establishing
production, distribution and retail networks throughout China.
Yaohan, which has 432 stores worldwide, became the first foreign retailer to
set up shop in China, opening department stores in Shenzhen and Beijing in
1991. It is also building a shopping centre with floor space of 108,000 sq m
in Pudong, the special economic zone near Shanghai, to completed in 1995.
'China lacks proper wholesaling and distributing systems. It takes two to
three months to replace a product after it has been sold,' said Mr Wada. He
plans to set up distribution centres in 10 provinces, and wants to open
1,000 supermarkets in China by the year 2010.
Mr Wada reckons that the true purchasing ability of Chinese living in large
cities is not reflected in the official statistics. Although the national
average annual income is considered to be about Dollars 350 (Pounds 232) per
person, 'In Shanghai it's about Dollars 2,000 and in Shenzhen about Dollars
3,000,' he said.
Rockwell International, the US automotive-to-aerospace multinational, is
setting up a joint venture in China to develop and make a range of car body
components for the fast-expanding Chinese vehicle industry, John Griffiths
writes.
The venture, in which Rockwell will have a majority stake, is with Zhenjiang
General Equipment Factory, based about 200 miles from Shanghai. It will
operate under the name of Rockwell Chassis and Body System Zhenjiang
Company.
Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell will supply technology,
processing equipment, systems and management expertise - as well as an
undisclosed amount of investment capital - for the production of window
regulators, door latches, handbrakes and similar products.
Rockwell has been active in China since the 1970s. 'The venture reflects
Rockwell's overall strategy for investment in China, where there is a huge
potential for passenger car growth,' according to Mr Donald Beall, its
chairman and chief executive.
Rockwell already exports to China heavy-duty axles and brakes and components
for off-highway construction equipment, avionics, telecommunications and
automation equipment and printing presses.
Several of its existing motor industry customers, including Peugeot of
France, are either starting up of expanding car production in China.

AN Anglo-Malaysian joint venture through which the Proton, Malaysia's
national car, will be marketed in continental Europe from the middle of next
year was formalised in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
The venture, Proton Cars Europe, is between Proton itself, its Malaysian
distributor, Edaran Otomobil Nasional, and Mr David Brown, who introduced
Proton cars to the UK - which has subsequently become by far Proton's
largest largest export market.
Mr Brown will have a 55 per cent stake, Proton 25 and Edaran 20. The initial
sales target for the first year of operation is 8,000 units, although the
long-term hope is for much larger sales as Proton's production capacity
expands.
Proton has about 70 per cent of the Malaysian car market and is now making
an aggressive sales push overseas. It has outline plans to set up an
assembly plant in Vietnam and is considering an overseas manufacturing
facility, possibly in Chile. Capacity at the plant, 20 miles outside Kuala
Lumpur, is being increased to 150,000 units a year from the current 120,000
and the 80,000 with which the car project began in the mid-1980s.
This is to cope with both the introduction of new models and the start of
manufacture of left-hand-drive vehicles for export to Europe from early next
year.
Currently Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd, the Proton's manufacturer, makes
only right-hand-drive cars. Malaysians drive on the left, reflecting the
country's former colonial status, and exports hitherto have been confined to
right-hand-drive markets.
The UK is by far the biggest export market, with just under 15,000 sold in
1992 and 16,000 projected for the current year. Another 2,000 annually have
been sold in other right-hand-drive markets such as New Zealand, Australia,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other Commonwealth markets.
Proton is itself a joint venture company in which Japan's Mitsubishi Corp
has a 17 per cent stake.
Proton Cars Europe will not, however, act as a conventional importer and
distributor in continental Europe in the same way as Proton Cars operates in
the UK. Instead, its role will be to research and recommend to Proton a
network of national distributors for each European country, and to
co-ordinate their activities after they have been appointed.

ISRAEL and China are moving swiftly to establish trade and business ties,
following the visit by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, to China
last month.
Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group, yesterday said it had
established correspondent banking relations with China during a high-level
Hapoalim mission to Beijing. The bank said the relations would help Israeli
and foreign clients of Hapoalim wishing to invest in and trade with China.
Bank Hapoalim's announcement followed the signing in Jerusalem of a
memorandum on agricultural co-operation between Israel and China. The
memorandum, signed by Mr Liu Jiang, China's agriculture minister, and his
Israeli counterpart, Mr Yacov Tzur, provides for the establishment of a
standing Chinese-Israeli agricultural committee, exchange of experts and
information, the strengthening of a joint training programme and the
establishment of a joint Israeli-Chinese model farm near Beijing where
Israeli agricultural experts can demonstrate Israeli technology to Chinese
farmers.
During Mr Jiang's eight-day visit to Israel, which ends tomorrow, a Dollars
1.5m deal was also concluded between Plastro G'vat of Israel and Beijing
Plastic to sell Israeli irrigation equipment to China.
Chinese technicians are already learning about the irrigation technology at
Kibbutz G'vat.
Mr Jiang said Israeli irrigation equipment and other agricultural technology
would be especially helpful in western China, which has a similar climate to
Israel's. 'Your irrigation systems can contribute a lot to advance the
co-operation between the two countries,' he said.
Israeli officials said strengthening economic ties between the two countries
was a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. China has always
supported the Palestinians and held up ties despite establishing diplomatic
relations with Israel two years ago.
Mr Dan Proper, president of the Israeli Manufacturers Association, who
accompanied Mr Rabin to China last month, said yesterday further trade deals
and joint ventures were in the pipeline, especially in advanced agricultural
technology and irrigation, communications, telephones and electronics, food
conservation, and chemicals such as potash.

<TEXT>
ROCKWELL International, the US automotive-to-aerospace multinational, is
setting up a joint venture in China to develop and make a range of car body
components for the fast-expanding Chinese vehicle industry.
The venture, in which Rockwell will have a majority stake, is with Zhenjiang
General Equipment Factory, based about 200 miles from Shanghai. It will
operate under the name of Rockwell Chassis and Body System Zhenjiang
Company.
Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell will supply technology,
processing equipment, systems and management expertise - as well as an
undisclosed amount of investment capital - for the production of window
regulators, door latches, handbrakes and similar products.
Rockwell has been active in China since the 1970s. 'The venture reflects
Rockwell's overall strategy for investment in China, where there is a huge
potential for passenger car growth,' according to Mr Donald Beall, its
chairman and chief executive.
Rockwell already exports to China heavy-duty axles and brakes and components
for off-highway construction equipment, avionics, telecommunications and
automation equipment and printing presses.
Several of its existing motor industry customers, including Peugeot of
France, are either starting up of expanding car production in China.

FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Vision of unity for embattled central
America - A commitment to freer trade and integration among six poor
republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX small, poor republics of central America, still suffering the
fallout from more than a decade of ruinous civil wars, huge foreign debts,
and injudicious economic policies, made an important commitment last week to
economic integration.
The six presidents signed an agreement on Friday which will set them on
course for free trade within the area and lay the foundations for deeper
political harmonisation - for those that want it.
It reflects the view of politicians and the business community that greater
economic integration is essential if central America's 30m inhabitants are
to avoid being swamped economically by extra-regional competitors.
While short on binding measures or concrete commitments, the agreement is an
important statement of intent to strengthen regional integration in the new
realities of central America.
The deal comes in the form of a protocol to the original 1960 General Treaty
on Central American Economic Integration which created the Central American
Common Market. The new model of integration with a common external tariff of
20 per cent replaces an import substitution one based on high external
tariffs. With the exception of Panama, all the countries have already
adopted this new regime.
The presidents also undertook to speed up the removal of the last of the
internal non-tariff barriers that have been erected over the past decade or
so.
Objections by Costa Rica to anything beyond merely trade initiatives forced
the core group of four - Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua
(Panama is something of a special case) - to make 'voluntary and gradual'
the protocol's implementation.
Panama has only recently thrown its hat in with central America and is
expected to move more slowly on integration.
Mr Rafael Rodriguez, the secretary general of Sieca, the technical body
which has drafted the nuts and bolts of the agreement, admitted that he
would have liked deadlines for the commitments in the protocol, but denied
that its voluntary nature would diminish commitment.
'It is not a strait-jacket,' he said. 'There is an element of flexibility.'
While the Costa Rican government insisted it supported free trade in the
region, it would not accept a customs union, the free movement of labour or
a commitment to a single currency.
'If we allowed free movement of labour, a million Nicaraguans would cross
over our northern border to seek work,' Mr Roberto Rojas, the Costa Rican
trade minister said in an interview recently.
Nor did Costa Rica, which receives 50 per cent of its fiscal revenue from
import duties, wish to lose control over its collection, implied by a
customs union, where any central American port would act as a point of entry
to the region.
During the 1980s, civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, trade
barriers, and mutual hostility between Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinistas and
the region's right-wing military-dominated governments contributed to a drop
in intra-regional trade from a peak of Dollars 1.1bn in 1980 to Dollars 450m
in 1986. This year trade flows are expected to pass Dollars 1bn.
But the new vision of integration is not just about trade. Recently El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, abolished passport controls
for their citizens, and plans are well advanced on connecting stock markets
and allowing banks, brokerage houses and other financial institutions to
operate in each other's country.
The region's governments, which by happy coincidence are at the moment cut
more or less from the same ideological cloth, are endeavouring to
co-ordinate macro-economic policy, adopting realistic exchange rates and the
tight fiscal policies recommended by the international financial
institutions.
Greater co-ordination on trade issues has already born some fruit. The five
central American nations were the first to get together behind a plan to
withhold 20 per cent of coffee exports to push up world prices, which came
into effect on October 1.
Central America has also been told repeatedly by the US that its chances of
reaching a free trade agreement would be greatly increased if it could
negotiate en bloc, despite Costa Rica's efforts to cut its own deal.
Similarly the bloc has already negotiated so-called asymmetrical agreements
which favour central America with Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, and talks
are under way with the Caribbean community.
But while the grand conflicts of the 1980s are nominally over, or have
diminished to the occasional combat, the region's impoverishment continues
to fuel unrest, which could undermine integration.
'If we can solve these problems, we can make a quantum leap,' says Mr Gert
Rosenthal, the Guatemalan secretary general of the Santiago-based Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 'If central America is to
compete in the world economy it must integrate its economies.'

EMIRATES Dubai Television plans to launch next month what it says is the
world's first 24-hour Arabic satellite television service.
EDTV, already available in the Middle East, hopes to reach 14m more Arabs
living in Europe and North and Central America.
The service will be carried on the Eutelsat II satellite in Europe and on
Galaxy satellite on the other side of the Atlantic, where it will be
available from Canada to Venezuela.
The exporting of a television service from Dubai is the latest sign of the
growing internationalising of the television market.
Next spring BBC World Service Television is to launch a news service in
Arabic for the Middle East. EDTV plans a December 6 launch.
EDTV, which will use programmes, presenters, and technical staff drawn from
all over the Middle East, plans to broadcast 70 per cent in Arabic and 30
per cent in English.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Dollars 1.8bn issue launched to rebuild Beirut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE EASTERN investors were yesterday invited to subscribe to one of the
region's biggest public share issues - and in effect to buy a stake in
Lebanon's future - with the launch of Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds
1.2bn) company designed to rebuild Beirut's city centre.
Subscription will be open to Lebanese and other Arab nationals on a scale of
priorities determined by the company. The offer, of 6.5m shares at Dollars
100 each, closes on January 10. 'It is probably the largest private launch
in the Middle East,' Mr Nasr al-Shamaa, Solidere's general secretary, said
yesterday.
A successful launch would provide the biggest private investment tranche
towards the ambitious rebuilding plans of Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's
billionaire businessman turned prime minister. Solidere's city centre
project is a pivot of Mr Hariri's 10-year, Dollars 13bn programme to revive
Beirut as the cosmopolitan hub of trade, finance and recreation it was
before the 17-year civil war erupted in 1975.
The government already has aid pledges of more than Dollars 1bn for specific
rebuilding projects from the EC, UN, the Opec Fund, Arab institutions and
European countries.
But the share offer will be a test of private sector commitment to Mr
Hariri's ambitions and, in particular, of his conviction that wealthy
expatriate Lebanese will channel wealth back into their country. Lebanese
expatriates are estimated to hold Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn in assets
outside the country.
The issue represents 35 per cent of Solidere's equity, the remainder of
which will comprise 11.7m class A shares distributed among 150,000 Lebanese
in exchange for their title to property on which Solidere will rebuild. A
government committee valued this land in central Beirut at Dollars 1.17bn -
the value of shares to be issued to former property owners.
Additional class B shares in Solidere - its name being the French acronym
for Lebanese Company for Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central
District - will be offered to these former landowners, other Lebanese
residents, government agencies, Lebanese expatriates and Arab citizens - in
that order of priority.
Paribas of France and Saudi American Bank, the Riyadh-based joint venture
bank, will act as subscription agents for the sale outside Lebanon.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Palestinians suspend talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators broke down yesterday
over the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip.
The Palestinian team, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, said it was suspending talks
with Israel until next week and would consult Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, before resuming the talks on the
details of implementing the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
The disagreement over the extent of Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza,
due to begin in less than six weeks, is the first real snag in the talks
which are supposed to conclude a protocol on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
and the West Bank area of Jericho by the middle of next month.
On Monday Israel presented maps and plans for the withdrawal and
redeployment of its soldiers, which leaves control of several roads used by
the 5,000 Jewish settlers in Gaza in Israeli hands. Substantial Israeli
forces would also remain in the settlements, on the beaches and on the roads
even after a withdrawal was supposed to have been completed by April.
There would be full Israeli control over the border crossing from Gaza into
Egypt, and plans to ensure the protection of Israeli settlers moving through
the Gaza area.
Palestinians say the proposals contravene the peace agreement. They are
particularly upset at Israel's insistence that it maintain a military
presence over roads leading into the settlements which pass through
Palestinians population areas.
After yesterday's breakdown Palestinians said they would demand complete
Israeli troop withdrawal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party of Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin appeared to have
suffered an electoral setback in Jerusalem yesterday as Israelis voted
across the country in the first test of public opinion since the signing of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
According to exit polls by Israel television, Mr Teddy Kollek, the
83-year-old Labour mayor of Jerusalem, was defeated by his Likud challenger,
Mr Ehud Olmert, by 55 per cent of the vote to 41 per cent.
Elsewhere in the country, political analysts predicted before voting that
Labour would marginally increase its control over local government, reducing
the power of the right-wing Likud party which controls more councils than
Labour. In Tel Aviv, where Mr Ronni Milo was aiming to retain Israel's
commercial capital for Likud, exit polls showed the two parties running
neck-and-neck with 45 per cent of the vote each.
Mr Kollek had headed the administration of Jerusalem, centre-point of the
battle with Likud, for 28 years. Mr Olmert, an MP who opposes the peace
accord, delivered a last-minute blow by cutting a deal for the support of
the city's ultra-orthodox community. Under it, an ultra-orthodox candidate,
Mr Meir Porush, agreed to drop out of the race and swing his votes behind Mr
Olmert.
Forecasters had said that to win re-election Mr Kollek would need a heavy
turnout from the city's 80,000 Palestinians living in Israeli-occupied Arab
east Jerusalem. But turnout was reported by Israel radio at less than 1 per
cent among Palestinian Jerusalemites.
Mr Kollek is a standard-bearer of peaceful co-existence between Arabs and
Jews while Mr Olmert had campaigned on an aggressive policy of Jewish
settlement throughout Jerusalem, including neighbourhoods which under Mr
Kollek were reserved for Palestinians.
Palestinian politicians said yesterday a defeat for Mr Kollek would
seriously set back talks between Palestinians and Israel on the future of
the Holy City, due to begin within two years. But many Jewish voters
believed Mr Kollek was too old to lead the city again.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Jordan's wider choice narrows the debate: The kingdom's
first multi-party election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX political heavyweights from Amman's Third District faced nearly two
thousand voters in the ballroom of the Philadelphia Hotel and were quizzed
for three hours on their campaigns leading up to Jordan's general election
next Monday.
Questions ranged from women's rights to corruption, from Jordan's economic
reform programme to its education system. The candidates included an
ex-prime minister and three former ministers.
It was a rare display of political debate in a region not noted for freedom
of expression. But it is unlikely to have changed the way members of the
audience vote on November 8. Most have already made up their minds.
In Jordan's last elections in 1989, candidates ran as independents for the
80-member lower house of parliament. This time round more than 15 political
parties and 555 candidates are officially registered to contest seats in the
country's first multi-party elections since 1956.
The kingdom is festooned with posters, banners and campaign leaflets. And
the 1.5m voters are seemingly spoilt for choice. But there is a distinct
lack of enthusiasm.
Most people blame the controversial new election law - announced by King
Hussein in August - which changed the rules to one person, one vote. Under
the old system, the number of votes allowed equalled the number of seats in
the district. Thus voters had two or three, and in one constituency, nine
votes to play with.
This suited most candidates because if they lobbied hard enough and obtained
the support of a majority of voters, even as the second or third choice,
they stood a chance of being elected. This time round they have to be the
first and only choice.
The effect has been a narrowing of political debate. The electoral change is
purposely weighted in favour of those candidates with strong tribal
affiliations and influential families, the bedrock of King Hussein's
faithful. Their votes will be won out of obligation and loyalty, which take
precedence over choice or preference in Jordanian society.
As a result, most candidates are campaigning to widen their private network
of contacts on a limited range of local and personal issues. Manifestos
generally consist of little more than vacuous slogans calling for national
unity, Arab unity, a free Palestine, and democracy for all.
Campaigns are conducted in homes, over the telephone, and by buttering-up
influential tribal and family figures.
Most of the parties have chosen to sell the attributes of individual
candidates rather than the party itself. The expected losers are the new
political parties which are largely based on woolly ideologies rather than
useful tribal connections.
The exception is the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the political wing of the
Moslem Brotherhood, which backed numerous candidates in the last election
and won 21 of 80 parliamentary seats. This time the IAF has 36 candidates
standing in 16 of 20 districts.
Its leaders say the new electoral system is weighted against them. Last week
they met the prime minister to complain that their campaign was being
targeted by the government. Until last weekend, when the High Court
over-ruled the minister of the interior, they were banned from holding
large-scale public rallies, and they say that their supporters in the civil
service have been forbidden to campaign for the party.
The likely outcome is that the new parliament will be dominated by
pro-government and tribal MPs. The expected decrease in the number of
successful fundamentalist candidates would result in less opposition to
government policies. And King Hussein would be able to continue with his
agenda without worrying about a rowdy house of elected representatives.

BANESTO, the big Spanish commercial bank, said yesterday it had formed a

Moroccan groups to fund development in Jericho and in the Gaza strip.
The venture, called Salam 2000, brings the Spanish bank together with Koor,
the Israeli industrial and financial group, as well as Morocco's powerful
Omnium Nord Africain (ONA) holding and with Palestinian investors lead by Mr
Jawid Ghossein, the head of the Palestine National Fund, a para-governmental
body that acts as the finance ministry of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Banesto, which did not disclose details of the shareholding in the joint
venture, said Salam 2000's initial project would be to finance a cement
factory in an unamed location. The bank said it intended to tap the US
markets for a further Dollars 150m for more investments in the area.
It described the move as a pioneering investment in the Israeli-occupied
territories where the Palestinians are being granted self-rule.
Earlier this year Banesto established close relations with JP Morgan, the US
investment bank which is helping the Spanish group to raise its capital base
through rights issues aimed at US institutions.

MS SYLVIE Kinigi, prime minister of Burundi, the East African country's top
official since President Melchior Ndadaye was killed in a coup, emerged from
12 days of hiding at the French embassy yesterday to hold talks with army
chiefs, Reuter reports from Bujumbura.
'She came out of the embassy guarded by about 20 French soldiers,' a witness
said.
Ms Kinigi has asked the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity
to send in about 1,000 foreign troops to help protect her and government
members. The army opposed this and UN undersecretary general James Jonah
last night rejected the idea. But the UN appealed for Dollars 17m (Pounds
11.2m) to provide urgent food and shelter to 675,000 Burundi refugees who
have fled to three neighbouring states.

MR MUSALIA MUDAVADI, Kenya's finance minister, warned yesterday that Kenya
might have to reschedule part of its Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) external
debt because of an accumulation of Dollars 700m in arrears resulting from
the suspension of foreign aid.
Mr Mudavadi raised the probability of debt renegotiations as the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund announced their support for a three-year
programme of economic reforms designed to mend Kenya's estranged relations
with the international donor community.
A policy framework paper, to be presented to donors, outlines Kenya's
commitment to cutting the budget deficit, curbing inflation from its present
50 per cent a year, and rooting out corruption in the state sector.
The IMF's endorsement of Kenya's new economic policies is critical for the
success of a donors' conference in Paris this month which will discuss the
renewal of financial aid. However, there were no immediate signs that the
IMF was preparing to resume financial assistance to Kenya.
It would be the first time Kenya has sought to refinance its foreign
obligations with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Kenya took pride in its
repayment record until donors, irked by corruption and economic
mismanagement, suspended balance-of-payments aid in November 1991, worth
about Dollars 40m a month.
'The arrears component of our foreign debt may require rescheduling,' Mr
Mudavadi said in an interview. Kenya also faces a large balance of payments
gap due to its trade deficit and heavy debt servicing obligations.
With foreign exchange reserves of just Dollars 260m, private-sector
economists believe Kenya is heading for a balance of payments crisis unless
donor governments are prepared to resume a measure of financial support.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Abu Dhabi to face new BCCI demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are
planning to move swiftly to negotiate a higher contribution for creditors
from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank.
They plan to push for payments higher than the originally negotiated Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in an effort to prevent complex litigation which could
take many years and leave hundreds of thousands of creditors with little
prospect of compensation.
It also emerged yesterday that the liquidators have negotiated a tax refund
from the Inland Revenue in the UK of about Pounds 20m overpaid by the bank.
The claim, which relates to incorrectly stated figures and tax deducted at
source over several years as well as interest, was paid out in the last few
weeks.
The liquidators' latest action follows the surprise decision by the
Luxembourg courts last week to uphold an appeal by three creditors against
the agreement between the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi.
In preliminary meetings this week the liquidators have tentatively decided
not to appeal against the ruling. Neither do they favour the prospect of
suing Abu Dhabi in the search for funds for creditors to BCCI, which was
closed in July 1991.
The strategy has been developed in advance of a full meeting today and
Thursday of the liquidators to the bank's principal companies in England,
the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg.
Mr Brian Smouha, Mr Georges Baden and Mr Julien Rodin, the three liquidators
to the main BCCI holding company in Luxembourg, in any case face
difficulties in making an appeal because they are officials appointed by the
courts.
They are awaiting written judgment from last week's appeal, but seem to have
ruled out a possible option from Judge Raul Gretsch to re-submit their
proposals in a modified form.
The Abu Dhabi government said its position remained unaltered and it had no
plans to increase its offer agreed with liquidators in February last year.
This would have provided a contribution of at least Dollars 1.7bn to
creditors in exchange for them waiving rights to sue, and would have allowed
a payout of 15p in the pound next year.
Abu Dhabi has an estimated Dollars 2.2bn in preferential claims deposited
with BCCI, and it could potentially counter-sue the bank to recover the
money, which would wipe out any returns to other creditors.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Malaysia: furious growth continues: A look at the south-east
Asian nation's optimistic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S economy continues to expand at rates western countries dream
about.
On Friday Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister, presented the 1994 budget
and forecast that Malaysia's gross domestic product was likely to grow by
8.2 per cent this year.
'With this growth, the Malaysian economy would have experienced growth rates
of 8 to 9 per cent for six successive years, an attainment which has never
been achieved before,' said Mr Anwar.
Officials say Malaysia is on course to achieve its aim of becoming a fully
industrialised country by the year 2020. 'We are moving into a period of
sustainable economic development,' said one official. 'To achieve our goal
we aim for 7 per cent growth in each of the next 27 years.'
While some might doubt that such high growth can be maintained, Malaysia is
optimistic.
The Kuala Lumpur stock market, which has risen more than 50 per cent since
the beginning of the year, largely due to a massive influx of foreign funds,
reached a new all-time high in the aftermath of Mr Anwar's budget speech.
Despite a recession in many of its markets, Malaysia's export earnings are
expected to grow by 16 per cent to MDollars 120bn (USDollars 47bn) this
year, compared with a 10 per cent rise in 1992.
While Malaysia still runs a substantial deficit in its services account, a
strong export performance is expected to result in a surplus in the balance
of payments current account, the first since 1989.
Strong economic growth has brought an improvement in national finances.
Foreign exchange reserves rose from MDollars 47.2bn at the end of 1992 to
over MDollars 60bn and the country's debt service ratio has gone down to 5.2
per cent from 5.7 per cent of gross exports.
Despite a rise of 13 per cent in development spending in the 1994 budget,
the government says an increase in revenues due to strong economic growth
means that Malaysia is expected to achieve a balanced budget for the first
time.
Meanwhile, there is zero unemployment in most parts of the country, annual
per capita incomes have risen in the last 12 months by 11 per cent to
MDollars 8,350 and the overall inflation rate has dropped to 3.7 per cent
compared with over 5 per cent early last year.
But fast growth has resulted in infrastructure bottlenecks. As in other
fast-emerging economies such as Thailand and Indonesia, Malaysia's roads are
jammed with vehicles, ports are congested and its power industry lacks
capacity.
'The present infrastructural constraints, especially in power and transport,
have occurred too often and are now being addressed as a matter of urgency,'
said Mr Anwar in his budget speech. Critics say that by not tackling these
problems sooner, the government has put at risk further economic growth.
The other main problem area is investment. Much of Malaysia's recent
economic growth is due to the government's success in luring investments
from overseas.
Attracted by the country's political stability and its relatively low wages,
multinational companies have poured millions of dollars into electronics and
other industries.
In 1990-91 foreign companies invested about MDollars 17bn in Malaysia's
manufacturing sector, representing well over half total investment. In the
first seven months of this year foreign investments fell to MDollars 2.4bn.
In part the fall-off is because of the tough times being endured by many
cash-strapped foreign companies. But it is also because Malaysia is facing
stiff competition for investment from countries such as China and Vietnam.
'Every country in this region is trying to offer the best tax package for
investors and we cannot be left behind,' says Mr Anwar. The 1994 budget cuts
corporate tax by two percentage points to 32 per cent, with a further
two-point reduction in 1995.
Under the present five-year plan (1991-95) the government's aim was to
lessen dependence on foreign investment, with domestic concerns playing a
greater role. But this has not happened, even though many Malaysian
companies are cash-rich. Domestic investment fell by more than 50 per cent
to MDollars 2bn in the first seven months of this year. The 1994 budget
includes a number of tax and other incentives to encourage more
participation in the economy by domestic concerns.
Malaysia's development is also being affected by skills constraints.
A comprehensive overhaul of the education system is planned, but there are
those who wonder whether the government has delayed too long in taking
action.
'Short-term, Malaysia will continue to be a success story,' said one local
economist. 'But we've really only made it to the first development plateau.
It's going to be a lot tougher from now on.'

<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND'S ruling National party appears increasingly likely to win
Saturday's general election, aided by a surprising late run from the
third-ranking Alliance, according to the last national opinion poll to be
conducted before the election.
The Heylen polling organisation yesterday confirmed other recent polls which
showed that the Alliance is attracting votes from Labour supporters,
reducing its prospects of victory. Up to a fortnight ago, Labour and
National were attracting similar levels of support at around 40 per cent.
Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, worried by the loss of support, this week
switched the focus of his campaign to fight on two fronts: attacking both
the government and the Alliance.
The Alliance is led by Mr Jim Anderton, a dissident former Labour MP who as
party president orchestrated Labour's landslide victory in 1984 before
resigning over its move to the right.
Mr Anderton stitched together an apparently unlikely consortium of
opposition groups, including left-wing trade unionists, former Labour party
members, the Green party, the Social Credit party, and a Maori opposition
group Mana Matahaki led by Mr Mat Rata, a former Minister of Maori Affairs
in a past Labour government. They are united in wanting to overturn the
'monetarist' reform programmes followed since 1984 by both National and
Labour parties in government.
The poll showed that National had increased its lead by one percentage point
to 39 per cent. Labour was down two points to 32 per cent as support grew
for the Alliance, especially in the key marginal Auckland seats which are
expected to decide the outcome of the election. The Alliance was up one
point to 17 per cent, and New Zealand First, led by Mr Winston Peters, a
dissident former Maori MP, was down one point to 9 per cent.
Mr Moore remained the preferred prime minister with 22 per cent support. Mr
Anderton was up five points to 15 per cent to match the prime minister, Mr
Jim Bolger, while Mr Peters had 14 per cent support.
The poll also showed that voters were moving towards favouring a
continuation of the Westminster-style first-past-the-post electoral system
ahead of a referendum being conducted along with the election. Support for
that system had increased to 41 per cent, while that for the German mixed
member proportional option was down slightly at 46 per cent. This time last
year only 20 per cent of voters favoured the UK method while 72 per cent
wanted the German system.

MR MUSALIA Mudavadi, Kenya's finance minister, warned yesterday that Kenya
might have to reschedule part of its Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) external
debt because of an accumulation of Dollars 700m in arrears resulting from
the suspension of foreign aid.
Mr Mudavadi raised the probability of debt renegotiations as the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund announced their support for a three-year
programme of economic reforms designed to mend Kenya's estranged relations
with the international donor community.
The IMF's endorsement of Kenya's new economic policies is critical for the
success of a donors' conference in Paris this month which will discuss the
renewal of financial aid. However, there were no immediate signs that the
IMF was preparing to resume financial assistance to Kenya.
It would be the first time Kenya has sought to refinance its foreign
obligations with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Kenya took pride on its

mismanagement, suspended balance-of-payments aid in November 1991, worth
about Dollars 40m a month.
'The arrears component of our foreign debt may require rescheduling,' Mr
Mudavadi said in an interview with the Financial Times. Apart from the issue
of arrears, Kenya also faces a large balance of payments gap due to its
trade deficit and heavy debt servicing obligations.
Mr Mudavadi declined to put a figure on the balance of payments shortfall,
which will form the basis of Kenya's appeal for the resumption of financial
assistance. To avoid disappointment, Mr Mudavadi said he was not going to
Paris with a shopping list of demands.
But given the central bank's foreign exchange reserves of just Dollars 260m,
private-sector economists believe Kenya is heading for a balance of payments
crisis unless donor governments are prepared to resume a measure of
financial support.
Mr Hiroyuki Hino, head of the IMF delegation to Kenya, said the economic
programme which had his blessing would be presented at the donors' meeting
in Paris.
The policy framework paper outlines Kenya's commitment to cutting the budget
deficit, curbing inflation from its present 50 per cent a year, and rooting
out corruption in the state sector.
The economic programme will be an important factor in the discussions with
donors, but by no means the only one. Donor governments have recently voiced
concern over the rising level of ethnic violence in Kenya, and the
government's apparent indifference to the plight of thousands of displaced
peasants in the Rift Valley.
There are also concerns despite recent government moves to clamp down on
financial improprieties in the banking sector, not a single wrong-doer has
been brought to justice. Mr Mudavadi said it was the government's intention
to investigate all cases of corruption and to bring them to justice. But his
priorities were to seal the loopholes that had been abused.
This was the aim of all his recent reforms, including the abolition of
import licences, the merging of the official and market foreign exchange
rates and the deregulation of the maize trade which was previously a state
monopoly.

<TEXT>
MORE than 100 prisoners on death row in the Caribbean could have their
sentences commuted to life imprisonment following a ruling by seven Law
Lords in London yesterday.
The British judges sitting as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
which remains the final court of appeal for 16 Commonwealth countries
including Jamaica, allowed the appeal of two Jamaicans, Mr Earl Pratt and Mr
Ivan Morgan, who have been under sentence of death since 1979.
Commuting their sentences to life imprisonment the judges said it was 'an
inhuman act to keep a man facing the agony of execution over a long extended
period of time'.
On three occasions the death warrant had been read to the men and they had
been removed to condemned cells next to the gallows. This alone was
sufficient to bring home to people of normal sensitivity and compassion the
agony these men had been through over 14 years, the judges said.
There was 'an instinctive revulsion' against the prospect of hanging a man
after he had been held under sentence of death for many years.
The Law Lords said that in future, where an execution was to take place more
than five years after sentence, the case should be referred to the Jamaican
Privy Council with a recommendation that the sentence should be commuted to
life imprisonment.
There are now 23 prisoners on death row in Jamaica who have been awaiting
execution for more than 10 years.
The Law Lords said they were conscious that the Jamaican government faced
great difficulties with a high murder rate and limited financial resources,
but warned: 'Nevertheless, if capital punishment is to be retained it must
be carried out with all possible expedition.'

FT  03 NOV 93 / Pained Senate weighs harassment charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the second day running Senator Bob Packwood, the Republican from Oregon,
yesterday tried to persuade his colleagues in the Senate to accept a
compromise whereby he would hand over some, but not all, of his possibly
incriminating private diaries.
The Senate ethics committee is seeking approval for a subpoena for all the
diaries, dating back to 1969, as part of its investigation into charges that
Mr Packwood sexually harassed more than 25 women.
Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, Democratic chairman of the committee,
announced last week that extracts perused so far suggested Mr Packwood may
also have engaged in other improper but unspecified activities.
Mr Packwood's compromise would make available all the diaries relevant to
the harassment accusations and to the additional charge, reported in an
Oregon newspaper over the weekend, that he tried to persuade lobbyists to
hire his former wife. The rest would be turned over to an independent
arbiter who would pass on what he considered relevant.
Far more notable than the substance of Mr Packwood's offers has been the
intense embarrassment, even pain, that his performance on the Senate floor
has caused his saddened and grim colleagues. Leaping constantly to his feet
to interject, sometimes incoherently and contradictorily, he has given the
appearance of a man at the end of his emotional tether.
Privately many wish Mr Packwood would simply resign and go away, or that the
voters of Oregon would try to recall him. But in a long political career as
a quintessential Republican moderate, the senator has always been known as a
man to fight his corner, be it politically or personally.
He was narrowly returned to a fifth six-year term a year ago. Shortly
thereafter the Washington Post published details of the sexual harassment
accusations against him. Mr Packwood initially blamed his problems on
alcohol but has shown no signs of resigning his seat. In fighting back he
has intimated knowledge of extra-marital affairs by other members of
Congress.
There has been some sympathy for his contention that the ethics committee
staff should not be given licence to 'rummage through' his personal papers
and some criticism of Mr Bryan for having spoken of possible criminal
charges.
But the sentiment of the Senate seems clearly behind its own ethics
committee and its arguments for a subpoena. Senator Barbara Mikulski, the
Maryland Democrat and a committee member, maintained with some force that
'we are not the committee on voyeurism'.
Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat, also reminded colleagues that
sexual harassment charges against a sitting senator were not to be taken
lightly, especially after the embarrassing spectacle of the Senate's
grilling of Professor Anita Hill two years ago during the hearings on the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.

FT  03 NOV 93 / US data point to solid growth in next half year

<TEXT>
NEW government economic data yesterday showed the US economy to be gaining
strength, lending weight to predictions of solid growth in the next two
quarters.
The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, published
yesterday, showed a rise of 0.5 per cent in September after a 0.9 per cent
gain in August.
The leading index, designed to predict movements in economic activity,
climbed to reflect an expanding money supply and buoyant orders for consumer
goods, and higher share prices and increase demands for building permits.
The index fell in the first half of this year, stabilised in June and July
and climbed in August and September.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose by 21
per cent in September to their highest level in seven years. New home sales
jumped to an annual rate of 762,000, 13 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Home sales have benefited from mortgage interest rates at their lowest level
in 25 years. Rates averaged 6.91 per cent in September and have since
slipped a little lower.
Most regions showed large increases, with sales rising 28 per cent in the
south, 24 per cent in the Midwest and 15 per cent in the west. Only the
northeast showed a decline in sales of 7 per cent.
Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes
also jumped in September.
Mr Ed Yardeni, economist with brokers CJ Lawrence, said this pace of home
sales was probably not sustainable, and the rate would be likely to decline
in October.
'Nevertheless, housing activity is clearly stronger, and will add to
economic growth this quarter,' he said.
Economists said both the index of leading economic indicators and the home
sales statistics were consistent with forecasts for stronger growth in the
second half of the year.
Initial government estimates of GDP published last week showed growth in the
third quarter at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent, and some economists now
predict the economy will expand at a rate above 4 per cent in the fourth
quarter, before subsiding in the new year.
'Our current fourth-quarter estimate is 4.2 per cent, and the risk to that
number is probably on the upside,' said brokers Merrill Lynch.
Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist with Economic Advisors, a Boston consulting
firm, is more cautious, predicting growth of around 3.0 per cent in the
fourth quarter and lower growth in the first half of next year.

FT  03 NOV 93 / States win approval for welfare reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reform
welfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experiments
for the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President Bill
Clinton.
The Wisconsin plan would cut off cash payments under the principal welfare
programme, known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, after two
years, although it would continue to provide food stamps and health
coverage. The pilot scheme will be started in two counties in 1995.
Republican Governor Tommy Thompson has made Wisconsin a pioneer in welfare
reform, with experiments such as Schoolfare, which cuts welfare payments to
teenage mothers who do not go to school.
In Georgia, the state does not plan a time limit on benefits, but wants to
reduce welfare payments to able-bodied adults who refuse offers of work and
deny increases in payments to families on long-term welfare who have more
children.
The federal government, which has to grant waivers to states wishing to
depart from normal US welfare rules, is also considering proposals from
Florida and Vermont for time limits on welfare benefits, and White House
officials have said that a two-year limit will be a central feature of Mr
Clinton's own welfare reform plans.
The promise to 'end welfare as we know it' was an important theme in Mr
Clinton's election campaign. Although he named a welfare reform task force
in June, the reform has been held up by delays in passing the budget and is
now expected to be delayed until the ambitious reform of the healthcare
system has passed Congress.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Violence and distrust mark Colombia polls: Politicians duck
bombs while they battle with voter disillusionment at corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICS is not a safe profession in Colombia. Yesterday the campaign
offices of the governing Liberal party's presidential candidate was
dynamited, injuring one person. Last month, guerrillas blew up an electoral
registry office and a political party campaign office.
Over the last five years, five of the top six presidential candidates in
next May's presidential election have variously survived shootings, a
kidnap, a grenade attack and bombings. Politicians acknowledge that it is
too dangerous to campaign in some parts of the country.
On top of this, Colombia's 14 presidential contenders are having a difficult
time overcoming disillusionment with party politics and corrupt political
practices.
So many candidates might be expected to produce wide-ranging programmes and
choice, but the early stages of the campaign have been marked by moral
skirmishes rather than debates about violence, social problems or the
economy.
The 1994 electoral calendar is a heavy one for apathetic voters:
congressional elections take place in March and Colombians will vote for
president in May. If no candidate polls more than half the ballots there
will be a run-off between the winner and runner-up. Then local government
elections - which excite much greater enthusiasm now that budgets and
responsibilities have been decentralised - follow in October.
The two candidates leading the opinion polls by a big margin - Mr Andres
Pastrana of the Conservative New Democratic Force and Mr Ernesto Samper of
the Liberal party - will probably fight it out in the second round of the
election. Both are under 50 years, firmly entrenched in the political
establishment and neither would represent an abrupt change of direction.
Mr Pastrana, the son of a former Conservative president, was the first
elected mayor of Bogota and is now a senator. Keeping his distance from the
campaign scramble - he has yet formally to declare his candidacy - appears
to have done Mr Pastrana's popularity no harm, though some commentators are
becoming impatient with his reticence.
Although Mr Samper was minister for economic development at the beginning of
President Cesar Gaviria's government he has criticised the speed of the
liberalisation process. His emphasis on jobs and social spending does not,
however, imply an about-turn in economic policy.
As a strong party man Mr Samper has had the time to build up a big
parliamentary and regional following. But in a country where a third of the
mayors and more than 15 congressmen are being investigated for
irregularities ranging from misuse of public funds to collaboration with the
guerrillas, this is not always an advantage.
A few weeks ago Mr Samper used the 'ethical code' developed for his campaign
to expel three congressmen from his movement because they had attended a
political meeting with someone accused of drug trafficking.
Despite much talk about clean campaigns and the vetting of contributions,
the incident took most people by surprise. Not only did Mr Samper risk
losing some 50,000 votes controlled by the congressmen but, politicians
asked anxiously, where would such purges end?
On the outskirts of Bogota, in the poorer barrios of Usme, people are
sceptical about candidates and voting procedures. Neglected by the local
administration, the inhabitants took matters into their hands and organised
a strike in June. As a result, some teachers have been appointed, water
pipes put in and pot-holes filled.
'Last time about 20 per cent of the potential electorate voted. There are
two positions - either people vote because they are offered housing
subsidies or school places for their children or some other bribe. Or they
don't vote at all, because there's no real difference between the
candidates,' said Mr Nelson Cruz, a founder of the Usme civic movement.
The murders in the last campaign of two left-wing presidential candidates
and Senator Luis Carlos Galan, who was expected to win the election, fuelled
distrust of the process. At least four candidates are standing on largely
anti-corruption platforms.
General Miguel Maza, former head of the secret police, is one of them:
"People want change . . . . Drug trafficking has brought a distortion of
moral values. We have to fight this. The surrenders and negotiated sentences
have been a failure.'
Like most of the candidates, Gen Maza is against the legalisation of drug
use or trade. But the issue is being debated more frequently as successive
administrations fail to find other solutions and as the infiltration of key
state institutions by traffickers is exposed.
Without doubt, the biggest disaster of President Gaviria's four-year term
was the escape from jail last year of Pablo Escobar, the leader of the
Medellin cocaine cartel. Any candidate with an outside chance must be hoping
that the drug chief will be dead or back in prison before the new
presidential term begins next August.

CROAT authorities and Serb separatists have been holding secret talks in
Norway on brokering a ceasefire, a Serb official revealed yesterday.
Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, Croatian security chief, headed the Croatian delegation,
and met Mr Goran Hadzic, 'president' of Krajina, and his 'foreign minister',
Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, at the three-day talks, said diplomats.
Observers immediately began drawing parallels between the clandestine
negotiations and the Palestinian-Israeli talks held in Norwegian farmhouses,
which ended in a milestone peace agreement.
But Serb officials yesterday said the two sides remained far apart despite
leaked reports that Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, would meet
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, in Oslo later this week.
'We can gain absolutely nothing, because at this time neither side is
willing to back down,' said Mr Branko Filipovic, 'foreign ministry' official
of Krajina, the self-styled Serb state which covers one-third of Croatia,
cutting the republic in half and isolating Croatia's Dalmatian coast from
the country's heartland.
The Bosnian army's chief-of-staff and two other senior officers, including
one commanding a district hit by Moslem separatism, were dismissed
yesterday, Sarajevo radio said, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The radio said
General Sefir Halilovic and the commanders of 4th Corps and 5th Corps, based
in Mostar and Bihac were discharged.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Yeltsin urges ministers to speed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday told his government ministers
that they were dragging their feet on reforms and ignoring the social needs
of the population.
In a stiff rebuke he said that those who took part in the Moscow
demonstration a month ago which culminated in armed clashes round the
parliament and the TV stations were 'not just criminals and bandits, but
also desperate people,' deprived of benefits and wages.
The Russian president said that a separation of powers embodied in the
presidency and a new parliament - to be elected on December 12 - was
essential, in spite of what he described as the growing affection of some
officials and ministers for an authoritarian system. It was, he said, 'a
crude mistake' on their part to doubt the need for different levels of
authority.
Mr Yeltsin said that steps must now be taken to make the rouble convertible
'stage by stage,' building on its stable rate against the dollar in the past
few months. He said, however, that the state must be actively involved in
the management of the economy - instancing the need to develop an efficient
mechanism of land sales following his decree last week allowing Russians to
buy and sell land freely. Also speaking to the enlarged meeting of the
cabinet with regional leaders, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
said that Russia now had the 'blueprint for a market economy' - and forecast
a slowing of inflation and the fall in production in the coming months.
Figures in a report considered by the ministers yesterday pointed to a
continued fall in Russia's gross domestic product, by 11 per cent in the
first nine months of 1993 compared with the same period the previous year.
Industrial production fell by 17 per cent and capital investment by 10 per
cent - while inter-enterprise debt grew to Rbs11.300bn and national income
fell by 15 per cent - an index of the rapid rise in poverty.
The budget deficit for the year is put at Rbs17,000bn, with a fourth quarter
deficit of Rbs5,500bn - Rbs4,500bn of which will be financed by central bank
borrowing and the remainder by the issuing of government bonds. Mr
Chernomyrdin, however, said 'the worst is now over,' and inflation - now
around 20-25 per cent a month - should come down to 16 per cent by next
March and end next year at around 5 per cent.
The trade surplus for this year is expected to be around Dollars 21bn, after
drastic pruning of imports.
Both the president and the prime minister criticised - without naming names
 -members of the cabinet who are now engaged in election campaigns as
leaders of their various parties.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ION Popescu is something of an exception in the Transylvanian city of Cluj,
home of Caritas, the Romanian money-spinning scheme which has drawn in more
than 3m investors and created a new class of Lei millionaires in the town.
'I sincerely hope Caritas collapses and soon. It's a terrible thing. I'm a
private businessman and I can't get anyone to work for me. People here have
so much money they won't work for normal salaries any more,' he says.
Mr Popescu may not have long to wait. The scheme works like a chain-letter
game and has become a nationwide craze. However, it has drawn warnings from
opposition critics, and even from President Ion Iliescu, that it could spark
a financial crisis or riots when the chain breaks down.
For two days this week, Caritas, which promises investors a seven-fold
return on their money in around 100 days, failed to pay out to depositors
for the second time in a month. Caritas blamed the first interruption on a
computer problem and this time around 'organisational problems.' The
organisers have been quoted as saying the pay-out period has now been
extended from three months plus nine days to three months and 24 days.
But these days, not even the miners, who earn on average four times as much
as other Romanian workers, are sinking much cash in the scheme. Business is
already slack in the mining town of Petrosani, some 300 km south of Cluj,
where Caritas's owner, Mr Ioan Stoica, last week opened a new branch with
the help of Mr Miron Cosma, the miners' leader who led his men on
anti-reform riots in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991.
In Cluj, a local lawyer says: 'The town is booming. People here are content.
They have already made a lot of money out of Caritas because they started
playing last year.' Analysts attribute the popularity of the game to
Romania's deteriorating economic situation which has caused real incomes to
drop by 40 per cent since 1989 and annual inflation to surge to nearly 300
per cent.
Others say Caritas is a product of incomplete reforms in a country where
conservative politicians have held up the creation of a stockmarket or a
modern banking system. Many fear a backlash against reform and market
initiatives once the inevitable collapse comes.
But opposition politicians say the government, a weak left-wing minority,
has not intervened for fear of losing the support of the Romanian National
Unity party (RNUP), upon which it relies to stay in power. Mr Gheorghe
Funar, the mayor of Cluj, is also RNUP president and one of Caritas's most
enthusiastic backers. He has often appeared with Mr Stoica to drum up
support for the flagging scheme.
However, Mr Funar's opponents hope the scheme's collapse will provide a
backlash against the mayor, for through it Mr Funar has claimed he can
provide 'solutions' for the people. One critic said: 'People there have
already been enriched. It's the laggards in the rest of the country who put
their money in later who will suffer.'

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE yesterday published a presidential decree continuing its state
ordering system into 1994 and opening the door for a tightening of control
over key industrial sectors.
The decree, signed by President Leonid Kravchuk on October 28, requires
agricultural, consumer goods and military enterprises to sell part of their
production to the government at state-determined prices.
It dashes hopes that Mr Kravchuk might try introducing market reforms before
parliamentary and presidential elections next year.
Of particular concern is the fact that the decree not only obliges
state-owned enterprises - comprising most of Ukraine's industry - to satisfy
state orders, but also applies to quasi-private companies that rent space
and equipment from the government.
Exclusively private companies are not required to comply with state orders.
However, the fate of companies that could be privatised next year is
unclear. Large-scale privatisation has yet to be initiated in Ukraine.
The exact portion of production to be sold to the government at fixed prices
is still to be determined.
While President Kravchuk's decree is aimed at 'stabilising production' in
Ukraine, where gross domestic product is falling at 20 per cent annually,
the result is likely to be a further outflow of funds and the continued
support of inefficient state enterprises.

THE disintegration of the Russian rouble zone appeared to be gathering pace
yesterday after officials in Uzbekistan said they intended to issue a joint
currency with Kazakhstan in an attempt to merge their economies and break
away from Moscow's fiscal control. Mr Fakhtiyar Khamidov, Uzbek
vice-premier, speaking in Tashkent, said that talks with Moscow to create a
new rouble zone were now 'deadlocked,' forcing the republic to develop its
own currency.
'The conditions of Russia are enslaving. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are now
planning to introduce a new currency,' Mr Zafar Ruziev, foreign ministry
spokesman, was quoted as saying.
The Kazakh government in Alma Ata yesterday denied that any concrete plans
had been agreed with Uzbekistan for a new currency.
But in the wake of a bitter attack by Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh
president, on Russia's rouble policy, the republic appears to be moving
closer to breaking away from the rouble zone.
Earlier this week Turkmenistan, the gas rich central Asian republic, became
the fifth republic to formally issue its own currency, joining the Baltic
states and Kyrghystan which have broken out of the rouble zone over the last
year.

<TEXT>
France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said yesterday that President
Boris Yeltsin's Russia had a big role to play in Europe's future but made it
clear there should be no retreat from democracy, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Balladur told a Moscow news conference that Mr Yeltsin's leadership
'incarnates democratic legitimacy' and France's goodwill would embrace the
parliament which emerged from next month's elections.
Mr Balladur was the first western head of government to visit Moscow since
Mr Yeltsin used tanks to crush an armed revolt on October 4 in a dramatic
showdown with hardline deputies who had blocked his market reforms. The
French prime minister used his two-day visit to press his country's
initiative for a proposed pact on European security which received backing
from the European Community at the summit in Brussels last week.
He said that he had told Mr Yeltsin and the prime minister, Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, that Russia would be 'an essential partner' for the success of
this initiative. Mr Balladur was at pains to say nothing that could be
construed as interference in the run-up to Russian elections on December 12.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Pravda returns to the struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE'RE BACK,' said the headline over the front-page editorial in Pravda
yesterday. After a month's ban, the Soviet Union's most famous paper,
founded on May 5, 1912, by Lenin, is out again - and, says the leader:
'We're not changing our convictions.'
If not its convictions, the paper has at least changed its tactics. Once
absolutely required reading for 20m Soviet communists, it must now compete
in a raucous marketplace of publications in which its pre-ban circulation of
just under 500,000 will be hard to maintain.
It has had to compromise with the authorities to get back on the streets.
The former, hardline editor, Mr Gennady Seleznev, has been sent upstairs to
the editorial board: in his place his former deputy and one-time New York
correspondent, Mr Viktor Linnik - a clever man of 49 who has in the past
year attended seminars in Moscow on press freedom and who said flatly
yesterday: 'We are against extremism and violence of all kinds - on the left
as well as on the right.'
Nothing illustrates that better than its attitude to the parliamentary
elections called for December 12. In a front-page article, Mr Viktor
Trushkov says that boycotting the elections in the hope that the required
number of voters would not turn out was rendered futile by the presidential
decree establishing 25 per cent as the minimum turnout, down from the
previous 50 per cent.
'This means that for opposition supporters to boycott these elections would
have only one result: the federal assembly (parliament) would be absolutely
in the pocket (of the president), and it would have no deputies committed to
defending the interests of the working man. No, we must go to the elections
in December.'
Pravda, switching editors and eschewing extremes, is the only one of the
banned papers to return: the nationalist (and more extreme) papers
Sovyetskaya Rossiya (daily) and Den (weekly) are still banned, as is the
popular '600 Seconds' television programme presented by Alexander Nevzorov -
who has turned up among the leading candidates of the right-wing
Constitutional Democratic party. While the main Communist party will take
part in the elections, many of the smaller Leninist and Communist groups,
some of them still banned, have refused.
Pravda's reappearance has many ironies - none sharper than its eager
endorsement of the complaints of foreign human rights organisations against
the Russian government's bans, organisations it would, it its heyday, have
dismissed as interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union.
A letter from Mr Jiri Leber of the New York-based Helsinki Watch Committee,
expressing concern on the press bans, is displayed on the front page - and
in the foreign section, correspondents from Paris, Vienna and Washington
report on the support for Pravda's freedom to publish.
With only four (broadsheet) pages, a restricted circulation, short of funds
and newsprint and with Lenin no longer the draw he was, Pravda has returned
not just to the streets, but to its origins in the opposition and in
struggle. But - for now - within constitutional limits.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Bavaria's PM exposes split on European union

<TEXT>
SERIOUS differences have emerged in Germany's governing coalition over
European integration within a day of the Maastricht treaty on European union
coming into force.
Leading foreign policy spokesmen in the coalition yesterday denounced the
views of Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's prime minister, who said the idea of
Europe as a federal state was finished.
Mr Stoiber is the most powerful political figure in the Bavaria-based
Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the coalition. His outburst is likely to
seriously embarrass his party leader, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and a
co-signatory of the Maastricht treaty.
In a hard-hitting interview with the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Munich's main
newspaper, Mr Stoiber called for the integration process to be slowed. He
implied that Mr Kohl's passionate commitment to European union was out of
date.
'We are no longer striving for a European federal state,' he said.
'Europe is more than the European Community. I want a simple confederation.
That means that the nation states maintain their dominant role, at least as
far as internal matters are concerned.'
The danger of Mr Stoiber's views for the coalition is that they undoubtedly
reflect growing doubts in the German population. Those doubts are likely to
see defections at next year's European elections to the far-right parties
such as the Republicans, who openly exploit anti-European sentiment.
Among rank-and-file members of the CSU and the CDU there is a growing
feeling that Mr Kohl's passionate commitment to Europe may be a vote-loser.
In a comprehensive opinion survey published yesterday by the interior
ministry, only 18 per cent of west Germans and 12 per cent of east Germans
said they could see real advantages for the country in EC membership. A
majority believed advantages and disadvantages were equally balanced.
On the other hand, most voters still believed that most difficulties - with
the important exception of employment policy - could best be resolved at
European level.
Mr Stoiber's ideas were criticised sharply by Mr Peter Kittelmann, EC
spokesman for the CDU in the German parliament. He said they went against an
agreed CDU and CSU policy paper agreed only last week and could be explained
only in terms of provincial Bavarian politics. He was referring to the
threat of a rise in support for the far-right Republicans in the state,
campaigning on an overtly anti-European platform.
On the very same day, Mr Kohl issued a statement reiterating his European
convictions, although he too stopped short of defining Europe as a federal
state.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Deutsche Bank prepares to open wide the doors on its past:
The secretive institution plans 'no-holds-barred' history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWERING above Frankfurt's financial district are the twin skyscrapers of
Deutsche Bank's headquarters. The buildings are made of of steel and glass:
blue reflective glass which is eye-catching but not designed to let anyone
look inside.
This lack of transparency has long been a characteristic of the bank,
Germany's most powerful financial institution with profits as big as those
of its three main competitors combined. Deutsche Bank has been at the heart
of German capitalism since shortly after it was founded in 1870, and has
always been highly secretive in its dealings with the outside world.
A portion of the veil, however, is set to be lifted. To celebrate the bank's
125th anniversary in two years' time, Deutsche has commissioned a 'no-holds
barred' history of the bank from five leading economic historians, each
concentrating on a particular period. The bulk of the material has already
been completed and was presented to international scholars in Frankfurt last
month. The history itself will be published in German and English in 1995.
The historians, at work on the project since 1988, have more recently been
able to draw on the bank's archives for the years 1870-1945. These only
became available after German reunification in 1990; before then they were
held in the east German city of Potsdam.
With a budget of DM1m (Pounds 400m), the project was initiated by Mr Alfred
Herrhausen, the former chief executive of the bank killed by terrorists in
1989. It has the active support of his successor, Mr Hilmar Kopper, who
makes a point of finding time amid his frantic schedule to attend the
meetings of the committee co-ordinating the project.
According to Prof Manfred Pohl, the bank's in-house historian, the aim is to
take the writing of corporate history to new levels of academic excellence.
All too often, he says, corporate histories diminish their intellectual
authority by their desire to present an unremittingly positive view of the
company in question.
For the Deutsche Bank, as for other German financial and industrial
institutions, there is one area of obvious potential embarrassment when
scrutinising the past - collaboration with the Nazi regime in the 1930s and
assistance with the war effort in 1939-1945.
Last time the Deutsche Bank published a history, to celebrate its 100th
anniversary in 1970, the issue was not confronted. Barely a mention was made
of a report by the finance division of the Office of Military Government,
United States Finance Division (OMGUS) which described how the bank, in
common with other large financial institutions, financed the war effort,
facilitated its industrial customers' use of slave labour, expanded its
branch network into the territories occupied by the Wehrmacht, and
participated in the Arianisation of German business.
This time, there will be no fudge: the bank is intending to stare this
unpleasant aspect of the past directly in the face. It demonstrated this
commitment last month when it held a seminar on the bank's role in financing
Universum Film, Germany's film monopoly in the 1920s and 1930s which
developed into a central organ of Goebbels' propaganda machine during the
Third Reich.
The company was founded in 1917 at the initiative of Mr Emil Georg von
Strauss, a director of the bank, and Deutsche owned a stake in the
organisation during the twenties when it made a made a number of early film
classics such as Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis'. The bank sold out in 1927.
Moreover, says Prof Pohl, the commitment to objectivity has been underscored
by the decision to appoint Prof Harold James, an Englishmen now at Princeton
University, to cover the most sensitive period of all: 1933-45. Prof James
is the official historian of the International Monetary Fund and writes on
German affairs.
The OMGUS team reported that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's
second biggest bank then and now, had too great a concentration of economic
power. They recommended that the banks should be wound up and their senior
executives tried as war criminals and barred from taking up positions of
responsibility in post-war Germany.
The winding-up did not happen. Broken down into regional organisations by
the allies, the banks were reformed in 1957 and soon developed for
themselves a central role in post-war capitalism.
Nor did bank personnel find themselves excluded from office, as witnessed by
the career of the legendary Mr Hermann Josef Abs, Deutsche's first chief
executive after the war. He joined the board of the Deutsche Bank in 1938
and although he was never a member of the Nazi party, and provided personal
help to Jewish businessmen and their families during the war years, he was
roundly criticised by the OMGUS investigators.
Mr Abs is today 92 and still able to prosecute his causes with a flavour of
the old doggedness - nowadays in the art world rather than in the boardroom.
After brief internment after the war, he went on to be one of the chief
architects of Germany's economic revival.
The Abs theme is likely to be of special interest to readers of the official
history. But the narrative from the more distant past should also provide
insight into the mysteries of present-day German capitalism. For example,
the chapters covering 1870-1914 and 1914-33 will deal with the bank's role
in sponsoring companies such as Siemens, AEG, Daimler-Benz and Mannesmann in
their early years. Its links with these companies are still close.

THE Portuguese government's attempt to forge a social pact for next year
with the country's unions and employers were set back yesterday when the
Socialist-led UGT trade union confederation rejected a government pay offer
of 4 per cent, Reuter reports. Talks have been going on since July.
The UGT leader, Mr Jose Manuel Torres Couto, said before the meeting that
failure to reach agreement would be no 'big drama for the country.'
Secretary of state for the budget, Mr Manuela Ferreira Leite, said
afterwards that employees would have to ask their unions why they rejected
the government proposal.

FT  03 NOV 93 / French fingers crossed as the economy shows signs of revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S economy minister is cautiously optimistic. Despite the steady rise
in unemployment the French economy is beginning to show signs of revival
from one of the deepest recessions since the second world war.
'It is clear that take-off has still to take place,' says Mr Edmond
Alphandery. 'But the economic climate is moving in the right direction.' He
bases his view on a series of statistics released over the past 10 days
showing encouraging trends from industrial production to exports to consumer
spending.
The figures lend weight to Mr Alphandery's argument that the economy has
stabilised after a sharp contraction which set in at the end of last year.
But the big question is whether the improvement in economic indicators is
sustainable, and whether it is strong enough to lift the economy from its
slump.
The biggest surprise in the latest batch of data has been consumption, the
Achilles heel of the economy in the first six months of 1992, but which rose
by 2.1 per cent in the third quarter over the second.
'The pattern of consumption was stronger than had been expected,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros. Most economists had
forecast that an increase in social security contributions which took effect
in July together with a rise in indirect taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and
petrol, would persuade consumers to keep their hands in their pockets.
Industrial production, too, has been stronger than forecast. In July and
August, lumped together because of the relatively quiet holiday period, it
rose by 1.3 per cent over June. A survey of French business leaders by
Insee, the national economics institute, revealed confidence that production
at their companies had also increased in October.
On the international front, French industry is resisting the effects of
recession in many of its principal markets and the increased competitiveness
of rivals in Britain, Italy and Spain, which have benefited from currency
depreciation. Trade statistics announced last Friday showed a surplus of
FFr10.4bn (Pounds 1.21bn) in July, including a surplus of FFr4bn with EC
trading partners. Total exports in the month amounted to FFr96.8bn, compared
with FFr94.9bn in June.
'If you take all these indicators together, the effect is encouraging,' says
one merchant bank economist. 'But I wouldn't open the champagne yet.'
The French government is similarly guarded. 'The economy is ripe for
recovery,' said Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, last week. 'But it
is better to err on the side of caution than be too optimistic.'
Such caution is justified by the uncertain prospects for the current
quarter. Economists are divided about whether the improved indicators will
be repeated or whether they are merely a blip.
Salomon Bros' Mr Mercier believes a double dip recession, with a contraction
in the fourth quarter, remains a possibility. He expects gross domestic
product to expand by just 0.5-0.6 per cent next year; the government is
forecasting 1.4 per cent growth. Some economists are more optimistic. Mr
Robin Hubbard at Paribas Capital Markets, for example, thinks a 1.5 per cent
rise in GDP next year is 'eminently feasible'.
The principal factors in the economy's performance over the next quarter are
likely to be the strength of consumer spending and exports. According to the
optimistic scenario, household consumption will be sustained by a rise in
real disposable income and a fall in the savings ratio. This view is
supported by the low level of inflation and the rise in labour productivity,
increasing by about 2 per cent per annum, and by the historically low level
of interest rates which reduce the incentive to save.
Such forecasts, however, are weakened by the continued impact of the rise in
unemployment. In addition to reducing disposable incomes among the
proportion of the population with the largest propensity to consume, the
prospect of joblessness has a powerful psychological effect on spending.
With unemployment forecast to breach 12 per cent by the end of this year and
to continue to rise through the first quarter of 1994, any recovery will be
constrained.
On the external front, exports will be boosted by the weakening of the
franc, on a trade-weighted basis, since the collapse of the European
exchange rate mechanism in the summer. But recession in Germany, France's
largest trading partner, and the slow pace of recovery in the UK and US will
continue to depress international demand for French goods.
The overall result is likely to mean a gradual but fragile rise from
recession. It is unlikely to mean a shift from existing economic policies.
French economic officials argue that the benefits of a strong franc policy
are evident in the competitiveness of industry and are illustrated by the
latest trade figures. An aggressive cut in short-term interest rates now,
they claim, would simply raise long term borrowing costs. This would
threaten, rather than nurture, the first shoots of recovery.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN industrial output fell by a provisional 2 per cent in September,
according to price and seasonally-adjusted figures published by the
economics ministry yesterday.
The ministry, which said it expected the final figure to be adjusted upwards
by a 'good two points' later, noted that the result had been decisively
affected by a 2.5 per cent drop in manufacturing production.
Total industrial output, which includes mining, construction and energy,
stood 7.6 per cent lower than a year earlier, although the ministry's
statement suggested the final outcome would be a year-on-year decline of
around 5.5 per cent. This would be unchanged from August, when production
increased by a revised 2.2 per cent.
The statistics support other indications that the worst of the recession is
past, although heavy industry in particular is still struggling and consumer
goods production was also markedly lower than it was a month earlier.
According to yesterday's figures, combined output in August and September
was 0.5 per cent higher than in the previous two months and 6.2 per cent
lower than in the same period a year earlier.
According to this two-month measure, construction - up 2.4 per cent - was
the only sector showing any year-on-year improvement. Production of
investment goods was 11 per cent lower.
According to the Federation of German Industry (BDI), industrial output will
decline further, although only marginally, in the coming months. Prospects
for a reversal of the trend seem dim, it says in its latest monthly report.
Consumer demand will expand very slowly. Public demand will remain weak
because of spending cuts, and there is little reason to expect a boost to
capital spending because of heavy investment in the recent past, the BDI
adds.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Europe's high-fliers a down to earth lot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE average European business traveller is a family man, often careless with
his health, more inclined to sleep than eat on long-haul flights and
occasionally prepared to play computer games on his portable computer.
The portrait is revealed today in a survey by Official Airline Guides, a
publisher of airline timetables.
It also records national differences in attitudes to air travel. The French
are most inclined to ignore in-flight catering and the British most likely
to drink alcohol, and the Germans like to both eat and drink.
Women business travellers, just 7 per cent of the total, are the most
industrious. Some 69 per cent say they preferred to work on short-haul
flights, compared with 61 per cent of men.
More than a third of all passengers polled did not take out full medical
insurance and less than half made sure they had the necessary inoculations
against disease.
The British were the most conscientious on inoculations, and Germans the
worst. One in five passengers usually carried condoms, of which most were
married men. One in 12 women travelling also carried condoms, the survey
found.
Frequent flyer schemes - in which loyalty to an airline is rewarded with
points that can be exchanged for free trips - emerge as an important
determinant in airline loyalty.
Some 82 per cent of survey respondents were members of such schemes and two
thirds of members said that given a choice of carriers on a route they would
choose one to whose frequent flyer programme they belonged.
Ironically, the free flights earned from such schemes were of little
importance to the frequent traveller. Top of the list of perks conferred by
membership of such schemes, nominated by 92 per cent of respondents, is to
be given priority in the waiting list for full aircraft.
Their desires are probably the result of the need to make late changes in
itineraries: 30 per cent of business travellers said they did this 'very
frequently.'
By contrast, only a minority of travellers had redeemed any frequent flyer
points, perhaps not surprising when only 10 per cent said enjoying leisure
time was more important than work or family life.

PILOTS and cabin crews at Austrian Airlines yesterday voted overwhelmingly
to end their strike, which had crippled the national carrier for five days,
writes Patrick Blum from Vienna. The decision follows a compromise giving
the unions a say in any future restructuring plans.
The militant flight employees' union abandoned its initial demand for the
resignation of the management board.
The strike was called in protest at plans to cut the 4,500 workforce by 500
in an effort to trim expected loses of Sch830m (Pounds 49m) this year.
Services are expected to return to normal today.

<TEXT>
LESS than a month before local government elections, the eastern German
state of Brandenburg is having a spot of bother: attracting candidates. In
300 of the state's 1,700 towns and villages, Germany's political parties
cannot find people willing to stand as mayors.
'Who wants to stand for mayor when the councils are virtually bankrupt,' one
official from the Brandenburg government said yesterday. Most of the city
and town councils in eastern Germany are running budget deficits as high as
70 per cent. This means that any promises by prospective mayors about
opening libraries, kindergartens, or building swimming pools, are sheer
flights of fancy.
But it is not only the councils' financial state which provides a
disincentive to any prospective candidate. Brandenburg, led by Mr Manfred
Stolpe, is the only eastern state in the hands of the opposition Social
Democratic party (SPD). The established parties all admit that they are
finding it difficult to create local elites in the five eastern states. For
40 years, eastern Germans were 'politicised' to the extent that they had to
participate in a political system ranging from waving the Red Flag to
joining the Youth Movement. 'It takes time to overcome a system in which
political participation was compulsory,' explained Mr Wolfgang Thierse, an
SPD member of the Bundestag, or Lower House, who represents a constituency
in east Berlin.
Voters in eastern Germany have also become rapidly disappointed with their
new politicians, as the initial euphoria of unification has collapsed with
the mass unemployment that it has brought to some regions.
There is also a deeper sense of distrust. The electorate in Brandenburg has
seen how Mr Stolpe, who before 1989 had close connections with the Lutheran
Church and had tried to defend them, is now pilloried for his alleged
connections with the Stasi, the former state security apparatus under the
communist regime. 'You need to be strong to tolerate non-stop scrutiny of
your past,' said an official from Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg. Ms
Regine Hildebrandt, Brandenburg's minister for labour, health and women,
says she can understand these anxieties.
However, she insists: 'We must pull the people out of their lethargy. They
just can't sit back and let other people make decisions for them.
'That's what it was like in the former days.
'They must get up and become politically engaged and let their voice be
heard, otherwise eastern Germany will be a political wilderness,' she added.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Italian group gains right to buy Ekostahl: Riva to put plans
for German steel plant to Commission
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand privatisation agency has granted sole negotiating rights to
Riva, the Italian steel group, to buy Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest
steel mill despite strong competition from German manufacturers.
However, the European Commission will need to be convinced that the Riva
plan for Ekostahl will not lead to more over-capacity in the German steel
industry, that its investments contain no hidden subsidies, and that its
plan is economically viable.
Riva is expected to submit its proposals to the Commission later this week,
and the Commission should then recommend its findings to the Council of
Ministers on November 18.
Under the plan, Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned company, will buy 60
per cent of Ekostahl, while the Treuhand will hold the remaining 40 per cent
stake. Together, they will invest DM1.2bn in building a hot rolling mill,
the equivalent of a mini-mill, with an annual capacity of about 900,000
tonnes.
Riva will also guarantee 3,600 jobs, of which 1,700 will be directly
employed at the steel mill. Before 1990, Ekostahl employed more than 12,000
workers, most of whom live in Eisenhuttenstadt, Brandenburg, close to the
Polish border. The mill was producing more than 2.1m tonnes a year.
Mr Hans Kramer, a board member of the Treuhand, said yesterday that the Riva
plan took precedent over its competitors because 'it would make Ekostahl
economically viable and competitive.' Ekostahl is running annual losses of
over DM100m on a turnover of DM1bn.
'We hope the EC will accept the plan because Riva's 60 per cent stake is
private capital,' a Treuhand spokesman said. The agency will use its 40 per
cent stake to modernise the mill. It is unclear if that stake will be sold
once the restructuring and modernisation plans are completed over the next
five years.
But Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel Federation said in a
statement that the Treuhand's decision 'was highly problematical' and it
would add further pressures on overcapacity in the industry.
Riva's German competitors, which included a consortium led by Thyssen and
Preussag, and Hamburger Stahlwerke, had rejected the idea of building a
modern hot rolling mill, largely because they did not want another
competitor entering the steel sector, or increase the country's annual
capacity.
Thyssen and Preussag had offered to buy 50 per cent of Ekostahl's
cold-rolling mill and close down the hot-blast furnace within the next three
years. It would also create 1,000 new jobs in Eisenhuttenstadt through its
subsidiaries.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Ulster peace talks may proceed without Paisley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is to press ahead with plans to put forward its own
proposals for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland even if Mr Ian Paisley's
hardline Democratic Unionist Party decides not to return to the negotiating
table.
Ministers' determination to proceed irrespective of possible DUP objections
emerged last night as Mr John Major, the prime minister, confirmed he will
shortly meet the leaders of all four constitutional Northern Ireland parties
 -including Mr Paisley - for bilateral talks.
The meeting with Mr Paisley, who yesterday spelt out two conditions for
rejoining the talks, will focus on the DUP's proposals for 'breaking the
logjam' and consequently is not regarded at Westminster as part of the
formal process.
News of the fresh round of talks came on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish
conference in Belfast, which will try to put renewed impetus behind the
government's efforts.
The detail of Mr Major's proposals is not expected to become clear for some
time and may initially be presented to those participating in the talks in
further bilateral sessions and in private.
The plan is, however, believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern
Ireland assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been
moribund since the imposition of direct rule in 1974.
Downing Street said Mr Major would begin seeing Northern Ireland political
leaders tomorrow. The first meetings are expected to be with Dr John
Alderdice, leader of the moderate unionist Alliance party, and Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party.
The prime minister's office is trying to arrange meetings with Mr Paisley
and Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest
unionist grouping.
It follows the prime minister's decision to accept a request for a meeting
from Mr Hume, who wants to discuss his talks on prospects for peace with Mr
Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein.
Mr Paisley yesterday insisted Mr Hume must end his meetings with Mr Adams,
before the DUP would re-enter talks. 'And until Dublin deals with Articles 2
and 3 (of its constitution which covers its claim to the North), there is no
point in sitting down with them,' he added.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Arbitrageur barred after Pounds 1.7m loss at Kleinwort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEALER at Kleinwort Benson who had incurred heavy personal losses at a
financial bookmaker and subsequently lost Pounds 1.7m of his firm's money
has been banned indefinitely from the securities business by the City's
investment watchdog.
This is the first time the self-regulatory Securities and Futures Authority
has taken such action. The SFA refused to disclose the name of the firm, but
merchant bank Kleinwort last night confirmed it had employed the dealer and
suffered the loss.
The arbitrage dealer, Mr Kevin Reed Morgan, had repeatedly taken on far more
risk than he was allowed when employed by two separate investment banks
between July 1991 and March 1993, the SFA said. Arbitrage dealers try to
exploit the differences between different markets and financial instruments.
Mr Morgan began increasing his risk after incurring heavy losses in 1990 on
his personal account at a firm of financial bookmakers. Financial bookmakers
allow individuals to bet on a stock market index, such as the FT-SE 100, or
on a bond contract in the same way that bets are laid on sporting events.
According to the SFA, in July 1991, Mr Morgan, who had worked successfully
as a derivatives arbitrageur in a large City investment bank, joined a new
firm. In the 10 days he was employed there, he heavily exceeded his position
limits, three times causing small losses to the bank. The last occasion came
after he had received a written warning. He was dismissed and the incident
reported to the SFA.
After being asked to resign, the SFA said, Mr Morgan sought to pay off the
debt to the financial bookmaker but some of his cheques bounced. He was
served with a bankruptcy petition in November 1992 and was ad-judged
bankrupt with debts of over Pounds 300,000 in April 1993 - two months after
joining another City firm, which had been told of his earlier dismissal. Mr
Morgan, the SFA said, did not tell this firm of his financial position.
In a three-hour period one day in March 1993 he exposed his firm to Dollars
400m of risk in US government bond interest rate futures though he had
agreed to have no more than Dollars 5m of risk at one time. Mr Morgan
misjudged the direction of US interest rates, costing his employer Pounds
1.7m.
The SFA said Mr Morgan had not been permanently barred from the industry but
'in the medium term there's no hope of him obtaining authorisation'.
'The SFA takes a particularly serious view of Mr Morgan's conduct in view of
the risk to which he exposed his firm and has reminded SFA members that they
should be aware of any personal account dealing that their employees
undertake with other brokers,' the SFA said.
Last night Kleinwort said it had reviewed its procedures following the
incident.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Major issues clear warning of tax rises and spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday gave the clearest signal yet that his government is
planning further tax increases in the November 30 Budget, writes Philip
Stephens.
In spite of agreement to freeze public spending in real terms for the next
three years, Mr Major indicated that tough controls on spending and resumed
economic growth would not do enough to curb government borrowing.
His comments coincided with signs of an upsurge of concern on the
Conservative back benches about the impact of the tax increases already
impending after the March budget.
Under plans announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, the tax
burden is set to rise by more than Pounds 6bn next year and by more than
Pounds 10bn in 1995-96.
But Mr Major told the Commons that the government needed to make a 'steady
and sustained' move to reduce borrowing. That could be done in several ways.
Controlling public expenditure was one, and economic growth would also help.
But in a clear reference to tax increases, the prime minister added that
'other matters' would also contribute.
Downing Street conceded that he was referring to tax increases but officials
argued that the reference was to the plans announced by Mr Lamont. That
explanation failed to convince ministers and Conservative MPs who had been
listening to Mr Major.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Senior civil servants fight off moves to reform jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP civil servants appear to have fought off attempts to open their jobs to
greater competition and to introduce fixed-term contracts of employment.
A year-long study of career management and succession planning for senior
civil servants has rejected proposals for advertising all vacancies in the
top 600 Whitehall jobs.
The study, carried out by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit, has also
rejected the idea of fixed-term contracts for those in the three most senior
civil service grades.
The unit's recommendations will be presented to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, at a seminar in No 10 Downing Street this morning. Mr William
Waldegrave, the public services minister, will also attend with top
mandarins such as Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, and Sir
Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary.
An early draft of the efficiency unit report recommended open competition
for all vacancies in the three top grades. Where possible, it said vacancies
should be advertised outside the civil service, as already happens with some
specialist jobs and management posts in executive agencies. Jobs likely to
be filled by career civil servants - such as policy advisers and
parliamentary draughtsmen - would still have been advertised, but
internally.
Subsequent drafts have been watered down in the face of implacable
opposition from Whitehall's top mandarins who currently select candidates
for promotion.
Acceptance of the early draft would have brought top civil servants more
into line with other parts of the public sector, such as local government
and the health service, where all senior jobs must be openly advertised.
Advocates of change in the civil service have included Sir Peter Levene, the
businessman and former civil servant who is the prime minister's efficiency
adviser, and Mr Graham Mather, the influential president of the European
Policy Forum, an independent think-tank.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Clarke puts strict limit on relief of VAT on fuel bills:
Compensation 'substantially less' than hoped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT appears ready to confront a threatened backbench rebellion
over the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel by announcing substantially less
compensation than the Pounds 500m demanded by many Tory MPs.
In spite of the outcry among the government's supporters over the impact on
its traditional voters of the controversial tax, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, has decided to limit severely the amount available to sweeten
its effect.
He has insisted that extra payments to offset the cost of higher heating
bills should be limited to those qualifying for income support.
That in effect excludes the 'nearly poor' - many of whom are Conservative
supporters - with modest incomes and savings who do not qualify for state
benefits. In the wake of the government's disastrous defeat in the
Christchurch by-election in the summer, several ministers joined backbench
critics of the tax in demanding that this group should be compensated.
It had been widely assumed at Westminster that Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, had won more from the Treasury to help this vulnerable
group.
Last night, Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory co-chairman of the all-party
parliamentary group for pensioners, warned of 'serious trouble' on the
backbenches if the compensation package was below expectations.
One of the arguments that is believed to have convinced the Treasury not to
provide more in the present public-spending round revolves around the
difficulty of implementing a bigger compensation package.
Ministers believe it would be almost impossible to find a simple method of
providing compensation for those not on income support.
The decision to limit compensation is expected to be approved at tomorrow's
session of the cabinet, which will confirm the level of public spending to
be announced in Mr Clarke's unified Budget on November 30.
The cabinet is also expected to confirm proposals to cut defence spending
which, officials say, will not lead to a reduction in operational capability
of the armed services or a lowering of manpower levels.
In particular, officials suggest that the effect of cuts in the defence
budget over the next three years might be offset by sales of land and other
military assets that have no direct operational role.
On domestic fuel, Mr John Major and Mr Clarke seem determined to stick by
the government's original plan to impose 8 per cent VAT next April and to
raise that to 17.5 per cent in 1995, but no final decision has been taken.
According to MPs close to Mr Lilley, the social security secretary does not
see the decision on fuel as a personal defeat. It is understood he always
believed it to be perfectly proper that the Treasury, which decided to
impose VAT on fuel, would settle the compensation.
In the longer term, some minsters do not believe that compensation for the
tax on fuel can go on indefinitely, particularly since electricity
privatisation has meant lower electricity bills.
Mr Lilley has taken an active role in looking at ways to cut his own Pounds
78bn budget, such as slimming the Pounds 5.5bn budget for invalidity
benefit. Ministers have now agreed to shave hundreds of millions of pounds
off this benefit.
On defence cuts, some of the 20 Conservative MPs who have threatened to
rebel against the government said they were still unsure whether they would
approve the Treasury's proposals.
Several of the MPs discussed the government's proposals with Mr Clarke on
Monday night. They told him of their concern that the Treasury had been
reluctant to allow the MoD to make new orders for Challenger tanks and for
the EH101 helicopter.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Inflation rate may exceed official 4% target, Bank warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England warned yesterday that inflation will rise in the months
ahead, with a 'slight possibility' that it will briefly exceed the
government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in the first half of
1994.
The forecast, in the bank's latest quarterly Inflation Report, helps explain
recent statements by Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, damping expectations of an early cut in bank base
rates from 6 per cent.
The report also made clear that interest rates will not have to increase to
offset any short-term rise in inflation next year, provided the higher price
level does not push wages higher. The expected acceleration of inflation in
1994 will largely reflect the impact of higher indirect taxes and changes to
local authority taxes, announced in the March Budget.
Indeed, the Bank appeared to give a green light to further tax rises in the
November 30 Budget. It urged the government to take action that would
steadily reduce the Budget deficit.
That, it said, was crucial to sustaining the credibility of the government's
anti-inflationary policies. 'It needs to be understood,' it said, 'that
one-off boosts to the level of prices, for instance, from higher indirect
taxes, do not mean any slackening of anti-inflationary policy, and should
not be regarded as permanent increases in the underlying rate of inflation.'
Mr George and Mr Clarke will meet today for confidential discussions on the
present stance of monetary policy and the likely implications of the
November 30 Budget for Bank policy.
In its report yesterday, the Bank noted that most year-on-year measures of
12-month inflation had risen since its last report in August. 'Headline'
retail prices inflation rose to 1.8 per cent in September from 1.2 per cent
in June while the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments
and is targeted by the government, advanced to 3.3 per cent from 2.8 per
cent.
But it said that slack in the economy, with moderate growth in demand and
slow growth in broad money and credit, pointed to the possibility of further
reducing inflation over the medium term, with growth of output picking up.
Excluding tax changes, the Bank expects that inflation will start falling
early next year and may reach a level close to the middle of the
government's target range in 1995.
The Bank's report provided no indication of whether it and the Treasury
would lower interest rates in the event of a substantial tightening of
fiscal policy in the Budget.

FT  03 NOV 93 / Top civil servants ward off job reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP civil servants appear to have fought off attempts to open their jobs to
greater competition and to introduce fixed-term contracts of employment.
A year-long study of career management and succession planning for senior
civil servants has rejected proposals for advertising all vacancies in the
top 600 Whitehall jobs.
The study, carried out by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit, has also
rejected the idea of fixed-term contracts for those in the three most senior
civil service grades.
The unit's recommendations will be presented to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, at a seminar in No 10 Downing Street this morning. Mr William
Waldegrave, the public services minister, will also attend with top
mandarins such as Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, and Sir
Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary.
An early draft of the efficiency unit report recommended open competition
for all vacancies in the three top grades. Where possible, it said vacancies
should be advertised outside the civil service, as already happens with some
specialist jobs and management posts in executive agencies. Jobs likely to
be filled by career civil servants - such as policy advisers and
parliamentary draughtsmen - would still have been advertised, but
internally.
Subsequent drafts have been watered down in the face of implacable
opposition from Whitehall's top mandarins who currently select candidates
for promotion.
Acceptance of the early draft would have brought top civil servants more
into line with other parts of the public sector, such as local government
and the health service, where all senior jobs must be openly advertised.
Advocates of change in the civil service have included Sir Peter Levene, the
businessman and former civil servant who is the prime minister's efficiency
adviser, and Mr Graham Mather, the influential president of the European
Policy Forum, an independent think-tank.
Earlier this year, the forum published proposals to put all senior civil
servants on to five-year contracts, with clear work targets and pay linked
to performance. It also proposed advertising all vacancies at permanent
secretary, deputy secretary and undersecretary level.
Mr Waldegrave was believed to have been attracted to the idea of clearer
targets and a greater emphasis on performance pay for top policymakers. He
was also encouraged by reports of the success of reforms in New Zealand,
where all top civil servants are on fixed-term contracts.

<TEXT>
HAFSLUND Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
yesterday reported a 5 per cent increase in nine-month pre-tax profits to
NKr1.18bn (Dollars 168.6m) from NKr1.13bn in the same period last year. It
was helped by the strength of the US dollar and Japanese yen.
Hafslund said it would reduce costs in the fourth quarter, and channel more
resources into research and development and strengthen its marketing
network.
Group sales in the first nine months of this year rose by NKr357m to
NKr4.17bn as operating profit, before research and development costs,
slipped by NKr47m to NKr1.68bn. R&amp;D costs increased by NKr67m to NKr527m.
The group posted financial gains of NKr35m against charges of NKr138m in the
same period last year.
Hafslund lifted net profit in the first nine months of this year by NKr33m
to NKr830m.

FT  02 NOV 93 / President's loose talk worries Guyana businessmen: The
former Marxist is confusing investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is peace, for the moment, between the office of Guyana's President
Cheddi Jagan and the city council of Georgetown, the capital, which is
dominated by the opposition party.
Mr Jagan recently referred to the councillors as 'rascals'. The councillors
said they did not fit the dictionary's definition of the word, and asked for
a public apology from the president. They got it.
But some of Mr Jagan's public statements are leaving a more lasting and
confusing impression. He has described his own administration as a 'working
class government guided by the ideology of the working class, which is
Marxism-Leninism . . . and not the philosophy and practice of capitalism'.
The statement created some consternation among local and foreign business,
which had happily accepted Mr Jagan's undertaking to continue with the open
market economic policies which he inherited a year ago when his People's
Progressive party won an election and ended 28 years of government by the
People's National Congress.
Mr Jagan's later elaboration  - to the effect that while the PPP was guided
by Marxism-Leninism, the government which it had formed was not - did not
temper concerns about the real direction of economic policy in the
English-speaking country of 850,000 people on the north-east shoulder of
South America.
'We in Guyana understand President Jagan, and we do not take this statement
seriously, but people outside the country will,' said Mr Hans Barrow,
president of the Chamber of Commerce. 'We have simply elected a leader who
speaks like this.'
Mr Barrow said, however, that local business leaders would understand why
foreign investors and potential investors would be worried, and would wait
before commiting themselves when the president made such statements about
ideology. He said there must be a two-way flow of business confidence.
Dr Jagan, a 74-year-old dentist and once an avowed Marxist, moved towards
moderation just before taking office.
The concern among local business leaders is that, although such statements
about ideology might not reflect the government's economic policy, they
could derail the expansion of an economy which, by any standard, has been
doing remarkably well.
Several consecutive years of contraction ended in 1991 with growth of 6 per
cent.
According to Mr Asgar Ally, the finance minister, the growth continued into
the first half of this year, and he has forecast expansion of 7.8 per cent
for this year. Mr Ally said this was the result of expansion in mining and
agriculture. Once-billowing inflation is projected at 6 per cent this year,
helped mainly by stability of the currency following a 64 per cent
depreciation which followed the floating of the currency in 1991.
Mr Ally said higher export receipts, foreign investments and funds for
balance of payments support had led to an improvement of Dollars 52.4m in
net international reserves in the year ended last June.
All this has not impressed the opposition PNC, which described the
government's first year as 'a failure'. Mr Desmond Hoyte, the opposition
leader, said the economy had lost its momentum and vibrancy. 'Business
confidence has receded, there has been no new major investment, vital
development projects initiated by my administration have been stalled, and .
. . there is a marked paucity of disbursements from international financial
institutions,' he said.
'There have been 33 new private investment projects valued at Dollars 26.1m
in agriculture, mining and financial services since the government took
office,' argued Mr Ally.
There is continuing uncertainty, however, over the government's commitment
to the programme of divestment of state enterprises inherited from Mr
Hoyte's administration. It suspended the programme soon after taking office,
saying it would investigate earlier deals. Mr Ally has since said the
government is committed to divestment, and has listed 30 companies,
including the national airline and the sugar company, which it wants to
sell.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Salinas calls for civility in elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday called on all Mexico's political parties
to sign a pact of civility to ensure 'transparent and exemplary'
presidential elections next August.
In his annual state of the nation address, President Salinas promised the
contenders 'full respect, abiding by the terms of the law, and proper
conditions for them to present their options to Mexicans in full freedom'.
Mexico's 1988 presidential election, which brought Mr Salinas to power, was
widely held by observers to have been marred by ballot-rigging.
Mr Salinas's government has recently passed new democratic reforms, but they
have been dismissed as inadequate by the main opposition candidate, Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and some foreign and domestic observers.
Despite the call for an electoral pact, Mr Salinas suggested there would no
more significant concessions to the opposition.
The president appeared to rule out the possibility of foreign observers
participating in the electoral process, saying 'only Mexicans' would be the
guardians of 'our' democracy.
The president announced that Mexico's reserves rose to Dollars 23.017bn at
the end of October, from Dollars 22.597bn. The high level of reserves seems
to dispel fears that there has been an outflow of capital provoked by
uncertainties over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The executive branch is due soon to send the Mexican Congress legislation
that will make the central bank independent.
The legislation may be in place, and possibly the head of the bank named,
before the vote on Nafta expected on November 17 in the US Congress.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Japanese contractor seeks protection with Dollars 5bn debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MURAMOTO Construction, a little-known contractor, became Japan's biggest
financial failure for more than 45 years yesterday when it filed for
protection from its creditors, unable to pay debts of Y590bn (Dollars
5.57bn).
This is by far the biggest single potential loss facing Japan's banking
system since the collapse in asset prices started two years ago, sending the
economy into recession.
Of the 50 banks exposed to the group, the leading creditor is Nanto Bank,
the main regional bank in Nara prefecture, western Japan, where Muramoto,
the country's 24th-largest general construction group, is based. It has
Y56bn of loans to Muramoto, which compares with the bank's Y3,000bn deposit
base.
Nanto is followed by Daiwa Bank, which has led creditors' negotiations with
the company, with loans of Y45bn; Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, with
Y38bn; and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, with Y28bn.
Muramoto's collapse would cause 'adverse effects' for its creditor banks,
but they can absorb the loss between them, a senior official of the Bank of
Japan, the central bank, said. Creditors had secured collateral for their
loans, and had approved the move in advance, a finance ministry official
added.
However, the move may increase Japanese banks' caution at a time when
lending is already sluggish, one of the factors contributing to the
recession.
Until yesterday, Japan's largest corporate collapse since 1945 was that of
Sanko Steamship, which filed for bankruptcy in 1985 with debts of Y520bn.
Teikoku Databank, the private credit research agency, attributed Muramoto's
collapse to the failures of property companies with which it had undertaken
joint developments. Like other property companies, they suffered in the
prolonged decline in property prices.
Muramoto, an unlisted company capitalised at Y2.4bn and with sales of
Y291.5bn last year, specialises in public works projects, but it diversified
into golf course construction and property development in the late 1980s.
Its difficulties are thought to have started with the collapse of a property
company that had ordered a golf course from the construction group. One of
its property development partners, Daito, then went bankrupt.
Muramoto yesterday found it was unable to pay its bills after the majority
of its creditors had rejected a rescue plan put together by Nanto Bank and
Daiwa Bank. It filed for protection under Japan's corporate reorganisation
act.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Spain heads European
performance tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT bond markets continued to post positive returns in October, as
European bond markets benefited from the Bundesbank's cut in key interest
rates.
According to JP Morgan's government bond index, Spain was the strongest
performer in local currency terms, posting returns of 3.3 per cent over
October. Spanish 10-year bond yields reached a historic low of 8.43 per
cent, following a cut of 75 basis points in the Bank of Spain's repo rate
over the course of the month.
German bunds offered gains of a relatively modest 1.58 per cent, while the
US Treasury market came bottom of the league table with returns of 0.32 per
cent. For the year to date, Spain and Italy are each offering around 28 per
cent.
For unhedged US dollar-based investors, the appreciation of the dollar
against most currencies, with the exception of the Australian and Canadian
dollars, held down returns. The Australian bond market posted the strongest
returns for an unhedged US dollar based investor, with 5.39 per cent in
October.
The Australian market performed even better for sterling-based investors,
according to Kemper Investment Management's government bond market index,
which shows a 6.05 per cent return in sterling for October.
SIXTY per cent of UK company treasurers believe sterling's suspension from
the European exchange rate mechanism is favourable for their companies,
according to a survey of 70 treasurers by Record Treasury Management, which
advises on currency risk.
Only 10 per cent consider sterling's exit from the ERM unfavourable,
compared with 25 per cent in last year's survey. However, 69 per cent would
support rejoining in a different structure, either using 'wide' bands (45
per cent) or as a move to a single currency (25 per cent).
An overwhelming 96 per cent oppose controls to curb currency speculation.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Midlands freight depot proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBCOTT Estates, a private property company half-owned by Severn Trent
Water, yesterday asked Daventry District Council for planning permission to
build a rail freight terminal with 2.3m sq ft of associated manufacturing
and distribution floorspace.
The move emphasises the search for land in the Midlands to develop
distribution depots close to the M1, M6 and M42 motorways. It reflects the
assumption that rail freight traffic will increase after the Channel tunnel
opens next year.
The Abbcott scheme, covering 160 acres five miles south of the M1/M6
interchange, would cost Pounds 140m to complete, but the terminal could
start operations after an investment of Pounds 35m on infrastructure.
The Daventry terminal could open in November 1995, depending on planning
procedures. It is then likely to be in competition with the terminal at
Landor Street, Birmingham, operated and recently expanded by Railfreight
Distribution, a British Rail subsidiary.

FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anxiety in the drugs sector, triggered last week by Wellcome's results,
continued to pull stocks lower. Few investors came to the rescue of
pharmaceuticals and shares slipped almost across the board.
The flagging sentiment was not helped by Kleinwort Benson's move from
overweight to neutral on the sector and a shift from buy to a hold on Glaxo.
Its shares fell back 8 1/2 to 674p, while Fisons gave up 2 to 159p, Zeneca
17 to 756p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' 7 to 413p. Wellcome lost 15 to 675p,
with 2.6m shares traded.
But as bearish stances hardened across the sector, one analyst stood out to
say that the profit-taking on the stocks had been something of an
over-reaction. He said the harsher climate that gripped pharmaceuticals
should lead to lower expectations of growth, and therefore Wellcome's
figures should not be seen as extremely as the market had done. 'The sector
has turned the corner but the fundamentals are just not as good as they used
to be.' He also pointed to Wellcome's yield and suggested that that would
soon prove to be a pull for investors.
British Petroleum's rehabilitation continued yesterday, the shares creeping
up a further 3 to 352 1/2 p - their highest close since October 17, 1991 -
ahead of next Thursday's third-quarter numbers. 'No-one wants to be short of
BP, which is now seen as well set on the road to recovery,' said one
analyst.
BP shares slumped to a record low of 185 1/2 p in August 1992. after the
group cut its dividend.
The leisure sector was enlivened by a number of features which acted to keep
most of the stocks in positive territory. Thorn EMI surged on weekend press
comment on the bright outlook for the multi-media market, with interesting
hints on the prospects for mergers and takeovers - BT notwithstanding. Thorn
shares added 13 at 964p, albeit in dull turnover of 1.1m.
An announcement from Stanley Leisure that trading in its casinos and betting
shops was 'considerably ahead' for the first six months of the current year
compared with the same period a year ago lifted the shares and impacted on
related stocks. Stanley made the revelation along with the purchase of a
regional betting group for Pounds 6m. The shares moved ahead 20 to 249p.
Stanley's good news helped Rank Organisation, which gained 6 at 847p. Bass,
owner of the Coral Racing chain, put on 2 at 490p. The group also announced
that it was buying a stake in the Czech Republic's second largest brewer.
Ladbroke, however, remained friendless and was down a penny at 172p.
The dullness in Ladbroke was also connected with the continuing revelations
over the fall of Queens Moat Houses, which kept hotel stocks under a cloud,
Forte slipping 2 1/2 to 219p. Compass Group appreciated 5 to 570p on
announcing a deal with Burger King.
After last week's rally, Guinness softened a penny to 434p. Two US-owned
brokers have been recommending the stock in the past week and analysts say
support will probably be forthcoming prior to a visit to the group's Greek
operations by institutions and brokers.
Turnover among food retailers returned to normal after the hectic activity
seen last week, fuelled by talk of a price war and worries over discount
operators.
NatWest Securities in its latest research note adopted a 'neutral' stance on
the sector and said J. Sainsbury, a half-penny firmer at 396p, Asda, steady
at 54p, and Kwik Save, off a penny at 641p, held good value. The broker
downgraded Argyll Group and went from 'buy' to 'hold'. The shares receded 3
1/2 to 292 1/2 p.
In a weak food manufacturing sector, Unilever's good run continued, the
shares climbing 15 to 1166p. Strauss Turnbull was again recommending the
stock. Agency broker James Capel was said to be behind a rise in Tate &amp; Lyle
of 5 to 387p.
Trouble in its pig rearing division was blamed by Cranswick for a profits
warning, which sent the shares plunging 32 to 159p.
Buoyed by US support and interest sparked from well publicised reappraisals
of the Globex futures trading system, Reuters moved up strongly, recording a
rise of 28 at 1662p.
Fears over the possible imposition of VAT on newspapers in this month's
Budget continued to nibble away at the price of publishing stocks. Telegraph
shares suffered additional nervousness ahead of third-quarter figures due in
two weeks' time and the price lost 5 to 677p. United Newspapers gave up 3 to
539p, News International 2 to 293p and Mirror Group a penny to 160p.
Standard Chartered moved up 13 to 1071p, an all-time high, with marketmakers
citing Continental buying interest, which uncovered a stock shortage, as
responsible for the strong rise in the shares. Hong Kong's latest upsurge
also accounted for some of the rise.
SG Warburg was the outstanding performer in merchant banks as expectations
of bumper interim profits saw the shares gain 6 more at 930p, after touching
a record 932p.
Legal &amp; General fell to 511p before settling 9 down on balance at 516p,
allbeit in thin trading of only 843,000 shares, amid persistent worries
about Lautro's investigations into the industry.
Pittencrief forged ahead 31 more to 436p, still boosted by revaluations of
its US telecoms interests.
Hopes that British Aerospace will gain a satisfactory outcome from its
crisis talks with the Taiwan authorities this week helped the stock advance
8 to 434p.
Steel group ASW saw its shares tumble after issuing a profits warning. They
closed 41 down at 147p.

FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BT wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spotlight was turned on BT shares at the outset of trading as the market
reacted firstly, and crucially, to news of a significant price war
initiative whereby BT intends cutting the cost of weekend calls.
Secondly, dealers were keen to see the reaction of the big institutions to a
story in the weekend press suggesting that BT was stalking Thorn EMI with a
view to a potential takeover of the latter. The Thorn story was immediately
disregarded by market analysts - 'the first I have heard of it and an
unlikely tie-up,' was the view of one top-rated specialist.
The price-cutting initiative was not viewed as damaging by telecoms and
general market analysts, who continued to view BT as one of the market's
best defensive stocks.
BT is scheduled to report second-quarter numbers on Thursday. NatWest
Securities is forecasting a 9.75 per cent increase in the interim dividend
to 6.75p and for profits to come out at Pounds 715m - up 66 per cent from
the comparable figure last year - to make first-half profits of Pounds
1.472bn.
At the close of trading, BT shares were 3 1/2 higher at 465 1/2 p on
relatively low turnover of 4.5m, while the partly-paid were 1 1/2 firmer at
214 1/2 p.

FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone nears record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST individual perform-ance in the FT-SE 100 Index came from Vodafone,
the cellular telephones group, which jumped 25, or 4.5 per cent, to 578p,
within a penny of the stock's all-time high. The move followed the
announce-ment of the group's highest ever monthly new subscriber figures.
Telecoms analysts were not surprised by the new gross subscriber levels,
which they said were triggered by the recent burst of aggressive marketing
efforts by both of the UK cellular phone groups, Vodafone and BT. One
leading telecoms analyst described Vodafone's new numbers as 'extremely
pleasing, even more so because two-thirds of the gross increase has come
from the more lucrative business subscriber tariff'.
Mr Marshall Whiting, telecoms specialist at Swiss Bank Corporation and a
long-term bull of Vodafone, said: 'The cellular market remains good value
and Vodafone will participate in its growth.' The shares peaked at the end
of August when a wave of US money moved into the UK market, focusing on the
then current American favourites such as Vodafone and Reuters.

FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in thin volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG warning against optimism on domestic interest rates from the
chancellor of the exchequer failed to depress UK equities for long
yesterday. The early part of the session saw some selling and the stock
market was also upset by the temporary closure of the London International
Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) because of a fire scare. But shares
rallied strongly just before the close when both sterling and government
bonds appeared to steady from their early worries over base rates.
However, traders stressed that sluggish trading volume presented the chief
characteristic of the first session of the new equity trading account.
Equity business was about 41 per cent down from Friday's level and most
significant share price movements reflected individual company concerns
rather than across the board investment pressures from the big fund
management houses.
Shares reacted quickly to the UK chancellor's comment, on a Sunday morning
television programme, that he saw no need for a base rate cut at present.
His remarks provided a discouraging backcloth to the stock market's
interpretation of the latest predictions in the City of the likely content
of the UK Budget to be presented at the end of the month.
At its worst the FT-SE 100 Index was down 23.1 to just under 3,148 and
remained subdued for most of the session. But at the very end of the trading
day, it bounced smartly to close at 3,164.4, with the day's loss trimmed to
only 6.6 points. At 3,520.5, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was off 7.6 points as
the second line stocks were largely left on the sidelines.
The weakest sector was again the pharmaceuticals, where last week's reaction
to Wellcome's results continued to drag down share prices. Losses among
retail shares, the most closely linked to base rate prospects, were minimal
by the close of business.
The market is expected to focus on the latest leading indicators on the US
economy, due today, for evidence that the American economy is continuing to
grow more strongly. 'The US booms, while Europe slumps,' commented the
economics team at Yamaichi.
Data on the British economy is limited this week but London analysts will be
scrutinising the list of statistics from Germany. Little is expected from
the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, and news of a further fall in
manufacturing output and a rise in unemployment are feared.
Seaq volume fell to only 465.5m shares, from 800.9m on Friday, when retail
worth of Pounds 1.63bn indicated the continued underlying strength in
equities.
Dealers ascribed the fall-off in business to a pause in activity by managers
of the multi-national funds prompted by holiday closures yesterday in
several continental European financial centres.
There was also some caution ahead of publication today of the Bank of
England's Quarterly Bulletin which, some analysts fear, may express further
concern that inflation prospects are deteriorating.
This would add further uncertainty to the equation over prospects for both
base rate cuts and tax increases in this month's Budget. 'Room for manoeuvre
on rate cuts without a tight Budget is fast disappearing,' commented Mr
Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at BZW.

FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor's dampening of interest rate cut hopes permeated through the
Footsie futures sector during yesterday morning, although later trading
brought a recovery which limited the final damage, writes Christine Buckley.
With fears also circulating over taxation moves on pension funds, the
December contract on the FT-SE 100 was quick to fall back after opening at
3,179 - the day's high.
Midway through the contract's morning slide there was a fire scare at the
London International Financial Futures Exchange. But the evacuation of the
trading floor for about half an hour was said to have had little effect on
the day's dealing.
As traders contended with a background of gloom provided by poor short
sterling and gilts markets, the low of the day came just before lunchtime.
Selling, said to have been mainly driven by independent traders, pushed the
December contract down to 3,151. But a bouncy Wall Street added a little
vigour to the afternoon and a convincing rally was mustered. December
finished at 3,171, nearly two points ahead of its fair value premium to the
cash market. The premium now stands at about 8 points. At 8,934 lots, volume
was steady.
Traded options were quiet, with index options accounting for a substantial
chunk of the action. Total volume was 25,552 contracts, with 9,816 dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New peak for Dow on bullish
economic news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER trading slightly lower in early dealings in spite of positive economic
news, investors set aside their concerns about rising bond yields and pushed
share prices to new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.02 up at 3,692.61, eclipsing the
previous record of 3,687.86 set last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained
1.27 at 469.10, the American SE composite added 1.13 at 482.57 and the
Nasdaq composite was up 4.51 at 783.77. New York SE volume was 256m shares
and advances outscored declines by 1,071 to 958.
Trading got off to a slow start, with investors troubled by early declines
in bond prices which were triggered by a stronger than expected report on
October manufacturing activity from the National Association of Purchasing
Management. The latest in a string of positive economic data, the report
pushed the benchmark 30-year bond down three-quarters of a point, lifting
the yield back above 6 per cent.
But the purchasing managers' report was bullish for stocks. The NAPM said
its index of manufacturing activity rose from the 49.7 seen in September to
53.8 in October. Any reading above 50 is taken as evidence that the
manufacturing sector is expanding. Strong readings in manufacturing orders
and production, and lack of growth in manufacturing prices, were seen as
particularly encouraging.
After a slow start, the figures eventually proved bullish enough to lift
equities out of their morning doldrums, and in spite of continued concern on
Wall Street about overvalued stocks, blue chip and cyclical shares moved
into record territory late in the day.
McDonnell Douglas jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 98 1/8 in busy trading
after the aircraft manufacturer and defence supplier reported net income of
Dollars 142m for the third quarter, an impressive turnround from the Dollars
42m loss incurred in the same period a year ago. The company's earnings were
boosted by a one-off tax-related gain of Dollars 41m.
Car manufacturing issues remained in demand in the wake of strong
third-quarter earnings reports.
Forestry product stocks, hit late last week by negative comments from a
brokerage analyst, rallied strongly. International Paper advanced Dollars 2
1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 , Georgia-Pacific Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 and
Louisiana-Pacific Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 38 3/8 .
Dean Foods rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/8 after stating that it would
be acquiring the Birds Eye vegetable business from Kraft General Foods for
about Dollars 140m. Compaq put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 68 3/4 in busy
trade after the computer group announced further price cuts in its leading
products.
Canada
TORONTO followed a five-day winning streak with a mixed performance
yesterday in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index receded 7.5 from its record
high to 4,248.0, but rises led falls by 405 to 384 after volume of 57.6m
shares.
Nine of the 14 stock groups rose, led by transportation, up 2.99 per cent.
But gold shares fell 3.44 per cent after the gold bullion price sank in
sympathy with silver, which plummeted after Xerox unveiled a new graphic
arts film this weekend which does not use silver.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volkswagen enlivens
Frankfurt's quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAYS in several European countries and in three German states reduced
bourse activity, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw volatility in individual stocks although the DAX index slipped
6.88 to 2,062.12, most leading stocks had a very quiet day and turnover fell
from DM9.5bn to DM4.1bn.
The blue chip exception was Volkswagen, up DM4.30 to DM398.30 on the
session, and by another DM4.20 to DM402.50 in the post bourse. Mr Peter
Bohnke, of Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that many traders liked to
short VW, and had to cover after a major buyer emerged yesterday.
Some smaller stocks shot up on a combination of the thin market and
investment buying. Porsche climbed DM51 to DM868, the pharmaceuticals and
dietics group, Altana, by DM34 to DM625 and the papermaker, PWA by DM6 to
DM193.
AMSTERDAM closed at the day's high, with activity remaining concentrated in
the options and futures exchanges. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.6 to
136.5, with a stronger dollar helping to lift sentiment.
In a week in which a number of the major companies release interims,
Philips, out on Thursday, gained 40 cents to Fl 39.50 and its Polygram unit
Fl 1.60 to Fl 72.30. KLM, also due out on Thursday, added 90 cents to Fl
40.60, picking up some of Friday's losses on fears that the Alcazar talks
might have run into difficulty. Hoare Govett has put out a sell note,
forecasting net profit of Fl 105m for the second quarter compared with Fl
154.6 in the same 1992 period.
ZURICH experienced an uncertain session. However, late demand for the dollar
sensitive Roche and Ciba-Geigy reversed the trend and the SMI index picked
up from the day's low of 2,708.1 to close 3.9 higher at a record 2,727.1.
Ciba-Geigy bearers, recent underperformers, added SFr15 to SFr815 while
Roche certificates rose SFr40 to SFr5,790.
Nestle, the most active issue, dipped SFr3 to SFr1,184, after a low of
SFr1,170. Profit-taking in cyclicals left Alusuisse registered shares SFr16
easier at SFr527, while among mixed to lower financials, Swiss Re shed
SFr100 to SFr3,770.
ISTANBUL fell sharply, the composite index losing 565.4 or 3.9 per cent to
13,935.2, following the decision at the weekend to raise the basic rate of
VAT from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. Although the move was widely expected,
it illustrated the difficulties faced by the government, which is also under
pressure because of an increase in Kurdish violence.
ATHENS fell by more than 1.5 per cent on a further round of profit-taking,
and disappointment over recent interim results. The general index lost 12.82
to 833.61 in turnover of some Dr2.7bn. TEL AVIV was another market where
investors took profits, following its climb to record levels on Sunday. The
Mishtanim index lost 2.4 to 238.81 in turnover of Shk392m, having risen to
241.21 on Sunday.
Commentators said that the rally had been triggered by a statement from
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in which he hoped that Israel and Syria
would sign a peace agreement by the year end.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 1.3% as
region continues to set records

PROFIT-TAKING in East Japan Railway dampened sentiment, and the Nikkei
average lost 1.3 per cent on arbitrage linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 264.73 off at 19,438.24 after opening at the
day's high of 19,656.97 and slipping to a low of 19,375.24 in the afternoon.
Volume was a thin 200m shares, against 297.6m. Declines led rises by 594 to
363, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 10.84 to 1,619.75, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.11 to
1,283.67.
Traders said individual investors and second tier brokers were selling JR
East. Meanwhile, much of the downward pressure came from arbitrage selling
linked to Nikkei 225 futures. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities commented:
'The market is not going to turn up until JR East rises above its initial
trading price of Y600,000.'
JR East receded Y28,000 to Y492,000, slipping below the psychological
support level of Y500,000 for the first time since its debut last Tuesday.
Technical analysts hope the Nikkei index will be supported at its 52-week
moving average of 19,200. 'That is the lowest it is likely to fall in the
near term,' said a Japanese broker.
Margin buyers sold Sumitomo Metal Mining, which fell Y30 to Y836, and NEC,
down Y2 at Y949. High-technology shares, which gained last week on the rise
in the dollar against the yen, declined on profit-taking.
Large-capital issues also eased on profit-taking: Nippon Steel dipped Y8 to
Y326 and NKK Y4 to Y269. Banks were lower as a leading Japanese brokerage
house sold Nikkei 300 linked shares: Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y20 to
Y3,340 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y40 to Y2,360.
Carmakers, on the other hand, firmed on foreign buying. Toyota Motor, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y1,900, while Honda Motor moved
ahead Y20 to Y1,610. NTT advanced Y3,000 to Y834,000 on bargain hunting.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 110.54 to 21,511.11 in volume of 7.9m
shares. Small-lot selling was one reason; and railway stocks lost ground in
tandem with JR East.
Roundup
FOREIGN buying brought further records to the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG continued to be propelled higher by further strong US and Japanese
demand, although the advance slowed towards the end of the session with the
emergence of profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 300.10, or 3.2 per
cent, up at a record 9,629.19, after establishing an all-time intraday high
of 9,710.08.
BANGKOK finished its most active trading day ever at another historic high
as foreigners continued to pour funds into the market.
The composite index rose 65.25, or 5.2 per cent, to 1,326.16 in turnover of
Bt28bn, against the previous record of Bt27bn set on October 7.
NEW ZEALAND registered its seventh consecutive advance with the NZSE-40
capital index 35.52, or 1.6 per cent, ahead at 2,199.50 - its highest level
since August 1989.
AUSTRALIA climbed to another six-year peak, encouraged by a narrowing in the
current account deficit, a 9 per cent jump in exports and a rise in building
approvals. The All Ordinaries index added 20.2 at 2,132.4.
SEOUL advanced in brisk trading as buying interest in large-capitalisation
export-oriented issues gained momentum. The composite index closed 11.04
higher at 761.76 in turnover of Won866.32bn.
JAKARTA was firmer in active trading, with both local and foreign investors
focusing on banking and property stocks. The official index finished 2.95
ahead at 469.10.
KARACHI saw the KSE 100 index recover 12.14 to 1,540.08, writes Farhan
Bokhari. The market had turned lower on profit-taking during the previous
two days.
However, after official predictions of a bumper 12m-bale cotton crop this
year, there was concern over new estimates from some officials and
businessmen who predicted between a 10 and 15 per cent shortfall from the
estimated figure due to recent pest attacks in central Punjab.
BOMBAY relinquished further ground as brokers continued to wind down
positions ahead of December 1 when new capital adequacy norms will be
applied. The BSE index shed 52.46 to 2,621.28.
KUALA LUMPUR was dragged lower by a retreat in Telekom Malaysia. The KLSE
composite index dipped 4.94 to 967.05 as Telekom fell 80 cents to MDollars
20.80.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Global investors remain intent on
Pacific Rim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attention of the world's investment community remained firmly fixed on
Hong Kong and the Pacific region's other emerging markets last week. But
weakness in some of the mature equity markets, including Japan and France,
kept the advance in the FT-Actuaries World index to a minimum.
The enthusiasm for Hong Kong - it is the world's third best performing
market in dollar terms so far this year after Malaysia and Finland,
according to the FT-A data - is not shared by everyone. Mr Albert Edwards,
global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, supports an overweight position on
the Pacific Rim but he argues the case against investment in Hong Kong.
'One of the main arguments used to justify the heavy inflow of money into
the Far East is that it is a rapid growth area. We have no quarrel with that
view; but what we would point out, however, is that mature economies such as
the US and UK are generating earnings growth that compares favourably with
the Far East'.
He adds that while rapid earnings growth in the west may be unsustainable in
the long term, it will drive p/e ratios down to levels which will look
favourable compared to the Pacific Rim: 'the prospective UK p/e is now
actually below that of Hong Kong.'
As the emerging markets in the Far East become ever more popular, especially
with US investors, a popular game to play at the moment is in identifying
those countries which remain ripe for for-eign investment. According to one
UBS global strategist, arranging markets by their market capitalisation
reveals that the Philippines, Thailand and even Taiwan have some way to move
before reaching the level of Hong Kong, which is now bigger than that of
Italy.
Japan was one of last week's disappointments, and the market's drift
downwards continued yesterday. The listing of East Japan Railway, which had
been expected to drive the Nikkei higher, did the opposite.
The market's drift has caused no surprise for Nomura's strategy team, which
advised a cautious approach back in May. While still sympathetic to a
bullish appraisal of Japanese equities, Nomura suggests that a lot of the
good news has already been priced into shares.
For example, 'an imminent package of Y5,000bn in income tax cuts has been
the market gossip for some time, leaving prices vulnerable to disappointment
over both timing and size'.
Europe's equity markets showed a divergence of performances over the past
week, with both France and Italy falling back as domestic worries took hold.
The decline of the French market, says Nikko Europe's Mr Michael Woodcock,
was due more to the government's climbdown over a package of austerity
measures proposed for Air France, the state-run airline, than concern over
the slow pace of interest rate cuts.
Mr Woodcock suggests that the Air France saga - which ended on Friday after
a 16-day stoppage of the airline's operations - called into question the
government's privatisation programme, given that a number of those companies
lined up for sell-off are in need of similar cost-cutting. If the
government's resolve broke once, might it not happen again?
The level of European interest rates and the likely scenario for further
reductions remain uppermost in investors' minds.
Warnings last week from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, against
expecting further interest rate reductions following the surprise  1/2
percentage point cut on October 21 may have dulled some appetites; but
others remain unconvinced.
Hoare Govett forecasts a further 50 basis-point cut before the end of the
year, probably in December, with a further full percentage point off in the
first half of 1994.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Boost for dollar and pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELL received data suggest-ing a pick-up in manufacturing activity in the US
gave a lift to the dollar yesterday. Dollar strength helped sterling, which
also received an initial boost from comments on interest rates by the UK
chancellor, writes Peter John.
With many European financial markets closed for the All Saints' Day holiday,
the US currency continued a rally that began on Friday and carried on during
Tokyo trading.
The dollar was firmer against the yen in Tokyo in spite of comments from Mr
Fred Bergsten, a US economist visiting Japan, who said it needed to stay
below Y110 to the yen in order to reduce Japan's large external trade
surplus.
In European trading, the dollar was helped by the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' index for October, which reflects optimism over
manufacturing activity. The index rose to 53.8 per cent, against an
expectation of some 51.8 per cent and a previous figure of 49.7 per cent.
The latest data on US construction also encouraged the market.
Mr Jim' O Neill, economist with Swiss Bank who has had a very negative
forecast on the dollar, changed his estimate for the US currency's floor
against the D-Mark to DM1.6750 in the short term from DM1.56 previously. But
he still believes it will be back to DM1.60 by the year-end.
The dollar came very close to DM1.70 yesterday, its highest point since
August. At that level many investors were taking their profit on the big
rally of the past two weeks and moving funds into sterling and yen. There
was also nervousness that the Bundesbank might be selling the US currency.
At the close of European trading, the dollar reached Dollars 1.4810 against
sterling, up from Dollars 1.4865 previously, but Y108.20 to the yen, down
from Y108.40. It maintained its strength against a D-Mark weakened by the
Bundesbank's recent interest rate cuts and closed at DM1.6935, up from
Friday's DM1.6795.
In New York the dollar ended at Y108.20 and DM1.6957 and the pound at
Dollars 1.4820.
Sterling also rose smartly against the D-Mark at the start of trading as Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, added his voice to attempts by the
governor of the Bank of England on Friday to dampen speculation of an early
rate reduction.
The pound broke through DM2.50 for the first time since the end of August,
and the index which shows sterling against a basket of leading currencies
rose to 81.1 before closing marginally firmer at 80.9.
Gains were pared at midday but then the pound picked up in the afternoon as
investors switched out of the dollar. Sterling closed a pfennig up on the
day at DM2.5075. A dealer said belief that sterling had broken through to a
new chart-bound range could push it higher still. 'If it stays above DM2.50
for more than 24 hours, the technical boys will move and we could see it hit
DM2.55.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Rate nerves hit shorts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOUBLE dose of official caution over the prospect for lower interest rates
in the UK unsettled the markets yesterday and short sterling fell sharply,
writes Peter John.
First, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, sought on
Friday to dampen speculation over an early cut in base rates, but the market
largely shrugged off his views.
Then on Sunday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, voiced his support for Mr
George by saying that there was no need to cut interest rates 'as of now'.
The opinion of many economists and dealers was 'well, he would wouldn't he,'
but they were in no mood to take chances.
Although most dealers remained convinced that the chancellor will have to
reduce rates by at least  1/2 percentage point at or soon after the Budget,
the short sterling futures contract which expires on December 15 was marked
down by some 17 basis points to 94.38 at the outset of dealing.
In the event of a half-point reduction the December contract was looking
very cheap, and there was good buying at the lower levels which took it back
to 94.42 by the close on turnover of more than 50,000 contracts.
Meanwhile, interbank oper-ations were very tight, and an unwillingness by
commercial banks to provide bills in exchange for the Bank of England's
offer of assistance saw overnight rates pushed as high as 14 per cent at one
stage.
Traders discounted rumours that the central bank might be responding to the
governor's comments by sending signals that interest rates would not fall.
They pointed out that the Bank offered help at each opportunity and at the
established rates.
The Bank offered early assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of
around Pounds 950m, later revised to Pounds 1.1bn, but there were no takers.
More than half of the shortage represented bills for repurchase by the
market.
The Bank did not operate in the money market at midday and provided only
Pounds 55m of assistance in the afternoon.
The bulk of the shortage was dealt with via Pounds 930m of late assistance.
Dealers said that as late help is traditionally provided for a very short
period - usually one or two days - yesterday's help was likely to lead to
tight monetary conditions later in the week.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (7): Following at
snail's pace - Jonathan S. Schwarz discusses tax regimes' imperfections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN S. SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX LAWS follow several steps behind business innovation. While financial
institutions have developed and marketed sophisticated and inventive
financial instruments, tax systems have adapted at a snail's pace.
Comprehensive tax regimes for foreign exchange gains and losses and
financial instruments designed to manage currency and interest rate risks
are still in their infancy. As a result, tax authorities and payers alike
struggle to adapt existing tax rules to these transactions.
Not only are results obtained unsatisfactory, but the tax consequences of
legitimate transactions are often uncertain. On the other hand, tax
authorities are uneasy because of potential revenue losses arising out of
the use of increasingly sophisticated and complex instruments.
The US has shown the way with tax legislation specifically on foreign
currency transactions. The US Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
amendments codified numerous aspects of foreign currency transactions.
Regulations are used to clarify certain aspects of the taxation of a number
of financial risk-management instruments, such as notional principal
contracts including many hedging instruments.
Although London is one of the three key international financial centres, it
is only in 1993 that UK legislation codifying the taxation of financial risk
management transactions has appeared. There has thus been pressure on
multinational corporate groups to move profitable treasury functions to
tax-favoured locations such as the Dublin Docks or Belgian co-ordination
centres.
In the UK, tax on foreign-currency gains and losses has until now been taxed
under general principles. The traditional distinction between income and
capital has caused numerous difficulties in this area. Revenue receipt or
expenses are included in computing taxable income, while capital gains or
losses on capital assets are determined separately.
Capital gains and losses are not recognised generally for tax purposes until
realised. In addition, gains and losses arising in respect of capital
liabilities are outside the tax system. Transactions that fit together
commercially may be awkwardly asymmetrical once tax has been taken into
account.
Difficulties in relation to currency gains and losses have long been
recognised. In 1989, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on
the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses. It proposed symmetry
in taxing exchange gains and losses on the same basis with respect to timing
methods and amounts. It tentatively proposed the abolition of the
distinction between capital and income in respect of foreign exchange, gains
and losses arising in the course of trade.
In March 1991, the Inland Revenue issued a further consultative document on
the reform of the tax treatment of currency gains and losses. This formed
the basis for measures included in the 1993 Finance Act.
The new law deals primarily with gains and losses on monetary assets and
liabilities. Generally, qualifying assets and liabilities are those debts
not convertible into equity, contracts to acquire foreign currency and
foreign currency itself. The rules which are contained in more than 50
sections and four schedules to the Act provide that exchange differences on
monetary items are to be included in taxable profits on a translation basis.
They will fall outside the capital gains regime.
Currency contracts are subject to tax as if the currencies were acquired
when the contract is entered into. Fluctuations over the life of the
agreement in relation to sterling are taxable or deductible.
Complex transitional rules determine the applicability of the new regime.
Given the fact that a number of areas are still to be clarified by
regulation and the necessary overlap between these rules and the rules
relating to financial instruments, it will be some time before its impact
can be fully assessed.
There are few provisions under current UK tax law specifically dealing with
financial instruments. The rules have been unco-ordinated and unfocused.
Corporate users of financial instruments are faced with different rules for
traded futures and options, as opposed to other futures and options for
example. Similarly, swaps with UK banks or swap traders are treated
differently from any other swaps.
In 1989, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on the taxation
of financial instruments for managing interest rate risks. The document
focused specifically on swaps. Then, current practice tended to discriminate
against non-bank entities in the UK swap market. Under the proposals,
recurring swap fees would be assimilated to interest. Because swap payments
were assimilated to interest, other rules would apply such as thin
capitalisation rules and treaty provisions dealing with interest.
A further consultative document was issued by the Inland Revenue on
financial instruments in 1991. The government objectives were to recommend
how payments and receipts should be characterised for tax purposes, to
include as many instruments as possible that are commonly used for managing
interest-rate risk, and to provide rules for the timing of recognition of
payments and receipts for tax purposes that are consistent with ordinary
commercial accounting. Specific anti-avoidance measures to protect the
Exchequer were proposed.
These proposals are broadly enacted in new draft clauses, released on August
20 this year, and are expected to be included in the next Finance Bill. The
draft clauses are designed to dovetail with the new currency regime. It
therefore applies to companies, but excludes several entities taxed as
companies, such as unit trusts and offshore funds. Special rules are
provided for special taxpayers such as insurance and mutual trading
companies.
Taxation may be on a 'mark to market' basis. This taxes payments and
receipts in each accounting period and changes in the value of the
underlying instrument over its life. Alternatively, an accrual basis method
may be adopted.
Payments and receipts under all swaps and financial hedging instruments are
to be treated as income, and therefore deductible and taxable accordingly.
Most instruments primarily used for currency and interest-rate risk
management are covered. They include swaps and other instruments involving
periodic payments which are either fixed or determined by reference to the
application of an interest rate to a notional principal amount. These
include interest-rate caps, collars and floors. There must be at least one
receipt or payment determined by a variable interest rate. Single period
instruments are also included. These include forward rate agreements,
interest-rate futures and options, as well as currency futures and options.
Clearly, the Inland Revenue is suspicious that sophisticated financial
instruments may be used to confer unintended tax benefits. As a result,
several anti-avoidance provisions are included.
Withholding tax will apply to payments made by UK resident companies to
parties in tax haven countries or in territories where there is no interest
article in an applicable tax treaty.
It is ironic that, while the tax rules relating to instruments for the
management of interest-rate risks have moved towards an accrual based
system, the rules relating to the taxation of interest have not. The UK
continues to apply the old-fashioned cash basis.
A number of key international issues remain unsolved. Although the UK has
opted to treat payments on qualifying financial instruments as interest, it
is unclear whether such payments will always be interest for tax treaty
purposes. There is a strong body of opinion that the definition of interest
for treaty purposes must follow the definitions in specific treaties.
Payments under swaps, for example, are often classified as 'other income,'
which commonly escapes taxation under many tax treaties. In some
circumstances, they may also be regarded as 'business profits,' which escape
taxation in the absence of a permanent establishment. This will be of
particular importance in relation to those treaties where withholding tax on
interest is not entirely eliminated.
In the European Community, the Commission is arguing that the Parent
Subsidiary directive be extended to interest payments. The directive
eliminates withholding tax on dividends from companies at least 25 per cent
owned by a parent in another member state. This would be a step forward, but
would only solve the problem for related party transactions. A single market
in financial instruments will not emerge in the EC until withholding tax
barriers have been eliminated.
The risks of double taxation, or indeed double non-taxation, as a result of
inconsistent categorisation of financial instruments, traps and
opportunities arising from differences in timing of recognition of income
and deduction and withholding tax problems continue. Transfer pricing will
continue to be a crucial issue where centralised treasury functions are
carried out for group companies in multiple jurisdictions.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (8): Alcos provide
an 'engine-room' - Banks' management of balance-sheet risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALANCE SHEET risk is now commonly managed by banks and building societies
through central committees. Though sometimes known as risk committees, or
balance sheet management committees, the popular label is 'the asset and
management liability committee' - or Alco.
Members represent each part of the balance sheet. The committee will often
include the treasurer, the heads of lending and fund acquisition
departments, the head of corporate planning and managers from international
divisions.
The main function is to maximise earnings through overall management of
acquisition and allocation of funds. Strategy is laid down through
monitoring asset and liability distributions and maturities, earnings
margins and appraisal of liability and loan pricing policies across a bank's
portfolio of businesses.
Alcos originated in the 1980s in the US. Growth in financial markets was
accompanied by an increase in the range and complexity of financial products
available. Risks consequently increased and new ways of taking and avoiding
risk mushroomed. Banks realised that top-level management was required,
hence the genesis of the Alco.
The committee's remit typically extends to the setting of high-level limits,
with board approval, in the key areas of interest-rate risk, currency risk,
liquidity risk, equity price risk and settlement risk. In some banks country
and industry, portfolio risk is also managed by the committee.
Royal Bank of Scotland set up its Alco last year. 'We recognised as a bank
that we needed an engine-room to effectively manage the risk that was
arising across the bank's business strategies,' says Mr Peter HanIon, head
of group asset and liability management 'It was to make sure that everybody
put their group hats on, so to speak, rather than their divisional hats.' Up
to then, the bank had a decentralised approach to risk management.
As well as ensuring that divisional strategies result in a balance sheet
that the group is comfortable with, RBS's Alco also acts as a communication
conduit, educating different parts of the group on market and credit risk.
The committee meets monthly and deals with high-level decisions. 'It's not
concerned with housekeeping,' says Mr HanIon.
Price Waterhouse partner, Mr Andrew Stott, is involved in setting up and
advising on the running of asset and liability management units and the
committees they report to. He estimates that three quarters of British banks
and building societies now have an Alco, but doesn't think that this means
asset and liability risks are necessarily being properly dealt with. 'Just
having an Alco doesn't mean that you're effective in managing your balance
sheet,' he warns.
A particular problem is undue influence of one part of a bank over the Alco.
Ideally, the committee should be chaired by the chief executive, but this
may not happen in practice. In particular, in smaller banks and building
societies asset and liability risk management may be run from the treasury,
due to the fact that the expertise required to analyse structural risk is
often far more developed in treasury than other areas.
First Consulting recently conducted a survey of the operations of Alcos in
19 British banks and building societies. 'There are people who say they are
an Alco - they say they are looking at the whole balance sheet - but
actually their conversations in their monthly meetings are predominantly
about treasury issues,' says First Consulting's Magnus Spence.
Treasuries are commonly geared to short-term structural risk, while the Alco
needs to assess risk against a bank's long-term goals. 'There could be
conflicting risk strategies,' says Mr Stott, at Price Waterhouse.
need not arise if the two functions are clearly separated within a treasury
with clear individual objectives, but that this is easier to ensure if
personnel are within different divisions.
A key issue for RBS's Alco is liability sourcing. For all banks, low
interest rates have produced outflows from customer accounts. RBS has a
policy of moving towards more stable retail deposits, and the Alco aims to
provide incentives for the process and speed it up.
The TSB has been running its Alco - known by the less catchy title of 'group
balance sheet management committee' - for around five years in its current
form, and has devised strategies for tackling the same problem.
'You're looking to put on basically more fixed mortgages and more personal
loans,' explains Mr John Ashenhurst, director of TSB's group balance sheet
management unit and secretary of the UK Asset and Liability Association.
One approach is to vary price sensitivity from account to account, and for
interest-rate tiers within accounts. 'The old way was that you said that
everything was either sensitive or insensitive. What we're saying is that it
might be sensitive today, but it may not be tomorrow,' says Mr Ashenhurst.
Changes in rates alter structural risk and policy. 'If interest rates go up,
you will probably have to reprice the liabilities so that they won't be
exposed,' says Mr Ashenhurst. 'It's timing and getting it right that is the
main issue.'
As well as increased marketing of fixed-rate mortgages and personal loans,
TSB is hedging the exposure from low-interest rate tiers in customers'
accounts by investments in gilts and swaps. Moves by depositors into
equities inevitably means that banks are looking to the interbank market for
funds. This changes the balance sheet's risk profile, notably for liquidity
risk, and presents Alcos with another set of policy decisions.
A battery of instruments are available to banks for redistribution of risk.
'Depending on their expectations, they could use interest rate derivatives,
for example,' explains Andrew Stott.
A key function of the Alco is the co-ordination of competing demands by a
bank's different operating units for a share of the balance sheet. Return on
capital, adjusted for the various kinds of risk, is a fundamental
performance indicator. 'You invest your capital in the highest performing
business units,' explains Peter HanIon. 'It's an incremental approach based
on bidding and competing.'
An important back-up to the Alco is the data provided by a balance sheet
simulation model. The effects of different capital allocation strategies and
of the use of new products can be predicted. Developed in the US, they have
been widely purchased by UK banks and building societies. 'It gives you a
dynamic dimension to your balance sheet,' says Mr HanIon.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (6): In pursuit of
yield as recession ends - Simon London explains how liquidity is monitored
to ensure cash flow is in good health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not only pensioners that suffer a drop in income when interest rates
are low. Companies with large cash balances are finding interest income
squeezed, and face pressure to either make cash work harder or return the
surplus to shareholders.
Organisation of cash management within a company can help to increase
returns without any change of investment strategy. Squeezing the most out by
reducing working capital, cutting debtor days and stocks is an obvious place
to start. As the economy pulls out of recession, though, the pressure will
be in the opposite direction.
Bringing the surplus cash resources of a group together in one
centrally-managed fund is a self-help strategy favoured by many companies.
'Centralised cash management produces the best returns by concentrating
expertise, increasing the size in which we can deal and avoiding the
position where idle cash balances are spread around the group,' said Philip
Wood, director of treasury at Reuters, which had Pounds 700m cash at its
last financial year end, although it has since spent Pounds 350m buying-back
its own shares.
Reuters' approach also demands close involvement of tax planning in
investment decisions. 'We are always trying to maximise the after-tax
returns to shareholders. Investors measure us in terms of earnings per
share, and that is how we judge ourselves,' commented Mr Wood.
But good housekeeping and careful planning can only work so far. The search
for higher yield almost inevitably involves a greater degree of risk. As
many local authorities found out to their cost, deposits placed with the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International offered higher returns than those
placed with clearing banks for a reason. In the light of the BCCI collapse,
many companies have tightened controls and do not place deposits with banks
below a certain credit quality.
For Reuters, the threshold is normally set at a credit rating of single-A
from one of the big rating agencies. This applies to swaps contracts and
exposures other than deposits. Different types of exposure to each
institution are added to give an aggregate exposure.
But credit ratings are not the only guide. Many company treasurers have been
wary of buying mortgage-backed securities following the financial problems
faced by National Home Loans, a prominent issuer. In fact, the credit
quality of asset-backed bonds originated by NHL and others remained
reassuringly stable through such problems. But prices fell as investors
edged away from the market.
'It is partly a question of self-protection. It is easier to go to the main
board to justify buying plain-vanilla government bonds. None of them are
likely to understand mortgage-backed bonds, and most will react with
suspicion,' commented the treasurer of one large company.
Another way of chasing additional yield when short-term interest rates are
low is to move into longer-maturity instruments. The 100-year bonds issued
in the US by companies such as Coca-Cola are the most extreme examples,
offering a yield comfortably above the benchmark 30-year US treasury bond.
The danger is that very long-dated instruments tend to be more sensitive to
changes in interest rates and expectations of inflation than shorter
maturity stocks. Credit risks may be no greater than short-dated paper, but
the market risks can be difficult to manage.
The same might be said of investment in foreign currency instruments. Some
UK companies prefer to keep cash in sterling - the currency in which
shareholders funds are denominated and earnings per share is measured.
Others invest in currencies which are a broad match for their spread of
underlying business, or which help off-set exposures to help smooth earnings
per share.
Derivative financial instruments are used to help offset interest-rate or
foreign-currency risks. The philosophical view of companies which prefer
sterling-only investment, though, is that the cost of hedging eats into
additional yield gained from the underlying investment.
Reuters invests mainly in sterling instruments. It aims for a compromise on
interest-rate exposures by identifying a core cash position which is likely
to be maintained for at least three years and locking into interest rates of
around this maturity. Not all of this core cash position is held in
instruments of three years maturity, but interest-rate swaps are used to
lock into rates of around three years. Cash outside the core is likely to
fluctuate - with acquisitions, or other corporate needs - and is treated
separately.
Companies point out that neither short-term nor long-term interest rates are
especially low in real terms, when measured against inflation. A real return
on bank deposits of around 4 per cent represents a reasonable real yield by
historic standards.
Even so, low nominal interest rates make it difficult for companies to
justify holding cash which is unlikely to be channelled into productive
investment. Most industrial companies demand a nominal return of at least 15
per cent from investment in new plant and machinery. Ronnie Hampel, ICI's
chief executive, has said that an average return of 20 per cent through the
economic cycle will be demanded of new investment in the chemicals business.
Set against such stiff targets, holding excess cash can act as a drag on a
company's rate of return on capital.
Reuters' decision to implement a share buy-back programme is a symptom of
such pressure. Glaxo's decision to pay a higher than expected dividend this
year also reflected the growth of its cash pile - from Pounds 1.3bn to
Pounds 1.8bn, despite spending Pounds 850m on research and development - and
pressure from investment institutions to stem the rising tide.
But Glaxo has no immediate plans to return the bulk of its cash to
shareholders. Cash-rich companies, such as GEC, equally show little
enthusiasm for making a one-off payment. Like other companies which face an
uncertain trading environment, Glaxo argues that cash gives it the
flexibility to react to a changing market. On that view, cash always has
value above and beyond the yield it is currently earning.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (5): Banks may be
over-estimating the effect - New US rules will shake up securities
accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW accounting rule that comes into effect in January in the US will
require banks and corporate treasurers to take a closer look at securities
held in portfolio, and account for them according to the institution's
long-term investment intentions.
The rule is expected to shift a large number of debt securities out of the
historical amortised cost basis accounting into market value. Many
capital-sensitive companies, particularly banks, are already shuffling
portfolios in response to the rule, trading off potentially volatile
long-dated debt in favour of short-dated securities.
The concern over bond price volatility is considerable, since the Federal
Reserve Board in August grudgingly decided to follow up on the accounting
rule, known as Federal Accounting Standards Board statement 115, by
requiring banks to adjust their equity capital to reflect unrealised gains
or losses for securities they hold for sale.
FASB 115 establishes three classes of debt securities. Securities that are
to be held to maturity can continue to be reported at amortised cost.
However, if the institution believes the security might be sold under some
circumstances - say, to create liquidity to meet seasonal loan demand - the
security must be classified as 'available for sale,' and be valued at the
market on a quarterly basis, with unrealised gains and losses affecting the
institution's equity position.
Securities held for trading purposes, the third category, are reported at
market, with unrealised gains and losses going straight to the income
statement.
Bankers say that many securities traditionally considered as held to
maturity will shift to the 'available for sale' category, because the rule
discourages the sale of a security classed as held for maturity. The rule
says transfers between classifications must be rare and unusual, and any
transfers must be accounted for as a sale and repurchase at market.
In addition, because FSBE 115 is asymmetrical, and deals only with the asset
side of an institution's balance sheet, a security must be classed as
'available for sale' if its price risk is hedged, or if it might be sold to
implement an asset-liability management strategy.
A sizeable amount of long-term debt that had been safely amortised under the
investment category will soon be subject to the whims of the market, which
bank managers say will have near-term and intermediate effects on capital.
The current environment of low interest rates and rapidly appreciating
stocks in the US should benefit a bank's capital position when the initial
market valuation occurs. 'Almost anyone who's holding a long bond has a
profit in it these days,' notes one institutional money manager. As a
result, few companies are expected experience immediate equity mark-downs.
However, the lofty levels of both the US bond and stock markets makes these
profitable investments highly vulnerable to a market reversal, and
introduces the very real risk of capital volatility.
Bankers fear that depositors and regulators who use capital as a measure of
a bank's soundness will misinterpret market-based capital swings. In fact,
even the Fed believes that the rules will force banks to manage their
portfolios to avoid dramatic capital shifts, at the expense of profitability
or managing interest rate risk.
The belief is well-founded. Bankers, when given the choice, invariably
choose capital preservation over higher portfolio returns. A secondary
concern for US banks is that a variety of regulatory actions, including the
price of bank deposit insurance, is linked to an institution's
capitalisation level.
'We're concerned that, by forcing capital to rise and fall, FASB's action
could trigger a variety of unnecessary penalties and unwise business
decisions,' said Mr Donald Ogilvie, executive vice-president of the American
Bankers Association.
In fact, the bank lobby could be overestimating the effects of the new
accounting rule. Many of the smallest US banks continue to act as
traditional bankers - making money by lending deposits at higher rates than
they pay depositors. If lending is the primary business, a bank's securities
portfolio can rightly be classed as investment, and held to maturity, and
avoid market valuation.
The nation's largest banks will also be prepared for the rule, with many
intending to use derivatives to manage market risks and to adjust the
maturities in their 'held for sale ' securities.
However, many managers are shortening debt maturities. Securities with
maturities of four years or less can be put in the 'held to maturity'
category with more confidence than a 30-year bond. In the 'available for
sale' bucket, a short-dated note is less exposed to a capital shock than a
long bond.
One unexpected result of the accounting rule may be to shut traditionally
long-term municipal borrowers off from their usual investors, and prevent
communities from locking in historically low long-term interest rates.
In communities where local banks are active buyers of municipal debt, the
effect of these portfolio shifts could be to force municipalities to issue
short-term debt to finance long-term projects.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (3): Swaps gain
popularity with users and producers - Robert Alldis discusses new approaches
to commodity risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT ALLDIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMODITY SWAPS have been with us for nearly 20 years. But until three years
ago, few raw material consumers or producers were actively using swaps to
hedge their exposure to changes in commodity prices.
Today, the interest in commodity swaps is rapidly gaining momentum, but
there is still some way to go before this interest is turned into widespread
use.
The total value of deals done is still small. The International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (Isda), in its first analysis of commodity swaps,
reckons they were worth, at the end of 1992 in notional principal terms of
those outstanding, Dollars 18bn - and of those, only Dollars 3bn were
non-energy swaps. But the market for total interest-rate swaps in the same
period was far larger - valued at Dollars 3,850bn, with currency swaps worth
Dollars 860bn. Still, having come from nothing a few years ago, the growth
in use of commodity swaps is significant: they are a useful cost-effective
and tailor-made vehicle, for users and producers of raw materials to manage
their exposure to price risk of an individual commodity.
In the swap, the commodity consumer normally pays fixed and the producer
floating, protecting the latter from any drop in the commodity's price.
Usually, only payment streams are exchanged, rather than physical delivery
taking place. And as the swap is tailored to the particular commodities
being used/produced, the basis risk of using an imperfect substitute, say
for jet fuel, when hedging in the futures market, is eliminated. But this
still does not answer the main reason why the rise in the total value of the
commodity swap market has happened now.
Price factor: Base metal prices have hit six-year lows in recent months;
this has put a limit on downside risk. The cash price for copper currently
trades at around Dollars 1,675 a tonne, near its six-year low when it
touched Dollars 1,571. And nickel is also at levels not seen since June
1987, when it traded at Dollars 4,451 a tonne (currently, nickel is trading
around Dollars 4,675 a tonne).
With base metal prices so depressed, there is a fair chance that their next
move will be up. 'If I were a consumer, I would fix prices now as prices are
so low. But if something happens, these prices would go higher quicker than
you know it - that's why we're seeing such a lot of activity,' says Robert
Miller, vice-president of commodity risk management at Chase Manhattan Bank
in London. And since commodity prices have a habit of being highly volatile
(acutely felt during the Gulf war), it is good time for raw material
consumers who want to capture contango to lock in at current price levels.
Understanding: Corporate treasurers are becoming increasingly familiar with
the use of derivatives to manage their interest rate and currency exposures.
A survey by Greenwich Associates, a Boston-based business strategy
consultancy, found that 52 per cent of European and Middle Eastern
institutions in early 1993 were hedging their currency exposure by using
forwards of less than one year, and that 39 per cent used non-dollar
interest rate futures or exchange-traded options. And, says Mr Per Sekse,
vice-president responsible for commodity derivatives marketing in Europe for
Chemical Bank, London, corporate treasurers seem increasingly willing to
deal over-the-counter with the investment banks, rather than run their own
hedging operations.
The banks can also offer a wide range of tailor-made services and
structures, says Keith Murphy, vice-president and head of commodity
derivatives at J P Morgan, London: 'They are looking at very customised
products, such as indices or baskets of commodities of the very specific
exposures that they have.'
The more exotic commodity swaps have tended to be used by heavy energy users
to hedge their fuel costs. Ed Speal, head of commodity transactions at
Banque Paribas in New York, says he has done swaps on specific pipelines for
natural gas and different grades of fuel oil. Also, by embedding options
into the swap, he has been able make an even more attractive and flexible
product. But for widespread use of the complex vehicles for all raw
materials, a senior US investment banker says: 'The derivatives industry
will get there, embedding four or five different risks into the one vehicle.
Within the next year or two you will see the 'multi-risk swap'.'
But the derivatives boffins have never been short on innovation. For most
corporates, however, the plain vanilla structures remain the rule of thumb.
And the majority of commodity swap vehicles tend to be settled against the
monthly average price of the raw material. These Asian (or average-rate)
products are particularly well suited to commodities.
'If an airline is buying jet fuel every day for a year, it is not worried by
the specific price of the fuel on a specific day, but is more concerned by
its average price,' explains Mr Miller. But in the currency markets, 'as I
know when apayment is coming in on a particular day, I am worried by the
exchange rate on that particular day.' Average priced swaps account for
virtually all the energy swaps Mr Miller does, and around 75 per cent of
metal swaps.
Depth and maturity: As the number of banks involved and the amounts of swaps
outstanding increase, liquidity in commodity swaps has risen and generally
spreads have narrowed. And with higher liquidity in the market, longer-dated
vehicles are now being seen.
'Commodity hedges on the exchanges a couple of years ago were only going out
three to six months forward. Now, in the OTC market, hedges are extending
one, two and three years forward and beyond, which has had a fundamental
impact on the forward curve,' says Mr Murphy, at J P Morgan.
A strong and active domestic futures market is also important for the banks
to lay off their own counterparty risk.' A liquid futures market is not
essential to structure a commodity hedge. But if we move away from products
that don't have a good underlying futures market, then we get into basis
risk, and our prices have to reflect this,' says Mr Sekse, at Chemical Bank.
And if there are options on the future, he/she can buy and sell volatility
and do his/her own delta hedging without fear of getting squeezed. But even
though commodity swaps can provide a relatively cost-effective and flexible
method to hedge raw material prices, some corporates are still wary.
For example, Mr Sekse advised photographic film manufacturers on the
benefits of hedging the silver price when prices were low. But as soon as
prices picked up, they quickly saw the new levels as unsustainable and
backed-off the hedge, expecting the next move in prices to be down.
Mr Sekse had more success with frozen orange juice swaps used by fruit juice
processing companies. The juice processors locked in at a rate of just under
Dollars 1.00 a lb earlier this year, against a price now of around Dollars
1.30 a lb. But some of the manufacturers wanted to take profits, despite
having hedged for 1994, believing again the higher price wouldn't be
sustained.

causes new anxieties - Antonia Sharpe examines foreign exchange risk

MOST COMPANIES think nothing of paying large premiums year after year to
insure their factories or offices even if, so far, they have never burnt to
the ground.
Yet many are only just coming round to the idea of paying similar amounts to
protect their earnings against events beyond their control, such as
volatility in the foreign exchange markets.
European companies were starting to think that currency fluctuations were a
thing of the past while the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was
performing in line with their expectations.
However, the exit of sterling and the lira from the ERM in September 1992
and the virtual collapse of the system in August this year, when some
currency bands were widened to 15 per cent, has sent many corporate
treasurers back to the drawing board.
'Companies are now worrying more about foreign exchange risk than before the
collapse of the ERM,' says Mr Albert Maasland, the European head of foreign
exchange sales and marketing at Chase Investment Bank in London.
While the ERM was running under its old format, companies were content to
use the D-Mark as their main hedging currency against the other leading
global trading currencies, since the German currency was effectively the
proxy for all the other European currencies.
But after the ERM bands widened, this was no longer the case and companies
could not take it for granted that the ERM would provide them with adequate
protection. Consequently, they are having to hedge themselves against a far
bigger number of currencies.
This has led to a big increase in the trading volume between the leading
world currencies and the less active European currencies. For example,
trading in the yen against the Belgian franc has increased substantially in
the last few months.
The improved volume is actually working in favour of companies, because the
greater liquidity in such currency crosses has improved pricing and the
execution of larger transactions.
In addition, now that the ERM no longer provides blanket protection against
a wide range of currencies, banks have developed various derivative products
which are designed to do just that.
Bankers report that volume in derivative products has increased
dramatically, because corporate treasurers agree that it is probably more
dangerous to do nothing about a currency exposure than to devise appropriate
hedging strategies.
In addition, there is a consensus that the heavy currency-related losses
suffered by Allied-Lyons, Shell and Adam and Co, the private bank since
taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland, highlighted the inadequate controls at
those companies and not that the hedging instruments were at fault.
These derivative products, which tend to be traded more actively over the
counter than on the exchanges, can be tailor-made to each company's
individual needs. Their main attraction is that they offer companies a
cheaper and more efficient way to hedge themselves against several
currencies.
One product which is becoming increasingly popular is the 'basket' option,
which has been used for many years in the equity markets. It has since been
developed to provide a lower-cost hedge for multiple currency exposures
against one or more 'base' currencies.
Such products are also being used by European companies which are trading
more actively in the emerging markets, especially in Asia. Bankers say there
is active two-way business in this area, because companies in the emerging
markets are also keen to use derivatives to hedge themselves.
Even companies that only do business in their domestic market are
increasingly exposed to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market
following the collapse of the ERM.
UK companies were among the first to become aware of the indirect danger to
their earnings, shortly after sterling started to fall against other
European currencies.
Although sterling's depreciation was seen as a godsend for the country's
exporters, it has created a series of problems for companies in the domestic
sector.
Mr Les Halpin, managing director of Record Treasury Management, a UK company
which advises corporate clients on how to manage currency risk, gives the
example of confectionery manufacturers who are having to pay far more for
their raw material, sugar.
The intervention price of sugar in the European Community is denominated in
the European currency unit (Ecu). Sterling's fall against the Ecu, combined
with changes in the EC's agro-monetary regime, resulted in UK confectionery
manufacturers having to pay more for their sugar.
However, they were unable to pass on their higher raw material costs to
their customers, because of the pricing war among the various supermarkets.
Their profit margins suffered as a result.
'These companies suddenly woke up to the fact that they faced foreign
exchange risks even though they were totally focused on the UK domestic
market,' says Mr Halpin.
One solution offered to a company in this situation was to undertake a
series of foreign exchange deals, whereby it would be short of sterling when
the currency was going down and be in a neutral position when sterling was
going up.
'By using straightforward financial instruments these, companies can create
a suitable risk profile,' says Mr Halpin.
Some manufacturing companies that export their products neutralise any
competitive disadvantages resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations by
buying parts for their products in the countries of their principal rivals.
For example, a UK car company is known to buy German gear boxes, one of the
most expensive components in a car, so that it can compete on a more equal
footing with German car companies both at home and in the export market.
Companies which have been doing business in many countries for decades have
not been greatly affected by the turmoil in the ERM, because they have been
structured in such a way as to minimise the impact of foreign-exchange
movements on their earnings.
For example, BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance group,
has decentralised its operations, to enable most currency transactions to be
handled locally.
'BAT tends to be fairly large in the local economies, so we have the ability
to take quality decisions locally,' says Mr Richard Desmond, the group's
corporate treasurer. 'As a result, our exposures are not great.'
However, BAT also has a centralised 'netting' process, so that its foreign
subsidiaries can set off any currency exposures which they might have
against one another. 'We have an information system which lets us know
exactly what the general exposures are in the group,' says Mr Desmond.
BAT's non-remitted profits are not hedged, since they are kept by the local
companies to build up their asset base. However, cashflows to the centre are
managed actively by BAT's in-house treasury team of five professionals. BAT
uses an average rate to translate foreign exchange earnings, but also uses
options strategies to help reduce risk.
