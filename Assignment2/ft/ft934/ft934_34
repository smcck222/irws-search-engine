FT  01 NOV 93 / Growing labour strife looms across Europe

WORKERS across Europe appear to have taken strength from the spectacular
victory of Air France employees in forcing a government climbdown last week
over cost-cutting plans for the troubled airline.
In Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and France, employers are facing
increasing militancy as they demand job cuts and flexibility in an attempt
to prune costs.
Much of the recent disruption is about job security rather than pay, and it
has been directed at governments rather than private sector employers. But
the wave of protest reveals potentially ominous developments for industrial
peace in Europe.
The decline of trade union power in Europe appears to be no guarantee of
harmony and may, indeed, have the opposite effect. France, the centre of
recent disruption, has the lowest level of unionisation among countries in
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Unionisation is higher in the French public sector than in the private
sector but the weak hold that union leaders have over the rank and file,
even in the public sector, prevented an early conclusion of the dispute at
Air France.
All of the national protests have domestic roots, but the domino effect
seems to be playing a part. In Spain and Belgium in particular, two
countries strongly influenced by France, union militancy seems to have been
fuelled by the success of their French colleagues.
In France itself, while the airline strike has ended, the dispute is far
from over. Fresh negotiations on a new package start this week. Force
Ouvriere, one of the unions which spearheaded the Air France protest, has
threatened further action if the new plan is unacceptable.
Strikes are also threatened later this month at Groupe Bull, the computer
manufacturer, Pechiney, the aluminium producer and several other companies
listed for privatisation. Rail, post office and telecommunications workers
backed a day of protest on October 12 over planned job losses and pay cuts.
In Germany, three factors have combined to raise the prospect of a bitter
autumn and winter of labour unrest: the threat of mass redundancies, efforts
by employers to cut labour costs, and sharp reductions planned in public
spending, not least in social benefits.
The key is the looming confrontation in the 4m-strong engineering industry,
where the employers have symbolically announced the termination of current
wage and holiday contracts, due to expire anyway at the end of the year.
IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, has called for open conflict in
the New Year, in a desperate effort to preserve real wages and generous
holiday benefits.
The temperature is rising in many other sectors.
Last week in Bonn, 120,000 building workers protested against government
plans to scrap their winter lay-off payments. It was the largest union
demonstration in recent years.
A week before, tens of thousands of steel workers protested in the Ruhr
region over reductions in social payments.
At the end of September, 60,000 coal miners demonstrated against the planned
closure of the Haus Aden-Monopol pit at Bergkamen, and two weeks ago,
workers occupied a power station nearby which is threatening to switch to
cheap imported coal.
On Friday, unemployed workers demonstrated in more than 200 towns and cities
across the country at the 'destruction of the welfare state'.
Among the threatened job losses are those of 14,000 at Mercedes for next
year, after cuts of 22,000 in 1992 and 1993. A further 16,000 are set to go
at Deutsche Aerospace. In the machine tool sector almost 50,000 jobs will be
shed.
In Spain, union leaders meet government ministers on Thursday to discuss
wage restraint and more flexible labour regulations but demonstrations are
already planned for later this month over the very economic policies they
are ostensibly negotiating.
'There is no objective reason why what is happening in France and Italy will
not happen here as well,' said a member of the employers' confederation who
is attending the talks.
Faced with rising unemployment, the government wants to peg wage rises over
the next three years to below annual inflation levels.
The unions are adamant that job security should be protected. The issue has
surfaced at SEAT, Volkswagen's troubled Spanish subsidiary, where 9,000 jobs
are to go.
Unrest over wage restraint is highest among 70,000 steel-workers at the
state-owned INI group, following a management decision to delay salary
rises.
In both Spain and Belgium the unions appear determined to reject 'social
pacts' restraining wages, which are ostensibly designed to create jobs. In
Spain, the pact also involves an overhaul of costly dismissal procedures and
in Belgium a reduction in employers' social security payments.

Business leaders in Germany warned at the weekend that introducing a
four-day week in crisis-hit sectors of industry, as proposed by managers at
Volkswagen, could prove counter-productive, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Trade union leaders are divided over the plan. There have been calls for
similar drastic action in the aerospace and coal mining industries to avert
threatened mass redundancies. Yet the unions insist that workers cannot be
expected to suffer a 20 per cent cut in their wages.
Volkswagen begins formal negotiations this week on the option between a
four-day week for its 108,000-strong workforce, or a loss of 30,000 jobs.
In a weekend interview, Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German
chambers of industry and commerce (DIHT), said the four-day week was
'fundamentally a step in the wrong direction'. 'In the future we must work
more, not less, if we want to remain competitive,' he told the popular Bild
am Sonntag newspaper. The four-day week only made sense if it was part-time
working, with a corresponding cut in wages.
Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German industry federation (BDI), said that
German industry needed cuts in real wages, not in working hours.
Mr Klaus Murmann, chairman of the German employers' federation (BDA), warned
last week that a four-day week was no panacea. 'The necessary job reduction
caused by the twin burden of recession and structural crisis may be slowed
down, but it cannot be stopped.'
The four-day week might temporarily relieve the pressure for job cuts, he
said, but it provided no substantial contribution to overcoming German
industry's cost crisis. What was needed was more flexibility in working
time.
However union leaders have rejected 20 per cent wage cuts, - including the
VW proposal.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Saturday night dance that ended in terror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS an all too familiar sight. Tearful women and children laying flowers
at the scene of yet another terrorist atrocity in Ulster.
Last weekend it was the Shankill Road, on Tuesday a cleansing depot in west
Belfast, and late on Saturday night the tightly-knit community of Greysteel
in Co Londonderry was plunged into mourning.
It was business as usual on Saturday night at the Rising Sun bar and
restaurant complex at the northern end of the village. The streets were
bedecked with the red and white bunting of the county's Gaelic football
team, which recently won the All-Ireland championship. That had contributed
to a mood of optimism in Derry in recent months. The county had been
relatively trouble-free in comparison with the rest of the province.
Intensive lobbying from US politicians had brought money and jobs.
Customers were packed into the lounge of the Rising Sun waiting for the band
to start shortly after 10pm when the killers struck. Two gunmen from the
outlawed loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Freedom Fighters,
fired indiscriminately on the customers. Seconds later, seven people, three
Protestants and four Roman Catholics, were dead and several others seriously
injured.
One of those killed, 54-year-old former soldier John Burns, had no qualms
about socialising with his Catholic former neighbours. Although he left the
village several years ago, he always returned for the Saturday night dance
with his wife. She is fighting for her life in hospital.
As a former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, he would have been
considered a target by the IRA. But Mr Burns would never have dreamt his
co-religionists would be the men to shoot him dead.
There was no perceptible mood of revenge in the town, home to a nationalism
moderated in part by its past. It was built in the second world war when
many residents worked for the Ministry of Defence at the nearby Eglinton
airfield.
The 2,000-strong community is a source of support for Mr John Hume's Social
Democratic and Labour party. Sinn Fein candidates have lost their deposits
in local elections.
Mr Brian McCaul, a resident for 20 years, said the community would not be
torn asunder by the gunmen: 'People here go to each other's weddings and
funerals. There would not be any anti-British sentiment around here.'
In yesterday's chilling wind, local resident Mrs Merie Irvine brought her
two children to the scene. She said: 'I just feel that it is important to
educate our children so that they know what is going on. I can't see any
point in shielding them from what is happening where they live.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / De Klerk concedes ground to ANC over constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA's ruling Nation-al party appears to have abandoned its demand
for a constitutionally enshrined veto in a government of national unity to
be headed by Mr Nelson Mandela if his African National Congress wins the
country's first all-race general election next April.
Joint proposals, which will be incorporated in a draft of the constitution
due to be released today, show that the government has given substantial
ground in its negotiations with the ANC on a new constitution. The National
party would have little constitutionally entrenched power to block majority
decisions.
In an earlier draft, the party was guaranteed what amounted to a veto in the
areas of budget, finance and security.
The proposals call for multi-party power sharing in a five-year national
unity government. However, the long-ruling National party, which speaks for
minority interests and is likely to come second in next year's elections,
now seems to have accepted a form of voluntary rather than enforced power
sharing, with President F. W. de Klerk appearing to rely on assurances from
Mr Mandela that fundamental decisions will not be taken without his
approval.
If the ANC wins the general election set for next April, Mr Mandela would
become president of South Africa. Unless National party electoral support is
drastically eroded, Mr de Klerk is likely to become second deputy president,
alongside a first deputy president also from the ANC.
If Mr de Klerk disagrees with the ANC, he can try to muster support from
allies to outvote it in the cabinet. He is likely to need 40 per cent
support to block the ANC, which still might not guarantee him automatic veto
power.
Dissent surfaced within Mr de Klerk's National party about the outcome of
the talks. One influential party member said the proposals would leave the
party 'at the mercy of the ANC'.
The proposals also offer only limited powers to provincial assemblies. They
are likely to reinforce fears of many whites and harden the opposition of
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom party which demands a
quasi-independent status for Natal province, the IFP stronghold.
The IFP and its white partners in the right-wing Freedom Alliance have been
given 10 days to respond to the proposals.
Freedom Alliance officials condemned the proposals, released yesterday,
saying they did not devolve sufficient powers to regional governments.
ANC and government negotiators expect to wrap up three years of off-on
constitutional negotiations this week, completing proposals on how a final
constitution should be written, on the composition of a constitutional
court, and on local government. They will then present the document as a
final offer to the Freedom Alliance, which includes the IFP and the white
Conservative party. Negotiators, say they will tell the alliance to accept
the offer within 10 days, or the government and ANC will proceed to
elections alone.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Unionists pressed by Dublin to back peace initiative: Major
condemns 'act of butchery' after seven die in pub massacre

THE IRISH government stepped up pressure on Unionist leaders yesterday to
join round table talks on the province's future in the wake of Saturday's
murder of seven people by the Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to
allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co
Derry.
But the peace initiative launched by the British and Irish governments was
rejected yesterday by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was close to
civil war.
Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the past nine days in a
cycle of violence provoked by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast,
which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer
was shot by the IRA in Newry.
Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative. 'As
long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the present status
to remain, that's the way it will be.'
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to arrange a
series of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months.
But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by Mr John Major and Mr
Reynolds in Brussels on Friday was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for
a united Ireland laid out last week by Mr Spring. Whoever it was aimed at,
it was not aimed at Unionists because it is adopting a nationalist agenda'.
However, UK ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James
Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made
no public comment.
The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes
to parliamentary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr
Molyneaux to join the talks. The government is moving to set up a Commons
committee on Ulster and may also end the use of non-amendable orders in
council for Northern Ireland legislation.
Other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home affairs
spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception'.
Mr Major, who is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the
Commons today, said the killings were 'another evil act of butchery in which
members of both communities were mown down'. He said: 'I appeal to all the
people of Northern Ireland to show no tolerance to the gunmen and the
bombers.' Mr Major is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from
the proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, and
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Mr Hume said yesterday that the SDLP-Sinn Fein proposals remained the best
prospect for peace. He said it was 'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams
proposals had been dismissed by the London and Dublin. Mr Hume accused Mr
Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals.
Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major.
However, the prime minister has said before that he is willing to meet party
leaders, including Mr Hume, at any time.
The British government is determined not to be seen to be talking to the IRA
through Mr Hume, but is also keen not to undermine Mr Hume's position as a
leader of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland.
The prospects for the Anglo-Irish initiative will become clearer this week
when Mr Spring meets Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in
Belfast.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Queens Moat chief blames management style for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDREW COPPEL, chief executive of Queens Moat Houses, yesterday laid the
blame for a Pounds 1.04bn pre-tax loss last year at the hotel group firmly
on the management style, which may have left its board seriously short of
information it needed to monitor the group's health.
Mr Coppel refused to exonerate the non-executive directors, who have been
criticised for failing to see the unfolding crisis that led to the year's
largest corporate failure.
He emphasised that source of the company's problems was the management's
style.
He said: 'Whatever is the view of the non-executive directors, the fact is
that there were serious shortcomings in the executive management of the
business, and this is the source of the company's problems.'
Mr Coppel said Queens Moat would have had to refinance its debts even
without the Pounds 803.9m write-down on the value of the hotel group's
properties, the main factor behind the loss. The real handicap was that the
company made no trading profits in 1992 with which to pay a Pounds 100m
interest bill.
Mr Coppel's remarks will reinforce a view emerging among City observers that
Queens Moat's advisers and non-executives for some time may have been
seriously short of detailed information they needed to check on the health
of the business.
In the past decade, the business expanded rapidly, financed by high levels
of debt and several rights issues. Senior executives brought in over the
summer believe the company lacked basic financial controls.
The hotel group built up by Mr John Bairstow, an aggressive 1980s
entrepreneur, may be investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The company's new management is considering legal action against its former
advisers and directors, possibly over allegedly unlawful payments of
dividends.
Mr Coppel said the entire board had offered to resign when he became chief
executive in July. He asked Mr David Howell, the former cabinet minister, to
stay on as a non-executive to smooth the transition to a new board and to
help organise the refinancing of the company's Pounds 1.2bn of debt.
He said Mr Howell had been 'very useful and approved the reference of
certain matters to the Department of Trade and Industry'.
Nevertheless, investors in Queens Moat are likely this week to question the
property valuations that are the main reason for the loss. A valuation
concluded by Jones Lang Wootton in August for the new board valued Queens
Moat's properties at Pounds 861m on December 1992.
Only five months earlier, the group's former valuers, Weatherall, Green and
Smith, had produced a draft valuation of Pounds 1.35bn for the same assets.
WGS had valued the group's properties at Pounds 2bn in early 1992.
Both valuations followed guidelines laid down by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors.

FT  30 OCT 93 / How To Spend It: A catalogue of charitable ideas - Lucia van
der Post explains how to help a good cause and give pleasure to your friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS is coming . . . and the catalogues are getting fat. For all those
who believe in planning and plotting it is time to sit down with pen and
pencil and send off for the catalogues of your choice.
For those who prefer to spend their hard-earned pounds where they believe
they will do the greatest good, here is a list of some of the best-known and
most deserving charities that you could support this Christmas:
Notting Hill Housing Trust, 26 Paddenswick Road, London W6 OUB. Tel:
081-563-5000. Catalogue free or available from any of the 13 trust shops.
A charity that aims to help house those most in need. Although it manages
some 10,000 homes, there are still about 37,000 homeless families in London.
The catalogue is very small - useful for those who do not like being
confronted with too much choice - well-edited and offers a few really
attractive presents at good prices. Camel candlesticks, 40cm high (sketched
here) are Pounds 7.99 each and there is an equally attractive elephant and
fish version.
There is a charming pure white cotton night dress, (Pounds 21.99), cotton
lace cushions covers at Pounds 7.99 and pillowcases at Pounds 10.99.
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Freepost, PO Box 48, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14
1BR. Tel: 0283-512040 for a free catalogue.
Many people's favourite charity, here supporters can buy most of their
Christmas essentials - from crackers (much better designed this year) to
cards, papers (look out for a particularly chic black and gold design),
ribbon and decorations to plum pudding and fruit cake.
When it comes to presents there is nothing very beautiful but quite a lot
that is useful - a wooden indoor croquet set (Pounds 34.95) would be handy
for the country-house set, fleecy-lined slippers (Pounds 12.99) useful for
those who live in draughty houses and the AA Guide to Short Walks to Country
Pubs (Pounds 8.99) could inject some fun into the life of ardent
fell-walkers.
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital Fund, PO Box 20 Tanners Lane,
Barkingside, Ilford, Essex 1G6 1QQ. Tel: 0268-288577. Catalogue free.
As many already know, this charity helps towards the treatment and care of
seriously ill children from all over the UK. A small selection of the
Christmas staples - cards, crackers, wrapping paper et al - and an equally
small selection of presents. Choose from a wooden two-piece duck clothes
brush (Pounds 9.95), a set of carpet bowls (Pounds 25.95), mystery games
(Pounds 15.99), key-rings, pens and the like.
Oxfam Trading, Murdock Road, Bicester, Oxon OX6 7RF. Tel: 0869-245011 for a
free catalogue.
Profits from catalogue sales go to help local craftsmen and women in poor
areas of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year's profits
helped to start marketing initiatives in India, a shop in Thailand, training
in Sri Lanka and Bolivia and a refuse cart in El Salvador. Lots of colourful
ethnic crafts ranging from a brilliantly coloured cotton canvas director's
chair (Pounds 39.95) to a tapestry kit based on Oriental rug designs (Pounds
37.95).
Levels of taste vary so there ought to be something for everybody.
Particularly appealing were the decorative Peruvian mirror (Pounds 25.95),
charming safari mugs 9Pounds 7.95), some wonderfully old-fashioned striped
pure cotton tea-towels from South India (Pounds 5.70), rugs from Kashmir,
Peru and Pakistan, and quite a good selection of toys. There is a separate
catalogue which features its cards, wrapping paper, calendars and diaries -
available from the address above.
NSPCC Trading Company, PO Box 39, Burton-on-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel:0283-510111. Catalogue free.
Big selection of Christmas cards, papers and gift tags, and a useful, if
unexciting, selection of presents - personalised pens, aromatherapy oils,
scented drawer liners and hangers, luggage straps and cassette carriers. A
choice of gadgets for the gizmo fancier - alarm lights, hand-held sewing
machine, lanterns with in-built alarms and so on.
Brainwaves from Childline, Freepost SU 361, Dept 5317, Hendon Road,
Sunderland, SR9 9AD. Tel: 091-514-4666.
Some really splendid presents for children - from jigsaws to a box of
science tricks (Pounds 7.95), lots of models to build, a working camera to
make (Pounds 16.95), bubbles to blow, old-fashioned clay building kits
(Pounds 45) and traditional games to play (Pounds 22.50).
World Wide Fund for Nature, PO Box 49, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel:0283-510344 for free catalogue.
Cards, calendars and wrapping paper, much of it on a furry note, and a wide
range of animal/conservation slanted presents. A tropical rain forest puzzle
(Pounds 9.99), wooden Noah's ark (Pounds 19.99), duvet covers, cushion
covers, t-shirts all embellished with colourful signs of wild-life from a
dolphin to a complete range of jungle life.
British Heart Foundation, Heart Cards, PO Box 45, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14
3LQ. Tel: 0283-512040. Catalogue free.
Some splendid suitably traditional cards, lots of ornaments, ribbons and
decorations, press-out Christmas books, candles and a rather limited
selection of predictable presents as well - personalised pencil sets, name
tapes, pot-pourri, scarves and ties. For a keen cook the stainless steel
fish poacher (Pounds 28.95) makes a handsome present.
Traidcraft Interiors, Kingsway, Gateheads, Tyne &amp; Wear NE11 ONE. Tel:
091-491-0591.
This catalogue may be slightly less useful as a source of Christmas presents
than for finding well-priced attractive things for the house. It is a
welcome change from the other catalogues, many of which clearly buy from the
same sources, this catalogue has an original, fresh selection of very
attractive things.
Apart from more substantial household objects such as chests and rugs,
wooden cabinets (a charming verdigris finished version for Pounds 44.95) and
chairs, there is a charming selection of appliqued Indian bedspreads (most
children would love the elephant one, Pounds 34.95), a delightful stuffed
fabric doll from Thailand (Pounds 14.95). There are colourful mirrors
(painted glass frames as well as carved wooden ones), a beautiful
hand-painted ceramic bowl (Pounds 36.95) and some wonderfully ethnic coconut
shell salad servers (Pounds 4.95).
Lifewatch, Freepost, SU361, Hendon Road, Sunderland, SR9 9AD. Tel:
091-5142777 for a free catalogue.
The usual collection of sweat-shirts, t-shirts, calendars and notebooks all
on a wild-life theme. Some particularly horrible gorilla feet slippers which
I guess children would adore (Pounds 7.50), some almost as gruesome wind-up
creepy-crawlies (Pounds 9.95 each), silver-plated elephant cuff-links
(Pounds 17.50), a fine owl needlework kit cushion cover and a highly
attractive 1,000 piece 'Happy Animals' jigsaw which should keep the family
occupied during the holiday period.
One or two really rather beautiful things as well - look out for a strong
and simple pewter brooch of penguins (Pounds 8.95) and Malcolm Sutcliffe's
mouth-blown lead crystal glass bowl. For the lazy there is the large mystery
parcel (Pounds 49.95 for at least 10 different items) or a small one (Pounds
24.95 for at least five mystery items) - they come wrapped in splendidly
old-fashioned plain brown paper and string.
NSF (National Schizophrenia Fellowship), 28 Castle Street,
Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, KTI ISS. Tel: 081-547-3937.
A slim little catalogue from a charity fighting for its share of the
financial limelight. Cards and calendars are mostly what it purveys but some
white, silver and gold crackers at Pounds 12.50 per box seem generously
filled (address books, sewing kits, mini torches etc) and elegantly
contrived.
Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People, Leatherhead Court,
Leatherhead, Surrey, KT22 OBN. Tel:0372-842204.
Another slim catalogue with a selection of cards, papers and crackers for
those who want to support this charity and a small selection of rather
predictable presents (sewing kits, photograph albums, pens and Biros,
eau-de-cologne, boxed bridge sets and the like.
Greater London Fund for the Blind, PO Box 81, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel: 0283-510111.
Cards, paper, ribbons, calendars and decorations and a small selection of
presents. Slippers seem popular this year (anticipating the VAT on fuel?) so
here we have some cosy-looking suede moccasins for just Pounds 10.99 a pair.
Aromatherapy, too, is in - choose from jasmine, camomile, peppermint and
juniper foaming baths or a gift boxed set of four bath oils, Pounds 8.99.
There is a lambswool scarf with tartan pockets (Pounds 24.95), lots of
personalised pens and pencils and what the compilers of the catalogue call
the 'World's Most Difficult Jigsaw' - 529 pieces for Pounds 9.99.
Marie Curie Cancer Care, PO Box 72, Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, DE14
3LQ. Tel:0283-512040.
For those who want to support one of the smaller cancer charities Marie
Curie Cancer Care provides nurses to look after patients at home as well as
funding 11 centres where cancer patients can be looked after around the
clock.
The catalogue offers a familiar collection of cards, wrapping paper,
calendars and crackers as well as some traditional Christmas foods and some
straightforwardly useful presents - woollen scarves, socks, pot-pourri,
gardening gloves, bath oils and a really rather charming matt black wooden
key rack based on the theme of cats, Pounds 5.99.
Shelter Trading Ltd., 88 Old Street, London EC1V 9HU. Tel:071-253-0202.
Nicely produced but very small little catalogue from the charity that helps
with the homeless and badly-housed. Most useful on the Christmas card front
as it offers an exceptionally jolly selection for those who prefer modern
versions of the well-worn themes. A very few presents on offer as well -
beeswax candles, some unexceptional blue and white pottery and some sweet
little wooden puzzles for children.
Christian Aid , PO Box 100, London SE1 7RT. Tel:071-620-4444.
Another catalogue mainly useful for its charming selection of original
Christmas cards - on the present front there is only a selection of
t-shirts, a couple of books and a dairy.
Unicef, 55 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3NB. Tel: 071-405-5592.
Probably the best and biggest selection of Christmas cards - from arty
photographic essays to jolly Nepalese pop-up cards - as well as a small
selection of presents.
STILL on a charitable theme, there are two Christmas fairs that readers like
to make a point of visiting. The Birthright Christmas Fair (Birthright, is a
charity primarily concerned with problems of infertility and the welfare of
newborn babies and their mothers) will be held at the Royal College of
Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists, 27 Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London NW1
4SP on Tuesday from 10am to 5pm. Tickets are Pounds 5 each. There is also an
evening preview on Monday November, from 6pm to 9pm for which tickets are
Pounds 10 each. Tickets can be bought at the door.
The Macmillan Fund, a cancer charity, holds its Christmas fair on Thursday
November 11 at the Royal Horticultural Society's New Hall, Vincent Square,
London SW1, from 10am to 5.30pm. Tickets cost Pounds 3 and are available at
the door.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Minister for a Day: Digging out of little England - Edwina
Currie, a former junior health minister, picks up the European portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWINA CURRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF I were minister for a day I'd probably waste most of it recovering from
the shock. I spent much of my first day last time on the phone to my mother,
trying to explain what a minister really does. I still don't know, but at
least now, were I Minister for Europe for a day and properly equipped with a
magic wand, I'd make one hell of an impact. They would still be talking
about it years later.
For a start I would order the commencement of the next channel tunnel, at
once. The first one is nearly finished and will be packed out from day one,
at least as soon as the French can get their trains running. Our side will
take a bit longer. But already 24m Britons a year stream abroad and the
ferry companies are busy buying bigger boats, convinced that the tunnel
won't pinch business but encourage it. The moment the new hole is packed
solid with sweating weekend commuters we will start demanding a second one
alongside: and that will take years. So I would get digging right away, and
lay the plans for the third tunnel in due course.
While we are at it, I'd make the French TGV compulsory throughout the
continent. It will be anyhow, sooner or later, its silver snakes hissing
through long tracts of countryside carrying passengers at 300kph, so I'm
going to take the credit for it. I said this in Germany recently - after my
train from Leipzig to Frankfurt left an infuriating 20 minutes late without
explanation, which produced some long faces, for the French have just beaten
the Germans for a lucrative contract in Korea.
What is good enough for the Koreans should be fine for us, especially if we
add British Rail's posh grey and pink velour, cheerful Asian ticket
collectors and splendid habit of running lots of only slightly slower trains
all over the place.
And now you can see what I'm planning. The Romans did it first: create
communications links between all your centres, and you foster a feeling of
wholeness, where nowhere is too far away, and everywhere counts. Trade,
commerce, tourism, and friendship all increase with ease of access: nothing
would be a greater unifying element, or bring more pleasure to more people.
I'd add fibre optic cables alongside the rail track and satellite dishes (or
whatever is needed) at suitable points, so that I could use my car phone
throughout Europe cheaply, instead of being held to ransom on a bad line.
And I'd insist that all post be delivered in a day, with no excuses, even
across frontiers: if it takes only 90 minutes to fly from Birmingham to
Berlin, why on earth did it take my postcard four days to get back?
Now I am getting into my stride. Danish teachers would find themselves
herded on to boats headed for all parts of Britain and refused home leave
for five years, until they had taught the British how to speak several
languages at once, fluently and with comprehensible accents. In return,
20,000 British teachers, chosen for their courage in standing up to the
education secretary would be rewarded by equally long-term trips to the
former east Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and points east,
with a brief to stay put until the good souls of those countries had grasped
basic English.
Then, when the European Community has grown to 20 countries with 16
languages - at which point the cost of translation will have overwhelmed the
Brussels administrative budget - the nations will plump for the most obvious
language, which (if I am successful) will, of course, be English.
I liked the idea of a member of the staff of the British Embassy in Bonn:
that the news should be compiled nightly not from the unadulterated
offerings of the BBC or ITN, but from all the main news stations in Europe,
with sub-titles. Most of the time the different reports might be from
separate planets. It would give us all a rude shock, and much to think
about, if we realised how wide the gaps in perception still are between
supposedly friendly countries. Then maybe we would all be driven to
understand before we criticise quite so freely.
One pet project is probably already bubbling in some Brussels bureaucrat's
fevered mind. Gazing at the superb restored buildings emerging from
scaffolding in Leipzig in former east Germany, I understood why Berlin is
still such a derelict mess.
There just isn't enough money to go around, even in the richest nation in
Europe. Heaven knows how they're managing in Prague or Budapest; meanwhile
the villages of Romania crumble from neglect and fine old churches up and
down France and England appeal without hope for funds.
Can't we have a Heritage Fund, a substantial sum year by year, to help save
the architecture and artifice of a bygone age which made Europe great? No
one country can afford to do even their own, yet the citizens of all can
enjoy the results. An International National Trust, if you like.
It could be paid for easily by scrapping the Common Agricultural Policy,
though the French would have to be allocated more than their fair share for
a while. However once they realised that far more people could be employed
renovating Tours Cathedral and the like than looking after subsidised cows,
they would be happy.
Churchill got it right, in The Hague at the first Congress of Europe in May
1948 when he spoke of 'progressively effacing (the) frontiers and barriers
which aggravate and congeal our divisions, and . . . rejoicing together in
that glorious treasure of literature, of romance, of ethics, of thought and
toleration, which is the true inheritance of Europe.'
Yes, that's it. If I get my way, in my one special day, that is what we will
do.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Motoring: BMW, a touch special
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE I was, convincing myself that the only things needed nowadays when
assessing a car were to check the price and look at its environmental,
safety, security and recyclability credentials before making a judgment.
Then, BMW (GB) spoilt it all by asking me to try its latest wares: a 325i
Convertible and M3 high-performance saloon, both with manual gears; and a
325tds turbo-diesel and 840Ci coupe, both automatics.
Never mind what the letters on their boot lids said; for me, they were all
SE models. SE, that is, not for special equipment but for sheer enjoyment.
What is it that makes a BMW - any BMW - a touch out of the ordinary to
drive? The company talks about the cars being an extension of the driver's
nervous system. It sounds a bit pretentious, but it must be near to the
truth because I do find myself striking up an instant rapport with a BMW.
There is an eagerness about a BMW, a desire to please a driver who enjoys
making a car go well without in any way wishing to behave like a hooligan.
The highway, after all, is public. It has to be shared with the less
fortunate driving ageing family hatchbacks. (Or, on the roads behind Nice
where I sampled the BMWs, the occasional out-of-season tourist in an
unwieldy camper van).
The 325i Convertible I tried first was a real south-of-France car. In late
October sunshine, with the top down, it was sufficiently draught-free for
short-sleeved autoroute driving to be a pleasure. With a strongly reinforced
body shell, it felt stiffer than many soft tops, flexing only slightly on
rough mountain roads.
The power-operated top disappears completely. Pop-up roll bars behind the
rear seats, and a massively strong windscreen surround, protect the
occupants' should the car overturn.
The price is Pounds 28,000 but this year's production is sold out. BMW (GB)
expects at least 500 Britons to buy one next year.
Next, a bright yellow M3, a two-door hard-top with a three-litre engine. The
top speed is said to be 160 mph (258 kmh). From 0-60mph (0-96 kmh) takes but
5.4 seconds and the average fuel consumption, should any owner really be
interested, is 31.5 mpg (8.96 l/100 km).
None of these claims can, realistically, be tested during an hour's drive on
mountain roads. What I can say is that the fat-tyred M3 was nervously
responsive to the slightest movement of the steering wheel; cornered with
total security at absurd speeds; and, in fifth gear, trickled through
villages slowly and so quietly enough that the boule players did not look
up. What more could a sporting driver with family responsibilities (and
Pounds 32,450) ask for?
Before going into diesels, BMW always maintained it was not prepared to
sacrifice refinement or performance. In other words, a BMW diesel would be a
BMW first, a diesel car second. Well, if you can afford it, the 325td (from
Pounds 18,950 list price) is the best medium-sized diesel for a mix of
performance and refinement. The 325tds, with an intercooler as well as a
turbocharger, raises the stakes higher still.
It has an extra 28 horsepower on tap (143 against 115); a higher maximum
speed (133 mph/214 kmh compared with 123 mph/198 kmh); and even a slightly
better average fuel consumption of 42.2 mpg/6.7 l/ 100 km (40.9 mpg/6.9
l/100 km).
The 325tds four-speed automatic I tried turned like a polo pony and sounded
ultra-refined. Only a distant chuckle under the bonnet at start-up gave the
game away. At Pounds 22,250, this is the car for the business motorist who
believes in cutting his consumption of fossil fuel but wants full enjoyment
from driving.
Finally, the 840Ci. When first I drove the original V12-engined 850Ci I was
slightly underwhelmed; the handling was not quite right. That was three
years ago and I am prepared to believe that much may have changed.
But my first experience of the 840Ci - essentially the same car, but with
the latest four-litre V8 and, in this case, a five-speed automatic
transmission - was different. It is a wide vehicle, but so sharp is its
handling that it seemed within minutes to have slimmed. As easy as a family
saloon to drive, it swept up and down curving D-roads with panache.
Standard features include traction control, air-conditioning and a
12-speaker stereo. BMW (GB) expects about 100 people to take delivery of a
Pounds 52,950 840Ci next year. If only I could be among them.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Bulls show no sign of tiredness: The dizzying rise in global
share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a dangerous moment in all bull markets when rising prices become
their own justification, when investors find it hard to think of reasons why
shares should not head upwards indefinitely.
That moment is with us now.
As the Dow-Jones Industrial Average reached a new record this week, briefly
passing the 3,700 mark for the first time on Thursday, a straw poll of
investors and analysts produced a striking consensus. The global bull market
still has a way to run, they say: there are no real signs of danger.
'We've got this incredible situation where low interest rates make stock
market investment almost a no-brainer,' says Mr Martin Barnes, editor of the
Bank Credit Analyst, a Montreal publication normally noted for its caution.
This confidence, widely shared, shrugs aside what in normal times would be
clear signs of an over-extended market. Share prices have risen in a
straight line almost everywhere for the past 12 months. Traditional measures
of the value of stocks and shares are starting to flash warnings.
Smaller British companies sell at 30 times their most recent earnings. The
dividend on the average US share represents a yield of less than 2 1/2 per
cent, lower than at the peak of the 1987 boom. German shares have risen 37
per cent in the past year in spite of a worsening economic outlook. The
Japanese equity market, though deprived of the steady rise seen elsewhere,
has stayed well above the 20,000 mark on the Nikkei index even though the
country is heading, on some estimates, for a period of damaging deflation.
Despite these warning signals, three factors lead to continued optimism.
First, much of Europe still stands to benefit from falling interest rates,
with perhaps 2 more percentage points to go. Falling interest rates are good
for stock markets because they will lead in time to higher corporate
earnings, and because they make shares seem more attractive compared with
cash or short-term bonds.
Second, though it is hard to see interest rates falling much further in the
two other main economies of the developed world, the US and Japan, it is
equally hard to see them rising in the near future. The classic credit
cycle, in which falling interest rates lead to higher borrowing and
ultimately to higher interest rates seems unaccountably delayed.
The bottom chart tells the story. In the developed countries, 'narrow
money', the money held for immediate transactions in the form of cash and
current accounts, has been rising steadily, as governments have eased
monetary policy to help pull their economies out of recession. But the broad
measure, a wider definition of money including interest-bearing accounts,
has fallen heavily, and has not yet shown a sustained upturn. It is broad
money that influences future economic activity; because it is so weak, the
normal economic upswing has been constrained.
None the less, the easing of monetary policy is having its effect elsewhere
in the financial system. 'To put it in simplistic terms,' says the Bank
Credit Analyst's Martin Barnes, 'that money has to go somewhere, so it finds
its way into financial markets.'
After the debt binge of the 1980s, both business and individuals are
unwilling to borrow more; and banks have become much more cautious lenders.
Economic activity is kept below the levels at which inflationary pressures
emerge, so interest rates continue low. 'There is too much cash or cash
equivalent which is not producing the returns people got accustomed to in
the past,' says Henry Looser, head of private banking at Bank Julius Bar in
Zurich. 'There is still a lot of pressure to redeploy such assets, most
obviously into the stock market.'
In the US, where this pattern is most obvious, the rush out of
interest-bearing deposits into mutual funds is overwhelming, running at a
rate of Dollars 1bn a day this year.
The third factor underpinning the optimism is the belief in a sea change in
the outlook for world inflation. The rise in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average on Thursday came about partly because the strong gross domestic
product growth reported that day was accompanied by low US inflation
figures: an annual rate of only 1.8 per cent in the third quarter, the
lowest since 1986.
Inflation is low across Europe. Measured in terms of a basket of currencies,
The Economist's commodity index shows prices 23 per cent below their 1985
level; food prices are 31 per cent lower than eight years ago; in nine of
the 12 biggest industrialised countries, wages rose by less than 4 per cent
in the past 12 months.
Is this atmosphere of confidence a sign that the market is reaching an
unsustainable peak? Worryingly, perhaps, few people seem to think so. 'Bull
markets always last longer than people expect,' says Michael Hart, joint
manager of Britain's biggest investment trust, Foreign and Colonial.
That comment was repeated several times this week, itself an indication that
sentiment is shifting from detailed justification of the market's rise to a
more general belief in its self-sustaining properties.
Even if the broad global rally is set to continue, however, there is still
potential vulnerability in a few specific areas. The US market has appeared
over-valued, in foreign eyes, for at least a year: to buy the shares in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index you have to pay for 28 years of current
earnings.
US investors' growing feeling that their bull market is mature has been
reflected in a rush to invest in emerging economies overseas, pushing these
generally illiquid markets up so fast they are vulnerable to any sudden
shift of mood.
Such specific risks aside, there are two more general uncertainties. What if
US interest rates start to rise? After all, long-term interest rates in the
US have been falling for six years, almost exactly as long as the rally of
the early 1980s which ended in the short but steep bear market in bonds of
1987. Though the Federal Reserve expects US economic growth to slow in the
fourth quarter, and there is still no sign of higher inflation there, the
interest rate cycle will undoubtedly turn in time. When it does, equities
will also look less attractive - and the signal could also mark a turn in
sentiment elsewhere.
And what if Europe's recession is longer and deeper than currently feared?
Though the consensus view is for a recovery starting some time in 1994 in
Europe's German heartland, there is a strong minority view that next year
will again bring bad news, with no real upturn likely till 1995. Share
prices may not reflect the damage that such a sustained recession could
cause to Europe's big companies and to its political and social stability.
Still, even people who say, like Henry Looser, that 'the economic situation
in western European economies is much worse than people think' are
optimistic about the effect on share prices - because they believe it will
lead to a faster, deeper cut in interest rates. This form of financial
alchemy, transmuting bad news into gold, surely signals the hour when a bull
market starts to rely on its own momentum.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Man in the News: Blueprint for a banking baron - Alexandre
Lamfalussy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In endorsing Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy to head the new European Monetary
Institute, European Community leaders have chosen a man who shuns the
limelight but who is not afraid to put forward trenchant views.
The EMI, which will have the job of preparing for European economic and
monetary union at the end of this century and is expected to be a forerunner
of the planned European central bank, will be headed by a firm believer in
international monetary co-operation, and someone who has been a persistent
advocate of greater European integration.
He will have little sympathy for the UK government's determinedly
anti-federal European stance, and still less for London's view of the EMI as
a low-key institution. From the Bank for International Settlements in Basle,
where he is currently general manager, Mr Lamfalussy has been scathing of UK
policy in the past. In the early 1980s he dismissed the first Thatcher
government's adherence to dogmatic monetarism, without regard to soaring
unemployment, as being akin to an experiment in the natural sciences rather
than a balanced economic policy.
Mr Lamfalussy was one of four outside experts appointed members of the
Delors committee of central bank governors, which in 1988 and 1989 drew up
proposals for the EC's move towards Emu that became the basis of the
economic and monetary aspects of the Maastricht treaty.
He can claim to have invented the EMI. Mr Lamfalussy was a prolific
contributor to the Delors committee's discussions, writing three special
papers on aspects of Emu. In one, he proposed that EC central banks should
create a joint subsidiary for the second stage of Emu which would centralise
some of their operations and perform certain of their functions. This in
effect was a blueprint for the EMI, although Mr Lamfalussy had in mind a
more powerful body than the new institute is likely to be.
The paper's contents - a mixture of academic reasoning and a strong
awareness of power relationships, the art of the possible and the
technicalities of financial markets - bore witness to his varied career.
Mr Lamfalussy is a Belgian citizen who has moved from academia through
commercial banking to the top of the BIS, the central bankers' bank. A
sprightly-looking 64-year-old, he was born in Kapuvar, Hungary, and fled to
Belgium 20 years later to escape communism. He has been honored with a
barony by his adopted country.
In Belgium, he studied economics at the University of Louvain, Belgium's
premier university for economic studies, until 1953, when he moved to
Nuffield College, Oxford, as a research student.
He combined the careers of a bank economist and academic until the
mid-1970s, by which time he had become an executive director of the Banque
de Bruxelles and chairman of its executive board, as well as a professor at
Louvain. Shortly after Banque de Bruxelles merged with Banque Lambert, he
moved to the BIS in 1976 as economic adviser and head of the monetary and
economic department, becoming BIS general manager in 1985.
With his high forehead and serious spectacles, he looks very much the
academic. As befits a professor, he is precise in his diction, and speaks
perfect, accent-free English. He is famously discreet and would never
divulge anything about the monthly talks among central bankers at the BIS.
Although he has never worked in a central bank, he has earned the central
bankers' respect. 'He is one of the tribe,' says a senior European central
bank official.
In a debate, says the official, he is able to accommodate and bring together
the views of several factions. But Mr Lamfalussy does not believe that
burying his own beliefs is a necessary part of diplomacy.
'If you look at successive BIS annual reports, you see someone who is
willing to go significantly further than most international bureaucrats in
giving an analysis which sticks its neck out, says something substantive
rather than tired cliches and is sometimes quite imaginative,' says Prof
Richard Portes, director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, London.
As one of those rare officials who straddles the world of economics and
finance, Mr Lamfalussy has shown a good nose for defining issues and
proposing solutions, well in advance of the herd. He has been in the
forefront of those expressing concern that the fast-growing involvement of
banks in derivatives could pose systemic problems for the banking system. In
1991, he warned of problems facing Britain from its membership of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
His willingness to stand up and be counted owes much to the fact that the
BIS is not controlled by individual member states. Its ownership, with 84
per cent of the stock held by more than 30 central banks and the remainder
by private shareholders, is sufficiently diffuse to keep carping governments
at bay.
We have still to see how the EMI develops. If Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, has his way, its future will be less than glorious. Other EC
leaders are keen, however, to see it supervise and rehabilitate the European
Monetary System in the second stage of Emu, starting on January 1, and pave
the way for a European central bank.
Mr Lamfalussy is keeping his own counsel on his plans for the EMI. He
intends to use the time between now and the end of the year to work out his
strategy and priorities.
Some commentators have lamented the EC's failure to attract a senior central
banker to head the EMI. But, according to Mr Portes, Mr Lamfalussy's
experience in running the BIS could be an ideal apprenticeship for putting
the EMI on its feet.
Since it was set up in 1930 to manage the transfer of German's reparations
after the first world war to allied governments, the BIS has seen great
changes in its structure and functions. Mr Lamfalussy has succeeded in
carrying on this tradition, putting the BIS at the centre of efforts to
achieve common rules on prudential supervision for international banks, for
example.
'For a long time he has faced the problem of finding roles in life for his
present institution,' Mr Portes says. Now he must find a role for the EMI
over the next three years.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Leaders set out Ulster principles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish Republic prime
ministers, last night set out six guiding principles as they sought to
revive the momentum for a political settlement in Northern Ireland.
For the first time Mr Major spelled out explicitly that his government would
be willing to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into peace
negotiations. He was adamant that this would be possible only if the IRA
renounced permanently the use of violence and demonstrated over 'a period'
its commitment never to return to terrorism.
As both leaders acknowledged the growing pressure on London and Dublin - and
on the constitutional parties in Ulster - to fill the political vacuum, they
said in a joint communique that the first principle of any settlement was:
'The situation in Northern Ireland should never be changed by violence or
the threat of violence.'
They added: 'Any political settlement must depend on consent freely given in
the absence of force or intimidation.'
Negotiations could only take place between governments and parties committed
exclusively to constitutional methods. There could be no talks or
negotiations between their governments and 'those who use, threaten or
support violence for political ends'.
The two leaders then reinforced that condition by stressing that there would
be no agreements with organisations supporting violence. All parties
claiming a serious interest in advancing the cause of peace in Ireland
should renounce the support for violence.
But in language that reflected the Dublin government's view that the
republican paramilitaries must be persuaded to stop the fighting, the
communique added: 'If and when such a renunciation of violence had been made
and sufficiently demonstrated, new doors could open, and both governments
would want to respond imaginatively to the new situation which would arise.'
Pledging to press ahead with their own efforts to secure negotiations
between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, Mr Major and Mr
Reynolds added that the two governments would work together on a new
'framework for peace, stability and reconciliation'. They added that such an
initiative could only be taken by the two governments.
London and Dublin acknowledged the 'courageous efforts' of Mr John Hume, the
leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
But there was 'no question' of the report he had drawn up after his talks
with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, being adopted or endorsed.
Last night Sinn Fein was non-committal on the statement by the two prime
ministers, saying only that leaders of the party were planning to study it
in detail over the weekend.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Mayhew endorses Irish peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night strongly
endorsed the peace plan outlined by the Irish government earlier this week
as a basis for future round-table negotiations on Northern Ireland, Tim
Coone writes.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme he said: 'I don't believe
the principles can seriously be objected to and we want to consider them
very carefully and to see whether, applying those to the talks process, we
can't take that process on and through to success.'
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
said on the same programme that three of the Irish government's points
included proposals made in the Hume-Adams peace initiative.
Mr David Trimble MP, home affairs spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party,
warned the British government 'to be on guard against the Irish government,
which is cynically recycling the Hume-Adams proposals'.

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: Disunion greets birth of the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were plenty of politicians and officials ready to fete the birth of
the Maastricht treaty in Brussels yesterday, but with the baptism fast
approaching - the treaty comes into force on Monday - nobody is really sure
what to call their pride and joy.
The treaty itself is pretty explicit: it plumps for European Union in the
first paragraph. That is all right for grand statements of vision -
President Mitterrand of France was already referring to the Union in his
opening statement to fellow summiteers yesterday - but the problem is that
less integrationist members of the Community find it, well, a little too
federal for their liking.
What is more, the 'old' EC has not quietly been put to sleep by Maastricht.
The EC, set up by the Treaty of Rome, lives on, alongside new joint
responsibilities for a common foreign and security policy, and a common
policy on justice and immigration matters.
Confused? The EC Council of Ministers thought you might be, and some weeks
ago set some of its keenest legal brains to work on a solution.
So far, nobody has, and Community (or Union) officials were keen to play
down the debate yesterday - presumably to avoid accusations that they are
merely fiddling while the Treaty of Rome burns.
* * *
Still on the subject of unions, yesterday's summit was picketed by Belgian
workers, protesting against Belgian government plans to freeze wages and cut
the country's looming budget deficit.
Most Belgians, however, took predictions of traffic chaos as an excuse to
enjoy a sunny day off ahead of the All Saints Day long weekend, leaving the
roads emptier than usual. That did not prevent the unions drawing a
parallel. 'The newspapers were forecasting that we'd mess up Brussels
today,' one unionist said, 'but the real mess isn't here but up at the
European summit - a monetary and social mess.'
* * *
Fog at Brussels airport was considered more of a problem for EC leaders than
the traffic. Flown to Aachen by helicopter early yesterday morning,
Chancellor Kohl decided to forge on ahead of his motorcade. Drawing up 15
minutes late for the summit - after Mr Mitterrand, traditionally the last to
arrive at such events - a shirt-sleeved Mr Kohl fazed the Belgian protocol
experts by emerging from a smallish police car at the head of the
procession, rather than the more ample diplomatic Mercedes behind.
* * *
As a location for the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of a European
central bank, Frankfurt did not get everybody's vote. Some central bankers
viewed the possibility of frequent trips to Germany's financial centre with
ill-concealed distaste. 'I have to admit that the idea of spending much time
in Frankfurt fills me with horror,' said one central bank governor. Some
bankers seemed to prefer the candidacy of Bonn, 'if only because it's more
lively at night' - not a compliment usually paid to the sleepy German
capital. But then central bankers do spend a lot of time in Basle.
* * *
Not much should be read into seating plans at European summits - they tend
to follow the alphabetical rotation of EC presidencies - but yesterday's
arrangement seemed calculated to irritate the British.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and his foreign secretary, Mr Douglas
Hurd, found themselves squeezed in between two smaller powers - Portugal and
Luxembourg - staring across the table at the much weightier triumvirate of
Germany, France and Spain.

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: Treaty celebrations give way to sober talks -
Europe is settling down to the task of finding ways to create jobs and boost
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT WAS our kind of talk,' a senior British official said of the summit's
debate on how to rekindle economic growth in Europe and respond to the
EC-wide unemployment crisis.
Asked whether this special summit was to celebrate entry into force of the
Maastricht treaty on Monday, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister,
said soberly: 'There is one thing to celebrate: that is that now we start on
solving pressing economic and employment problems. That is our major issue.'
But beyond saying that the 20m unemployed the EC will shortly have is
'intolerable', the 12 heads of government were vague on what to do about it.
'Concrete conclusions' are awaited at the December summit in Brussels, when
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, presents his White Paper
on growth, competitiveness and employment.
Mr Delors, and Mr John Major, the British prime minister, made what there
was of the running yesterday.
Mr Delors acknowledged the economies of the Twelve had ceased to converge.
To counteract this, he urged beefing up the 'growth initiative' agreed at
the Edinburgh summit in December 1992 and upgraded at Copenhagen in June; a
labour market reform to cut the cost of employing workers; spurring
investment to boost average growth to 3 per cent and cut jobless levels from
11 per cent to 6-7 per cent; and an investment drive in information and
communications technology which he said required Ecu135bn (Pounds 105bn)
over the next five years.
The Commission president was scathing about progress of the much-trumpeted
'growth initiative'. Only Ecu3.3bn of the Ecu7bn agreed at Edinburgh has
been allocated. One of the few concrete measures to emerge yesterday was a
widening of eligibility criteria, so that more 'national' projects could
apply to a facility designed for trans-European infrastructure networks.
Energy projects, transport equipment and urban renewal were singled out in
the summit's conclusions.
Mr Delors noted acidly that finance ministers 'are not interested' in making
use of Copenhagen's upgrading of Edinburgh: a bridging facility to bring on
stream faster the Ecu48bn in EC regional and structural funds earmarked for
1994-95, soft loans for small industry, and an ambitious European investment
fund. In the conclusions, finance ministers who this week rebuffed Mr
Delors' call for an expanded growth initiative, were instructed by their
bosses to stop dragging their feet on the last two summits' pledges.
There was little discussion of the labour market reforms emphasised in a
recent draft of the Commission White Paper. This calls for more part-time
work and job-sharing, greater wage flexibility including possible dilution
of minimum wage norms, a reduction in non-wage costs on lower skilled jobs,
and shifting part of the social security burden on employment onto eco-taxes
on pollution and energy.
But the tone of most debate across Europe over labour markets enabled Mr
Major to devote most of his speech to hammering home the UK's recipe without
much demur from his colleagues. The UK prime minister said whereas long-term
unemployment in the US was 6 per cent of the jobless total, and 18 per cent
in Japan, in the EC it was 45 per cent of all unemployment. 'A better
climate for enterprise' and jobs needed more flexible working hours; relaxed
minimum wage legislation; reduced employers' social security contributions;
pricing the jobless into work; and better education and training.
Mr Major also made the strongest of the few summit references to the Uruguay
Round world trade reform negotiations, theatened by French intransigence
over farm trade. 'Completion of the Uruguay Round must be our highest
priority over the next six weeks,' he said, referring to the December 15
deadline for concluding the talks.
The absence of real discussion on the trade talks reflected the desire of
France's partners not to push Paris into a corner - at least not yet. The
draft conclusions said: 'It is now more than ever necessary to make every
effort, within the agreed timetable, for a global, balanced and durable
Uruguay Round accord.' But in the final communique, France managed to add a
sentence saying any final agreement would have to take account of the
additional agricultural demands that the EC raised last month under French
pressure.

<TEXT>
EC LEADERS yesterday restored a semblance of unity to the European Community
with a decision to base the future European Central Bank in Frankfurt as
part of a wide-ranging agreement on the location of EC institutions.
But the deal struck at a special European summit in Brussels followed an
acrimonious battle over the division of 'Euro-spoils', including veto
threats by the UK and Spain unless they got the European Agency for the
Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
After several hours of haggling, the prize went to the UK which immediately
praised the deal as creating several hundred jobs and confirming Britain as
a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry. Spain was given two sites as
a consolation prize - the EC trade-mark office and a new institution
responsible for monitoring health and safety.
The summit, chaired by the Belgian presidency of the EC, was called to
revive Europe's faltering progress toward greater political and monetary
integration after the near failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The choice of Frankfurt as the location for the European Monetary Institute
 -the forerunner of the European Central Bank - was seen as a minimum step
towards rebuilding credibility in European Monetary Union after the August 2
currency crisis.
Germany, which stands to surrender the D-Mark under the Maastricht treaty at
the end of the century, fought tenaciously for the EMI.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's argument that the choice of Frankfurt was necessary
to reassure Germans about the loss of their symbol of post-war stability
carried the day over reservations from France and the UK.
The Bank of England said last night the decision was 'a pity, not for the
City but for the EMI'.
The EMI, whose president will be Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium, is the
institutional anchor for the second stage of EMU due to begin on January 1,
1994 under the Maastricht treaty.
With the treaty set to enter force on Monday, EC leaders used the one-day
summit to pledge closer co-operation in foreign policy and the fight against
organised crime, as well as a broad endorsement of the goal of a European
monetary union by the end of the decade.
They steered clear of any new initiatives to tackle mass unemployment in
Europe, preferring to wait for the European Commission's White Paper on
competitiveness, employment and growth which will be presented at the next
summit in December.
They also avoided a damaging row over the Uruguay Round world trade talks in
which France is holding out for more concessions on farm trade. But the
final communique warned of the of the community 'turning in on itself.'
Despite relief that the log-jam over the location of more than 10 new
institutions had been broken, there was also an air of contrition among EC
leaders and a general admission that mistakes had been made before and after
the Maastricht agreement.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Leaders in new drive for Ulster peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE British and Irish governments last night responded to the escalating
violence in Northern Ireland with a new drive towards a political
settlement.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds agreed during talks in Brussels to
speed up work towards a framework agreement to persuade Ulster's
constitutional parties to return to the negotiating table.
They rejected as a basis for peace the conclusions of recent talks between
Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no
question' of the two governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of
the dialogue. That report was passed yesterday for the first time to Mr
Major by Mr Reynolds.
A joint communique, however, released by the British and Irish prime
ministers after their meeting, left open the possibility of Sinn Fein being
brought into the peace process if and when 'a renunciation of violence had
been made and sufficiently demonstrated'. In those circumstances 'new doors
could open'.
At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the
two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the
Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the
'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to
deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'.
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the
stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political
settlement to the province.
Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's
acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to
exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status.
Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by
the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the
aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant
extension of cross-border administration.
But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to
which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into
their own negotiations.
Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that the two sides could not ignore the potential
for a cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the
negotiating table for Sinn Fein.
But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major told journalists that there could
be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those who
use, threaten or support violence'. Nor could there be any secret agreements
or understandings with Sinn Fein or the IRA.
Despite their new determination to fill the political vacuum in which the
terrorists have flourished, the two leaders also acknowledged that an
intergovernmental agreement would not be enough in itself to bring peace.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax credit on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE A self-select personal equity plan (Pep). On my last quarterly
statement was an entry for a tax credit on one of my dividends. The credit
was given at the rate of 20 per cent.
I think the rate of tax on dividends is 25 per cent, but the last Budget
decreed that credit is given at only the 20 per cent rate. A Pep is free of
all tax, so am I right in thinking that this means there is relief at 25 per
cent and not at just the rate at which non-tax exempt funds can claim a tax
credit? Should my Pep have credited me at the 20 or 25 per cent rate?
The Inland Revenue was correct in paying a credit at the rate of only a
quarter (equivalent to 20 per cent tax) on your Pep dividends for the
present tax year, as against a third (equivalent to 25 per cent tax) on
previous years' dividends.
You are wrong in saying 'the rate of tax on dividends is 25 per cent.' In
the former chancellor's speech, printed in the FT's Budget supplement on
March 17, was the statement: 'Finally . . .I also propose to reduce the rate
of tax on dividends from the current basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower
rate of 20 per cent.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TABLE shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in September.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for the month in
which you bought it. Subtract the results from the proceeds of your sale;
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in June 1985 and sold them
in September 1993 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
June 1985 figure of 1.487 gives a total of Pounds 8,922. Subtracting that
from Pounds 14,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 5,078, which is below the
1993-94 CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If you are selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in
September was 141.9.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Police chiefs back diluted reforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of Chief Police Officers yesterday welcomed the home
secretary's ditching of controversial proposed reforms of police pay and
conditions.
Mr John Smith, association president, welcomed Mr Michael Howard's decision
to reject recommendations in the Sheehy report that junior ranks be employed
on fixed-term contracts, starting salaries cut and pension qualifications
changed. Mr Howard also intends to water down the suggested formula for
performance-related pay.
Mr Smith said: 'The home secretary has listened to arguments that we and
others presented. There's much more yet to discuss and to debate . . . We
will be wanting to continue to argue, but we believe with what the home
secretary said yesterday he's taken (the) police service and therefore the
public back from the precipice.'
Mr Richard Coyles, Police Federation chairman, agreed that there was much
still to be debated, with pay rates an important example. He said discussion
of the rates was back where it belonged, in the police negotiating body.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Pay for MPs set to rise by 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to offer MPs a two-year 5.5 per cent pay rise prompted fierce
criticism yesterday.
Under proposals to be debated next Wednesday, MPs would be awarded a 2.7 per
cent increase, taking their salaries to Pounds 31,687 with effect from
January 1994. This would be followed by a further 2.68 per cent the
following year. The government also proposes to link MPs' pay to a range of
civil service bands.
The government is this year seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent ceiling on the
public-sector pay bill, and may try to impose a freeze next year.
Mr Michael Bates, Tory MP for Langbaurgh, said: 'It is an absolute outrage.
This is a time when we are asking all public servants to play their part in
having a pay freeze.'
Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, Britain's biggest union, said: 'It
would be grossly hypocritical for ministers and MPs to vote themselves an
increase nearly twice the figure to which public-sector workers are being
restricted this year.' Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union,
said: 'Aren't they the lucky ones? I wish our members had the chance to vote
themselves a pay rise at twice the rate of inflation.'
Officials said the proposed increase was a catching-up exercise. A formula
linking MPs' pay to the civil service was abandoned more than a year ago
when civil servants' rises were made dependent on performance. MPs' pay has
been frozen since then, while civil servants have seen increases of 3.9 per
cent from August 1992 and 1.5 per cent this year. Last year MPs voted
themselves a 38 per cent rise office-cost allowances to nearly Pounds 40,000
a year.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Plaid in PR bid to lift number of female MPs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF THE MPs in a future Welsh parliament must be women, Mr Dafydd Wigley,
the Plaid Cymru president, said yesterday.
The Welsh Nationalist leader said that an incoming Labour government or a
Liberal Democrat/Labour pact should use a voting system based on
proportional representation to ensure 'near parity' between men and women
members.
It is expected that a Welsh parliament would be set up in the first year of
an incoming Labour or Liberal Democrat/Labour government.
Plaid Cymru, debating the issue at its annual conference in Cardiff, is
pressing for a chamber made up of two MPs - one man and one woman - from
each of the 38 constituencies in Wales, plus additional elected members, to
give a total of about 100 members.
In his address to the conference - which earlier this week launched a
campaign to put independence back on the political agenda - Mr Wigley, MP
for Caernarvon, gave his support to proposals for a two-stage drive towards
self-government for Wales.
On the last day of the three-day conference today delegates will debate
calls for a Welsh parliament with law-making and financial powers to take
over responsibility for all functions which are currently undertaken by the
Welsh Office and about 80 quangos - such as the Welsh Development Agency.
The second more controversial step, setting up a fully self-governing Welsh
republican state in Europe, would be put to Welsh voters five years later.

<TEXT>
THE leaders of four German states (Lander) are to meet the chief executives
of Daimler-Benz and its subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to try to head
off mass redundancies and plant closures by Germany's principal aerospace
contractor.
The meeting, at the initiative of Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian prime
minister, is on November 12. It will bring together Mr Edzard Reuter of
Daimler-Benz, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, his colleague at Dasa, as well as Mr
Gerhard Schroder, the premier of Lower Saxony, Mr Stoiber, and the mayors of
the city states of Bremen and Hamburg.
All the states have important Dasa plants, several involved in manufacture
of the European Airbus and now threatened with closure in the drastic
rationalisation programme announced by Mr Schrempp last week. The company is
to shed 16,000 jobs from its 80,000-strong workforce by the end of 1996, and
close six plants, while seeking outside buyers for three further plants.
The biggest plants affected are the Airbus Lemwerder works outside Bremen,
with 1,150 expected redundancies, and the Airbus factory at Munich-Neuabing,
with 1,200 job losses.
Both Bavaria and Lower Saxony have offered subsidies to keep the plants
open, but Dasa insists it has no plans to amend its cuts.

FT  30 OCT 93 / British Gas and Tenneco win Chilean pipeline deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS and Tenneco Gas of the US were yesterday awarded a contract to
operate a Dollars 1.65bn project to pipe natural gas from Argentina to
Chile.
The 1,200km pipeline, which would transport gas from Argentina's Neuquen
fields to businesses and homes in Santiago and other Chilean cities, has a
target completion date of 1997.
Chilectra, the project developer and leader of a consortium that has
negotiated a gas supply contract with Argentina, named Tenneco as the
technical operator of the transmission company.
British Gas will take responsibility for the 8,000km distribution network.
The British and US companies beat off stiff competition from other
international companies, including Enron, Lonestar Gas and Utili-corp of the
US, and Transcanada Pipelines and Novacorp International of Canada.
The two companies, which would take out an equity stake in the project, will
undertake feasibility studies before going ahead with construction in 1994.
British Gas's share of the study costs will be less than Dollars 2.25m.
Securing financing may be difficult given the estimated six years of
negative cash flows involved and the 20-year payback period.
The transmission and distribution elements of the contract, not including
three thermo-electric generators, are likely to cost between Dollars 950m
and Dollars 1.2bn.
There is also political risk. Although Chile was awarded an investment grade
rating last year, Argentina's economic stability is still to be tested.
Relations between the two countries, although much improved, have often been
strained - a factor that could interrupt the smooth flow of gas.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Aristide's opponents call strike

<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide called an armed
general strike yesterday which left the streets of the capital,
Port-au-Prince, almost deserted.
The strike came the day before Mr Aristide was due to return to the country
under the terms of a United Nations-brokered peace deal.
Yesterday's action was called by extreme rightists with close links to the
military. The stated aim of the strike is to force Haiti's pro-Aristide
civilian government to reopen petrol stations, which have been closed as a
result of a UN embargo imposed because of the military leaders' refusal to
give up power.
Army chief Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, in an interview on the pro-army Radio
Liberte, said Mr Aristide had overstepped the terms of the peace accord by
calling for the resignation of the army high command and police chief Joseph
Michel Francois.
The impasse over Mr Aristide's return and deteriorating conditions in the
country have led many ordinary Haitians to try to flee the country. Ships
enforcing the embargo have intercepted two refugee boats this week carrying
a total of 43 people. Fifteen people sent back were promptly arrested by
armed men.
The Dominican Republic, with which Haiti shares a border, has traditionally
offered an avenue of escape in times of crisis. This week, however, the
Dominican government has been repatriating thousands of Haitians, including
people who have lived there for decades, and even black Dominicans suspected
of having Haitian descent. Although President Joaquin Balaguer of the
Dominican Republic has said that the deportations would stop, the message to
prospective Haitian refugees is clear: they are not welcome.
The deportations might serve another purpose. According to Mr Ruben Silie,
an expert on Haitian-Dominican relations at the Technological Institute of
Santo Domingo, they 'are a clear signal to the Clinton administration that
the Dominican Republic is not prepared to pay the costs of US policy in
Haiti.'
With traditional channels of escape being closed, desperate Haitians can be
expected to seek refuge in other shores.
Britain could soon find itself drawn into the crisis. The Turks and Caicos
Islands, a British protectorate, has been also receiving Haitian refugees.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Private View: The savage in the three-piece suit - What
drives an English gentleman to spend five harsh years wandering in the
desert with the bedouin? Wilfred Thesiger, one of the last of the great
explorers, considers his craving for adventure among the world's most
isolated tribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GENTLEMAN nomad, a tribesman in a three-piece suit: Wilfred Thesiger is
oxymoron personified. In London he carries a furled umbrella, at home in
Africa a spear.
This ascetic, upper-class Englishman is one of the last explorers to have
filled in the globe's blank spaces: you can see the desert etched into his
face. Though 83, he is as tall, lean and straight-backed as the Samburu
warriors of northern Kenya among whom he lives.
Wilfred Thesiger is a glorious anachronism. Where others only uttered their
hatred of the modern age, Thesiger lived his. Where others only dreamed
their adventures with the help of Kipling, Conrad or Buchan, Thesiger went
out and created his own.
His exploits are well known: he has described them in his own spare prose
and vivid black-and-white photographs. At 24 he was the first European to
survive a journey among the Danakils of Abyssinia, tribesmen who showed off
by killing and castrating their neighbours. He twice crossed the Empty
Quarter of southern Arabia by camel. He lived for years with the marsh Arabs
of Iraq (now being exterminated by Saddam Hussein). His only regret, he
said, was that he did not see Tibet before its desecration.
Can the mind of an explorer be mapped?
I met Wilfred Thesiger at his Chelsea flat during one of his rare visits to
London and asked him if he understood why he had been so determined to risk
his neck.
'No, I don't. I mean, in a sense it was born into me.' As a child in
Abyssinia, where his father was head of the British legation, he had been
mesmerised by the savage splendour of a tribal victory parade. 'Then I
wanted to hunt, and to get into areas that were virtually unknown, among
tribes which hadn't any contact with the outside world.'
Nowadays, I said, people would look for a deeper psychological explanation.
'I wouldn't know anything about that.' He smiled. But he described as
'decisive' the experience of being sent home to St. Aubyn's prep school in
Rottingdean, near Brighton.
'I arrived a friendly, forthcoming little boy, I think, and immediately I
started telling stories about tiger hunts (in Jaipur with his uncle, Lord
Chelmsford, then Viceroy of India) and being taken to see the British guns
firing on the Turks near Aden, and I was regarded as a complete little liar.
I was in a sense rejected by the other boys and driven back on myself.'
You escaped into the wilderness because you could not feel at home in your
own country?
'I didn't think in those terms.'
Is there any explanation you have heard applied to you that you accept?
'No. I haven't discussed it like this before.' He added: 'What it did do,
this rejection by my contemporaries, it spoiled Eton for me to some extent.
Even there I was suspicious of the other boys and I think slightly
aggressive.'
He was not popular, and that perhaps was why he preferred to travel with
Arabs or Africans, avoiding other Europeans. (He introduced Gavin Maxwell to
the marsh Arabs. The trip was not a success).
'When I was in Arabia my great aim was to get on to level terms with these
people, to live as they did, meet the challenges of the desert on equal
terms. I wanted no concessions. I think to that extent I won their respect,
and the result was that three or four of them identified themselves with me
and were prepared to take very considerable risks.'
The respect you earned from the bedouin made up for failing to win it at
school?
'Again, I wouldn't be thinking in those terms. But I think it probably did.'
But why, I asked, does a man choose such extraordinary physical privations:
the starvation, the thirst, the tedium? It's almost masochistic.
'No, it was a life that tested one to the full. It was this desire to meet a
challenge, to be tested to the full.'
Thesiger had risked his life hunting lion but it was the hardship of five
years in Arabia that forged him, he said, and the nobility of the desert
nomads that fired him.
'All Arabs want to excel, to be known as more generous, more hospitable,
brave and so on. Because it was a small society on the move everything was
known. If you distinguished yourself it was 'God whiten the face of
so-and-so'. If you behaved badly it would be heard everywhere.'
You felt obliged to undergo this test?
'It was what satisfied me. I don't feel obliged to do it. When I went to the
marshes, the Arabs didn't match up to the bedou in that sort of way. I
enjoyed being with them, but the challenge was gone.'
Perhaps, like the hermits of old, he went into the desert to meet his God.
But no. Thesiger does not believe in a Creator, only some fundamental
physical law. He went to the desert for companionship and for 'the dunes of
silence.'
'Without the bedou it would have been a meaningless penance. If I had gone
off to the North Pole I might have got associated with the Eskimos. If I had
gone to the South Pole the penguins wouldn't have satisfied me.' He laughed
like one who rarely makes jokes.
Thesiger was a 10-year-old at prep school when his father died suddenly. His
mother became obsessively devoted to her four boys. Was this a classic
recipe for . . . ? I broke off as the old man leaned forward to point to the
framed photograph of a beautiful woman: 'There she is, you see.'
Again I elaborated the theory of the absent father and devoted mother and
said: Does that make any sense to you?
'No, it all sounds complete nonsense. I mean, it wasn't anything to do with
my father not being there that I had to go off and do the things I'd wanted
to do while he was still with me.'
The elegant clubman opposite said he felt no affinity with England, a
country he has not lived in for 60 years, since his Oxford days. And he is
going blind. 'I couldn't bear coming back to England, going into a sort of
old man's home for the blind. I'd rather live out in Kenya and be led about
by them on a stick.' He smiled ruefully.
He shares a mud and timber house with his adoptive Samburu family, helps
officiate in circumcision rituals and - a former boxing Blue - teaches boys
to box.
You never wanted a family yourself?
'No. To have married and everything would have crippled me - there was a
girl once I was attracted by when I was almost a boy. Then you have
children, they've got to be educated. I wanted complete independence.'
Thesiger's sexual ambivalence is common gossip. A journalist colleague
recalls meeting the explorer in the Yemen and being shown a box of dried
foreskins. But I could remember nothing in print and had no idea how he
would react to my next question. Thesiger took it blithely.
'I think in a curious way I had very little sexual sort of . . . in either
direction.'
Thinking of his heroes, TE Lawrence and Alexander of Macedon, I said many
adventurers seemed to have been ambivalent.
'If you travelled in the desert as I did, how many times did we see women?
You arrived in camp and the women looked after you. There was a very
attractive girl on one of the wells. The others used to pull my leg about
her. I was attracted by her, but you were moving about the whole time with
men - and some of them were really only boys.'
Hoping it sounded tactful, I asked: Do you prefer boys?
'I suppose in a sense, yes. But I am not thinking sexually. I have much more
an emotional attachment because I know where I am with them. I was a boy
myself. With girls I wouldn't begin to know what to talk about. I mean, I
never have.'
In the past people would leave England to escape the stigma of a homosexual
inclination, I said. Was that your case?
'No, it certainly wasn't. In the sense that I was to some extent - I suppose
I am to some extent - homosexual it had nothing to do with it. My whole
driving thing in all this was exploration.
'No. I lived in a celibate society. I've never had much interest. I find it
extraordinary when people are prepared, like the Prince of Wales with Mrs
Simpson or whatever her name was, to give up everything for another person
like that woman.'
Thesiger had a lunch date at the Travellers Club. When I suggested it was
time to wind up he demurred. 'Ask as many questions as you want. It's rather
interesting, your probing me like this.' So I asked if he had satisfied his
need for the wilderness.
''Need's too strong. Craving. It was an urge, a craving.'
You never questioned where this craving comes from?
'I don't question things. I'm not that sort of person.'
You've had time to think about it, sitting in the desert under the stars at
night . . .
'My mind doesn't work that way. You're giving me credit for being much more
intellectual. I'm not an intellectual.'
So you wonder why I am trying to find out why you do these things?
'I think it's a bit odd.' He laughed, then added: 'Let me say something. I
think this is one of the reasons for all this trouble like football
hooliganism. It's that most young people - young men anyway, perhaps the
girls to some extent . . . I know nothing about 'em - want to meet a
challenge, want to see how they will face up to some sort of danger.
Hardship and danger. I think it's a desire that's almost born into most
people. Now, kicking a football about in Battersea Park doesn't satisfy you,
therefore you join a gang.
'It did at one time reintroduce tribalism into this country: the Mobs (he
meant 'Mods') and the Rockers. Two quite separate tribes, dressing
differently, behaving differently and fighting when they met.
'There's dissatisfaction with a world which gives them no opportunity for
this. So you hang about in the streets, you paint your hair green, sit there
and wait to collect money off Americans taking photos of you. I thank God
that I lived when I did and that I'm not 18 today.'
I have called Wilfred Thesiger a glorious anachronism. But the last word
should go to Lawi Leboyare, the young father in Thesiger's adoptive family.
The explorer was chiding him one day for his love of cars, transistor radios
and pop music. 'Of course,' laughed the young man, 'the truth of the matter
is that you are Old Stone Age.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Travels with a twerp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of our dislikes are rational; others, obviously, are not. Why, I
wondered this week, do I dislike twerpy Mark McCormack with such
resoluteness. What has he done to me? I haven't even met him. I went to his
office once, but McCormack was away travelling. So I was dealt with by an
aide so ridiculously good-looking, charming and articulate that I assumed he
was an android from Planet Zog.
McCormack is rich and successful, but that doesn't irritate me. I am not an
envious person. His company, International Management Group (IMG),
represents a large number of sports and entertainment celebrities, and has
so insinuated itself into the running of sports and cultural events
everywhere - merchandising, licensing, TV programming - that its influence
is all-pervasive. McCormack, I am certain, deserves his success.
The best I can do to justify my dislike of him is to say that I find him one
of the most banal and insensible of all sports commentators (yes, he does
that as well); and that he has just produced one of the worst, most smug,
most gung-ho and self-serving, most risible and stick-in-the-craw volumes of
twerpish twaddle that I have set eyes on in many a long month.
It is called Hit The Ground Running: The Insider's Guide to Executive
Travel, and has just gone on sale at the beguilingly cheeky price of Pounds
15.99. I only hope a copy does not fall into the hands of Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer.
If it does, I have little doubt that Clarke's brain will snap and that he
will vent his fury in next month's Budget by levying a stupendous rate of
VAT on all books and newspapers. And all because of McCormack.
McCormack is, he tells us, a 'global commuter' for whom a sedentary month
means fewer than 10,000 air miles. 'Last year, I logged over 225,000 miles
on business travel - just as I have for each of the past 30 years,' he
crows. 'I have eaten meals in more than 5,000 restaurants on six continents
and stayed in hundreds of hotels in every major city.'
Here is a bit of nonsense from Page 104. In addition to the valuable papers
that must stay with them in transit, and the materials they need to read or
work with, says McCormack, all smart business travellers should pack a
survival kit in their carry-on luggage.
'This small bag of 'travel insurance' might include: a fresh shirt;
prescription medicines; personal toiletries, including a toothbrush,
deodorant, make-up, razor, comb, hairbrush, shampoo and compact hairdryer;
tissues; aspirin; spare contact lenses or eye-glasses; a change of socks (or
pantihose); a change of underwear.'
And here is another bit of nonsense: 'I think the window seat (on aircraft)
promotes clear thinking. Some business travellers think that if you've seen
one cloud, you've seen 'em all. But, for me, looking out over the clouds can
create a mood of contemplation that channels creative ideas to the
forefront.'
Unfortunately, Hit The Ground Running seems to be selling copies. On
Thursday evening I bumped into Miss Lee, my Thatcherite executive assistant.
Miss Lee is a beauty, legs up to here. She was wearing one of the tightest
microskirts I think I have ever seen, and was on her way to a meeting of the
Blue Fuse Club in a wine bar near Chelsea barracks. In theory, the Blue Fuse
Club devotes itself to Tory fund-raising; in practice, Miss Lee and her
cronies drink cocktails and pick up young soldiers.
'Have to dash,' said Miss Lee, breathlessly, 'but everything's ready for
your next trip, sweetie. I've packed you an on-board survival kit: fresh
shirt, malaria pills, toothbrush, deodorant, make-up, razor, comb,
hairbrush, mini-hairdryer, tissues, aspirin, socks, underwear. I've booked
you a window seat so that you can watch the clouds fly past.
'And I've arranged with the hotel for you to have four telephone lines in
your room - lines, not extensions - so that your calls to and from all six
continents can flow in and out speedily and efficaciously.
'I have further informed the hotel that you will require a king-size bed
with choice of pillows; swivelling reading lamps; bedside table with control
console for lights, TV, radio and drapes; a real desk; an ottoman;
coffee-maker; video message retrieval; teleconferencing capability; fax and
computer modem capability; CNN; and in-room private safe.
'Each night I'll send you a 'headline fax' - highlights of the previous
business day. You are up and running, tiger. Mark H. McCormack would be
proud of you.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: Caught by the artist's snapshot - An intimate showing
of Francis Bacon works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTIMATE is hardly the word most would use to describe Francis Bacon's art.
Yet he was in some ways the most intimate of painters. The remarkable
exhibition now at the Marlborough in London, which includes many loans from
private collections, brings out two aspects of his work often overlooked.
First, it shows that for all the larger scale and formulaic presentation
that Bacon came to adopt in his later work, his first and lasting
reputation, in all its strength and expressionist authority, was founded on
images of moderate size. Some of the strongest works are, in comparative
terms, almost shockingly small. No matter how generalised the final
resolution of the figure might seem to be, it was always based directly upon
his response to a particular human presence. The physical immediacy and
conviction of the result was never compromised by fact that he often used
secondary and photographic sources as working references.
The show is of small studies for portraits of the sort he made consistently
through the last 30 years of his life, the earliest dating from 1961. He had
painted heads before, notably the screaming Popes after Velazquez, and the
death-mask images of William Blake, but it was only then that this
particular format was set. He had always responded to the visual stimulus of
the image caught on the wing, the film-still, the snap-shot and newspaper
photograph, and now was clearly fascinated by the serial image of the
photo-booth and mug-shot, with its curious compound of arbitrary directness,
informality and self-consciousness.
The head is cropped, constricted, close up, the subject a specimen beneath
the microscope or victim strapped into the dentist's chair. Here is nothing
of the quality we find in the work of Lucian Freud, for example, or, in its
different way, of Frank Auerbach - of the artist confronting and
scrutinising the model over an extended period, sharing a common space and
temporal experience. Rather it is a matter of the moment, of the fleeting
expression, the half smile, the fatuous grin, the turn of the head, the
trick of the mouth.
The development of the image, too, is a serial affair, coming less from the
particular and objective scrutiny even of the photographic image over a
given and limited period, than from an extended familiarity with the subject
in personal terms. For Bacon worked from few sitters, but tended to return
to them repeatedly - Muriel Belcher, the formidable patronne of the Colony
Room; Isabel Rawsthorne; Henrietta Moraes; Lucian Freud; George Dyer, his
long-time companion; John Edwards, his heir. But, more than any of them, he
painted himself, and while as single spies the self-portraits are no secret,
thus brought together, it is not just their number but their insistent,
cumulative quality that comes as a considerable surprise.
Many of the images are single shots, but the diptych and triptych follow
naturally from the photo-strip, and suddenly we remember that it was by
virtue of that first triptych, the studies for figures at the foot of a
Crucifixion of 1944, that Bacon woke up Byron-like to find himself famous.
He continued to use the device in his larger, more public work throughout
his career. Yet here again, with these small, intimate and private
paintings, we are brought up short, for among them we find particular twos
and threes brought together to make up some of the most powerful and
properly monumental works of the entire oeuvre.
One in particular, a triptych of 1977, of one self-portrait set with two
still-life panels, makes one wish only that there might be a body of
similarly intimate still-lifes to match the portraits. And, curiously, these
characteristically pulled, twisted, distorted, truly manhandled heads and
faces come together as a cumulative whole in celebration, not of some bleak
and dreadful vision of a depraved humanity, but of something altogether more
cheerful. The images are vital and alive, the paint laid on with a sensual
and positive enjoyment, the drawing vigorous and positive. The likeness lies
with a presence not closely described but known and sensed, as it blinked
and, shifted, alive in every broad sweep of the brush across the surface of
the canvas. Oh dear, we say, as we press the shutter, you must have moved.
Francis Bacon - small portrait studies: Marlborough Fine Art, 6 Arlbemarle
Street, London W1, until December 3.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: Why we should privatise the RSC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Shakespeare Company has had a good year. As it unveiled its
1992/93 accounts in Stratford this week, it revealed an operating surplus of
Pounds 128,906, a return of 0.48 per cent on total costs of just over Pounds
26.5m. Many of its productions in both Stratford and London have been
playing at more than 80 per cent of capacity audiences - a fine record by
any standards, especially during recession.
The results of the Royal National Theatre, the nearest analogue to the RSC,
are less satisfactory. It reported an operating loss of Pounds 565,000, or 2
per cent of turnover. But there is no point in making invidious comparisons.
Theatre has its ups and downs. In 1990/91 the RNT had an operating surplus
of Pounds 310,000.
Yet even if the RSC and the RNT had made profits of Pounds 1m apiece, there
would still be bleats about what is to come, just as there were at the RSC's
annual meeting of its Court of Governors on Wednesday. Sir Geoffrey Cass,
chairman of the council, warned of difficult decisions ahead in the light of
possible government cuts in the arts budget.
Prince Charles, who as patron of the RSC chaired the meeting, went along
with him in general terms. He could not understand, he said, why Britain is
so bad at appreciating what it is really good at.
The problem is the subsidy. At the RSC it is down to 38.79 per cent of
costs, against 42.12 per cent in 1991/92. Just over Pounds 8m of it comes
from the Arts Council and another Pounds 1.4m from the Corporation of
London. Those are substantial amounts. The RNT is subsidised even more: in
1991/92, 44.4 per cent of its income came from grant in aid. The fear is
that if the subsidies decline, or even at best stand still, the quality and
variety of the two big subsidised theatres will go down with them. That is
the conventional wisdom.
Yet the more one hears the arguments and looks at the figures, the more one
wonders if the conventional wisdom can be right. For a start, we have been
here before. Laments about a financial crisis in the arts are part of the
landscape. Even if the government bows to the lobbies and allows a little
more money for the arts than it otherwise might, there is no reason to
believe that we shall not be here again within a year or two.
Is it not time for at least the two big theatre companies to break away from
the system? It cannot be done overnight. The subsidies are so fundamental
they would have to continue for a while. But there are possibilities for the
longer term.
Remember that the government will shortly have extra money available for the
arts from the national lottery. It could allocate part of that to pay off
the accumulated deficits of of the RSC and the RNT once and for all, then
set a deadline for when the subsidies would stop, after tapering off on the
way.
It would be a great help if the theatres could could have some ideas of
their own. For example, I can see no insurmountable reason why the RSC and
the RNT should not be privatised. This is not a hostile capitalist device
and indeed is not much different from becoming a co-operative. Many people
might want to buy shares: actors, theatre-goers, impresarios, even the
public. You could revert to the old BP solution where the state held just
over half the shares and the rest were privately owned, or the other way
round. There are masses of variants, including a management buy-out.
Yet for anything like that to happen, there will have to be one radical and
early change. This is in the attitude to seat-pricing. The idea is around
that going to the theatre is expensive. In its annual report, the RSC notes
that the highest priced seat for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford
is Pounds 30, the lowest Pounds 4.50. At the Barbican the range is from
Pounds 20 down to Pounds 4.50. Overall, the subsidy per paid admission is
Pounds 9.54.
Somehow it has become fixed in the collective mind that those top prices are
extravagant. That is nonsense which must be challenged. The basic question
is how much it costs to put on a good show plus some profit, just as it is
for the production of any other consumer good.
If you believe that Pounds 30 is excessive to watch a delightfully
professional RSC performance of Love's Labour's Lost, such as opened in
Stratford this week, think of the frivolities on which you might otherwise
be spending your money: Pounds 60 for a second rate dinner in London, Pounds
30 for a haircut and another Pounds 20 for a book of unread political
memoirs. Something has gone badly wrong between cost and price.
Of course, cheaper prices would remain for students, pensioners and the
unemployed. But the idea that prices in general should be kept artificially
low by subsidy is already damaging and will become even more so as the
subsidies fail to increase. It is a bit like British Rail, where nobody
seems to know any more how the pricing system works and any attempt at a
rise is resisted.
This is the real downward spiral. Unlike BR, the theatre is still efficient
enough to begin to reform itself. It will not do so by bleating.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: The future of Britain's art treasures? It's a lottery
 -Off The Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ANYONE interested in Britain's heritage this was the week of the bad
news and the good news. The bad news came first. On Tuesday the annual
report of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art bewailed yet
again the important national treasures sold abroad during the past year.
The next day came the good news, with the National Heritage Memorial Fund
reporting how it spent its money saving for the nation everything from Old
Masters to rare tracts of countryside.
But, as the Reviewing Committee points out, 'it is an ill wind that blows
nobody some good'. The collapse in the art market over the last three years
has reduced the flow of masterpieces seeking export licences, and only 20
objects were important enough to attract the attention of the Committee in
1992-93 as against 47 in the previous year. Of course British museums and
art galleries are still unable to raise the cash to keep important works in
the UK, and of the 15 objects that the Committee temporarily barred from
leaving the country eight eventually left.
Inevitably they were the most valuable, and included grand Old Master
paintings by Guido Reni, Ribera and Bellotto. There was absolutely no chance
that a British institution could find the Pounds 11m needed to match the
Getty Museum's offer for Turner's vibrant seascape 'Von Tromp going about to
please his masters'. The Committee would have been prepared to let it go
without a struggle but for the fact that it was being sold by Royal Holloway
College. Its export was delayed for six months to show how much the
committee disapproved of the college selling works bequeathed to it in
perpetuity by its founder.
Not that Royal Holloway showed any signs of repentance. This week it did it
again, and is Pounds 3.5m richer after dispensing with a Gainsborough
landscape. The mysterious new owner said he was willing to loan the picture
back occasionally to the College which suggests that it was bought by Sir
Andrew Lloyd Webber, who lives nearby and is the only person in the world
currently paying this sort of price for a British picture.
The Heritage Fund, the Government financed safety net to shore up the
nation's heritage - artistic, natural, and industrial - also had a quiet
year. Its main achievement was securing Joseph Wright of Derby's 'An Iron
Forge' for the Tate with a Pounds 900,000 grant. As ever the 67 successful
applications for its aid, out of a reduced total of 163 requests, included
curiosities: a remnant of wildwood in Huntingdon; the turn-of-the-century
wagon of a travelling showman; and 270 films showing the London Fire Brigade
in action during the second world war.
The Fund needs a quiet time. It is frantically preparing for 1995 when it
takes over the distribution of the heritage pot of Lottery money. It has a
staff of seven and in 1994 its annual grant is a reduced pittance of Pounds
7.8m. A year later it will have at least an additional Pounds 75m to
distribute.
Although the Lottery is aimed at capital projects, and much of the money
will go towards restoring country houses, cathedrals, museums, etc, Lord
Rothschild, chairman of the Fund, made it clear that the money can also be
used to keep important works of art in the UK.
There is an obvious danger that crafty owners might try and arrange sales
overseas at outrageous prices in the expectation that the Fund will step in
with matching sums. The Fund is aware of the danger. It is already concerned
at what it considers excessive valuations put on some of the archives of
historical manuscripts which have come on to the market in recent years. It
has made its displeasure known.
In theory, with new EC regulations shortly to come into force to allow the
return of smuggled works of art; the Reviewing Committee in place to delay
the export of treasures; and the Heritage Fund at last better able to help
museums anxious to acquire artworks in danger, the UK's sorry record in
squandering its cultural history should end. It sounds too good to be true.
The Lottery money cannot arrive too soon. There are signs of the art market
recovering its nerve. The last few weeks have seen a spate of high, indeed
record, prices. Not in London, which seems to be slowly slipping away as the
centre of the international trade in art, but in those places overseas where
fortunes are still being made.
The auction houses see their salvation in south east Asia. This week
Christie's brought in Pounds 12m from Hong Kong sales of oriental art and
Sotheby's Pounds 11.5m, with new collectors from Taiwan, Singapore and Korea
often out-bidding the traditional Japanese and Hong Kong buyers. In Europe
Sotheby's made Pounds 3.5m from Greek and Roman coins in Zurich while the
clear out in nearby Regensburg by Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis of more
than 6,500 lots of high class tat from her numerous palaces raised Pounds
12.8m, double the estimate. As always bidders were prepared to pay over the
odds for a conventional item with an aristocratic provenance.
Christie's in New York managed an auction record for a photographic image,
when Steiglitz's photograph of the hands of his wife Georgia O'Keefe sold
for Pounds 260,458, while London made some contribution, with a high for an
Islamic artifact, Pounds 2.4m for a bronze lion made in Spain around 1100.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: All hail the high prince of horror - Nigel Andrews
pays tribute to the actor Vincent Price, who died this week aged 82
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tingler, The Pit And The Pendulum, The Raven, Theatre Of Blood . . .
Vincent Price, prince of darkness, is dead. Who can resist the ritualistic
mourning incantation? - 'Horror cinema will never be the same without him.'
But of course horror cinema was never the same with him. Never the same from
movie to movie - when would this gaunt actor-chameleon put on his
sepulchral-serious colours and when his self-spoofing motley? And never the
same, seen historically, in the post-war Price heyday as it was in the
earlier era of Lon Chaney or Boris Karloff.
Almost single-handedly Vincent Price created a new realm of Gothic cinema:
one where stomping monsters gave way to silken aristocrats, monochrome (and
often monotone) mayhem to a richly-coloured Romanticism sometimes curdling
into camp.
His best movies were the series of Poe-based films made with director Roger
Corman. Here the damask snarl of a voice - Missouri-southern mixed with
stage-trained Shakespearean elocution - gave us the beat of Poe's taunting,
haunting prose. And the patrician-bloodhound face summoned up all those Poe
aristos, marooned in their mansions as troublesome guests dropped by. 'That
noise, sir? Just my sister trying to emerge from her resting place. That
scream, sir . . . ?'
The only time I ever met Price, it was in his pink-washed villa halfway up
the Hollywood Hills. He already looked frail from long illness. But he
talked for an hour; showed me round his art collection (he has written books
on painting and was once reported to be the highest-paid art lecturer in
America); and rolled out his career history for me like a red carpet.
He was a living half-century chronicle of Hollywood. After early stage
experience with, among others, Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre, he came to
screen fame in the late 1930s as Sir Walter Raleigh to Bette Davis's Queen
Elizabeth I. Then he spent the next two decades working for a connoisseur
series of Mad Directors, including Otto Preminger (Laura, 1943) and Cecil B
DeMille (The Ten Commandments, 1956). DeMille was his favourite: probably
because, like a good horror director, CB expected other people's imagination
to work along with his own.
'He never had a script,' says Price. 'He'd have a Bible on his desk and that
was the script]' The film's visuals were not always
quick-off-the-drawing-board either. 'In The Ten Commandments I had a line to
Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who was playing the Pharaoh and I said, 'Yonder lies
the city of Seti's glory]' And behind us there was this great blank
cyclorama which they'd superimpose the photograph on later. And DeMille
pulled me over and said, 'Vincent, you don't read that line with much
conviction.' And I said, 'Mr DeMille, I don't know what I'm talking about] I
look out there and all I see is a great blue screen.'
'He said, 'You're right, come with me to the studio.' And he showed me what
was going to be superimposed - temples, giant tombs and 13,000 slaves
walking up the Valley of the Kings pulling an obelisk] It was the most
extraordinary thing you ever saw in your life. I went back and read the line
a little more convincingly.'
But not - see the film today - all that convincingly. Price never seemed
wholly comfortable in either ancient or modern clothes. He was to find his
identity in between: in those fin de siecle, quasi-Victorian villains that
came his way after DeMille, multiplying like a benevolent plague in the 60s
and 70s.
'You've really made it in Hollywood when you're typecast,' he says. 'You
haven't made it until they say 'Oh he's the actor to play that kind of part,
let's hire him.' So they hired Price. Again and again. His novelty value was
that he was the suavest, most cultured 'heavy' in the history of screen
Gothic.
'I think Aristotle's theory of the villain is correct. He said the villain
should be a high-born, highly educated, very erudite man. Because if he has
to pay for his sins, we hoi polloi understand that we must pay for ours.
I've always tried to give my characters that kind of elegance.'
Different directors, though, had different uses for the Price charisma. For
years he was pulled two ways by two contrasting auteurs: William Castle, of
The Tingler and House On Haunted Hill, and Roger Corman.
'Bill Castle was a showman. He'd strew his movies, and his theatres, with
these outsize gimmicks. For The Tingler, he wired up the seats with little
buzzers so audiences would get shocked at key moments. And he sent the
actual tingler, which was like a kind of lobster, on a string round the
auditorium]'
Corman was ascetic by comparison. He steered Price through the incomparable
Poe films, poised between refined camp and psychoanalytic fable. 'Roger's a
very erudite man. He used to give Karloff and Peter Lorre and me directions
on how Jung would have approached this or Freud that, and he'd quote from a
book by Krafft-Ebing, and we'd say 'Yes, Roger, but how do we do the
scene?''
The Corman movies gave us the Price we know, and the Price we know gave us
hours of enjoyment screaming away in the darkened stalls. Did he think it is
innocent enjoyment?
'I've been asked a lot about this. You know, 'Is it harmful to our
children?' Well, it's not as harmful as the things that are harmful, which
we can see on every street corner. Horror is a kind of escape. It happens
when you're very young. Your favourite stories are Bluebeard and
Rumpelstiltskin, which are terrifying stories. We start early loving to be
frightened. 'Boo]' is probably the first word children react to, and they do
all their life.
'I've had people come up to me, people my age in their eighties, and say 'I
remember being frightened to death and holding hands with my boyfriend or
girlfriend.' And it's true: there's a kind of intimacy that's brought about
by adventure, and by adventures in evil.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: From 'good morning' to 'hello matey' - Clement Crisp
finds the new chit-chat approach of Radio 3 a real turn-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE a very low resistance to chatter in the morning. An exquisite lyric
about breakfast-time sums it all up: 'Good morning, George. Good morning,
Percy. Good morning, Colonel. Christ, have mercy]'
I suppose that, like many another, I get up to the sound of music on the
radio as I embark on the via dolorosa of ablutions and breakfast. Decent
music helps, which has meant Radio 3 since it began. Brief news bulletins
(albeit no help to the day's travails), discreet voices, minimal words, and
music.
There are moments when lunacy strikes, and a voice promises a concerto for
Jew's Harp by Albrechtsberger (the world's dullest composer). Then you shout
'Oh no you don't]' and switch off. But all in all, until a couple of years
ago, the music, plus agreeable and cultivated voices (Donald Macleod and
Tony Scotland as ideals. And ah, Patricia Hughes, of blessed memory) were
part of the process of greeting the day with something less than a snarl.
Then came Classic FM, and change. I do not think there is any conceivable
rivalry between the two music stations, despite foolish efforts to detect
some battle for audience figures. Classic FM is unashamedly populist,
unabashedly commercial, and tremendously well-intentioned. There is no
snobism about it, no pretentions. Radio 3 remains essentially what it always
has been: our most influential advocate of serious music, of encouragement
for new work, of devotion in promoting an art.
The idea that it is an enclave of intellectual dyspepsia and arcane
performance can only be held by those who do not listen to it, or consider
its schedules and responsibilities. (And, be it said, there are listeners
whose musical tastes are for highest art, and who merit their share of
air-time).
Yet Classic FM's cheery manner has apparently made BBC policy-makers
anxious. How else to account for Radio 3's barrage of chit-chat aimed at us
in the early morning, and in that late-afternoon slot which was once a
helpful way of easing oneself into the matter of the evening - be it
preparing dinner, travelling home, or getting ready to go out.
Adieu the brief announcements and the unemphatic voices. Babble is all.
There is a too-bright young man in the morning who cannot stop telling us
his name: it is like having an uneasy guest at the breakfast-table. (He also
cannot pronounce 'one', preferring 'wan'). There are interviews, oh so matey
and first-namey, with assorted worthies. (One female announcer, her voiced
pitched to tones of direst chumminess, promoted a detestable American
choreographer during the Edinburgh Festival. If the BBC is prepared to do
such commercial sponsorship, then there are many better candidates for
puffery).
Classic FM is frank in its willingness to let people know about music on the
most undemanding terms. Standards are variable: a Beethoven concerto once
consisted only of the opening orchestral tutti, and the belief that the
Yellow River Concerto, a piece of Maoist committee work, is even remotely
music, is open to question. But it plays a wide range of good music, and we
accept the nonsense of the commercial breaks (though I swear I will never
buy one of those sofas) for the sake of the station and its aims. It knows
exactly what it is, and why it is doing it.
So, I trust, does BBC Radio 3. Yet if it cannot be true to its own past
integrity, to its uncompromised standards, even in so slight a thing as
morning and afternoon broadcasts, then trouble looms. The path down-market
is slippery. Cut the cackle, and get back to the musical 'osses.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: Wits at a wedding - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING about English National Opera's 1991 staging of Figaro's Wedding
is shaped by Jeremy Sams's lucid, sassy translation. The first two acts
strike me as among his very finest work. His wit often complements that of
da Ponte's Italian libretto - a barbed, knowing wit that connects to the
spirit of Mozart's opera and the original Beaumarchais play; I love
Susanna's little post-Rousseau feminist remark to the Countess in the Act
Two finale 'We think we are free, but we are always in chains.' Yes, very
free, and marvellously refreshing.
But Sams's tone is unyielding. When his characters have no humour, their
parlance grows less original and closer to operatic cliche ('And my joy has
turned to woe'). It is also during the opera's latter acts that Sams draws
attention to his own skill as a rhymester (army, barmy) and his needless
modishness ('Bye bye, nice to have seen you'). With such strokes he reveals
his distance from the tenderness at this opera's core.
Sian Edwards conducts. Pacing is good, orchestral timbre attractive, words
generally clear. But pathos is missing, and the larger ensembles lack
sparkle. None of the singing has great musical distinction, but Cathryn
Pope's Susanna carries the opera along with a charming mixture of delicacy,
robustness, directness and humour. Arwel Huw Morgan is a worthy,
communicative Figaro, though amid this cast he looks too old. Curiously, his
finest moment occurs simply in listening to Susanna's aria - motionless in
pain, only inches away from her in the dark.
Amid the rest of the cast, only Donald Adams as Doctor Bartolo is
outstanding - a self-important old buffer who suddenly melts into paternal
warmth. Margaret Marshall's elegant Countess gave a very strained account of
both arias. Edgy, pushy singing and lively, inelegant acting from Peter
Sidhom's Count, Ethna Robinson's Cherubino, and Anne Mason's Marcellina. If
embellishments are to be added, they should be more precise; but several
appoggiatture were missed.
Graham Vick's production has been revived by Bill Bankes-Jones. The story
becomes vivid - how well the eye is repeatedly drawn to Cherubino's
commission - and has many revealing touches of manners, such as the way
Figaro and Susanna stand to attention in the Countess's bedroom. Indeed,
every iota of Susanna's comportment is fresh and convincing. But not
everything else rings true. Though I was impressed by the violence with
which the Count treated the Countess in private, it seemed false to their
previous behaviour.
The stand-and-deliver method used in several big arias often detracts from
the drama. When Barbarina sings her 'I have lost it' solo, you want to cry
'Then keep on looking]' Richard Hudson's sets are ghastly. One bright colour
per surface: sheer green versus sheer mauve, and so on. Why seven doorways
in the garden wall? This isn't Bluebeard's Castle. And the doorways are so
narrow the Countess has to enter sideways.
Lord Goodman, a former chairman of English National Opera's board, was 80
this year. His birthday, and his presence on opening night, were marked by
the company's new general director, Dennis Marks, whose curtain speech of
congratulations contained the World's Longest Sentence.
ENO, London Coliseum. Performances until December 16. Original production
sponsored by the Woolwich Building Society.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Arts: Yesterday's crooner - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO 2 is generous to yesterday's favourites. We have Dusty Springfield
this week and also a more interesting one, Michael Holliday, 'Britain's Bing
Crosby', who committed suicide aged 38 some 30 years ago. Dennis Lotis
presented a survey on Tuesday, but did not reach the conclusions I did.
Holliday had a lovely voice and wrongly spent his life challenging Crosby
instead of an opera star like Thomas Allen.
He gave his rich, deep baritone impeccable intonation, faultless breathing,
as much understanding as possible of the shallow songs, and no accent. He
left school at 14, served in the Merchant Navy and the Royal Navy, and
learnt to play the guitar. What musical future for him except as a popular
singer? He was not good-looking and was too unpunctual and forgetful to be
cast in a musical (sometimes he had to invent new words as he sang). A sad
loss of talent.
Mike Harris' Dark Messiah (Radio 4, Monday) takes an unusually strong line
against missionaries. It is set in a Methodist mission in Kikuyu territory
in Kenya in 1929 and its theme is female circumcision. This was common when
I was in Africa in the 1940s: indeed a doctor in Nairobi showed me a film he
had made of the procedure, a purely routine affair, he said. These
missionaries think it un-Christian. When 12-year-old convert Susan (Viviene
Rochester) has to be done to marry convert Benjamin, a chief's son, there is
bound to be trouble - especially as Benjamin's grandmother is against the
conversion of decent Kikuyu girls.
There is interesting detail about the mission even if the missionaries are
dull. Their leader (John Church) has to mediate between the government and
the Kikuyu Christian Association, whose activities grow increasingly Kikuyu.
There is a resident assistant (Gudrun Ure), dealing with African girl
converts. 'Girl-catcher', the Africans call her, and in the dreadful
conclusion that caps the fuss over Susan's decision to go along with tribal
custom, she is held in the sickbed where she is dying of fever and forcibly
circumcised.
Howling at the Moon (Radio 4, last Saturday) was an informed programme on
werewolves, with references to such sources as Petronius and John Webster.
It traced the habit of turning into wolves to the envy of primitive men, who
would dress up as wolves, those exemplary hunters. In the 16th and 17th
centuries there were many cases against people accused of lycanthropy, which
was associated with witchcraft. In eastern Europe the transference took
another line and gave birth to vampires.
Humans turn into horrible creatures in fairy-tales - consider Red Riding
Hood - and such stories go on, mostly for children. So what did we find on
Radio 5 last night but the tale of Eloise, in Joe Turner's Twentieth Century
Vampire, a checkout girl at the Co-op with a vampire Aunty Lucretia. At a
party at Lucretia's suburban castle, she hopes to try her teeth out on Wayne
from the meat-counter. It goes on for six parts, just like any old legend
from France or Hungary, only more outspoken.
If you go for legends, Radio 3 on Tuesday gave a new version of Dante's
Inferno. Peter Howell rewrote it as if Dante (Alec McCowen, excellent)
conducted a bus-load of visitors around the infernal regions. These were
seen afresh in the light of our modern world, and if it seemed cinematic,
that is how it should have seemed. There was ultra-cinematic music from the
BBC Radiophonic Workshop, performed by Serenata Notturna and Singcircle.
First heard in 1983, it was much better than the example they gave us last
week.

INSIDE HITLER'S GREECE
by Mark Mazower
Yale, Pounds 19.95, 464 pages
IN OCTOBER 1944, the streets approaching Athens were strewn with palms and
carpets: to salute jeeps charged with British troops. By December 1944,
those same troops were fighting in the streets against the Greeks they had
supposedly 'liberated'. This is ostensibly one of the most perplexing events
of the last war, and objectively-sketched explanations of it are not easy to
cite. Here, at last, is one such.
Mark Mazower's account of the Italo-German seizure of Greece is often
elliptical and specialised, but it should make sense to anyone with a feel
for truthful documentation, and sympathy for modern Greek political history.
The reason why British Tommies found themselves sniping from the Acropolis
in late 1944 is basically that Churchill misread the extent of Greek support
for the exiled Greek monarchy.
Churchill also underestimated the part played against the Axis invasion by
the mountain-based guerrillas who did all they could to stop the occupying
forces from treating this posting as a holiday. Churchill thought them
reckless bandits, judging them more from external appearance than their
internal organisation, which had a primarily Communist political tincture.
To describe the situation as an 'entanglement', in Churchill's phrase, is to
understate the complex of local impulses right and left. Even British
officers working with the guerrillas were sometimes mystified. What
compounded these tensions were the intolerable economic circumstances
created by the invaders, and the Wehrmacht's policy of local reprisals for
gun attacks. As Mazower points out, the German forces had no experience of
fighting an invisible enemy: frustration, as much as anything else, led them
into a massacres of the innocents.
Sometimes this succeeded in raising local indignation against the
guerrillas; more often, however, it merely intensified partisan support.
There are some poignant photographs here of one such slaughter of villagers
at Kondomari, on Crete; and a telling shift of focus to German headquarters,
where a young officer called Kurt Waldheim translated barbarities into the
language of bureaucratic acceptability.
Substantial differences are drawn between the joint forces of occupation,
reinforcing general stereotypes (to German irritation, the Italians were
considerably gentler in their areas of control, and also refused to
co-operate in the extirpation of Greece's ancient Jewish community). But
what is perhaps most extraordinary about the Teutonic military presence was
its overt philhellenism.
Troops and officers eagerly studied classical remains. When Himmler went to
Athens, it was not so much on SS business as to visit the Parthenon. True,
there were appalling cases of double standards. Some Germans may have been
sensitive to it: their escape route was the ethnic casuistry of bracketing
modern Greeks as 'Balkan', and therefore sub-human.
As I say, this is an objective study. Not all Greeks or British are heroes,
and not every Nazi acts dishonourably. But German behaviour in Greece 50
years ago has living witnesses. You might expect their accounts to be
exaggerated. The documentation assembled in this book, however, suggests
that they are right. It was a genuinely atrocious occupation.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Books: From killer to conservationist - J D F Jones
considers Peter Scott's biography

PETER SCOTT: PAINTER AND NATURALIST
by Elspeth Huxley
Faber Pounds 17.50, 361 pages
IT is remarkable how some of our most famous conservationists learned their
trade - discovered their passion - in the killing fields.
Here is Peter Scott ('Because of him, more than any other single person,
animals that 40 years ago seemed doomed to extinction still exist' - Sir
David Attenborough) at play before the war: he and two friends shot a score
of ducks at Leighton Moss, rushed to the Lake District to kill two stags,
then charged back to the marsh for another 100 geese before supper.
He saw nothing untoward in this. 'They were man's traditional quarry,' he
wrote, 'and it was part of man's instinct to hunt: it was part of the birds'
instinct to be hunted' (my emphasis). To which I can only say, balderdash
and humbug.
Eventually - slowly - the sinner repented, and by the early 1950s Peter
Scott had sold his guns. Gavin Maxwell had trodden the same path, just like
those professional white hunters in Africa who, today, have become game
wardens. Perhaps our own king-in-waiting will one day follow their example
as he attends to his duties as president of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust
which, successor of the original Severn Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge, is
Peter Scott's most concrete legacy.
But peaceful co-existence between hunters and bird-watchers was very much on
Scott's mind in the early days of the Trust. He had observed in America the
benefit of partnership between shooters and savers.
So long as a species was not endangered, the trust's annual reports could
talk about 'the notion of wildfowl as a natural resource which can be
harvested like any other crop'. It still sounds pretty rum to me, coming
from a man who committed his life to, and built his international fame upon,
a passion for geese.
Peter Scott was a famous man for 40 years. His father, of course, was even
more famous, and everyone has always assumed that it must have been a
problem for Peter to be automatically associated with the gallant Captain
who died on the way back from the South Pole.
In fact, according to this authorised biography, there seems to be next to
no evidence of a complex. On the contrary, Peter throughout his life found
every door open to him, and he had the energy to take full advantage of his
role as a golden boy of the Establishment. Elspeth Huxley's thesis is that
his father's fame was a double-edged legacy: it smoothed his path but also
confronted him with the need to achieve the highest standards. That sounds
about right.
From babyhood he mixed with the good and the great, thanks to his formidable
sculptress mother, Kathleen. At Cambridge he managed a pass degree by the
skin of his teeth - he was never an intellectual - but it was there that he
discovered wildfowl. He had a facility for drawing and, as we all know, he
became a painter, a trade which was to fund him for much of his life. The
biographer is polite: 'Although his paintings tended to be ignored or
patronised by avant-garde critics, they sold well and continued to do so for
many years to come, affording pleasure to his patrons and a comfortable
income for himself'. The print called 'Taking To Wing' sold 355,423 copies
between 1934 and 1959. Later on he saved himself exertion by making
cardboard stencils of geese in flight which he could pin to his landscape
canvases in the appropriate position.
He had a good war, in destroyers in the North Atlantic and then commanding a
steam gunboat; he also made an important contribution to the technique of
camouflage. A first marriage to the teenaged Elizabeth Jane Howard quickly
failed (his portrait of that distinguished future novelist was to grace the
jacket of Paul Gallico's best-selling The Snow Goose which he illustrated).
He almost became a Tory MP. And he was a sportsman - skating, sailing,
gliding - of world class; at the ripe age of 55 he was the British Open
Champion glider.
The war matured him, says his biographer, which hardly seems surprising. It
might be worth underlining (as she does not) that his powerful mother died
soon after. In 1945 he discovered Slimbridge, on the south bank of the
Severn, where Whitefronted geese arrived in immense numbers from Russia
every winter. This time he did not shoot. He transferred his own collection
of birds, which he had started in 1933, and the Wildfowl Trust was born.
Portly, balding, bespectacled, Peter Scott became first a national figure
and then an international committee man and lobbyist. He was a pioneer of
television nature programmes, which turned him into an indefatigable
globetrotter, but Slimbridge (and its later satellites) was his first and
true mission as he churned out the canvases to pay the bills. He was a
mighty pioneer of the Green Movement and it was inevitable that in 1961 he
should have been centrally involved in setting up the World Wildlife Fund
(now the World Wide Fund for Nature). All this, be it noted, before we knew
about acid rain and ozone holes and global warming. A voice before his time,
he wrote: 'I personally believe that all other species of flora and fauna
have as much right to their place on earth as does Homo sapiens'. It was his
lifelong crusade.
This is not a book that calls for detailed criticism. Huxley has told a long
and interesting story lucidly - no mean achievement for a writer in her
mid-80s whose first biography, the definitive life of the Kenyan Lord
Delamere, goes back nearly 60 years. She has evidently enjoyed a trusted
relationship with the family (15 years ago she wrote a biography of Captain
Scott). Peter, knighted, a Companion of Honour, Fellow of the Royal Society,
is an Establishment hero and Huxley is not the biographer to scrutinise the
emperor's clothes.
Once she asks whether he was 'too good to be true', but she prefers not to
chip too deeply into the inner man. She is unnecessarily discreet about
Kathleen's uninhibited life and, unsurprisingly, coy about the son's private
concerns, but these things need not matter: the tale of a busy, worthwhile
life, so superior in its achievement to that of the famous father, will
carry you happily through a couple of winter evenings.

SHAKESPEARE: THE EVIDENCE. UNLOCKING THE MYSTERIES OF THE MAN AND HIS
WORK
by Ian Wilson
Headline Press, 498 pages, Pounds 19.99
WHAT DO we think we know about the author of Hamlet - assuming it was
Shakespeare who wrote the plays? The answer is: a great deal, but some of it
is wrong.
The main facts of his life are well authenticated. Born in
Stratford-upon-Avon shortly before April 26 1564, he married, had several
children, and moved to London. He wrote poems, was an actor, and a
playwright. From money made from investing in the theatre, he bought land at
Stratford and died there in 1616. A few years later two of his colleagues
published an edition of his collected plays.
All this can be discovered from official records of baptisms, marriages,
burials, and from property documents, wills, books and manuscripts. Samuel
Schoenbaum, an American scholar, reprinted most of them in 1975.
But the facts have not been enough. From the beginning of the Shakespeare
mania in the 18th century, the plain story has been filled out with invented
gossip, anecdotes drawn from the plays, speculation, and forgery.
Tourist sites are still encrusted with a layer of nonsense, perpetuated by
misleading disclaimers. Gaps in the chronological record have been elevated
into 'lost years' with the implication that something sinister must have
been going on.
Over the centuries Shakespeare has attracted dozens of pseudo-scholars and
cranks, sure that they have uncovered a deep secret. Those who believe that
he did not write the plays and try to give the credit to Bacon, Oxford,
Marlowe, or others, have no more evidence than their own discomfort that a
mere provincial could have known so much, but they continue to claim
attention.
Ian Wilson's Shakespeare, The Evidence, Unlocking the Mysteries of the Man
and his World, like his earlier study of the Turin shroud, is intended for a
popular readership and assumes little prior knowledge. The book contains
helpful summaries, a family tree, transcriptions of key documents, and is
excellently illustrated. But is our excitement at the sleuthing increased by
the knowledge that Stratford parish register measures 17 1/2 in by 7 1/2 in
and consists of 335 pages with the Shakespeare entry towards the bottom of
page five? Is Hamlet, above all, one of the most cracking ghost stories of
all time?
Wilson's book is better than his misleading title implies. He rightly
resists the common temptation to reconstruct Shakespeare's personality from
the speeches of his characters in the plays. He sometimes tells us more than
we need about the earls and lords and other better-documented men and women
who were Shakespeare's contemporaries, and he piles 'arguably' on
'arguably.' But, for the most part, he is sure-footed in picking his way and
judicious in his judgments. His book is a reliable guide to what is true,
what is relevant, what is guesswork, and what is false in Shakespeare
biography.

TENNESSEE WILLIAMS: EVERYONE ELSE IS AN AUDIENCE
by Ronald Hayman
Yale University Press, 268 pages Pounds 19.95
THE TRAJECTORY of literary fame in 20th century America often seems as fixed
as a meteor's. A sudden burst of talent and light from an unexpected region
is quickly followed by a long, spectacularly visible fall. Hemingway,
Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Capote - the American pantheon is full of writers who
suffered the dubious distinction of being celebrities long after their
talent had flared out.
Perhaps the most pathetic and poignant of these big league burn-outs is
Tennessee Williams. Born the second child of a seedy middle class Southern
family in 1911, by the age of 36 Thomas Lanier Williams had changed both his
name and his future, becoming the most famous playwright of his age with the
classic dramas The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire.
Nothing, it would seem, could stop him. But by the time of his death in
1983, the great dramatist had become a stumbling, lisping, doped-up parody
of himself, raging and remonstrating like some countess in exile, working
feverishly in an amphetamine trance yet unable to come up with anything
worth staging.
Ronald Hayman's short, sharp biography provides a telling portrait of how
this disintegration occurred. Unlike Hemingway and Fitzgerald, who simply
drank too damned much, Williams's self-destructiveness was tied up with his
art from the very beginning. After all, how many 13-year-olds complain of
writer's block? Young Tom's family proved an incubator for both his
homosexuality and artistic drive. The Williamses were dysfunctional long
before the phrase became popular, with a distant and drunken father who
worried about his 'sissy' son, an overbearing mother, and a sister whose
brittle sensitivity was to lead to institutionalisation and a lobotomy.
Williams's response to this stifling environment was to write and travel
obsessively. By his 30th birthday he had consigned an awesome number of
words to the page, rivalled only by the miles he had racked up in the
wanderlust that was to grip him until his death. But if wealth and fame
allowed him to escape from his family, his imagination was tied to it for
the remainder of his life. His domineering mother, a preacher's daughter who
had married 'beneath herself', was to appear in various guises throughout
Williams's oeuvre, most notably as Amanda Wingfield, the mother in Menagerie
who claims to have once received 17 gentleman callers in a single day.
Echoes of her can also be found in Streetcar's Blanche DuBois, another faded
belle with delusions of grandeur.
Williams's sister, Rose, also informed his art. He was away when it was
decided to give her a lobotomy, and he felt guilty for the rest of his life
that he had not be present to prevent an operation which turned out badly.
The model for the crippled Laura in Menagerie, her condition undoubtedly
contributed to the morbidity and images of mutilation that were to mar much
of the playwright's later work.
Ironically, Williams's father, a blustering and abusive shoe salesman, was
confined to the wings of his son's imagination - most of the domestic
arrangements in the playwright's major works are devoid of fathers. Although
this may have seemed like contempt at the time, one can only conclude that
Cornelius Williams fared better than his wife and daughter.
Hayman's biography is at its best in showing how Williams's ability as a
young writer to mine his own life for dramatic ore left him gutted as an
older man. There was no catharsis involved in putting his guilt and sexual
tensions on paper. Writing seemed only to amplify these feelings. Williams
was a compulsive reworker of material. Most of his plays began as short
stories, grew into one act dramas, then blossomed into their final five-act
form. While this diligence at first was the mark of admirable craftsmanship,
it later took on the air of morbid obsession. Williams's hopelessly
overblown later work rehashed the themes of emotional cannibalism and sexual
confusion that were so potent in his great plays.
After critics and audiences shunned his work, Williams sought refuge in
chemicals and pointless travel. His final years are as boringly melodramatic
as his later work, a countless succession of male companions, tempests of
hypochondria, and brief residencies in posh hotels. With the cruel irony
America likes to reserve for its ruined artists, Williams's last years were
his most famous, allowing him to play the grandmaster of the stage at
countless revivals and lifetime achievement ceremonies even as he was coming
creatively unglued.
While Hayman's book is skilled in showing the tragic arc of Williams's
career, it is perhaps too perfunctory to satisfy readers wanting to get the
full picture of this sad life. While I am no fan of door-stopping
biographies, 240 pages of amply illustrated text does seem a bit meagre.
That said, this remains a useful guide to the workings of Williams's
troubled imagination, as well as a sad testament to the way a literary
career can go so terribly wrong.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (9): Expats
flock to green playing fields - John Authers finds that British boarding
schools are attracting more pupils from abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH boarding schools have at least one growth industry to be proud of.
The last survey by ISIS (the Independent Schools Information Service)
revealed that the numbers of pupils coming from overseas had risen, in spite
of an alarming 6 per cent fall in the total number of boarders.
For many schools, improved recruitment from expatriates and non-UK nationals
could be the key to their survival, and they have improved their service for
children from overseas as a result. Some of this is marketing hype with more
than a hint of desperation - school prospectuses now tend to emphasise their
closeness to major airports - but genuine improvements have been made.
Standards of accommodation have improved markedly.
Even the examinations are changing. This survey is based around A-levels
which are still, in spite of increasing attacks from educationalists, the
'gold standard' of British education. But the international gold standard of
education is the International Baccalaureate.
Four schools in our survey now offer the IB - the Anglo-European School,
Cheltenham, Malvern, and Sevenoaks - while others are considering doing so.
It is accepted to a growing extent by British universities, but also,
crucially to many outside the UK, by universities in other countries. The
entries for Sevenoaks and Anglo-European both include IB results, using a
formula to convert them into A-level equivalents.
Sevenoaks initially introduced the qualification for purely educational
reasons, according to Richard Barker, head for the last 11 years. IB
requires three subjects at a higher level, at a similar standard to
A-levels, plus three subsidiary subjects.
The six must include English, maths, a modern language, a science, and a
humanity, with only the sixth subject left optional. This allows
specialisation for those fixed on a particular degree - for example maths,
physics and chemistry could be the three higher subjects - while ensuring
that they retain far greater balance.
IB candidates must also produce a 4,000-word essay and master a compulsory
paper in the theory of knowledge, which takes students through a whirl of
language, logic, induction theory and ethics, as well as specialist fields
such as architecture. Rather than taking the standard university route
through the subject, and studying philosophy author by author, the students
have to answer questions such as: 'Do governments have the right to outlaw
abortion?'
Finally, IB candidates must satisfy requirements in creativity, action and
service, which typically means taking part in Duke of Edinburgh's awards,
the combined cadets force, or voluntary services, such as helping
handicapped children.
Alison Berresford, whose parents are much-travelled expatriates, is
confident that the IB has offered her a better education than A-levels could
have done: 'How can 16-year-olds know what to specialise in? By the time you
are 18, 19 or 20 you should have some better general knowledge which you
can't have perfectly at 16.'
The exam attracts foreigners as well as expatriates. Christian Artmann is
German and studying the IB in Kent because he is unhappy with what he
regards as the poor prospects of German sixth-form education. University in
the US might follow.
Adam Abote is an Ethiopian, who was evacuated from his home country to avoid
the civil war there. He wants to progress to college in American university
 -Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, he hopes.
His parents sent him to Sevenoaks, he says, simply because he could do the
IB there. The IB has been the key to an expansion in boarding numbers by the
school - very rare as boarding numbers contract in the recession - which now
hosts 30 nationalities.
More schools can be expected to introduce the IB in the next few years, a
development which can only be beneficial for all concerned.
Once the curriculum is in place, the greatest obstacle in most parents'
minds is the distance from home involved. At least British children at
boarding school can usually go home for a weekend if the homesickness gets
too much for them - not an option if your parents live in Singapore.
Schools have found an answer to this. Independent commercially run
'guardianship' services are now on offer, which give children the chance to
phone someone they can trust and ask for advice. Almost as important, the
guardians can also deal with the school when they have problems, rather than
trusting to awkward trans-global telephone conversations.
Gabbitas, Truman and Thring, based in London, offers the largest
guardianship service, while some schools, such as Rossall in Fleetwood,
Lancashire, offer special deals with local guardians.
Rossall has traditionally had a high proportion of overseas students and is
now going out of its way to attract children from overseas. It provides free
escort services to take children to and from Manchester airport and also
operates an overseas club, run by two members of staff, which takes pupils
on weekend outings to give them a broader view of Britain.
All of this should be good news for expatriate parents. While British
independent schools are looking so far afield for recruitment, they can be
expected to offer better value for money.
They offer fluency in the English language, and a passport to British higher
education, which is much admired throughout the world. But in some cases,
the hard-sell recruitment campaigns which they take across the world
represent a last bid for survival. Expatriates now have the luxury of a wide
choice, and it should be used with care.

AN EMPIRE OF THE EAST: TRAVELS IN INDONESIA
by Norman Lewis
Jonathan Cape Pounds 16.99, 237 pages
GRAHAM Greene called Norman Lewis 'one of the best writers not of any
particular decade, but of our century.' Others are content to acknowledge
him as the doyen of English travel writing. Either way, all Lewis's
qualities are paraded in his latest travel book, which takes him to
Indonesia: to Sumatra, East Timor and Irian Jaya.
Many writers would feel overwhelmed by Indonesia, an archipelago scattered
across 3,000 miles of tropical seas, with a population approaching 200m that
is divided, uniquely, into 300 ethnic groups speaking approximately 250
languages, each island possessing a different history and culture from the
next.
But not Lewis. Like all the best travel writers, he is monumentally
unflappable. He simply starts at the start and proceeds to the end,
providing, as he goes, a textbook illustration of the qualities - charm,
generosity, reportorial perspicacity and wisdom high among them - that have
made him such a much-loved guide to places strange and far.
Not that this is a guidebook. It is the antithesis of guidebookery: a
brilliantly-rendered account that pilots the armchair traveller from strange
spot to strange spot, from lowland to highland, from the 20th century to the
Stone Age, as though by magic carpet.
Lewis's vast experience as a traveller shines through everywhere. On a
Sunday afternoon he visits Well Beach Number Three, as it is called in
Indonesian, on the weirdly beautiful island of Weh, off the northern tip of
Sumatra.
He is greatly taken by the sub-aquatic pleasures of Well Beach Number Three,
where he sees more fish, and a greater variety of them, than he had seen
anywhere on the planet - 'even in such remote Pacific islands as Raiatea.'
He is excellent on big issues like transmigration: the shipping of millions
of people from one part of Indonesia to another to relieve population
pressure.
'Painstakingly,' he says, 'all Brazil's errors in the movement of
populations from rural wastelands and city slums into the Amazon were copied
in Indonesia, although on a much larger scale.'
If the primary aim of transmigration was to relieve Java and Bali of excess
population, the secondary aim was to guarantee national unity by the spread
of Javanese culture through the islands.
'This so far has not happened,' he maintains. 'In fact the resentment
provoked by what are generally viewed as government-sponsored Javanese
colonies tends to diminish whatever ingredient of Indonesian patriotism may
have previously existed. However many transmigrants are sent to East Timor,
nothing is more certain than that only a permanent presence of the army will
prevent it from declaring its independence.'
Within a few lines of this passage Lewis has switched, with the grace of
quicksilver, from the cultural weightiness of transmigration to a
beautifully controlled description of the pleasantness of life in the small
Sumatran town of Lamainang, away from the hugger-mugger of the
transmigration settlements.
In Lamainang market, girls in blue and scarlet bargain excitedly for jungle
fruit and several kinds of bat. A pet stall offers cockatoos, long-tailed
mice and a small member of the tarsier family, which surveys the world
through troubled eyes, as well it might.
'Everyone's existence in Lamainang was enlivened by a clear mountain river
squeezing through this small town, which drew a happy attendance of people .
. . a thin old man, trousers rolled up, dabbed in a pool with a net; a woman
brought her duck, carried under her arm, for its daily excursion on the
river.'
The high point of the book is a journey into the Irian Jaya highlands, into
the almost-Stone-Age realm of the Dani people. No one can use wryness as
effectively as Lewis. Here he is at a church service of tribespeople, some
wearing necklaces of graded boar's teeth, in a mission hall in Endoman, an
experience, says Lewis, that calls for extreme theological simplification:
'What possible contacts could the minds of these villagers have with the
intellectual subtleties evolved in 4th-century Byzantium shortly after the
Emperor Constantine's conversion to the new faith? How could the preacher
Engen, peeping out through the shutters of the Stone Age, explain to them
the mystery of the Holy Trinity, Redemption, Atonement, and the union of
divine and human natures in the Hypostasis of Christ? . . . It was a case of
the blind leading the blind.'
In addition to a magic carpet, Lewis possesses the beadiest yet kindest of
magic eyes.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (8): A
helping hand for hard-up parents - Scholarships and bursaries can ease the
financial burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   YOU MAY shudder at the sight of independent school fees
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but remember you may well not be asked to pay them in full.
Last year, for the first time, more than a quarter of independent school
pupils received some assistance towards paying their school fees  - a total
of 123,750 children. This was a rise of 2.9 per cent on the previous year
and reflected schools' use of bursary funds to nurse parents through the
recession.
Both scholarships (awarded for academic merit or for specific abilities) and
bursaries (awarded in cases of need) allow parents to pay less than the
standard fees. The government's assisted places scheme also helped.
Schools are understandably cagey about announcing their use of bursaries to
parents, as they do not want to raise hopes. However, the Headmasters'
Conference, which includes most of the best known boys' schools, has
recently moved towards a policy of allowing more means-tested awards.
With a few exceptions, HMC schools now award scholarships of a maximum of
half standard fees on academic merit. This allows them more lee-way to help
boys from disadvantaged backgrounds - and means that schools can still pay
full fees to academically able pupils from poor backgrounds.
Many headteachers felt that awarding full-fees scholarships to children
whose parents could have afforded to pay anyway effectively reduced access
to their schools.
Some schools are required under the terms of their endowments to offer a
specific number of scholarships on merit. For example, St Paul's in London
has 153 'foundation scholars' at any one time, in accord with the wishes of
its founder, John Colet. Each scholar is entitled to wear a silver fish on
his lapel, as 153 is the number of fish caught by Jesus in the 'miraculous
draught'.
Eton, one of the richest schools, has 70 King's Scholars and will even pay
for four 10-year-olds to go through three years of prep school, before
taking the exams for the King's Scholarship.
Pupils entering for scholarships usually need to sit the school's own exams,
which will often include Latin, and then endure a round of interviews.
Others are prepared to take the common entrance exam as evidence.
Many schools also award scholarships for specific abilities, particularly
art, drama, music and sport. This practice is controversial, but it allows
schools to improve their extra-curricular activities without allowing rivals
to 'scoop the pool' of gifted youngsters.
Bursaries are commonly awarded during a pupil's career when parental
circumstances change for the worse. Typically, schools produce a form asking
parents about their circumstances, which must then be verified using tax
returns or other reliable documents. Decisions will then be taken normally
by bursars and governors.
Some schools have bursaries for children of families in the armed forces,
the clergy, or teachers.
The government's assisted places scheme also pays a large block of fees,
accounting for 31,582 children last year. The amount of government help will
depend on the family's 'relevant income', which includes the total pre-tax
income of both parents, and any unearned income from dependent children. It
does not include social security benefits and an allowance of Pounds 1,105
is deducted for each child in the family who is not applying for an assisted
place.
On this basis, families with income up to Pounds 9,226 are eligible to have
their fees paid in full. Assistance for families on higher incomes is
available on a declining scale, up to a maximum income of Pounds 25,000.
Parents interested in the scheme should contact the Department for Education
Assisted Places team, Mowden Hall, Darlington, Durham DL3 9BG (tel:
0325-392163). For details of schools in Wales, telephone 0222-761456,
extension 5362.
These sources of funds add up. Haberdashers' Aske's, an academic powerhouse
in Elstree, west London, offers 35 assisted places to 11-year-olds each year
and a further five for pupils joining in the sixth form. Side by side with
this is the school's bursary scheme, which currently pays (without any
academic threshold) towards the fees of around 100 boys.
It also awards five half-fee scholarships per year on academic merit,
meaning that more than a third of its intake receives some help with fees.
Statistics like that should shake parents out of discounting an independent
education just because published fees are high. They would be foolish not to
investigate the state sector. But it would be similarly a mistake not to ask
for help with fees.
Details on specialist scholarships, and on bursaries, are printed in
Choosing Your Independent School 1993/1994, published by the Independent
Schools Information Service, 56 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6AG. 071-630
8793. Pounds 6.95. ISIS also publishes a list of recommended financial
advisers.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Property: For those with reform in mind - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW rules allowing owners of leasehold flats to buy the freehold come
into effect on Monday. Copies of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993 can be obtained from Her Majesty's Stationery Office
for Pounds 19.65. But leaseholders still face many hurdles if they intend to
act and will need solicitors and surveyors.
Several firms and the department of the environment have prepared (or are
putting together) books and pamphlets with advice. In alphabetical order,
these include Bircham (071-222-8044) with Strutt &amp; Parker (071-235-9959);
William H. Brown (071-636-2736) with Philip Hodges (071-454-9970); Francis
Russell (071-225-3344); Macfarlanes (071-831-9922) with Property Vision
(071-602-8788); Simmons &amp; Simmons (071- 628-2020). There might be a charge
for some but the DoE's is free (PO Box 151, London E15 2HF). Meanwhile, law
firm Trowers &amp; Hamlins (071-831-6292), in conjunction with Fineman Lever, is
organising a free seminar in London on November 18.
Guides to the legislation include:
How to Manage Your Own Block of Flats, by John Cumming and Richard Hickie;
and How to Buy Your Freehold or Extend Your Lease, by Paul Gurowich, David
Marcus and David Haines (both published by the College of Estate Management,
Whiteknights, Reading RG6 2AW, at Pounds 14.50 and Pounds 12 respectively).
Buying Your Freehold or Extending Your Lease, by Timothy Curran (Pounds
11.99 from Leasehold Enfranchisement Ltd, Swan Centre, Fishers Lane,
Chiswick, London W4 1RX).
IN MAYFAIR, central London, Egerton (071-493-0676) is selling 3 Lees Place
W1, just off Grosvenor Square, on a lease with 26 years to run and with a
guide price of Pounds 1.15m. But as the ground rent was fixed in 1931 at
Pounds 125 for the whole term, the house is can be enfranchised under the
new laws. Many larger houses in London cannot because the ground rent is too
high or a company (not an individual) is the leaseholder.
* * *
SIR EDWARD Heath, the former prime minister, is the only person to have
enfranchised in the close of Salisbury Cathedral. But whoever buys Myles
Place, a very grand Grade I-listed house in the close which the dean and
chapter are offering on a new 60-year lease, will not be able to join him
because the ground rent of Pounds 500 exceeds the low rent test of Pounds
250 for a lease outside London granted after March 31 1990. The agent is DW
Barke (0722-327087) and the price around Pounds 650,000.
* * *
ARDELEY BURY is a romantic castle on an ancient moated site near Stevenage
in Hertfordshire. Its Tudor brick front, with a handsome, low, vaulted
entrance hall merges delightfully with Georgian Gothic brick and flint
towers and turrets, and a great hall built on to the Tudor house. As you
approach, you pass a lake with a Tudor boathouse; ancient parkland with
bumps and hollows awaiting an an archaeological dig (if that appeals); and
old, thatched barns in apple-pie order.
This is a small paradise, where, even in winter, no neighbour is in sight.
In excellent repair, it is waiting for new owners who will enjoy living in
an exotic and congenial house. But they will need to bring large pieces of
furniture with them. The guide price from Savills (071-499 8644) is Pounds
2.5m, which includes 90 acres. It is hard to believe that such rural bliss
exists an hour from London.
BLISS MILL, on the edge of Chipping Norton, is a Cotswolds landmark - a
huge, Italian renaissance-style tweed mill, with a chimney like a minaret,
that would be more at home in Bradford or Glasgow than Oxfordshire. Built in
1872, it worked until 1980 as one of the last survivors of the Cotswold wool
industry.
When it closed, a speculator bought it. There were various planning
applications, including for a mosque. In 1987, Bliss Mill Holdings started
converting it into flats, but went into receivership in 1990; the asking
prices were too high. It was acquired by Widworthy Leisure Ltd, which took
it to market last year - and then also went into receivership. Now, Chris
Barlow, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand (as receiver), is marketing the flats at prices
from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 198,000, and several have been sold already or
are under offer. The agent is Savills in Banbury (0295-263535).

FT  30 OCT 93 / Gardening: The idiocy of planting for ethnic correctness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF you may be looking forward to planting trees during the next few
months. You are interested not only in the 'best tree for a small garden,'
that elusive entity which obsesses books on gardening. You also want trees
for a field, an acreage of set-aside, or an eventual barrier in the
landscape.
If you want inspiration, look around you this weekend or visit a local
arboretum. The autumn colour is still holding up well, from Westonbirt to
Leonardslee. You have your last chance to weigh-up your options while the
leaves are looking their best.
Our choices are muddled with incoherent rhetoric which seems to be gaining
ground. It comes home to me whenever I look through the two main windows of
my life. One, the home window, is evidence of mistakes made 25 years ago by
somebody else; the other, the working window, reveals the options which
ought to have been followed.
The home window looks out across my garden into a tall boundary fence of
sycamores, the rock-bottom trees of British landscaping. Whatever you decide
after reading this, I do beg you not to plant them. By late summer, the
leaves are already dull and dirty; in autumn, they turn a soulless
grey-brown and are slow to rot when they drop.
The main reason they crop up so often in former owners' gardens is that they
seed themselves frantically and some of the seedlings turn into trees.
Nobody in their right mind would allow these seeding menaces anywhere near
their flower beds. But free-seeding trees appeal to ecological gardeners:
they can be introduced 'naturally' and, after years of seeding, they have
become so firmly established that they satisfy hedgers and foresters who
want to go 'native.'
Going native has become extraordinarily acceptable. County councils have
special grants for amenity tree-planters, who are so slow to claim them that
even a casual inquiry encourages a deluge of correspondence and offers of a
consultative visit. The grants have two conditions: the trees must be open
to public viewing, a reasonable condition as they are planted on public
money, but they must also be 'native broad-leaves.'
This second condition is ridiculous. Nobody will give me a grant if I plant
a glorious grove of ginkgos or an avenue of tulip trees which are
beautifully foreign. If I propose sycamores, I would qualify for a
broad-leaved handout. It seems batty to me. The council would probably be
asked to prosecute me for discrimination if I banned immigrants in any other
area of life; why does it give grants only to planters who conform to ethnic
correctness?
The notion is ultimately bogus, anyway. When does a tree become a native,
not an import: what about wild cherries or walnuts, both of which are
approved native broad-leaves but which historians have sometimes proposed as
foreign imports, brought to Britain by the Romans?
Why should we want a tree just because it is indigenous? Large areas of
'indigenous' British life are pretty second-rate. I would ban subsidies for
sycamores and point out to inquirers that there are far lovelier trees for
Britain than the service tree, hawthorn, common crab and elder which make up
a municipally-correct idea of a 'native hedging mix.'
Avoid sycamores, therefore, and do not fall for the mindless 'native'
rhetoric. Turn instead to the view from my life's other window, out beyond
the shoulders of pupils reading essays on classical slavery to a wonderful
harmony of winter-flowering cherry, non-copper beech, extraordinarily
foreign mulberry, and Oriental wistarias which are still retaining their
green leaves before going yellow in a blaze.
Here, natives mercifully are swamped by immigrants. While sycamores were
being planted in the sight-line of one of my windows, a connoisseur was
planting these un-English trees in front of the other. I wish I could risk
felling the boundary hedge and replace it with trees from the tutorial
vista, jazzed up by the best aliens which I could foist on the West
Oxfordshire council.
Like our restaurants, our hedges need to be rescued from 'native' staples.
We also need to break down the categories. When we think of the landscape,
we are still too ready to divide trees into 'specimen' or 'hedgerow'
varieties and to mark off some of them as 'ornamentals.' Fields and
set-aside, we seem to be saying, do not need ornamentals: huge, sweet
chestnuts, white-flowering winter cherry, Chinese sorbus, brilliant
parrotias or the best birches. No, they need the unspeakably British service
tree and the miserable blackthorn.
Even when we do dare to be ornamental, we run in ruts. Outside the garden,
birches still amount to the pock-marked trunks of a common silver birch, not
the stunningly white Betula jacquemontii. In fields, limes are large-leaved
limes, not the silver or weeping silver varieties.
I am not claiming that cities have broader horizons. From New York to Seoul,
streets are about to glow with the autumn duty of yellowing ginkgo trees:
why did British town councils miss out on this lovely possibility, planting
those awful yellow-edged acers on a main route into Leicester or splodges of
pink cherry when the A23 pauses for a tree?
We used to be told that street trees had to be chosen so as to be
vandal-proof: I never understood why a dreary mountain ash was any more
proofed than one of its Oriental relations. In fields and on farms, we were
also told that native trees were the right choice because they were better
at fighting for themselves.
Chemicals and machinery have reduced the force of these arguments. Our new
age of weed-killers, based on glyphosate, allow us to keep grass and coarse
weeds away from a newly-planted tree on a headland as easily as in a garden:
two or three sprays during the year will keep it clear without much
difficulty. As a result, we can risk so-called ornamentals in places where
once they might have succumbed to weeds.
We can also risk more of them at a greater height. The books still tell us
to transplant some of the better varieties as pot-grown specimens, about 2
ft high, because they will then take root. But better techniques of root
preparation and better machinery for lifting has made this advice outdated
in most cases.
You can now buy most of these trees at a height where you will not lose them
in the first year among your patch of weeds, set aside and subsidised by the
EC.
I buy my trees from the fairly-priced list of Landford Trees, Landford,
Salisbury, Wiltshire. Its ginkgos are Pounds 11.50 each (plus VAT) per 10 at
six to seven feet high, while Sweet Chestnuts are Pounds 9.25 at 8-10 ft and
tulip trees are Pounds 14.25 at a similar height.
Early in the 18th century, the great landscape architect, William Kent, was
said 'to have first jumped the fence and seen all nature was a garden.'
Nowadays, I merely suggest that we remember the full width of nature,
outside the British Isles, and then proceed accordingly.
Of course, we do not want anything too fancy or too variegated or too purple
and gold in the setting of farmland. But there is no fixed rule that woods
in Britain have to be beeches and copses have to major on hazels. Open out,
survey the world and enhance the view from your windows of the future.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Property: Somerset's different worlds - Gerald Cadogan finds
a wide variety of houses on offer in the heart of the West Country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JULIUS Caesar would have divided Somerset into two or three parts. The
rolling hills of the east, on the border with Dorset, are a different world
from the plateau of Exmoor, the county's west end.
Exmoor has sheep, stag hunting, and ancient hedgerows from which huge
beeches sprout. Its steep and narrow valleys conceal burbling rivers, with
pools for a bracing bathe that return you to the days before heated swimming
pools in the garden. Its heroine is Lorna Doone, made famous by novelist RD
Blackmore.
East Somerset is gentle country. Long, low stone houses are tucked into the
hills or lie in a village at the bottom of the valley. Handsome churches
show how the county prospered in the Middle Ages. And there is a sense that,
in this haven of clematis and roses, it is always afternoon and time for a
cup of tea or the first glass of white wine.
In the middle, between Exmoor and the Dorset borders, lie the flat lands of
the Glastonbury levels, and the Sedgemoor marsh, and the Vale of Taunton
Deane which the M5 crosses. Here, the Duke of Monmouth started his revolt
against James II in 1685, and was routed. Judge Jeffreys' Bloody Assizes
followed. The Quantock hills separate this vale, packed with history, from
the wild country of Exmoor.
The M5, Somerset's main artery, goes south to Exeter, Plymouth and France,
and north to the rest of England and its motorway network. Caravans bound
for Devon and Cornwall crowd it in summer. The other links are the railway
to London - which sometimes has long delays and re-routings when floods wash
away the ballast; and, for east Somerset, the A303, the modern highway of
Wessex.
Close to the A303 is the thatched Rodwell Manor at West Lambrook, a long
house which has, as a centrepiece, a mid-16th century great hall. The house,
listed Grade II, comes with five acres and looks over the National Trust
land at Barrington Court (which will not be built on). Jackson-Stops is
asking Pounds 475,000.
Pendomer Manor, south-west of Yeovil, is another long house of similar date
which once was the rectory for the church next door. Buried there is a
knight who might be one Sir John de Domer. For a chance to be the late-20th
century squire, attend Humberts' auction in Hardington Mandeville village
hall on November 11 (7.30 pm). Humberts also will be selling Eastfield at
Hardington Mandeville: two farmworkers' cottages now made into one larger
cottage with a garden around enclosed by a low stone wall.
For cottages on Exmoor, Stags is an agent to consult, and Gribble Booth
Taylor has a good list of village properties. At Seavington St Michael, near
Crewkerne, Jackson-Stops is selling Orchard Cottage, at the end of a
no-through-lane, for Pounds 180,000. 'John Skellen May 25 1689' is inscribed
on the wall in plaster, and the thatched roof received a new ridge last
year.
At Compton Dundon, four miles from Glastonbury, Michael de Pelet (in
association with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley) offers Castlebrook Cottage, a long,
thatched village house with Honeysuckle Cottage in the grounds, for Pounds
255,000. De Pelet also has the cottage-style Four Gables; this is listed
Grade II, presumably for the unusual gables at either end which make it look
like the model for a fairy story. The guide price is Pounds 360,000. Cheaper
is Fosseway, with some mullion windows and exposed beams, in Hinton St
George near Crewkerne: Pounds 265,000 from Jackson-Stops.
Farmhouses on offer start with Pightley, at Spaxton on the edge of the
Quantocks, with nine acres and priced at Pounds 125,000-Pounds 150,000 by
Greenslade Hunt. It needs total renovation but has a good position. South of
Shepton Mallet, Kilkenny Farmhouse is half a mile from the Roman Fosse Way
(A37) and, with a stable yard and 3.5 acres, costs Pounds 325,000-Pounds
350,000 from Cluttons. Two barn conversions are Park Barn at Castle Cary
(Jackson-Stops, Pounds 245,000) and Home Barn at East Compton near Shepton
Mallet (Cluttons, Pounds 215,000).
Just over the Devon border, and new on the market, Stags is selling Lodfin
Farm at Bampton with 110 acres and farm buildings for Pounds 465,000. At
Winsford, on Exmoor, the same firm offers The Tufters, with a licenced
hiring yard for 10 horses in prime hunting country. Apart from the Devon &amp;
Somerset staghounds, five packs of foxhounds meet within five miles. The
price for this retirement sale is Pounds 350,000.
If Victorian rectories are your taste, Cluttons has the Old Vicarage at
Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, which is lucky still to have its coach house
(now converted as a three-bedroom house). Often, a diocese has sold these
separately or pulled them down to allow space for re-building. The price is
around Pounds 325,000.
If your house has to be Georgian, Humberts and de Pelet offer Cheriton
House, in South Cheriton near Wincanton; this has 26 acres, a swimming pool
and outbuildings for Pounds 420,000. De Pelet also will sell Magnolia House
at Watchfield, close to the M5 (junction 22) and needing renovation, by
informal tender on November 24; offers in the Pounds 150,000-Pounds 200,000
range are suggested.
For Pounds 280,000, he offers the Old Rectory at Limington, near Yeovil, and
Grove House at Baltonsborough, near Glastonbury.
The Great House at Edington, near Bridgewater, is on offer from Greenslade
Hunt for Pounds 240,000. But the handsomest Georgian property is Haygrass
House in Haygrass, near Taunton, from Humberts for Pounds 550,000; for
Pounds 155,000 more, there are cottages and a further 17 acres.
Finally, there are two solid, Edwardian houses. Ham Court at High Ham -
built, rightly, with some Ham stone - costs Pounds 400,000 from
Jackson-Stops. The same agent (with Grimley JR Eve) is selling Coker House
at East Coker, built with much more Ham stone, for Pounds 450,000. Recently,
it was an old people's home.
TS Eliot is buried in East Coker church. His family left the village to
emigrate to America, but he came home. In the East Coker part of The Four
Quartets, he writes: 'In my beginning is my end, in my end is my beginning.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (7): School
fees - plan ahead to ease the pain / Giving Junior an education could cost
over Pounds 300,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAYING FOR school fees has become an industry in its own right. Not only
accountants but financial advisers and computer programmers have done very
well out of the escalating costs of private education - and the increasing
desperation of parents to buy it.
A look down the column of boarding school fees demonstrates the scale of the
problems. Millfield, the most expensive school outside the specialist music
institutions and one of the best-resourced schools in the world, charges
Pounds 12,435 per year to boarders.
School fee inflation is currently running only slightly ahead of retail
price inflation, but has averaged around 10 per cent for the last 10 years -
last year's average of 8.3 per cent was the lowest since 1984-85.
A return to historic levels of inflation could therefore bring fees of
around Pounds 20,000 in another five years. If your child is still an
infant, and you want to pay for a boarding prep school as well, the total
cost will be well into six figures. Sun Life's projection that sending a
child born last year to independent school between seven and 18 would cost
Pounds 310,000 appears accurate.
Projections like that make a wonderful sales aid. Frightening though they
are, they should not scare parents into buying unnecessary financial
products.
Some glossy school fees packages are just a good way to sell life assurance.
They may make sense in limited circumstances, but their crucial weakness is
that they ignore the current state of your finances.
If you already have extensive savings which could be put towards school
fees, it is senseless to take out fresh policies aimed at paying the fees on
their own. In spite of the alarming projections, do not over-provide for
fees.
This can easily happen when dealing with salesmen paid by commission, so try
to seek advice payable via a fee for time spent, rather than by a commission
extracted from the money you invest. ISIS keeps a list of recommended
advisers.
First step is to establish how much money you are likely to need to pay. If
you have a school in mind, telephone the bursar, who should be prepared to
predict how fast fees will inflate in future. If you are still deciding on a
school, the figures in this survey should give a good idea of the figure to
aim for.
Once you have set a target, standard wisdom is to err on the side of caution
by using low-risk products to ensure that fees can be met. Higher risk
products, based on equities rather than cash deposits or government stocks,
have a good chance of doing better, but cannot be guaranteed to do so.
This judgment is finer the further in advance you plan. If your fees will
only be payable 10 years hence, the chances that equities will outperform
cash are so strong that you can afford to take the risk of a few market
bumps. If Junior starts next year, putting money into equities would be more
of a gamble.
Today's low interest rates, good news for the economy, are less appetising
for long-term savers and further complicate the issue. Fixed rates on offer
are so mediocre, as the table shows, that many advisers are prepared to risk
school fees money to the stock market which they would have salted away in
bonds or gilts a few years ago.
Low interest rates have also gnawed away at the value which schools can
offer themselves. Most boarding schools allow parents a discount for paying
in advance via a 'composition plan'. Bursars invest the money in cash
deposits, so the level of the discount is dependent on cash interest rates.
Schools are glad of the help for their cash flow that early payment can
provide, and parents should ask for details, but in this economic climate
schemes are unlikely to be competitive.
Once you have decided the level of risk you can take, the next golden rule
of financial planning is tax-efficiency. For example, if one parent pays no
income tax, they can earn gross interest on deposit accounts. On capital
gains, the authorities allow a gain of Pounds 5,800 each year, once
inflation has been taken into account, before any capital gains tax is
payable. The Weekend FT regularly provides details on how to calculate CGT,
which is one of the most unnecessarily complicated taxes on the statute
book.
Once you have taken advantage of both allowances, two routes are open,
depending on the state of your finances, for the bulk of your investments:
Capital. If you have a lump sum for fees payment, you have plenty of
opportunities.
Educational trusts are popular. Funds can be invested tax-free, provided
they are used to pay fees, and no particular school or pupil has to be
named. The trusts are offered by life assurance companies, which will
guarantee a certain level of fees through a series of annuities starting
when your child starts at school. These schemes are secure, but like
composition plans their attractions have been dimmed by low interest rates.
They should not be touched while other tax allowances remain unexploited.
Products ahead of them in the queue include personal equity plans, which
allow investment in equities free of income or capital gains tax, Tessas
(tax-exempt deposit accounts which must be maintained for at least five
years to maintain the tax advantages) and zero-dividend shares of investment
trusts, which offer a fixed return taxed as capital gains (useful for those
who do not pay capital gains tax).
Income. This is how most people pay school fees.
The traditional recommendation is the 'with-profits' life assurance
endowment. This is the same product, offering investment with a little life
assurance on top, which is used to back up most mortgages.
Their disadvantages in terms of inflexibility and tax-inefficiency are
considerable, as regular readers of the Weekend FT will know. In most cases
they are best avoided.
More flexible and tax-efficient savings schemes would again involve Peps or
cash-based Tessas. National Savings, which offers Children's Bonus Bonds
specifically with school fees in mind, should also be considered. For those
who have not saved in advance, a third route may be inevitable:
Loans. Isis has a special reserve plan which provides cheap lending
facilities for parents. Draw-down loans come from the Halifax; you borrow
money only when it is needed for another term's fees.
This scheme has two big advantages. The first is the rate of interest, which
is linked to the Halifax's base rate of 7.99 per cent. If borrowing is
likely to be more than Pounds 60,000, the rate charged will be 7.54 per
cent; this drops to 7.39 per cent if you borrow more than Pounds 100,000.
The second is that there are no strings to how you repay the loan - you are
not forced to buy an endowment policy. Instead, Claremont Savile steers
parents towards the least risky and most tax-efficient investments first.
The Isis scheme now pays out around Pounds 1m a week to parents. It is
better to save in advance; but if you have no choice but to borrow, you are
highly unlikely to find any better deals.
If none of these schemes are affordable then you might resort to the most
effective way to save fees. Look through this survey - and find a good state
school.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (6): More
to grades than just graft and grind - John Authers finds that the best
schools are not just exam factories with Oxbridge forever in their sights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EXAM league tables have achieved anything they have at least identified a
group of schools which are firmly entrenched in the top 10 each year.
Nothing seems to move them.
With two exceptions - Eton and Winchester, both of which are internationally
renowned boarding schools - all of them are day schools, single-sex (at
least until the sixth form) and based in big cities.
The list includes King Edward's Birmingham, Manchester Grammar, North London
Collegiate, St Paul's and St Paul's Girls', both based in west London, and
Westminster.
However, recognition has brought them problems. High A-level grades achieved
with such regularity look intimidating. This leads to the belief that such
grades can only be achieved by sacrificing everything else which creates a
broad education.
An old boy of Manchester Grammar summed up this Dickensian view perfectly in
an article published by the FT three years ago. In it he attacked his
'conveyor-belt education' and judged that 'imprisonment, Oxbridge, the work
ethic (even the workhouse ethic) were the themes of my years there'.
Exam success was brought brutally to the fore at St Paul's Girl's last year
when its high mistress resigned in the face of complaints from parents that
their daughters were doing too few GCSEs. Her idea had been to allow a
broader education and greater concentration on the ultimate objective of
A-level. The school nevertheless gained the nation's best results at GCSE
this year.
One Paulina (as St Paul's old girls are known) puts it brusquely: 'I don't
feel I was educated. I was just trained to do exams.'
Attacks like this are deeply resented by the schools themselves. Dr Martin
Stephen, currently head of the Perse School in Cambridge, who will next year
take over as high master of Manchester Grammar, says: 'It is natural to
assume that schools pay a price in human terms for academic success, and
very wrong. It is natural to assume that schools with the most selective
entry are ruthlessly competitive and even destructive to what in their terms
are the lesser-able, and also wholly wrong.'
Dr Stephen points out that unhappy or bored children do not get outstanding
results, and that university entrance procedures encourage pupils to show a
wide range of extra-curricular involvement. Academically successful schools
are likely therefore to encourage a broad range of activities.
In any case, the good, ambitious teachers such schools need are unlikely to
be happy unless they have the opportunity of deep involvement with
extracurricular activities as well.
Manchester Grammar, for example, answers the charges with the words
'Atherton' and 'Crawley'. Both Michael Atherton, the new England cricket
captain, and John Crawley, the 21-year-old tipped by several Australians as
his successor, are Mancunians who went on to Oxbridge - suggesting that they
found time in the school timetable to practise sport as well as swot for
A-levels.
King Edward's in Birmingham, top over the last five years, even advertised
the spectacular success of its sports teams in the match programmes for this
season's local derby match between the Birmingham City and Aston Villa
football teams.
St Paul's, top on A-level performance this year, has a two-hour lunch break,
during which boys are expected to make the most of the facilities - they are
excellent, expensive, and well-used. The music rooms shake with jazz and
orchestral music, while the theatres, art rooms, and playing fields are all
heavily occupied.
All the top schools accept that the degree to which they can select - far
greater for large big-city day schools than for others - is crucial to their
success. One St Paul's boy expresses this with self-confidence typical of
the school: 'If you only take boys who are going to get As at GCSE it's not
difficult to come top of the league table is it?'
This leads to perhaps the most important caveat about league table results -
that if your child is not particularly academically able, he or she is
unlikely to be admitted to one of the top schools. They would, in any case,
be unlikely to flourish there.
Whether parents should actually consider sending their children elsewhere
even if they get in to a top academic school is more debatable. John Trevis,
schools consultant with Gabbitas, Truman and Thring, suggests that pupils
who only narrowly win entrance to such schools might find the pace too fast,
and prefer to be somewhere less heated. This is another fiercely contested
idea.
For example Joan Clanchy, headmistress of North London Collegiate, this
year's top girls' school for A-level results, is relieved when parents are
nervous about the school's high league table position because 'it shows that
parents are asking the right questions'.
But this does not mean that any girl who wins admittance should be worried
that the pace will be too great. The school recruits extensively from the
state sector and gives its pupils close attention, which leads to an
obviously friendly atmosphere. According to Clanchy, this close attention is
as useful in helping those nearer the back of the class as it is in
fostering the more eye-catching gifted children.
Certainly all the top schools take academic subjects at a brisk gallop, with
GCSE only viewed as a brief stopping point, and not an objective in itself.
The target at which they take aim is A-level, which in itself is a gateway
to university.
Oxford and Cambridge then loom on the horizon.
Approaches vary. Joan Clanchy starts the sixth form with a talk on Oxbridge
which all the girls describe as 'deeply discouraging'. Those who choose
other universities are put under no pressure to change their minds.
Manchester Grammar's Oxbridge applications system is likened by one old
Mancunian to a military campaign. Boys fill out their application forms, and
then teachers, who know most of the admissions tutors, fill in the colleges.
St Paul's Oxbridge mechanism is subtler, but has a deadly effectiveness. One
boy in the lower sixth puts it thus: 'It's kind of understood. Some power up
there knows who's going to be in the Oxbridge set. It happens, but it's not
a pressure that's put upon you.'
Another boy then chirruped up to say that 'teachers hate being wrong'. Five
minutes later his tutor was able to assure me that the sixth-former in
question would be reading English at Cambridge.
That academic intensity will deter some parents, and attract many. But a
close look at the top academic schools must at least dispel any notion that
they are stultifying factories for bored children.
Far from it. Viewed at close quarters these schools seem exciting and
vibrant.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Fashion: You can't keep a good shirt down - This time the
look is long, lean and romantic or ascetic. It may be the one essential
autumn buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITE shirt is the many-headed Hydra of fashion. There are countless
versions of this basic essential, and each time it seems about to disappear,
because of a change in design direction, it renews itself more strongly.
Designers are capable of perpetually reinventing it.
This time it is the swashbuckling dandy, the romantic poet or the ascetic
nun which inspires the transformation. The square-cut, plain-collared,
button-cuffed shirt always looks smart in its classic way - but it does not
have quite the elan of this winter's style.
The details to look for include: long, rather lean-cut shapes with
pronounced tails; long, ruffled or double cuffs and an interesting neckline
with elongated revers; stock-ties or jabots; and cavalier lace trim.
The significance of these details lies in the way the white shirt is worn
now. This is a season of layers and the shirt, as the basic ingredient,
gives them topicality. It goes over, or under, a succession of lean, often
fine-fabric layers and it is usually longer than the rest.
The protruding tails, cuffs and collar proclaim the vintage of your outfit,
the details - a bold stock-tie, a romantic soft ruffle or a puritanically
plain buttoned-up collar - say which of the season's fashion 'characters'
you have decided to espouse.
For this autumn, designers have again plundered the dressing-up box and the
shirt is the shortest way to a specific theme. Wear a very plain,
high-necked style with simple, monochrome tailoring and skinny, undersized
knits and you have a deconstructed look bordering on the ecclesiastical.
Anything with a hint of lace worn with velvet, smacks of the dandy while a
shirt peeking from long, knitted layers updates a revived classic.
So strong is the impression created by the shirt that there is a case for
making it your one essential autumn buy. Certainly some of the top designers
seem to think so. You have a Chanel jacket, however old, or - whisper it - a
tweed lookalike in your wardrobe? Then follow Karl Lagerfeld's train of
thought.
He put just about every jacket-shape he has designed for the house on the
catwalk, all of them worn over saggy jersey trousers and a white shirt with
tails and cuffs flying - and very fresh they looked.
It is a similar story at the newly-opened London shop of Dior where
Gianfranco Ferre, its designer, has always been a serious shirt man.
He is best known for his flamboyant evening wear but his impeccable white,
cotton day shirts, their collars and cuffs cut and top-stitched with
mathematical precision, would lend drama and presence to any jacket. At more
than Pounds 300 they are expensive, but compare this with the cost of a
jacket of equal quality.
At lower price levels the choice is vast and often represents very good
value. If you are choosing a plain style, check for neat top-stitching, even
hems and attractive buttons and cufflinks. With more ornate styles, for
good-quality embroidery or lace trims, Next and Laura Ashley have
inexpensive shirts trimmed with good-looking lace. At whichever level you
buy you are unlikely to be disappointed. Your white shirt will be a
long-running item, although by next year the designers will doubtless have
thought up a different way for you to wear it.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Fashion: Luxurious, and politically correct - Lucia van der
Post dresses stylishly in lambskin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEEPSKIN is one of those staples of the classic outdoor wardrobe. Fashions
come and go but the popularity of sheepskin goes on, riding tranquilly above
and beyond the frenetic search for trends and directions. Soft, warm,
wind-proof, it is the garment one reaches for when in need of comfort and
reassurance.
Desirable though sheepskin may be, lambskin is even more sought-after. Much
softer, about a third thinner and 50 per cent lighter than sheepskin, it
drapes better and feels silkier.
Lisa Johnson is a new designer of lambskin who, this autumn, has brought a
collection of four lambskin designs - a short waistcoat, a long waistcoat,
half-length jackets (either single or double-breasted) and a three-quarter
length coat. All are made from lambskins which in these politically correct
days, she is at pains to point out, come from natural casualties (mainly
stillborn lambs) so there is no slaughter.
Lambskin, needless to say, does not come cheap. Coming from such tiny
casualties, many skins are needed to make one coat, the workmanship is fine
and careful and a jacket will sell in the shops for between Pounds 500 and
Pounds 740.
Lambskin can be dyed almost any colour. This season Lisa Johnson is using
black, anthracite, a jeans blue, ice-blue (see photograph) cream, mocha and
dark coffee brown, dark khaki and a mint green.
Already her lambskins are highly sought-after and for next winter a
full-length coat is planned - start saving now for it will cost around
Pounds 2,000. So far Lisa Johnson has concentrated on designing lambskin for
women but a few masculine pieces are also under way.
A good selection can be seen and bought at Space NK, 41 Earlham Street,
Covent Garden, London WC2 and at Questionnaire, 2 the High Street, Wimbledon
Village, London SW19. For further stockists ring 071-613-5239.
For those who want to see a wider range of lambskin coats, Nigel Preston is
another name to look out for. A fine designer who every year does something
new and beautiful with skins, this year he has three main themes: Afghan, a
classic for everyday designs which retails at between Pounds 500 and Pounds
600; Entrefino, a luxury version, which sells at Pounds 1,300; and finally,
the most luxurious range, Snow-tipped, which sells at about Pounds 1,500 and
features everything from a shawl-collared coat to a trench coat. Joseph
stores, Harvey Nichols, Harrods and Matches of Wimbledon all stock the Nigel
Preston label.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (4): Do
grades suffer when girl meets boy?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU WOULD think in these days that girls could perform as well in a
classroom where there are boys as in a classroom where there are none. I
don't know why that is not the case, but it's unfortunate.'
A statement like that, coming from a sixth-former at the girls-only North
London Collegiate, cannot go unchallenged.
Other sixth-formers, dressed casually as the school rules permit, take
issue: 'I don't think it's unfortunate. Once you are out of school it's
almost inevitable that the society you are going to be in will be mixed.
It's a question of taking the opportunity to be single sex.'
'School is for learning. You have got to have fun but I wouldn't want to go
to a school which was mixed. I think it would be a distraction.'
Now the protagonist is put on to the defensive. She suggests that a mixed
school is a more natural environment. But the enthusiasm the sixth-formers
feel for single-sex education is strong.
'It's very cosy. Girls can support each other. You don't have to play the
changes in the sexes off each other. I think it's important to have the
opportunity to make close friendships with just girls.'
Then one makes a point which many academics have already noticed. 'Boys
start to mature at 17 or 18. A 16-year-old boy can be the most painful
person in the entire world.'
League tables of performance in GCSE exams, usually taken when the
candidates are 16, bear this out. Girls' schools dominate the first 30
places, to an extent which suggests that girls at that age must be
academically superior to boys.
But that does not prove anything about the relative merits of single-sex and
mixed education. If girls at that age are academically more able than boys,
it might still be possible to make the advantage tell at mixed schools as
much as at girls' schools.
However, it is difficult to see many ways in which North London Collegiate
girls are missing out. The school, set in a broad campus at the edge of
Canons Park in North London, overtook its more famous rival, St Paul's
Girls' School in Hammersmith, to become the nation's top girls' school this
year.
Established by Miss Frances Mary Buss in 1850 to educate the girls of north
London, it has a less exclusive air than most independent schools.
Scholarships and assisted places are used to recruit as widely as possible
from the local community, and the girls include strong contingents of both
blacks and Asians.
This is very much part of the school's mission. While Cheltenham Ladies'
College was meant to train young ladies, North London Collegiate is 'for
girls' who intend to make their own way in the world.
Symbolically, the school no longer even offers cookery. Instead, the cookery
room has been converted and is now full of girls enthusiastically working at
craft, design and technology.
North London Collegiate also prepares its pupils for the hard-headed
commercial world outside via the Young Enterprise scheme, which gives
'companies' of youngsters starter capital of around Pounds 1,000 and then
gives them a year to make profits.
Whether girls truly feel freer to tackle the allegedly 'masculine' science
subjects in an all-female environment is more open to question. Mathematics
was the school's most successful A-level subject this year, with 31 of the
39 candidates winning A grades. But the most popular subject is the female
bastion of French (45 candidates, including 24 As), while Chemistry
attracted only 25 (14 As) and Physics 14 (8 As).
Elsewhere, the music centre is well-appointed and well used, while the
school puts on numerous drama productions, some in conjunction with Harrow,
the rather more exclusive boys' school just up the road.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (3):
Charters - first among equals / John Authers visits three very different
schools, each of which excels academically
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KATE MORSE, head girl of Charters School in Sunningdale, Berkshire, wants to
make something quite clear: 'I hope you don't think we're just a nice school
full of nice people and that's why we get good results. This area isn't like
that at all.'
Charters is one of the top schools in the UK, ranking 210th in the FT
survey. But unlike the highest flyers it has achieved this with a fully
comprehensive intake. Nobody in the catchment area can be turned away.
That catchment area is wealthier than the national average, but the towns of
Ascot and Sunningdale are not as affluent as their reputations might
suggest. Besides, its GCSE results - which show 60.5 per cent of Charters
pupils passing at least five grades A to C - put the school far ahead of
other Berkshire schools, where on average only 41.6 per cent of GCSE
candidates did this well. Its A-levels make it the third-ranked mixed
comprehensive to stay under local authority control in the UK.
A closer look shows that the school is far removed from the stereotyped
image of the vast and impersonal comprehensive.
Steve Pratt, head of sixth form, does not regard league tables as a fair way
to assess a school's worth. He believes that the high ranking comes from the
school's policy of using the National Record of Achievement scheme to
monitor pupils regularly.
Each pupil is issued with a folder, in which targets and reports are
accumulated at meetings with tutors throughout the pupil's school career.
This way the children who use the school's large and well-equipped centre
for special educational needs are given the extra care they need.
It also allows the truly talented pupils to be identified and nurtured.
Pratt says with pride that his staff can usually predict the A-level grades
their children will get a year in advance.
Charters encourages pupils to stay on for the sixth form with a wider range
of A-levels than most independent schools can offer. Theatre studies and
physical education were added this year to a list which already included
History of Art, Government &amp; Politics, Greek, Russian, Spanish, and
Sociology. Vocational qualifications are now being added.
The school's version of the prefect system also helps to maintain interest.
Sixth-formers act as liaison officers for tutor groups in lower forms and
sit on the school council, where issues such as recycling waste bins are
discussed with an intensity reminiscent of university junior common rooms.
Even in the sixth form there is no such thing as a free period at Charters,
with time not spent in lessons occupied either by private study, or by a
range of optional extra courses including interviewing skills, games
leadership and business French.
Sixth-formers are also encouraged to spend time helping both children with
learning problems lower in the school and autistics from a neighbouring
specialist unit. Two flourishing Young Enterprise companies are in business.
Do the potential university entrants lose anything by going to school with
their academic inferiors? Barry Mitchell, the headmaster and a veteran of
secondary moderns in greater London, dismisses the idea as ridiculous. 'We
do divide pupils into sets depending on which subject they are studying as
they move through the school. Therefore at appropriate times in their
development pupils are brought together to work with their peers
academically.
'Wherever you look you have got a pleasant atmosphere and a pleasant
approach by the teaching staff. You don't get that by setting in motion
systems which will divide pupils,' says Mitchell.
The school is well-maintained and adequately resourced, although its
facilities do not match the best of the independent sector.
But no sixth-formers believe they have missed out on anything. Parents
considering spending good money to send their children to one of the
Berkshire independent schools which finished below Charters might bear in
mind another candid comment from Kate Morse, when asked if she would have
preferred to attend an independent school: 'I can't see the point. They just
don't have the the taste of real life and the mix and variety in their lives
that we do.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (5): New
kid on the block
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEICESTER Grammar provides a potent riposte to plenty of preconceptions
about schools. It is fast gathering fresh claims to fame. The newest recruit
to the prestigious Headmasters' Conference, having been inducted earlier
this year, it is also the top coeducational school in the FT-1,000.
But most remarkably, Leicester Grammar opened as recently as 1981. The
centuries of tradition and wealthy endowments boasted by most schools above
it in the tables, and many below it, might be expensive luxuries.
Leicester Grammar started in response to public demand following the
abolition of the city's state grammar schools.
As the history of the school's first 10 years proclaims, the Grammar is 'a
product of the enterprise culture of the 1980s'. A group of worthies clubbed
together to take over the buildings of one of the old grammar schools when
it was closed by the council. Its fees still put it high in the
value-for-money league tables, and it has expanded rapidly - from 94 pupils
on opening day in 1981 to 565 now. The only problem is overcrowding.
Ingenuity has allowed the school to reclaim every nook and cranny in the
buildings it has inherited. Music rooms are in the cellar, while a
fully-equipped multigym lurks in what used to be a broom cupboard.
Leicester cathedral, next to the school buildings, is used for religious
assemblies, while the school's impressive hall is also used for drama
rehearsals.
Lack of resources has not dented formidable extracurricular ambitions. The
school runs its own glossy magazine and the school choir has even released a
record.
Coeducation was never an issue, according to John Sugden, the headmaster. At
its foundation, the school needed as many pupils as possible and cutting out
boys or girls was ruled out on purely commercial grounds. He backs mixed
schools on educational grounds as well: 'If you put the two sexes together
you are bound, if you get the balance right, to get a better education.
Otherwise you are cutting out half the human race.'
The pupils, dressed in adult business clothes rather than uniform at
sixth-form level and including many members of Leicester's east African
Asian community, certainly seem happy with coeducation - to judge by the
necking couples to be found in the sixth form's attic-like common room,
which is off-limits to staff . . .

FT  30 OCT 93 / Fashion: Dressing for the Dolce Vita - Ralph Shandilya
contemplates the style of Gianni Agnelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH SHANDILYA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MAY have had bad habits in the old days, but never bad quality.' So said
Gianni Agnelli, thus succinctly encapsulating his personal views on life and
living - views that will be immediately recognisable to anybody who has
followed his career during the last 27 years, when as well as being chairman
of his grandfather's empire, he established his reputation as a notably
stylish dresser. He sensed, with finer antennae than almost anybody else,
that an important part of life's drama is acted out on the level of style.
In the land of La Bella Figura, where how you dress matters more than almost
anywhere else in the world, he carved a special niche for himself.
In republican Italy, L'Avvocato, or Il Re, as he was variously dubbed,
became a potent myth for the masses and one of the most charismatic figures
in Italian public life for many a long decade. When Gianni Agnelli wore his
watch on the outside of his cuff, thousands of would-be snappy dressers did
likewise.
When Gianni Agnelli tied his tie with a thick and glossy knot, so did young
men the length of Italy.
Where this famous style began it is hard to say. His childhood influences
(which include an English governess, an Anglo-American princess mother and a
formidably powerful grandfather) must all have played their part. Rich,
pampered, brought up in many-splendoured mansions, his tutelage in dressing
began early. 'The Agnelli children,' Alan Friedman tells us in his biography
of Agnelli, 'were always dressed as sailors - blue for winter, white and
blue in the spring and autumn, and white in summer. At lunch the little
Agnellis changed into formal and elegant clothes: with short silk socks.'
After war and military duties were over, with an annual income of around
Dollars 1 million and the world his oyster, Agnelli took to heart his
grandfather's words - 'Have a fling for a few years, get it out of your
system'. He embarked on the serious business of driving fast cars and
chasing beautiful women.
Over the years he developed a personal style that became a national
trademark. His great leonine head, the skilful way he has mastered the art
of wearing a permanent tan, his taste for a sober elegance enlivened with
just the right touches of elan, have combined to give him almost cult status
among the fashion cognoscenti. All over Italy his stylistic foibles are
noted - his wearing of Brooks Brothers' shirts with the collar buttons
undone, his turning up at business meetings with old-fashioned suede
after-ski boots with the laces undone, for pairing dark shirts with light
ties, gangster-style.
As Robert Graham, our Rome correspondent puts it, 'Some people wear clothes
like a male model, others like a charmer and Gianni Agnelli wears them like
the real charmer that he is. He has that seductive way of concentrating on
you and what you are saying that all true charmers have. Another part of his
charm is the way he seems to run his business - more like a bailiff guarding
the family inheritance than a go-getting, cost-cutting businessman.' Franca
Sozzani, editor of Italian Vogue, is a longstanding devotee of Agnelli's
style. 'He really is the only businessman I admire. He is effortlessly
stylish and this style emanates through the smallest details.'
Quite how it is and why it is that a 72-year-old man, who really wants to
retire but has been ordered by his bankers to stay on, can still command the
attention of the paparazzi and the followers of fashion is something of a
mystery - but command it he does. Agnelli-style still sets a standard of
masculine elegance that many want to emulate.
Here RALPH SHANDILYA analyses the essential ingredients of Agnelli style.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Homage to Catalonia - French elegance in
Spanish brandy / Spirits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH spirits drinker is a wretchedly conservative beast. Take brandy.
This means cognac or, very occasionally, armagnac. Sometimes, it means
rather cheap French grape brandy mixed with soda in the pub; but this is
less a matter of choice, rather the chicanery of brewers who count on the
drinker asking for brandy, not cognac.
Spanish brandy is something else altogether. In Jerez, where 90 per cent of
it is made, they add such flavourings to the casks as sweet, boiled grape
must, caramel and cane syrup, or anything else which might give the spirit
some individuality: plums, apricots, prunes or, in some cases, even nuts.
The result is that many Spanish brandies have big, sweet fruit flavours of
the sort which the Cognacais finds vulgar.
Spain has another brandy producing region, though: Catalonia. And here the
spirits are made in a tamer, more elegant French style. The biggest Catalan
producer is the Miguel Torres winery at Villafranca del Penedes, near
Barcelona. It started making brandy in 1928, mainly to supply the important
local market: in Spain, workers like a slug of brandy in their morning
coffee and are not too fussed about its quality.
Torres, however, has moved steadily up-market over the years and now makes
some of Spain's most prestigious wines. Sooner or later, the brandy had to
follow the same path - out of the column stills, which made spirits for the
workers, and into the expensive pot stills from Cognac which produce a
refined spirit more appropriate to the dinner table.
Torres makes six brandies and a sweet liqueur based on brandy and oranges.
The first two brandies in the range, the Solera Select and the Gran Reserva
(known as Torres 5 and 10), are produced in continuous stills and matured
according to the solera method where older casks are topped-up constantly by
younger spirits.
Fontenac is the cheapest of the pot still spirits and spends four years in
American oak casks. Miguel Torres is aged for eight years in French oak.
Then come the two brandies at the top of the range: Miguel I, aged 10-12
years in French oak, and Honorable, aged 15-20 years. Only limited amounts
of each are made, and both are rather expensive.
The 5 and 10 are produced from the trinity of grapes responsible for the
sparkling wines of the region: Parellada, Macabeo and Xarel-lo. The better
brandies are made from a pure Parellada, with the exception of Honorable
which is distilled from the cognac grapes Ugni Blanc and Folle Blanche.
Almost certainly, Parellada is responsible for something of the difference
of character between cognac and a Penedes brandy.
Unless the grapes are picked early (as they must be for brandy), those on
the Parellada vine achieve monstrous size, averaging more than a kilo a
bunch. Flavour is not their strong point. At 70 per cent, I imagined 1 could
smell the Catalan breakfast doughnut or Xuxo in its slightly sweet bouquet;
but maybe I was simply hungry. After prolonged ageing in Limousin oak casks,
however, the spirit sheds this sweet character and mellows into something
very delicate and much closer to cognac than I might have imagined.
This was amply proven by the blind tasting of three brandies I did with the
distiller Matias Llobet. The first flight of three brandies were all dark
spirits.
The first two, with their sweet, caramelly or raisiny bouquets, clearly were
Spanish - and Jerezanos too. But the third? Though a deep mahogany, the nose
was subtle and the palate grapey. This was the Torres 10. The others were
Osborne's super-popular Magno and Domecq's Carlos III. In the second round,
the same Torres brandy also trounced the tarty three-star cognac from
Courvoisier.
Three more brandies appeared in the next flight. The first I found a little
short on the nose, but elegant and structured nicely on the palate. The two
rivals scored better on the nose but, on tasting them, they were fiery and
slightly coarse. The results of this round were revealing: the smoothest was
Miguel Torres brandy; the others were VS0Ps from Hennessy and Martell at
Pounds 5 to Pounds 10 more a bottle.
Three more brandies appeared in the next round. The first had a superb
bouquet: nuts, prunes, oranges and orange blossom; a classic example of what
the Cognacais call rancio. It was lovely to drink, too. The second was also
exquisite just to sniff, but less impressive to drink. The third paled
slightly before the first two: not in the same league. It was Miguel Torres.
The first two were Martell Cordon Bleu and Hennessy XO at three and four
times the price. It clearly does not pay to be conservative as far as brandy
is concerned.
Torres 10 is available in the UK from Moreno Wines (tel: 071-286-0678 or
071-723-6897) at Pounds 13.99, or from branches of the North-Eastern Co-op
at Pounds 11.95. Miguel Torres brandy is Pounds 19.95 from Moreno; Pounds
20.30 from Rackhams of Birmingham (021-2363333); or Pounds 22.50 from
Selfridges (071-629-1234).

FT  30 OCT 93 / Why costs don't count: Every parent's fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, FT Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a good story about the National Health Service; about NHS doctors,
nurses and administrators delivering unrivalled standards of care and
efficiency. Sadly it may turn out to have an unhappy ending.
It starts with a personal experience: the only sort that counts in an age in
which we too often judge the worth of our public services in terms of
financial bottom lines and cost-benefit analyses.
My three-year-old daughter Jessica has a heart complaint. It was spotted two
years ago by a diligent GP treating her for a particularly nasty cold. Since
then she has been an out-patient at Guy's hospital.
Until this summer regular checks at the hospital's department of paediatric
cardiology had shown the condition - a narrowing of the aortal valve - was
stable. At some stage she would need an operation - and eventually a heart
valve transplant - but the longer it could be left the better the prognosis.
Two months ago came the bad news. The latest check had revealed a sharp
deterioration in the pressures inside the valve. Jessica would need at the
minimum an exploratory operation and perhaps direct intervention to widen
the valve.
That, as every parent will know, is when the panic started. But in our case
it was also when the NHS showed its worth.
Jessica was summoned back within days so the consultant in charge of her
case could conduct the tests again personally. The results were the same. We
were told she would have to be admitted.
Giving us all the time we needed, the consultant explained the diagnosis
would be rechecked under general anaesthetic and, if necessary, the valve
stretched by the catheter 'balloon' technique pioneered at Guy's during the
1980s and now used to treat even unborn babies.
Then came the bad news. Jessica's case was serious but not an emergency. She
would have to go on the waiting list. Her consultant was not quite sure how
long that would be. But obviously the sooner the operation was done the
better. The risk of damage elsewhere in the heart meant it should not be
left longer than a few months. Instantly, images flooded our minds of
Jessica suffering heart failure while waiting for an NHS bed.
It was at this point that our preconceptions crumbled. Fearful of delay we
explored the option of having the operation done privately. Like many cynics
I had always assumed that consultants - especially in high-tech specialisms
 -would never pass up the chance to switch patients from NHS to private
lists. And such is the standing of paediatric cardiology at Guy's it already
attracts private patients from around the world. I do not have private
medical insurance but what's a few thousand pounds or so in such
circumstances?
I was wrong. The doctors caring for Jessica advised us to wait. Why not see
if an NHS bed came up. And if we wanted a second opinion, no problem. All
Jessica's notes would be faxed to whatever consultant we chose.
So we contacted the senior paediatric cardiologist at the Hospital for Sick
Children in Great Ormond Street. Since we wanted to see him within days we
were quite willing to pay. No need. He would fit us in outside his normal
clinic - but on the NHS. His advice - delivered without regard for what must
be pretty valuable time - was to stick with Guy's. We should not worry about
waiting up to three months. Beyond that we could re-explore the options.
From here on in the story gets still better. Guy's came back with an early
date - the waiting list was not as bad as feared. Jessica had her catheter
examination and the valve turned out to be in better shape than expected.
With luck, major surgery will not be needed until she is much older. By then
the technology will have advanced still further.
During a few days as an in-patient her treatment - from doctors, nurses,
technicians and everyone else - was exemplary. We saw for ourselves what the
combination of sophisticated equipment and a caring medical team can
produce. In many other places the only option would have been open heart
surgery, with all its attendant risks.
So what moral should be drawn? It is not, I am afraid, that the government's
reforms have transformed the health service. Guy's may or may not have
become a bit more efficient since it became a joint hospital trust with St
Thomas'. But it worked for Jessica because of the dedication of staff and
availability of expensive but invaluable equipment. People and resources,
not structures, were the key.
It is here that we come to our fears of an unhappy ending. In spite of its
envied reputation, there are strong rumours that a number of Guy's high-tech
specialisms, including paediatric cardiology, will all but disappear through
the merger with St Thomas's. All London hospitals must save money.
Individual units may be a national asset at the leading edge of medical
research. But things like that tend not to show up on the cost-benefit
analyses of trust hospitals. Nor, it seems, is there any strategic authority
ready to make the wider judgment. Next time Jessica needs an operation, I
fear it will be an altogether different story.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A wizard of Oz weaves a spell in Italy -
Jancis Robinson meets a very well-travelled moustache / Wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time I spoke on the telephone with South Australian wine-maker
Geoff Merrill, he was still recovering from cricketer Ian Botham's most
recent testimonial. He had got to bed at 3.45am and had to be on a 7.55am
flight to Rome. He made it.
Thus, he kept his promise to Sainsbury's, the UK supermarket giant, to see
some Orvieto and Frascati fermentations bubbling away before turning his
hired Lancia north and driving 680 km to position himself in readiness for a
hard spell of wine-making the next day. 'I've been told I must have been the
most photographed person in Italy last September, the speeds I've been doing
on those autostradas,' he told me. his
Merrill is one of those characters whose reputations precede them. Somehow,
our paths had never crossed - a lack of cricketing expertise on my part,
perhaps - and I was all prepared for Les Paterson incarnate. What I got was
a silk-shirted charmer with flowery waistcoat, a bunch of irises and a
handlebar moustache.
Sainsburys's, the most sober of the supermarket chains, has hired Merrill to
inject some Australian 'fruit - driven' character into an array of Italian
wines made at premises owned by Gruppo Italiano Vini, Italy's most dynamic
group of co - operatives. According to witnesses, the facial expressions
above the Italians' Milanese suits when Merrill was presented to them were
wonderful.
What Merrill did not realise when he took on the job is quite how long he
would spend in the Lancia between what turned out to be seven different
wineries from Rome to the Alps. In one 24-hour stretch, he drove 1,600 km.
'I had to work even harder in Italy than I do back home. There, you just
ring up and get answers to 'What's the sugar level? Any sulphide on the
nose?' You can't in Italy. You have to jump in your car in Trento and drive
to bloody Rome and back.'
Merrill swears he loves the Italians, though. Great people. Great food. Some
great wines, especially Tuscan reds. 'The elegant tannins in those Antinori
wines. That's what I'm trying to go for at home. I'm not a big rap for
Valpolicella, mind you, but I liked those - whaddyacall them? - Amarones.
That's all I drank up there (in Valpolicella country). Fifteen per cent
alcohol, mind you. Not very clever, was it?
'The only thing is, the way those guys eat lunch. You can forget asking
someone to give you a reading at five to twelve. Or put some Chardonnay into
oak on a Saturday, even if it's really ready for it. Could be the start of
the shooting season, or something really important like that.
'And d'you know what? At six o'clock, they go home] Chief wine-maker came up
to me at the end and shook my hand. 'You work very hard,' he said. Well, I
wouldn't want it any other way.'
Merrill's main amendments to the Italian wine-making recipe have been to
ferment cooler and use different yeasts, all the time trying desperately to
protect the embryonic wine from oxygen, the obverse of Italian philosophy.
'In terms of machinery, Italians have got it all. But what they don't have
is enough refrigeration, and it can be hot out there.'
Merrill claims he took on the job to keep sweet a very important British
customer for his own Mount Hurtle Australian wines. Sainsbury's, on the
other hand, realised that only someone who was his own boss would be allowed
out.
This is not the first time an Italian winery has seen the arrival of a
'flying wine-maker' during the quiet season down under. The ubiquitous
Jacques Lurton turned out some Basilicata wines last year, and Ricasoli of
Tuscany had a little help from South Australia. This year Gaetana Carron,
formerly of Rosemount (Australia), Trimbach (Alsace) and Concha y Toro
(Chile), has been working the vintage all over northern Italy.
Sainsbury's buyers are flying to Verona on Monday to choose from the
Merrill/GIV Bianco di Custoza, Pinot Grigio, a couple of Chardonnays, a
Veneto Sauvignon, a Cabernet or two, a Teroldego, a Frascati, an Orvieto,
and trials of varietal Grechetto and Verdello, two of Italy's less exposed
grape varieties. Deciding how to market them might be even more difficult,
though. A Vino Merrillo label? The Ozitalia range? Or GIVusabeer?
Footnote: Merrill must have found it difficult to improve on GIV's
Chardonnay delle Tre Venezie (Pounds 3.59 Sainsbury's). Best Merrill buys
are vehemently Australian. Mount Hurtle Grenache Shiraz 1992 (Pounds 3.99 at
Oddbins and Pounds 4.15 at Sainsbury's) is a juicy antipodean answer to
early-drinking Cotes du Rhone. Cockatoo Ridge Chardonnay 1993 (Pounds 4.19
at Oddbins) combines body with vivacity. Mount Hurtle Grenache Rose 1993
(Pounds 4.95 Sainsbury's) shows us what most Tavel is not.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Sport: Mansell keeps the fire of desire alight - Motor
Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIFE IN the US and on the IndyCar circuit has changed Nigel Mansell
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
outside the cockpit, at least.
After a year away from the political world of Formula One, Mansell has lost
the wary defensiveness which appeared to make him the most miserable grand
prix world champion on record. He is confident, relaxed and smiles readily.
The paranoia has gone.
Today the only racing driver in history to hold both the grand prix and
IndyCar world championships simultaneously might have been on his way to
Adelaide to drive in next week's final grand prix of the season. With the
IndyCar title tucked safely in his belt he was contractually free to take up
offers from a couple of serious grand prix teams to drive in both the
Japanese and Australian grands prix. That could have earned him close to
Pounds 1m.
Instead, today and tomorrow he will be at Donington Park in central England,
racing a Ford Mondeo touring car and one of the cheap but mighty Tuscans
produced by the Blackpool sports car maker, TVR.
If he wins in the Mondeo he will earn Pounds 12,000 in prize money on top of
the comparitively modest Pounds 100,000 Ford isthought to be paying him. TVR
chairman Peter Wheeler, who will be racing against Mansell himself, says
Mansell will be driving the TVR for 'a couple of coffees and a bun like the
rest of us'.
If it is not for the money or prestige, I ask Mansell, is he doing the
unthinkable by grand prix standards - and just driving for the hell of it?
The grin that comes back is huge. He wants, he says, 'to have some fun.'
Every driver will be risking all to beat him. The chances are that someone
will. These drivers have raced together all season. They know their cars;
each others' foibles. Whichever way it goes, Mansell is the, theoretically,
loser. If he wins, that is no more than the world expects. If he is beaten,
the popular press will have a field day.
But Mansell will give both races all he has. It is plain that even after all
this time at the top, he would race dustbin lorries if there were nothing
else to hand.
It is that undiminished desire to compete which, allied to his unquestioned
track skills, explains so much of Mansell's success. His attitude this
weekend is in stark contrast to the jaded tensions which envelope grand
prix, and once again causes it to say goodbye to its new world champion,
Alain Prost.
Prost's critics say that that he has lost motivation - that the fire has
gone out. There was a fierce parting shot from Bernie Ecclestone, head of
the Formula One Constructors' Association and the man effectively in charge
of grand prix. 'Nobody,' he declared, 'is bothered about Prost. Racing will
go on without him.'
It was understandable that Prost, 38, should take the attack personally. But
the episode has a wider significance, it provides evidence of a shift in
attitudes towards drivers. It is perceived that starting grids have become
over-populated with overpaid, over-aged and too often under-committed
drivers. Fearful of losing its huge audiences and sponsorship, grand prix
has tended to cling to its established stars. But this year in the absence
of one of Mansell, it has found out how quickly, among the public, new
heroes can supplant the old.
At the Portugese Grand Prix in Estoril, Prost's young fellow Williams driver
Damon Hill started from the back of the grid, Hill scythed his way through
the field and was only seven seconds behind Prost by the end. Between them,
Hill and Prost display most of the ingredients which go to make up
successful racing drivers.
Prost is nicknamed 'the Professor'. His approach has become wholly scientic.
In Prost's world, a racing car driven with its tail hanging even slightly
out is a car wasting energy which should be propelling it forward. Prost is
the ultimately 'tidy' driver.
But that very precision has frequently been called boring. So has been
Prost's wholly rational philosophy of winning races at the slowest possible
speed and least possible risk.
Prost has mostly won from the front this year in a car universally
acknowledged to be the quickest. Had the Williams-Renault proved vulnerable,
few would have expected Prost to tiger his way round any performance deficit
as Michael Schumacher has done so brilliantly in the Benetton.
Hill, in contrast, has everything to play for. His natural talent and innate
car control are not in doubt. But nor is that of Hakkinen, Schumacher, Jean
Alesi, Rubens Barichello and several others among the up and coming F1
driver crop.
Both young and old guard are, almost without exception, physically fit.
There is no choice if massively variable forces of up to 5g are to be
survived for nearly two hours.
Where they differ is in commitment - the willingness to go out to the ragged
edge, and occasionally and expensively beyond, in seizing any and every
overtaking opportunity.
Only a very few, such as Mansell and Senna, retain their aggression
undiminished - Senna sometimes off the track as well as on - as Mansell's
kamikaze antics on Indy's ovals have shown. Cliche it may be, but grand prix
drivers require courage. But then, back in the early 1980s, former world
champion Nicky Lauda could be heard talking about the enthusiasm and
'madness' of his young team mate, Alain Prost.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Sport: Big boys come out to play - The US league starts
without its biggest star. Who will replace Michael Jordan? / Basketball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH, the day after Michael Jordan, professional basketball's biggest
star, unexpectedly retired from the game at the peak of his powers, the
former Boston Celtic player Kevin McHale said something shocking. He said
that within a year or two, basketball fans would be asking: 'Michael Who?'
The astute McHale did not mean to diminish Jordan's nine-year career, in
which the Chicago Bull's guard won three consecutive National Basketball
Association championships, three most valuable player awards, and seven
consecutive scoring titles.
McHale was pointing out that basketball would survive the loss of its
greatest star, that the memory of Jordan's greatness would soon be
superseded by the reality of younger players reaching heights of their own,
and that the memory of Chicago's three consecutive league titles would
quickly be dulled by the rise of other teams to the NBA championship.
Among the tidal wave of hype and hyperbole that accompanied Jordan's
retirement in October, McHale's remark was a refreshing dose of realism.
Yet, it was also a trifle hyperbolic itself.
Jordan was more than just the best player in basketball. To millions in the
US and around the globe, he was basketball. Although others began the game's
revival in the early 1980s, it was Jordan who helped make basketball the
fastest-growing, most glamorous and sexiest, professional team sport in the
world.
But, the league goes on without him, and his early retirement will make the
new NBA season (which opens this week) the most competitive in years.
Although Jordan was always ably assisted by his team mates (whom he cheekily
dubbed his 'supporting cast'), the Bulls would never have won one
championship, let alone three, without him. Now that he is gone, the few
teams that came close to matching Chicago and Jordan in the playoffs in
recent seasons - the Phoenix Suns, the New York Knicks, the Portland
Trailblazers, and the Cleveland Cavaliers - have the best shot at winning
the NBA title next spring.
Of those four, the first two will start as favourites to meet in the final,
assuming the Suns' unpredictable leader Charles Barkley, stays fit enough to
play and keeps out of trouble, and the Knicks' hot-headed heavyweights keep
their collective cool when big games are on the line. Both Portland and
Cleveland, however, look past their prime.
The Bulls themselves cannot be overlooked as contenders. They may have lost
their maestro, but in Scottie Pippen they have one of the best five players
in the NBA, and in Toni Kukoc, the recently signed 6 ft 11 in Croatian, they
have a versatile playmaker who dominated European basketball.
Then there are a handful of teams which have flirted with success in recent
years but which have struggled to progress in the playoffs, such as the Utah
Jazz, Seattle SuperSonics, Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs.
Golden State could succeed, but only if their heralded new recruit from the
college game, Chris Webber, plays to his potential.
There are also some outsiders, most of them built around young, unproven
players. Teams such as the Charlotte Hornets, Orlando Magic, and New Jersey
Nets possess some of the most explosive raw talent in the game, and
represent the NBA's bright future. Yet, they remain works in progress, and
it will probably be two or three years before they join the elite.
The NBA, however, has always been more about individuals than teams, and the
most intriguing question this season is who will become the dominant
personality of the post-Jordan era?
Barkley would probably regard himself as heir to Jordan's throne.
Bull-shaped, bald-headed, and big-mouthed, the 30-year old Barkley is the
NBA's favourite anti-hero. Fans adore his aggressive, highly physical play,
but therein lies his weakness. Already struggling with recurrent back
problems, he is not sure how long he can last, and has already hinted that
he may retire at the end of this season.
No, the NBA will have to look to younger stars for its next Michael Jordan.
The Orlando Magic behemoth Shaquille O'Neal looks the obvious successor, not
least because his sponsors Reebok, the shoe manufacturers, have already
anointed him the world's newest sports phenomenon.
The 21-year old O'Neal (who will be playing an exhibition game in London
this weekend) is what basketball coaches like to call an 'impact' player. At
7 ft 1 in and 300 lbs, the Orlando centre made an impact as a rookie last
year, scoring 23.4 points-per-game and dominating the most important part of
the court - underneath the basket. O'Neal is quick, and very strong. So
strong that he has twice pulled the entire basket, backboard and supporting
rig to the floor during games with spectacular slam-dunks.
O'Neal was voted rookie of the year last season, but the player who came
second in the ballot, Charlotte's Alonzo Mourning, displayed as much
potential as his rival. Although smaller and lighter than O'Neal, Mourning
plays the same pivotal position of centre, and does so with great drive and
aggression. He is quicker than O'Neal, a better dribbler and passer and a
more accurate shooter. Aided by Larry Johnson, the rookie of the year in the
1991-92 season, Mourning is expected to lead Charlotte to a championship
sometime this decade.
Barring serious injury, O'Neal, Mourning and Johnson should be the game's
biggest stars (both in size and reputation) for some time to come. In fact,
the big men should dominate the NBA well into the 21st century, because this
season's top rookies, like Webber of Golden State and Jamal Mashburn of the
Dallas Mavericks, share the same attributes of strength and size that
distinguished last year's crop.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Travel: Loved the Galapagos, loathed the red tape - Richard
Mooney visits the Ecuadorian islands made famous by Darwin but discovers
that a mouth-watering itinerary can prove deceptive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED too good to be true. 'Cruise the Galapagos Islands with Gerald
Durrell,' the advertisement said.
To visit the Galapagos archipelago, cradle of Darwinian evolutionary theory
and home to many unique species, was a long-cherished dream; and to meet
Durrell, naturalist, author and founder of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust, had for 30 years been among my wife's fondest ambitions.
A call to Superlative Travel, the London agent, brought a mouth-watering
itinerary by return post: three days at leisure in Quito (capital of
Ecuador, of which the Galapagos Islands are a province); a flight to the
islands to join the cruise ship, followed by five days hopping between no
fewer than seven of them; and return to Quito for Andean tours on the final
day. So we booked. The cost was Pounds 4,998 for two.
The first change of itinerary came a few weeks later. We were told that
over-booked flights from Quito meant we had to join the ship at the main
port of Guayaquil, an hour's flight from the capital; sail the 600 miles to
the Galapagos; and, on completion of the island-hopping, sail north to Costa
Rica before heading homewards. That resulted in a two-day extension to the
13-day holiday - an inconvenience, but hardly a disaster.
The writing, however, was on the wall.
Ten days later we arrived in Quito and, having made contact at the airport
with one other UK adventurer, were transported to the Grand Hotel Colon. We
became uneasy at the continued absence of a detailed itinerary.
A telephone call to the office of Metropolitan Touring, which was handling
the mainland phase of the holiday, and a request to speak to Paddy Romirez,
named as local contact in our pre-departure information sheet, produced only
consternation. An English speaker was found and the request repeated. Deeper
consternation.
Eventually, someone was found who had heard of Romirez (apparently, he
worked for another company altogether and was based in Dallas, Texas). More
helpfully, someone else in the office knew the arrangements for that
evening.
Contact having been established, the Andean tours (brought forward in the
changed itinerary) passed off enjoyably and reasonably smoothly. Then came
the time for transfer to Guayaquil and the high seas, or so we thought.
The air transfer was all right but the high seas had to wait. The ship had
been unable to dock at the port and was sailing direct to the islands, to
which we were to fly next day.
The morning saw the party, which had grown to five while in Quito, augmented
further by two American passengers who were rejoining the ship after a spell
of back-packing in Peru; and a Newfoundlander, Kevin, who was taking over as
ship's chef. The three-hour flight seemed longer in the cramped light
aircraft that had been chartered specially, and it was with some relief that
we landed on the island of San Cristobal.
The ship had not yet arrived so we were put up overnight in a small hotel
where Ernesto, a naturalist-guide, gave us an introductory lecture in the
evening, laying particular stress on the restrictions under which visitors
were placed.
Wildlife reserve areas could be visited only in the company of a licensed
guide and visitors had to keep to the designated trails; no food was to be
taken ashore; smoking was banned, as was flash photography; touching the
animals was forbidden; and footwear was to be washed on departure from each
island as a precaution against plant seeds being transferred and upsetting
the fragile balance of their unique eco-systems.
Next morning, the odyssey was resumed with a five-hour trip in a small, slow
and incommodious boat to the island of Espanola. Earth has plenty of things
to show more fair than this featureless platform of volcanic rock, but dull
would be the person unmoved by its inhabitants' extraordinarily relaxed
attitude to humankind. And so accessible is its profuse wildlife that more
species can be seen in an hour on Espanola than in a week almost anywhere
else.
As soon as we dropped anchor, our dinghy was appropriated as a perch by two
brown pelicans. And as this vessel ferried us ashore past marine iguanas,
both swimming and sunning themselves sinisterly on the rocks, we were joined
by a young sea lion showing ill-concealed delight at our arrival. This usher
conducted us eagerly on to the beach, where lay a score of older members of
his extended family.
It seemed that most of the neighbourhood had turned out to receive us.
Frigate birds wheeled overhead; mocking birds hopped around us; Galapagos
doves made more sedate inspections. Little lava lizards scuttled to and fro,
going over, rather than round, lounging iguanas. A few yards away, a
Galapagos hawk was casting a beady eye over the new arrivals.
Arriving back on San Cristobal after another tedious five hours at sea, we
found the ship in the harbour and Patrick Shaw, the tour host, at the hotel.
Within 20 minutes, we and our luggage were on board. The information sheet
had said that the Northern Ranger was 'comfortable but not luxurious,' which
turned out to be a fair description. Its appointments were what might have
been expected of a craft designed to ferry fisherfolk and supplies up and
down the Labrador coast during the northern summer. Accommodation was in
cabins rather than suites, furnished with bunks rather than beds, and
'facilities' rather than bathrooms. But it did have air-conditioning.
At that evening's briefing, the hand-to-mouth nature of the voyage's
organisation began to become apparent. Shaw revealed that it had proved
impossible to get permission for the Northern Ranger to move to any other
anchorage during its stay in the archipelago. Thus, our trips over the next
four days would, like our visit to Espanola, have to be conducted as return
journeys on small Ecuadorian craft, restricting severely the scope of our
expeditions.
Conversations with our shipmates, mostly elderly Americans and Canadians who
had boarded three weeks earlier in Argentina, confirmed that confidence in
the organisational skills of Blyth and Co., the Toronto-based cruise
operator, had expired soon after the Northern Ranger rounded the southern
tip of the continent. And a lengthening list of cancelled excursions and
aborted landfalls had done nothing to revive it.
Somewhat daunted, my wife and I retired to the promenade deck. There, in the
sultry darkness, the islands' enchantment began to work on us once more. As
we watched sea lions hunting flying fish attracted by the ship's lights, our
spirits rose. We were in the Galapagos; Gerald Durrell was on board (we had
met his wife, Lee, but not yet the man himself); and, if not exactly
cruising, at least we were afloat.
The next two days were spent very enjoyably - except for the sweltering,
interminable boat rides - on visits to sites on San Cristobal (red-footed
boobies, marine iguanas, more sea lions), followed by a crossing to Santa Fe
island (land iguanas, more finches, still more sea lions) and on to Santa
Cruz, where we were rejoined by the Northern Ranger before leaving Galapagos
waters the next day.
What lay ahead was the two-day journey north to Puntarenas in Costa Rica,
during which long turtle- and dolphin-spotting vigils would be interspersed
with lectures and slide shows presented by Gerald and Lee Durrell (herself a
noted naturalist).
The hurried manner of our departure from Santa Cruz (the captain had been
given a deadline to depart, under naval escort if necessary, whether or not
all his passengers and crew were back on board) underlined the basic problem
that resulted in the uncomfortably ad hoc arrangements of our stay in the
islands. We were not welcome. This is not to say there was any
unpleasantness towards the visitors from individual Galapagans; anything
but. It was between the organisers and the local authorities that the
tension existed - and one had to admit the authorities had a point.
As the jewel in the crown of Ecuadorian tourism the Galapagos group is,
understandably, guarded jealously. If this third world country is to
maximise its revenues from the limited number of visitors the islands can
sustain without irreparable harm to their ecologies, those revenues must be
earned chiefly at sea. So, cruising the islands in foreign vessels is,
effectively, banned.
On our return, I checked with a London-based firm, Twickers World, which has
been taking tourists to the Galapagos Islands for more than 20 years. It
confirmed that the only way to cruise the islands is to transfer on arrival
to a licensed Ecuadorian vessel. So now we know. Next time we will make sure
our trip is organised according to Ecuadorian rules.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Travel: Not many people know about El Salvador . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO HUNDRED years ago, a hole appeared in the ground somewhere in western El
Salvador and a huge fountain of lava and ash spewed out to form a perfect
volcanic cone 4,000ft high. Over the years it remained almost permanently
active and, late in the 1950s, the government decided to build a lavish
hotel on an adjoining peak with spectacular views into the crater.
Just as the Hotel Montana was about to open its doors in October 1966,
Izalco volcano let out one last rumble and, to this day, has remained
perfectly, stubbornly dormant. Such is the luck that has dogged the history
of El Salvador's tourist industry.
In recent years, events have taken several turns for the worse, with a
terrible civil war and a frail peace accord in 1992 doing little to promote
the country as a holiday destination.
The capital, San Salvador, once was an elegant colonial city but has twice
been destroyed by earthquakes and is now dominated by a monstrous,
unfinished concrete cathedral. Building started in the 1950s but, during the
war, the liberal archbishop, Oscar Romero, ordered church funds to be spent
instead on the poor. Despite his murder by a death squad 13 years ago, the
cathedral shows no signs of being completed.
In the 1980s, other Central American countries seized on developments in
international tourism, with Guatemala cashing in on its colourful indigenous
population and Costa Rica catering to the fast-growing demands of
eco-tourism. But El Salvador seems to have missed the boat again. Its own
indians apparently have decided to adopt western culture, trading in their
traditional garb for T-shirts and jeans. Even the country's principal
pre-Colombian ruin, a 10th century pyramid at Tazumal, has been restored
crudely in concrete. The countryside is beautiful but farmed intensely:
eco-tourists want to see jungle, not banana groves and coffee plantations.
At the tourist office in San Salvador, the staff refuse to be disheartened.
A bubbly young lady assured me there were muchos, muchos other tourists in
the country, although her excitement at my arrival suggested otherwise. She
gave me a handful of photo-copied bus timetables, a list of government
tourist centres - and suggested I visit a Texaco garage to find a road map.
I took a bus to the 'charming indian village' of Panchimalco, which
allegedly has a 'beautiful church full of colonial treasures.' Everyone
there spoke Spanish, wore Levis and seemed to be listening to heavy rock
music. The church was boarded up, apparently after a Colombian tourist had
run off with some of the colonial treasures.
Things improved at Ilopongo, just half-an-hour from the scream and stench of
San Salvador, where I found a clear blue lake five miles wide in the crater
of an extinct volcano. The water was warm, fed by hot springs, and an old
man steered me around the little craggy islands in his leaky boat. On the
shore, the government has built one of its tourist centres, a surprisingly
tasteful collection of wooden picnic tables under a cluster of palm trees.
The indians used to drown four virgins in the lake every year because they
believed it was inhabited by gods - and, with all those other tourists
mysteriously absent, it was easy to see why. The place was eerie.
On weekdays, all the tourist centres were similarly deserted but, on
Sundays, rattling buses would descend on them, packed with thousands of city
folk. Few would sunbathe or even swim, preferring instead to sit around
drinking horrifying quantities of Tic-tak, a clear rum that scientists might
like to consider as a way to power space missions. For most Salvadoreans, a
perfect Sunday seems to consist of going to church, downing two bottles of
rocket fuel at the beach and then driving home, stopping on the way for a
brief gunfight with a fellow motorist.
The second city, Santa Ana, has a small-town feel; when I got off the bus I
was approached by various people who wanted to help me find a hotel, have a
chat or just shake hands. None asked for money. It was one of the most
friendly places I have known. There were few sights; but inside the huge
neo-Gothic cathedral, under a shrine to Our Lady of Santa Ana, was an
interesting plaque which read simply: Gracias por el pick-up.
Two hours away, at Sonsonate, a week-long fiesta was getting under way in
honour of La Virgen de la Candelaria. Each evening, the streets were blocked
off with enormous loudspeakers and the salsa and merengue blasted out until
3am. At 4am, an army brass band drove around town on the back of a truck,
playing a screeching fanfare.
In the east of the country, where the war had been fought most intensely,
the fiestas were more subdued. In the small town of San Vicente, in a valley
surrounded by fields of sugar cane, people were still getting used to the
lifting of the curfew and some would not yet venture out after dark.
On the main square, the church was overshadowed by a huge military barracks,
painted lurid green and surrounded by sandbags and gun turrets. On Sunday
evening, about 30 uniformed soldiers marched out on to the leafy park, took
up positions on the bandstand and, armed with three bass drums, six tubas
and a woodwind section big enough to fill a stadium, bashed out possibly the
worst-ever public rendition of the Beatles' Yesterday.
Not a soul watched; but, across the square, a small stage had been set up
outside a chemist shop where two young men with acoustic guitars played
songs of love and freedom. A crowd of hundreds appeared from nowhere.
Eventually, the army retreated, leaving the guitarists in peace. Twenty
minutes later, a power cut threw the square into darkness and the crowd
drifted back into the shadows without complaint.
El Salvador's best chance of attracting tourists might lie in its beaches.
The long stretches of stark black sand and crashing white surf are dramatic
and deserted. Word had it that some of California's most adventurous surfers
were about to descend on a spot called Zunzal, but I swam there in complete
solitude until a military training jet roared over the horizon and buzzed me
from 20ft, almost bringing on a heart attack.
As I recovered my composure over a beer and a plate of crayfish at a wooden
beach-side restaurant, a thick-set, middle-aged man in dark glasses walked
in, looked carefully around - and then sat down to embrace a young female
companion. Outside stood his black Jeep with tinted windows and five
nervous-looking bodyguards, each with matching moustache and machine-gun.
I developed a habit as I travelled around the country of asking hotel and
restaurant staff if there really were many other tourists in El Salvador.
The answer was almost always the same. 'Oh, lots. Not right now, but we have
many, many tourists here.'
Back at the Hotel Montana, all was quiet. In the observation lounge, bored
waiters in grey tuxedos shuffled from one foot to the other, waiting for
customers. The furniture was period hi-tech, as if from an early James Bond
movie. The high-backed chairs were not worn out but faded in the sun.
I sat with a cocktail reading the paper. A banner headline read: Gran Futuro
Por Turismo Salvadoreno. More question, perhaps, than boast. I looked out of
the plate-glass window across to the volcano, half expecting an answer, but
the reply remained the same: unequivocal silence.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Travel: Masterful guide to World Heritage sites
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRICK QUESTION: how many British sites appear on Unesco's World Heritage
list of 360 'natural and spiritual treasures' of 80 countries? asks Michael
Thompson-Noel. Masterworks of Man &amp; Nature, published by Harper-MacRae at
Pounds 30, puts the answer at 14.
It is a trick question because one of them is Henderson Island, uninhabited
and largest of the Pitcairn group in the south Pacific. Henderson is
described as one of the few remaining pristine atolls anywhere, an
evolutionary laboratory with all the dynamics of natural selection on
display.
Top marks, however, if you managed to call to mind six of the remaining 13
British sites. The list: Blenheim palace, Oxfordshire; the city of Bath,
Avon; Edward I's castle and town walls, Gwynedd, north west Wales;
Canterbury cathedral, St Augustine's abbey and St Martin's church,
Canterbury, Kent; St Kilda, Outer Hebrides; Stonehenge, Avebury and
associated megalithic sites, Wiltshire; the Giant's Causeway and its coast,
Northern Ireland; Tower of London; Ironbridge Gorge, Wrekin; Westminster
palace and abbey, and St Margaret's church, London; Durham cathedral and
castle; Hadrian's wall; Studley royal park and the ruins of Fountains abbey,
North Yorkshire.
Masterworks is a thorough, well-photographed guide to all 360 World Heritage
sites, buttressed by useful essays.
Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia, co-signs the preface in which he
describes the World Heritage convention as 'one of the greatest achievements
in international co-operation of all time.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Playing it cool in the fruit
field - The chilling techniques used to ripen produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARD avocados, unloved and unwanted by supermarkets and shoppers, are what
gave Barry Cooper an opening into business.
The fruit can be imported hard and then ripened with heat and ethylene gas -
but it can get too ripe. Cooper, a self-employed refrigeration engineer, was
asked to design airspray equipment to cool the avocados and stop the
ripening process.
'The first airsprays leaked so they cost me a lot of money,' says Cooper.
However, once he overcame that problem, he had equipment enabling him to
send fruit and vegetables through the supermarkets' distribution chains in
good condition.
He joined with Ian White, then selling refrigeration equipment for a
Peterborough company, to form the Horticold company in 1989. 'I wanted to
expand the business. Ian had a good customer base and technical knowledge.
We just felt there was a huge market.'
Chilling fruit and vegetables in Britain used to be a hit and miss affair
and caused produce to dry out. It was put in a cold room or a refrigerated
lorry but a cold room simply chills the air and the cold takes a day or more
to reach the inside of the produce. Maintaining the quality of the fruit and
vegetables requires faster cooling.
But how fast? Peaches split if cooled too quickly; cucumbers go soft. There
was no research data, so Cooper and White have had to compile their own
using a mobile cold room equipped with airsprays enabling them to see how
fast the produce can safely be cooled.
White only went into refrigeration following an incident on the cricket
field. He was fielding at first slip when second slip suggested that he give
up car trading, which he had taken up after a background in engineering, and
apply for a job at a Hull refrigeration company. He got the job.
To launch Horticold, Cooper and White took out Pounds 100,000 in bank loans
against guarantees. They got their first big order quickly, a Pounds 300,000
contract to design and install equipment for a new distribution centre for
JO Sims, an importer, at Spalding, Lincolnshire.
Slowly they built up a reputation, advising and equipping other importers,
and installing small units at prices from Pounds 10,000 for farmers selling
strawberries. 'The only thing that sells an engineering product is
recommendations and track record,' says Cooper.
Then Horticold turned to the importers' suppliers in Spain, France, Greece,
Zambia and Kenya, offering to cool produce straight out of the fields, thus
allowing it to be picked ripe.
'People harvest produce unripe for a long shelf life,' says Cooper, 'but if
it ripens unnaturally the taste is not there. Peaches from Italy look
beautiful but can taste lousy. It used to take 24 hours to cool peaches. We
designed a machine that could do it in an hour.'
A staff of 12 assemble Horticold equipment at Langley, near Slough. They
also install it in Britain and overseas, and train local maintenance teams.
Turnover was Pounds 600,000 in the first year. Four years later it's Pounds
1.6m. Profit is between 3 and 5 per cent. 'We've had a few scary moments
with delayed payments and people finding excuses not to pay,' says Cooper.
'You have to run on your clients' integrity.'
Horticold is now tackling the task of promoting the sale of British fruit
and vegetables by extending the season beyond November. This means that
produce must be stored, possibly for months and then ripened.
As produce ripens it gives off carbon dioxide and sometimes ethylene, and
this mixture promotes further ripening. Cooper and White have devised a
computerised system for controlling the mixture and, through that, the
ripening process.
'We started with carrots,' says White. 'We have a project near Newark. We
have also shipped equipment to Italy for potatoes and carrots.'
They now have to wait to find out if they priced these projects correctly:
they will not know the costs until the first few are completed. They
believe, however, in doing things themselves. Cooper says: 'People want a
slice of the action. But these are our ideas. We developed them. There's no
charity when it comes to business.'
Their understanding of refrigeration and the market gives them an advantage
over less specialised companies in what they have found to be a specialised
field. 'The more cities and countries you visit, the greater depth of
understanding you acquire. And this, after all, is a technology that does
travel.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / As They Say In Europe: France insists on playing the fool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH Fifth Republic is founded on two principles: it must stand up to
its friends and cave in to its enemies. President de Gaulle laid the
groundwork when he turned on those who put him in power in 1958. He later
ditched Nato and tried to cosy up to the Russians.
Then, 20 years ago, France thought its interests lay with the oil producers
when OPEC jacked up the price: it rejected membership of the west's
International Energy Agency and went over to the other side. This resulted
in huge contracts in Iraq, for which it never got paid. More recently,
France tried to preserve East Germany, although it did not go along with
more extreme British plans in this area.
This week saw the government failing to end a strike at Air France, even
though it abandoned an essential plan to re-structure this giant loss-maker.
Nearly two-thirds of the population approved of this retreat, according to
one poll. President Mitterrand said the strikers often talked sense and gave
the kind of backing to his prime minister, Edouard Balladur, that Lady
Thatcher reserves for John Major.
On trade questions, France remains united around the neanderthal remnants of
a once-numerous peasant class. But any success achieved in protecting them
will damage the country's long-term interests and, more importantly, those
of its closest allies.
It could be that things are now getting out of hand. The president of the
European Commission has diagnosed the problem. Jacques Delors often keeps
his more valuable apercus to himself but on television nearly two weeks ago,
he revealed that the French had finally gone mad. What he said was that
France was going through a 'collective trauma which leads to bad solutions,
prejudicial to its interests'. He was talking about Gatt - the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
These four letters often arouse a certain madness - catatonia, hysterical
boredom, and even a complaint known as Gatt-rejection syndrome. German
newspapers can scarcely bring themselves to mention it. In Russia, the very
words 'Uruguayski Raund' generate disbelief and scorn.
For the French, though, international trade policy plays the same role as
vampires in Transylvanian folklore. The day after Delors' warning, there
were 27 editorials in the French press. The day after, 18. 'We are not
barmy,' was the theme.
The issue these days is not only French farming: agricultural protection is
now joined by cultural protection, otherwise known as subsidising French
films and keeping American rubbish off the small screen. In a country where
you can rely on seeing an old episode of Hawaii Five-O whenever you like,
there is clearly much to be done.
In its five-point rebuttal of everything, Nice-Matin accepted the worst the
world could throw at France: 'Must we be resigned to see ourselves
stigmatised as timid, irrelevant, limited, narrow-minded, inconsequential,
chauvinist, archaic, demagogic, and so it goes on, for the simple reason
that we care for the interests of France? One hopes this will not be so and
there still remains an opportunity for our lesson in reason to be heard.'
Most French leader writers think they are Francois Mauriac.
Another paper wrote of Balladur's 'Gaullist accents' and talked of a France
ready to 'join the Resistance' if the US persisted in its dangerous game -
'a France which will accept neither injustice, nor inequality nor
humiliation'. Le Figaro linked the Gatt struggle with the solidarity of the
Francophone group, which held a summit at about the same time. France could
escape from its encirclement by shovelling out free surplus food to its old
colonies.
Liberation, almost alone, maintains a sceptical attitude towards the
pro-peasant frenzy of the rest of the media. Referring to a prospective
piece of legislation which will make it obligatory to translate the words
'Jurassic Park' into French, it wrote: 'Drugged by a kind of plebiscite,
Edouard Balladur will be able to confront, with renewed muscle, the
yankosaurs who menace our country.'
It is the coincidence of farms and films that makes the present French stand
so interesting. The two are indeed symbols of all that it means to be
French. The only trouble is that they do not go well together: the peasant
provides a stock character of the French cinema, but a laughing stock
character. From The Sheep has Five Legs to Jean de Florette, this figure -
depicted as a timid, narrow-minded, archaic, malign, half-witted drunk -
deploys enough cunning to destroy his friends while, comically or
tragically, assuring his own demise.
Farmer France - the Movie provides a less-than-satisfactory motor for a new
Europe. Which is a pity - for France, when not playing the fool and fighting
its friends, is the country which can make this Europe something worth
joining.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Benefit turns sour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING 1991/92, I started a new job. This included a company car, with
petrol provided for business mileage only.
In my tax return for the year, I declared the appropriate scale charge,
reduced proportionately for the number of months for which the vehicle was
at my disposal, and this was accepted.
During the following year, the benefit was improved to include fuel consumed
for private mileage. I assumed I would be taxed only from when the benefit
started.
But the Revenue has now told me that 'fuel is an all or nothing charge. If
you make good the cost of all the fuel provided for private use, the car
fuel scale charge is nil. If you fail to make good the cost of all the fuel
provided for private use, the full amount of the car fuel scale charge is
chargeable.'
Is the Revenue correct that there can be no proportionate reduction in the
annual scale charge for the period before the benefit was provided? If so,
could I now reimburse my employer for private fuel costs from the date the
benefit was provided to the end of that tax year, and thereby eliminate the
tax liability?
The answer to your first question is yes, by virtue of section 158 of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 as amended for 1992-93.
The answer to your second question is no, because sub-section 6 of section
158 says that 'the cash equivalent is nil' only 'if in the relevant year . .
. the employee is required to make good to the person providing the fuel the
whole of the expense incurred by him in or in connection with the provision
of fuel for his private use and he does so . . .'
Ask your tax office for the free explanatory booklet 480 (Guide to expenses
payments and benefits for directors and certain employees). This will give
you an idea of the arbitrary nature of the rules laid down by parliament:
they do not purport to be equitable or logical.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: All downhill from this Crest - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREST is a well-known brand of toothpaste. The same name has been chosen by
the Task Force on Securities Settlement for the proposed new share
settlement system which is expected to begin operations in 1996. Rather than
give people a gleaming smile, the task force's Crest is likely to make many
private investors foam at the mouth.
In preparation for Crest, the London Stock Exchange recently announced that
a 10-day rolling settlement for UK equities would be introduced on July 18
1994. The task force has recommended that the settlement period be reduced
still further: to five days at the start of 1995.
The time taken to post and clear cheques will then make it impossible for
private investors to deal unless they leave money on deposit with their
brokers and, probably, make use of a broker's nominee service. The brokers
will either charge for this 'service' and/or make a 'turn' on the money held
on deposit, offering a lower interest rate than an investor could gain
elsewhere.
With a nominee service, all dividend cheques go to the broker, not direct to
the investor, and it is highly likely that the brokers will earn interest
for themselves on dividends for several days (or longer) before crediting
the dividends to their clients' accounts.
While I am in favour of brokers' receiving a fair return for their work, the
nominee system can cause all sorts of problems. Under a nominee system, all
company reports, takeover and other documents are sent to the nominee, not
to the shareholder. Depending on the efficiency of the nominee (many of whom
leave a lot to be desired), these documents may then be forwarded to the
private investor.
Some nominees insert their client's name after the nominee name so that,
when documents arrive, it is easier for them to discover to whom the
documents should be forwarded. Other nominees do not do this and sometimes
get in rather a muddle. In any event, delays are caused. Yet, prompt action
on receiving documents can save an investor a small fortune.
Many small companies receive little press attention and are not followed by
analysts. The private investor, therefore, has to rely on the company itself
for information. If there is some 'horror' concealed in the notes to the
accounts, then, by the time an investor receives his report via a nominee,
other people may have bailed out of the company at a far better price than
the poor nominee-dependent private investor will be able to achieve.
The supporters of the nominee system claim it is possible for investors to
get reports direct from the companies concerned. I have tried this: it does
not always work. Writing to a company secretary asking to be placed on the
company's mailing list for reports will result in a report being despatched
in the first year but, quite often, reminders have to be sent in subsequent
years. Writing to company registrars dealing with millions of shareholders
in hundreds of companies is also not always effective, either.
Getting a nominee to exercise voting rights on your behalf at an annual
general meeting can also be fraught with problems, as well as incredibly
time-consuming and costly. And as to getting 'shareholder perks,' such as
discounts on purchases from a company's stores, most companies and nominees
find this impossible to arrange.
Using a nominee means everything has to to be double-checked by the investor
 -even more time-consuming than checking bank statements for errors. At
least with cheques, you have a fairly good idea of the amounts going into
and out of a bank account; with nominee share services, there are additional
problems. For example, I once sold what I (and the nominee) thought was my
entire shareholding in a particular company only to find, almost a year
later, that I still held shares in the company as a result of an earlier
share bonus issue of which I had had no knowledge and which the nominee had
not noticed.
The scope for fraud and tax avoidance by nominees is enormous. We have all
read of companies that have gone bust and where auditors are being sued for
alleged negligence - are nominees likely to be any better? Holding shares in
my own name, I know the shares are mine: I have a share certificate in my
name, not that of a nominee. At any one time, my brokers are not holding
large amounts on my behalf: I am, therefore, well protected by the
compensation scheme.
But if everyone is forced to move to nominee services, then many people will
find the terms of that scheme inadequate because their brokers will be
holding large sums on their behalf. It is worth remembering that, under the
scheme, a claimant only receives the first Pounds 30,000 of his claim in
full and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. The maximum anyone can
receive is Pounds 48,000.
Will this mean that more private shareholders will move to large, well-known
firms of brokers in the hope that size will bring greater security? If so,
will the numbers of independent broking firms decline and thus reduce
competition, to the detriment of investors?
Even if a broking firm is financially secure, if its systems foul up or its
record-keeping is poor, then it could be costly and time-consuming to sort
out who exactly owns what within its nominee service - and so clients might
have to wait some time before being able to sell their shares or receive the
amounts that are due to them.
I have never liked nominees. Indeed, 23 years ago, when I was just investing
small sums as a student, the FT published a letter from me in which I
stated: 'Far too many sharp deals and crooked practices can be carried out
behind nominees.' How much capital gains tax is the Inland Revenue deprived
of because the unofficial owners of shares have their identities concealed
behind nominee names? If it is proposed to have identity cards to reduce the
number of social security benefit cheats, why is it legal for people to hide
behind nominee names when the scope for cheating on tax is considerable?
It surprises me that a government which spends millions of our tax on
promoting democracy in other countries should connive with the Bank of
England (leader of the Crest task force) to remove democratic rights from
private investors. The Bank of England is a supporter of the Cadbury Code of
Corporate Governance: yet, where is the proper governance when private
shareholders find unwanted, costly obstacles placed in their path designed
to make it difficult for them to attend AGMs and vote on various proposals,
including takeover bids?
It is the private investor, more than the professional investment analyst,
who is likely to notice mistakes in the annual report. Indeed, there are a
number of instances at AGMs where private investors have correctly pointed
out simple errors in arithmetic in reports which analysts have failed to
spot. It is private investors who are likely to have more courage and ask
pointed questions designed to elicit information of benefit to all
shareholders.
Like many other private investors, I like receiving direct communications
from companies and having a direct involvement with them. After all, as a
shareholder, I am one of the owners of the company.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: When age does weary them - The
options for those needing help as they grow older / Health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S population is ageing, like most of the developed world. Modern
medicine lets people live longer, but a growing number need expensive,
labour-intensive care and nursing in their final years. This could strain
both individual and national finances. A paper presented to the Institute of
Actuaries this week estimated that the demand for long-term care would rise
in real terms from Pounds 40bn a year now to Pounds 60bn in 40 years.
Demographic and social trends mean that the present heavy reliance on
informal care by relatives may no longer be feasible in future. The ratio of
retired people to the population of working age is set to rise, more women
are going out to work, family members live further apart, and rising divorce
rates mean there are more single elderly people - and fewer daughters-in-law
willing to perform traditional caring roles.
In coming decades, more people are likely to have to pay for care, but very
few are taking the logical step of planning for it. Many have the vague
feeling that the state will provide but the government has made clear that
it can no longer afford to take full responsibility for the elderly. Anyone
who has income, savings, or a home above certain limits must now pay for
care, as described in an article on these pages two weeks ago.
Within the past few years, a number of insurance companies have launched
products which aim to make paying for care easier. Sales are low as yet, and
insurers are still experimenting with product structure. One innovative
option devised by Cannon Lincoln, which packaged long-term care insurance as
part of a pension plan, was dropped after the Inland Revenue withdrew
approval.
Many insurers are hesitant to launch products while public awareness of the
need is still low, or are waiting for the government to come up with tax
incentives to kick-start the market. Bupa, the medical insurer, has been
eyeing the market for some time and could well launch a product next year.
Products available now take two main forms: insurance plans for people not
yet requiring care; and 'point of entry' plans for people who already need
to go into a nursing home but are worried about their money running out. A
few hybrid products combine an element of long-term care with life or
permanent disability insurance.
Long-term care insurance is based on a concept called 'activities of daily
living' (ADLs) - such as being continent, able to dress, wash, use the
toilet, get in and out of bed and feed yourself without assistance. Once a
person is no longer capable of a certain number of ADLs, the policy will pay
out. 'Cognitive impairment,' such as that caused by Alzheimer's disease,
will also usually act as a trigger.
Commercial Union and PPP Lifetime are the biggest players in this market,
offering similar plans at two levels. One pays out only on serious
incapacity (roughly, failing more than three ADLs), and one starts to pay at
a lower level when two ADLs are failed. As the payments are made to the care
providers - whether nursing homes or home nurses - they are tax-free. This
insurance is intended to be long term, like life assurance: the younger and
healthier you are when you start, the cheaper it will be all along. Premiums
can be paid monthly, annually or as a one-off lump sum, particularly on
retirement or when people move to a smaller home and have cash in hand.
Prime Health, a specialist health insurer, has two plans. One, called Home
Health Care, covers help in the person's own home while Home Health Care
Plus extends to nursing home care and some common inpatient surgery which
improves the quality of life, such as hip replacement operations. These are
more short-term policies, similar to private medical insurance, with
variable, annually renewable premiums.
Commercial Union is also a provider of 'point of need' plans along with
Eagle Star and Clerical Medical. The plans are all different, but have as a
common basis an enhanced annuity: anyone needing immediate nursing home care
is by definition in a poor state of health, with a correspondingly reduced
life expectancy, and so can get better than normal annuity rates.
The plans are bought with a lump sum (often from the sale of a house) and
then pay out a fixed or increasing sum every month or year for the rest of
the person's life. Often, the insurer makes an arrangement with the nursing
home that its fees will not rise more than a certain percentage a year, or
in line with a recognised index, so that no shortfall arises.
Clerical Medical's plan is rather different. It is for a fixed five-year
period and part of the lump sum goes to buy a temporary annuity. The rest is
invested in unit trusts or a Pep with the aim of replacing the capital used
to buy the annuity. After five years, another plan can be taken out or other
arrangements made.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Penny shares - why you should beware
/ The Speculator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN INVESTORS start to get interested in penny shares, that is often the
sign of a flourishing bull market. If blue chip share prices start to run
out of steam, the spotlight turns to less well-known companies which seem to
present the chance for speculative profits.
Penny shares are merely stocks with share prices of under Pounds 1 (in some
cases, under 10p). What makes them a potentially attractive investment is
that they often fall into two categories:
Those where profits have collapsed and there is the hope that the market has
under-estimated the chance for recovery.
'Shells' where there is no substantial business left. Here, the main value
of the company is the stock market quote itself. This can be used by
acquisition-minded entrepreneurs, or by other businesses which want a
listing and can 'reverse' into the shell.
Both these classes of stocks can provide attractive returns, although at a
risk; recovery stocks do not always recover and moribund shells can remain
moribund for a long time.
Investors. however, seem to have a mystical belief that penny shares must be
bargains simply by virtue of their low prices. Indeed, some may remember the
phenomenal rise of Polly Peck in the 1980s and are hoping to catch its
1990s' equivalent.
Part of the enthusiasm could be due to the feeling that investors get more
for their money with a penny share stock. Put Pounds 1,000 in ICI and you
will get 140 only shares; put Pounds 1,000 in the Millwall soccer club and
you get around 25,000. The problem with this theory is that if Millwall goes
bust, you still lose Pounds 1,000.
In fact, there is nothing magic about the share price of the company. If
someone whispers to you in the street: 'Psst. Want to buy some beer for
50p?' you would be wise to ask: 'How much beer exactly?' If the reply is a
teaspoonful, then you are being offered a bad bargain; if the answer is a
gallon, the deal might be attractive.
The key questions about a share price are not 'Is the price above or below
Pounds 1?' but 'What are the assets and the profits (or potential profits)
of the company?' and 'What proportion of those assets (and profits) do those
shares represent?' If, for instance, there were only two shares in British
Petroleum, and each was priced at Pounds 1bn, they would still be a bargain
since the whole of BP is valued at more than Pounds 18bn. But shares in a
company about to go bankrupt would be worthless at 1p, 0.5p, or 0.25p, since
shareholders would get back nothing when the company went bust.
Any quoted company could easily turn itself into a penny stock simply by
making a scrip issue; that is, issuing enough free shares. The company would
still have exactly the same assets and profits as it did before and the
shares ought to be no more or less attractive.
In practice, however, the 'bargain' effect does mean that shares tend to
rise because of a scrip issue. Scrips do not always result in penny shares;
often, they are undertaken by companies with so-called 'heavy' shares,
trading at more than Pounds 10 or so, and bring the price down to a more
palatable Pounds 4-5.
It is one thing to accept that the market can be irrational in favouring
companies with low share prices; it is a much greater leap to state that
penny shares automatically are cheap. Many investors make dangerous
assumptions, such as: 'The shares are trading at only 2p so, if they go up
to 3p, I will have made a 50 per cent profit.'
That ignores the very wide bid-offer spreads (the different prices for
buying and selling) which often apply to penny shares.
Take Dares Estates and Tamaris, two companies which were shown as trading at
2p earlier this week. That figure is, of course, just the mid-price; the
bid-offer spreads were 1 3/4 p-2 1/4 p for Dares and 1 1/2 p-2 1/2 p for
Tamaris.
In short, buy the shares of Dares and you start off with a 22.2 per cent
loss, not counting the cost of commission and stamp duty; buy Tamaris, and
you are 40 per cent in the red.
To make a 10 per cent profit on, say, 40,000 shares in Tamaris (costing
Pounds 1,000, plus Pounds 5 in stamp duty and Pounds 40 in commission), you
would need the bid price of the shares to double to 3p. Furthermore, the
'value' of penny shares often consists of the hope, or expectation of future
developments; sometimes there can be no dividend, no profits and not much in
the way of assets.
Even if the business of the company does improve, it can take a long time
for the fundamentals to catch up with the effect that sentiment has had on
the price. And if sentiment changes for the worse, the small investor will
probably be the last to hear.
So, is there any merit at all in penny shares? There can be, but only to the
extent that often they are small companies or recovery plays. Penny shares
are far more likely to be small, than large, companies; at present, the only
FT-SE 100 index constituent at present with a share price of under Pounds 1
is Asda.
The work of Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, of the London Business School, has
shown that small company shares have tended to outperform their larger
brethren over the long run. One reason is that there is more scope for small
companies to grow; another is that they tend to be under-researched and,
therefore, under-valued.
Recently, however, investors have endured four successive calendar years -
from 1989-92 - of smaller company underperformance. The small company effect
is thus not inevitable (although such shares have outperformed this year).
For the private investor, the risk of investing in individual small
companies is high; because they are highly vulnerable to the fortunes of a
major customer or a particular sector of the UK economy. The safest way of
backing the small company effect is via a specialist unit or investment
trust.
The same factors apply to recovery situations. As the long-term success of
funds such as M&amp;G Recovery has shown, it is possible to earn excess returns
by picking on stocks which the market has written off. There have been some
splendid examples of penny stock recoveries in the recent recession; Next
has climbed from 12.5p early in 1991 to near 200p today.
The O'Higgins theory, which we have written about many times in the Weekend
FT, depends partly on choosing shares with low nominal share prices. But it
limits itself to major companies, on the ground that the low price indicates
the chance to buy a sound business while it is temporarily in the doldrums.
Shares, however, do not collapse for no reason at all. Many companies which
have fallen to the status of penny shares have very real problems, which
often prove fatal. For the private investor, a broadly-spread fund of
recovery stocks is a better bet.
In short, penny stocks can have their attractions - but not because of their
price. It is the recovery or growth potential of the company that creates
the investment opportunity, not the level of the share price.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Controversy over fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER &amp; Braithwaite is launching a unit trust which, when held in a Pep,
will offer investors a tax-free income of 7 per cent. The trust has already
provoked controversy since it will deduct the annual charge from capital
rather than income - a practice which the Securities and Investments Board,
the UK's chief financial services regulator, hopes to ban.
If F&amp;B had deducted the 1.25 per cent annual charge from income, the yield
on the fund would be 5.75 per cent. So, it would be wrong to assume the F&amp;B
unit trust is better than a rival fund (which takes the annual charge from
income) offering, say, 6 per cent. But John Vintcent, chairman of F&amp;B,
points out that investment trusts are allowed to take their charges out of
capital, so why not unit trusts?
Furthermore, whether the charge comes out of income or capital should make
no difference to the total return to the investor. As yet, there is no
standardised basis for calculating unit trust yields; some trusts use the
distributions they have paid already while others use the yield they expect
to pay.
SIB is consulting on proposals to prevent funds from levying charges on
capital but the industry's trade body, AUTIF, is against such a ban. If SIB
does go ahead, F&amp;B will have to change its practice.
The F&amp;B fund's investments will be high yielding investment trust shares, UK
equities and, on occasion, fixed interest securities. F&amp;B is known best for
its expertise in investment trusts; it has the top unit trust in the IT
sector over three years. The initial charge on the fund will be 5.5 per cent
(although there is a 1 per cent discount until November 22). Minimum
investment in the Pep is Pounds 3,000.
Guinness Flight is offering a 1 per cent discount off its three UK equity
unit trusts - Recovery, High Income and Temple Bar Emerging Companies -
until November 19. The normal initial charge on them is 5.25 per cent.
The funds chosen show good short term performance, but two have rather less
impressive long term records. The Recovery fund is top of the UK Equity
Growth sector over the year to October 1 (although 105th out of 118 funds
over five years). High Income is 19th out of 107 UK income funds over one
year, but 67th over five years. Temple Bar Emerging Companies has done well
over both the short and long term; it is 11th out of 66 smaller company
funds over one year, and seventh out of 49 funds over five years.
The funds are actually even cheaper to buy through a Pep since the initial
charge is just 2 per cent. (The discount does not apply to the Pep).
Prolific Unit Trust Managers is also offering a discount off some of its
funds. In its case, the 1 per cent break is in the form of additional units
if investors buy into one of four funds - Recovery, Technology, European
Growth and American Opportunities - before November 26. All four have good
records, with top quartile (25 per cent) performance in their sectors over
one year. American Opportunities was the best US fund over the year to
October 1. The charges are 5.25 per cent initial and 1.25 per cent annual.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The Japanese fund that takes its cue
from Edinburgh - Unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS A LONG way from Scotland to Japan, but the physical and cultural
distance has not hampered the performance of the Dunedin Japanese Smaller
Companies trust - which is managed by a team based in Edinburgh and
separated by nine hours and several thousand miles from the market it
studies.
The Pounds 42m fund is top of 86 in the Japanese unit trust sector over the
year to October 1, with growth of 84 per cent (offer to bid, with net income
reinvested, source: Micropal); second over five years, with growth of 161
per cent; and eighth over three years.
Nigel Barry took over management of the fund in 1987, a year after its
launch. He also manages Dunedin's Japan Growth unit trust, and the recently
launched Dunedin Japan investment trust. He has a team of co-managers in
Edinburgh, assisted by a researcher in Tokyo since 1990. The UK team members
regularly visit Japan, seeing about 200 companies a year between them.
The investment approach is based on stock-picking, searching for good value
among the smaller companies - mostly from the second section of the stock
market and the over-the-counter market. 'Smaller' is a relative term: the
largest stock in Dunedin's portfolio has a market capitalisation of about
Pounds 3bn; the smallest, about Pounds 50m. The fund generally aims to buy
reasonably large stakes, expecting holdings to form at least 1 per cent of
the fund, so very small companies are not always suitable targets.
Share turnover is on the low side, at 30-40 per cent a year. 'I wouldn't say
the portfolio has changed a great deal in the past year,' says Barry. 'We
tend to sell a stock when we think its earnings outlook has changed, or it
becomes too expensive.'
The strength of the yen has contributed to the fund's strong performance
over the past year, but does not explain it entirely. Over the year from
October 1 1992 to October 1 1993, the fund grew by 96 per cent (offer to
offer) in sterling terms; but even in yen terms it put on a good show, with
growth of 46 per cent.
Since the fund was launched, the Japanese stock market has had something of
a roller-coaster ride, ranging from the late 1980s' boom to the early 1990s'
bursting of the bubble and on to the latest tentative signs of recovery.
Barry's strategy has had to adapt to carry the fund successfully through the
ups and downs.
Between 1988 and 1990, favoured areas included machinery and robotics
companies, as large manufacturers were increasing capacity. But in 1990,
when the market began to fall quite sharply, Barry adopted a more defensive
posture, moving into public works and housing related stocks: utilities,
road repair companies, and a few food stocks and manufacturing companies.
'We were not exactly looking for great growth, just safety,' he says.
Now that the market is starting to improve, Barry is picking a few more
economically sensitive stocks. One successful find recently was Kansai
Sekiwa, a real estate company dealing in low-price condominiums, where sales
volume is starting to increase.
The fund holds about 60 stocks. The top 10, which account for just over a
quarter of the fund, are: Sansei Yusoki (leisure and storage equipment),
Rinnai (kitchen and heating equipment), Katokichi (frozen food), Senshukai
(catalogue sales), Nissho Corp (medical equipment), Eidensha (electrical
retailer), Chofu Seisakusho (kitchen and heating equipment), Shimachu (DIY
and furniture retailer), Max (house building equipment), and Mabuchi
(electrical micromotor manufacturer).
'Dunedin are basically value investors. We don't tend to get wrapped up in
the theme of the day,' says Barry. But economic and market trends are among
the factors involved in the decision-making process. Japanese consumers, for
example, have long had the reputation of being less price-sensitive, and
more likely to buy expensive brand-name goods, than their counterparts
elsewhere in the world.
The recession appears to be changing that. Growing consumer awareness of
prices has been illustrated by the success of companies such as Aoyama, the
discount suit retailer, and other well-positioned or adaptable companies
could also benefit.
In the medium term, Barry is enthusiastic about the prospect of
deregulation, in the construction industry as well as international trade.
He is interested in companies which could benefit from trade deregulation,
such as specialist discount alcohol retailers which could import
lower-priced stock.
Other companies such as dairy product companies and bakers could do well
from buying cheaper raw materials on the international market, where prices
can be several times lower than for domestic products.
Charges. The trust has an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual charge
of 1.5; the bid-offer spread is around 6 per cent. The minimum investment is
Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 30 a month with a savings plan. There is no Pep
attached to the trust.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Henderson TR is top of the Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Touche Remnant, the merged fund management group, dominates the
top 10 performing investment trust Peps over the last three years. The list,
produced by Chase de Vere, contains five Henderson TR trusts.
The best performer, Personal Assets, which is a self-managed trust (with
links to Ivory &amp; Sime), has an investment portfolio split between the UK and
the US. Manager Ian Rushbrook says he has felt the UK market has been
undervalued for some time and has accordingly done well out of investing in
the shares of fund management companies, which represent a geared play on
the market.
Among the unit trust, the top place over three years is held by the St
James's Place Pep Progressive fund. Its sister trust, International Growth,
was covered in our Unit Trusts series recently; the management team, led by
Nils Taube, follows a stock-picking approach, linked to various investment
themes. Performance tables, covering some 550 unit and investment trust
plans, are available with Chase's Pepguide for Pounds 9.95 from: Chase de
Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3JX.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Bank warns on deposits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is issuing a leaflet to warn people about the dangers of
putting money into institutions which are not authorised by it to accept
deposits.
Called 'Money in the Bank,' it sets out some signs that should put people on
their guard - such as an offer of unusually high interest rates or an effort
to attract them into making loans to someone's companies.
It also spells out the difference between a deposit, where someone has lent
money and is entitled to have it back in full, and an investment, where
there is no promise to return the money but the lender is entitled to a
share of profits made.
The Bank is at pains to emphasise the lack of protection for someone who has
lost money with an unauthorised deposit-taker, and also the scale of the
problem.
In the cases being investigated by the Bank, up to Pounds 50m could have
been taken in illegal deposits.
'All too often, the losers are elderly and those least able to afford to
take the loss,' Bank officials say. They recall cases of pensioners who had
to return to work after losing money to unauthorised deposit-takers.
Investigations have led Bank officials to carry out interviews in such
unlikely places as London's Wormwood Scrubs prison, a brothel in Toxteth,
Liverpool, and the back seat of a two-door Ford Fiesta.
Over the past year, they have brought three prosecutions for taking
unauthorised deposits, all successful and all resulting in custodial
sentences.
Just under 500,000 leaflets are being printed and will be available from
post offices, Citizens' Advice Bureaux and libraries.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week sees several of the UK's largest retailers reporting interim
results. The UK's two most profitable retailers, Marks and Spencer and J
Sainsbury, report on Wednesday, and both are expected to show a healthy
increase in pre-tax profits. M and S is forecast to lift pre-tax profits
from Pounds 257.1m last year to between Pounds 285m and Pounds 295m this
year. Sainsbury is expected to see interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds
391.1m to Pounds 435m. But analysts are more interested in what the company
might say about the changing UK food market.
On Thursday it is the turn of Boots, which is likely to report increased
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 185m last time to about Pounds 210m,
after exceptional items relating to the sale of the French subsidiary
Sephora and the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug by Boots
Pharmaceuticals.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected on
Wednesday to report an increase of about 25 per cent in pre-tax profits for
the first nine months of the year. Forecasts range from Pounds 1.31bn to
Pounds 1.38bn. Tobacco earnings will again feel the effects of the US
cigarette price war but the group should benefit from more favourable
exchange rates. Analysts expect further progress from Eagle Star, the
general insurance subsidiary, despite continuing losses on mortgage
insurance. Growth may be slower at Farmers Group, the US subsidiary.
British Petroleum, reporting third quarter results on Thursday, has enjoyed
a marked upgrading of its fortunes in recent weeks. Although oil prices have
fallen petroleum revenue tax has been cut to 50 per cent from 75 per cent
and downstream operations have turned in stronger performances. Profits of
at least Pounds 175m (Pounds 117m) are expected net of stock gains of Pounds
100m.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Societies retain their urge to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE abandonment of the planned merger between the Leeds Permanent and
National &amp; Provincial building societies will not necessarily affect the 1m
people who borrow from or have an account with them, writes Alison Smith.
Although the cancellation is slightly embarrassing, neither society needed
to be rescued; thus, neither is left in severe difficulty.
The merger, combining the Leeds' Pounds 18bn in assets with the N&amp;P's Pounds
12bn, would have created the UK's third-largest society, not far behind the
Nationwide.
Much has been made of the societies' different styles, which stymied the
merger. The Leeds is seen in the industry as being more traditional while
N&amp;P has adopted a more unconventional approach based more on teamwork and
emphasising a focus on the customer rather than on the product.
John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, says that although the
two approaches are strikingly different, both have worked for their
respective societies. He said both remain 'very strong' and could prosper
alone.
The Leeds has made clear that it is still looking for a potential partner.
And while David O'Brien, the chief executive of the N&amp;P, talks of its
strategy of 'organic growth,' it also would be ready for discussions if
there were a 'meeting of minds' with another society.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Boost for co-habitees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT decision by the law lords in a repossession case could have given
rights to those who co-habit, as well as to married couples, according to
some lawyers.
Bridget O'Brien had been misled by her husband into signing a surety which
she believed guaranteed a short-term loan of Pounds 60,000 secured on the
couple's house. In fact, it covered her husband's business debts of Pounds
135,000, which rolled up to Pounds 154,000. Barclays bank had not explained
to her what she was signing. She paid back the Pounds 60,000 she thought she
had guaranteed, but the bank sued for repossession to recover the rest.
In deciding that Barclays was not entitled to take the house, the law lords
said the fact that the O'Briens were married gave the bank constructive
notice of a potential for emotional pressure, and possibly undue influence,
being used by one partner on the other. Because the bank knew it was dealing
with a married couple, it should have asked questions, such as whether Mrs
O'Brien understood the transaction.
The law lords made clear that the same principles would apply to other cases
where there was an emotional relationship between people living together,
saying 'the tenderness shown to married women is not based on the marriage
ceremony but reflects the underlying risk of one co-habitee exploiting the
emotional involvement and trust of the other.'
They added that since unmarried co-habitation and less conventional couples
now were widespread, the law should recognise the fact. 'This could make
lenders a lot more nosy in order to preserve their position,' said Pauline
Walker, a solicitor specialising in family law with Manches &amp; Co,
'If two people are living together, the bank is immediately on a sort of
notice to ask questions.' She noted, however, that the decision applied only
to people guaranteeing loans from which they did not benefit.
Walker added: 'One of the most interesting things about the (O'Brien)
judgment is the law lords going so far as to say they were accepting social
change. The law always has done, of course, but judges have never argued it
so publicly before.'
Barclays said this week it had tightened its procedures on guarantees
already in line with the Banking Code introduced last year, but did not feel
the judgment put any onus on it to discover additional personal details
about cohabiting couples. A spokeswoman pointed out that the bank had won a
Crystal Mark for the clarity of its guarantees.

METALRAX, the engineering group, is the ideal candidate for a bit of
profit-taking and deputy chairman Douglas Hammond clearly feels the same
way. He sold 150,000 shares at 120p leaving himself with 346,000.
When interim results were announced at the end of September, the chairman
said the company looked forward to the coming year with greater confidence
than had been felt for quite some time. Brokers are forecasting profits for
the present year of Pounds 7.7m, rising to Pounds 8.2 in 1994.
Geoffrey Simon, chairman of Prism Leisure, has sold 421,000 shares at 130p.
Business for this computer game wholesaler has been going well. The shares
have outperformed the market by over 100 per cent in the past 12 months and
the prospective p/e ratio for the year to March 1994 is 11. PN Goldsmith,
chief executive of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, the quoted surveying
group, has sold 150,000 shares at 46p. Surprisingly, with just under 2m
remaining, Goldsmith is one of the smaller shareholders on the board. Ronald
Sinclair sold 750,000 at 47.5p on September 13 so further selling would
indicate a clear trend.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: What Clarke's Budget could hold for
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER its content, the November 30 Budget will be radically different in
form from those before it. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will deal with
both the revenue-raising and the spending elements of the government's
finances - making it a 'Budget' in the true sense of the word.
While this change seems sensible, it does mean the Budget will be even less
digestible than usual. Furthermore, the chancellor must walk a fine line;
taking action to control the government deficit without endangering the
recovery.
The chancellor has already been committed to a number of measures by his
predecessor, Norman Lamont. The most infamous of these is the imposition of
VAT on domestic fuel, at 8 per cent in April 1994 and at 17.5 per cent a
year later.
Also in April, mortgage interest relief will be limited to 20 per cent, as
will tax relief on the married couple's allowance. Employees' national
insurance contributions will rise by 1 per cent (effectively, an increase in
income tax). One of the few pieces of good news is that the 20 per cent tax
band will be increased from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000.
As is usual before a Budget, rumours of policy changes have abounded. Often
these are kite-flying exercises; if the public reacts badly to a proposal,
it can be dropped with no harm done.
Income tax
It is widely assumed that, after years of making a virtue out of
tax-cutting, the Conservatives would not dare to increase either the basic
or higher rates of tax. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of scope for
bills to rise.
One easy option is to freeze personal tax allowances at their present
levels, rather than increase them in line with inflation. Since inflation is
only 1.8 per cent, such a move would hardly be noticed by most taxpayers -
but would still raise Pounds 670m. A more radical option would be to
restrict the tax relief on the personal allowance to 20 per cent.
This possibility is discussed at some length in the Green Budget book
produced by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Other reliefs are being limited
to 20 per cent, so there is a precedent. In practice, the change would
probably be achieved by taxing individuals on all their income and giving
them back a tax credit of Pounds 689 (20 per cent of the personal
allowance).
This would cost top-rate taxpayers a maximum of Pounds 689 a year, and a
maximum of Pounds 172.25 for those on the basic rate. If Clarke did make
such a change, he would raise Pounds 5.7bn, according to the IFS.
Accordingly, he could afford to give back some of the money (and reduce the
resulting outcry) by perhaps increasing the 20 per cent tax band to, say,
Pounds 5,250. Such a move, the IFS points out, could be presented as a
further step towards a basic rate of 20 per cent, a long term Conservative
promise.
Price Waterhouse thinks the chancellor will be much gentler, increasing
personal allowances and widening the 20 per cent tax band even further.
National insurance contributions.
The separate systems for national insurance and income tax are something of
an anomaly. The ceiling for employees' NI contributions is Pounds 21,840;
the starting level for higher-rate tax is Pounds 27,145. So, the marginal
tax rate of those who earn just over Pounds 21,840 suddenly drops from 34 to
25 per cent - only to increase again to 40 per cent after Pounds 27,145.
Accountant Chantrey Vellacott thinks the government could bring the NI
ceiling and the start of the top-rate band in line. It also believes the
chancellor could bring all fringe benefits within the NI net and impose a
heavier NI burden on the self-employed.
Value-added tax
The furore over VAT on fuel could prompt Clarke to act. Some think he might
impose the 17.5 per cent rate in one go (to get the fuss over with now);
others, such as Price Waterhouse, that he might limit it to 8 per cent.
New products, such as books and newspapers, could be brought into the VAT
net. A more daring suggestion from Price Waterhouse is a general increase in
VAT, possibly to 20 per cent; the argument against this is the effect on
inflation, which the government is attempting to keep within a 1-4 per cent
band.
Inheritance tax
The 1980s' house price boom brought many Tory voters into the IHT net. Price
Waterhouse suggests the government might abolish the tax completely while
re-introducing some form of capital gains tax charge on assets held on
death.
Tax allowances
Despite my suggestions in Serious Money on page II, the chancellor is
unlikely to do anything as radical as combining Peps and Tessas. Indeed,
Price Waterhouse thinks he could extend Peps to include gilts, perhaps
renaming them Pips (personal income plans).
Pensions
The present system gives very generous treatment to pensions. Contributions
are tax-deductible; the fund itself rolls up tax-free; and the pensioner can
take a tax-free lump sum on retirement. The government's dilemma is that it
wants to encourage private pension provision (and reduce the burden on the
state). Accordingly, it might want to chip away at the tax privileges of
pensions rather than make a frontal assault.
Chantrey Vellacott thinks the chancellor might tax the lump sum but phase in
the change, so as not to be unfair to people about to retire. The accountant
also thinks tax relief on pension contributions could be limited to the
basic rate. More radically, it suggests higher-earning employees could be
taxed on their employer's contributions to the pension fund.
Advance corporation tax
The last Budget's changes in ACT - cutting the tax credit from 25 to 20 per
cent - managed to raise Pounds 1bn of revenue a year with little protest.
Further cuts in the credit are possible. A more likely change is a crackdown
on 'enhanced scrip dividend' schemes, where companies arrange for those who
take extra shares to sell them immediately for cash at little cost.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: BES rush goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW business expansion schemes are still flooding in ahead of the December
deadline, writes Bethan Hutton. Assured tenancy and arranged exit schemes
continue to be popular with investors, but a number of trading companies are
also taking their last chance to use the BES tax incentive to attract new
money.
Cadogan, the publisher of travel and chess guides, is aiming to raise Pounds
750,000 through a BES offer. The company has 35 travel titles, and its chess
authors include Garry Kasparov (who is also a director). Minimum investment
is Pounds 1,050, or Pounds 525 for booksellers and newsagents.
The Hop Back Brewery is a profitable brewing and pub company, based in
Salisbury. It aims to raise Pounds 750,000 to expand through an
entrepreneurial BES issue, sponsored by Wise Speke. Minimum investment is
Pounds 500.
Coventry-based Patrick Eggle Guitars produces 225 electric and acoustic
instruments a month and is hoping to raise almost Pounds 500,000 to expand.
Minimum subscription is Pounds 2,000.
New Netherhall Residences is the Netherhall Educational Association's second
arranged exit scheme, guaranteed by the Midland Bank and sponsored by James
Capel. It offers an exit price of Pounds 1.19 after five years, equivalent
to an annual 13.84 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers. Minimum investment is
Pounds 1,000; cheques can be post-dated to November 19.
Investment in Heritage is an assured tenancy BES, sponsored by Matrix
Securities, which aims to raise Pounds 5m to buy, refurbish and let listed
properties of small to medium size. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
There is no arranged exit, but the directors aim to provide a minimum return
of Pounds 1.40 a share after five years.
Accumulus Froebel is a cash-backed, arranged exit scheme sponsored by
Terrace Hill Capital. Froebel Educational Institute has several schools and
colleges around London. The scheme is offering a return of Pounds 1.20 a
share after five years, equivalent to 14.1 per cent for higher-rate
taxpayers. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Tax-free schemes that beg for reform - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor of the exchequer is unlikely to listen to my advice but I am
going to give it to him, anyway. Please, Kenneth Clarke, when you deliver
your Budget speech on November 30, can you reform all the tax-free schemes -
Peps and Tessas, mortgage interest relief and the rest?
Before you protest, it is not that I want your voters (or FT readers) to pay
more taxes. I just believe that a simple tax regime is a good tax regime.
You will still take the same amount of tax from us, but in a way that is
more straightforward and creates less work for lawyers and accountants.
The present system is pretty generous. One executive confessed to me this
week that he had already stashed away Pounds 75,000 in tax-free form this
year, what with Pounds 40,000 in the BES, Pounds 18,000 in Peps for himself
and his wife, Pounds 3,600 in Tessas and the rest in pension contributions.
Good luck to him. If the government wants to hand out these goodies, Britons
are perfectly entitled to take advantage of them. Indeed, part of the
purpose of the Finance &amp; the Family pages is to point readers in these
directions.
But does it really make macro-economic sense for you to be searching for
ways to squeeze us for tax revenues, such as April's 1 per cent rise in
national insurance contributions, while simultaneously promoting these
loopholes?
Conservatives used to argue that the high rates of tax imposed by Labour
governments distorted the economy. Do not some tax reliefs have the same
effect? Take the business expansion scheme which your predecessor, Norman
Lamont, had the good sense to abolish from the end of 1993. It sounded a
great idea when it was established. Britain needs young, growing businesses;
but such businesses have difficulty attracting finance, so why not give
investors tax relief to buy shares in them?
The problem is that a large number of young, growing businesses tend to go
bust. Investors found that saving 60 per cent (the old top rate) in tax was
little comfort when they lost 100 per cent of their investments. The only
people who seemed to prosper from these schemes were the sponsors, who had
the good sense to take their fees up-front.
Late in the 1980s, the BES was turned on its head. Suddenly, the scheme was
a vehicle for creating private rented accommodation. Again, this is a
perfectly laudable aim since Britain has a shortage of affordable rented
property. In practice, though, the principal beneficiaries seem to have been
Oxbridge colleges.
The distorting effect of mortgage interest relief has been whittled away by
restricting relief to the 25 per cent (and, soon, the 20 per cent) rate of
tax. I know the housing market is weak now but mortgage rates are very low;
many people will have benefited from big falls in interest payments. Why not
announce that the relief will be phased out over five years, by successive
cuts of Pounds 6,000 a year? That way, the pain in any individual year would
not be great.
What about Peps? They are proving amazingly popular, so they might seem to
be one scheme which the government has got right. Certainly, the present
regulations are an enormous improvement on the original Pep which was small,
costly to operate and, inappropriately, encouraged small investors to have a
portfolio of just one or two equities.
Now, most Pep money goes into unit and investment trusts, which give small
investors a properly diverse portfolio. And there is everything to be said
for encouraging investors to break away from their dependence on building
societies and move into equities. But what worries me about Peps is the
trouble they may be creating for the future tax base.
A married couple could already have Pounds 100,000 in a Pep if they had used
the maximum allowances each year. In another five years, if you allow for
further contributions and a bit of growth, their portfolio could easily grow
to Pounds 250,000. Even if they stopped there, and just let the portfolio
grow at 8 per cent a year, they could have a tax-free portfolio of Pounds
500,000 by 2007. Thus, in the foreseeable future, some very wealthy people
could have virtually escaped the tax net altogether. You, or your successor
but five, will have to load the rest of us with even more taxes to
compensate.
Meanwhile, we have the Tessa, a wishy-washy tax break; neither big nor
flexible enough to change the nation's savings habits. So why not combine
Tessas and Peps into a savings allowance, giving people the right to earn a
certain amount of tax-free income from their investments each year, which
they would declare on their tax form? This would be fair; after all, most
people's savings come from money that has already taxed. It could be limited
to a level that would not be too expensive on the nation's coffers, nor be
too generous a shelter for the very wealthy; and it would abolish the need
for special schemes.
Tax relief on pensions has to stay, I suppose, on the ground that the more
you encourage people to save for their old age now, the less the state will
have to provide for them. It could be trimmed back a bit (by, say,
restricting up-front relief to 20 per cent).
For the rest, though, cut out the gimmicks; let us have as simple a tax
regime as possible. Allow people to invest in an atmosphere free of
confusing initials and regulations.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Wellcome gears up for war - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN FOR hardened observers of the stock market, the behaviour of the
Wellcome share price in the past couple of days has been slightly odd. On
Thursday morning, the company, one of Britain's leading drug manufacturers,
announced an almost two-thirds rise in earnings and a one-third increase in
the dividend. The shares fell 11 per cent on the day and another 3 per cent
yesterday. This puts them on a historic multiple of 14, compared with a UK
market average of 23.
The market had its reasons, though. Before the results, Wellcome had risen
30 per cent since mid-August. This was part of a general re-rating of drug
stocks which had been walloped since the start of last year as investors
realised that, in the penny-pinching 1990s, governments finally were serious
about controlling their health bills.
The reason for the re-rating was simple enough. Falling interest rates have
caused a stampede into equities around the world.
As a result, many stocks and sectors have started to look worryingly
expensive. In a rising market, this causes the phenomenon known in the trade
as rotation, whereby any sector that seems to have been left behind goes
through a catch-up phase.
The snag about Thursday's figures was that they reminded the market of what
it had been worried about in the first place. Although Wellcome's earnings,
margins and cash were still rising sharply, sales growth was slowing.
This was particularly true of the second half of the year. After stripping
out the effects of sterling's devaluation, sales in the first half were up
11 per cent - but by only 3 per cent in the second.
Worse, the effect was marked strongly in the two drugs on which Wellcome
relies most heavily for its profits. Its best-known drug, the AIDS treatment
AZT (or Retrovir), showed sales growth - again, at constant exchange rates -
of only 3 per cent in the year compared with 22 per cent the year before.
More worrying in fundamental terms, the herpes treatment Zovirax, which
analysts reckon could account for half Wellcome's profits, grew by only 11
per cent on the same basis compared with 24 per cent the year before.
The slow-down in Zovirax, especially, reminded the market of a more
fundamental question: how good is Wellcome at operating in competitive
markets?
Until now, Zovirax has been the only treatment available for herpes or
shingles. Next year, SmithKline Beecham is bringing in a rival. The chances
are that it will pitch its price much lower.
If so, Wellcome must follow suit. John Robb, the chief executive, put the
point bluntly on Thursday. 'SmithKline has cornered a healthy slice of the
anti-depressant market on price already,' he said.
'We're not going to see our herpes market go out the window on price.
Wellcome has to take on board a more aggressive marketing strategy.'
With luck, lower prices can be offset by higher volume. But it is hard to
see this being true for the industry as a whole. And the slowdown in the
industry's sales cannot be matched by reductions in spending on marketing or
research. Indeed, Wellcome's R &amp; D costs rose faster than sales last year.
As Robb put it on Thursday: 'The two principal areas for the long-term
health of the company are R &amp; D and marketing. We've tried to protect
spending in those two areas.'
R&amp;D consumed 16 per cent of Wellcome's revenues last year, and marketing
probably at least as much again. It is easy to see why the market is worried
about price wars.
In one sense, Wellcome could ask what on earth the fuss is about. The
company is justly proud of having pushed operating margins from 21 per cent
in 1990 to 31 per cent three years later, and in pushing its net cash from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 567m in the same period. It is this hard-won financial
strength, says Mr Robb, that gives it the muscle to act tough on prices.
But this is an industry of giants, many of which also have fat margins and
big cash mountains. If there is to be a war of attrition, it could prove a
long one.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Unexpected recruits to penny shares - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS more people joined the ranks of investors in penny shares this
week - but only one of them was a volunteer. The enthusiastic convert was
Lord Weinstock, whose GEC group was revealed as a potential purchaser of
Ferranti at a price of 1p a share. The unwilling penny-share investors were
Ferranti's existing shareholders, who had thought until now that their
company as worth more like 10p a share.
Indeed, in 1987 they believed Ferranti to be worth 140p a share. That was
before Ferranti bought the US company International Signal and Control, and
discovered it to be constructed around an elaborate fraud, blowing a whole
in the parent company's balance sheet from which it was never able to
recover.
Eugene Anderson, the company doctor brought in to rescue Ferranti from its
ISC problems, said this week that the company had also suffered from the
decline in the defence business, and from poor management in the past. 'But
I'm not blaming anybody. I've been here for three and a half years and we
should have turned it around.'
In retrospect, it is possible to draw two lessons from the Ferranti story.
The first is that all deals made amid the heady atmosphere of 1987 and 1988
must be viewed with scepticism, because so many of them have since come
unstuck.
Second, the inability of Ferranti's core businesses to survive the financial
damage inflicted by the ISC acquisition shows that the decision to diversify
was based on a correct assessment of the company's vulnerability. But as
shareholders will be all too painfully aware, getting your strategic
analysis right is not much use if the steps taken to implement it are
flawed.
There was one other relic of 1987 around this week, illustrated in the
bottom chart. Figures published on Tuesday revealed that in the first nine
months of this year, more money flowed into unit trusts than in the whole of
1987, the previous record year. Yet the long-term trend of individuals'
ownership of the stock market, shown in the top chart, has been steadily
downwards over the past decade. Rising unit trust sales do not contradict
that trend, which partly reflects an increasing preference for collective
rather than individual ownership. But the conjunction of the two charts does
raise the question of whether the growing appetite for equities will in time
lead to a revival of interest in individual ownership.
That partly depends on how long the current rally lasts. And on that
subject, after the gloomy tone of some recent columns readers might
appreciate a bit of no-holds-barred bullishness. It comes by courtesy of
James Capel, the stockbroker, whose analysts spent Wednesday telling clients
their optimistic views on the future for UK equities.
The specifics of this forecast are obviously those of the broker concerned.
The broad argument, though, is one shared by a wider selection of investors
and analysts.
Capel is expecting steady growth for the UK economy, continued low
inflation, falling short-term interest rates, and satisfactory inroads into
the government deficit. A sharp rise in corporate earnings would allow
continued progress in share prices, taking the FT-SE 100 index possibly as
high as 4,000 - although Capel was keen to point out that this was not an
official forecast.
For Paul Walton, the broker's UK strategist, much of bullish phase of the
equity cycle still lies ahead. There is still another 1 1/2 points to come
off base rates, taking them down to 4 1/2 per cent in the first part of
1994. Longer-term interest rates will stabilise around 6 1/2 per cent, a
level not seen on a sustained basis since the 1960s.
The economic recovery is healthy, says Capel, with 3 per cent gdp growth
forecast for next year. Companies will take a rising share of the economic
pie. Earnings per share are set to rebound sharply, as companies start
outperforming analysts' estimates for the first time since the recession
started. Annual dividend growth returns to 6-7 per cent.
Such encouraging fundamentals mean that the market is not over-valued at
current levels, says Walton. He estimates that the market as a whole is
selling at 14 times 1994 earnings, compared with a target range of 16-18. It
is selling at a 1994 dividend yield of 4.2 per cent, compared with Walton's
target of 3.5 per cent. That gives scope for share prices to move up by
another 25-30 per cent.
What are the risks in such a scenario? Apart from the dangers that Capel
itself mentions - political uncertainty or a slide in sterling - they can
best be summed up as how to get there from here.
If there is one thing the British economy has been famously bad at doing, it
is settling into sustained non-inflationary growth. If, this time, that's
what we get, the equity market will be entitled to rejoice on the scale
these forecasts suggest. But there are an awful lot of potential pitfalls on
the way, starting with the Budget at the end of November. And - if the CBI
survey published on Tuesday is any guide - company bosses are not yet ready
to be as optimistic as stockbrokers. Business confidence rose for the fourth
quarter in a row, but the increase was slight. Only one per cent of
companies were more optimistic about the general business situation than
three months before.
No such pessimism was in evidence among the enthusiasts for emerging stock
markets. Any worries that the fad might be going too far were dispelled by
an announcement from the First Philippine Investment Trust: Norman Lamont is
to join its board. So that's all right, then.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Hungry investors tuck in to tasty stocks - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE plenty of low inflation and low interest rates, and add a healthy
portion of low-to-moderate economic growth. Sprinkle with strong bond prices
and improving corporate earnings, and you have the perfect recipe for a
tasty stock market boom.
All of the above ingredients were available this week, and the mix proved a
satisfying meal for hungry US investors, who propelled stocks to another
round of record-setting gains on Wall Street.
A week ago it was the secondary market indices - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500,
the Nasdaq Composite and the American Stock Exchange Composite - reaching
new highs. This week it was the turn of blue-chip and cyclical stocks to
break into previously unexplored territory, as the Dow Jones industrial
average advanced to a record close of 3,687.86 on Thursday.
The key to much of the gains was the third quarter gross domestic product
report. Expecting a 2.7 per cent increase in GDP, analysts were pleased to
see that growth was slightly stronger at 2.8 per cent. Yet two other
elements of the quarterly data that were particularly encouraging.
First, statisticians pointed out that but for the impact of the crop losses
incurred during the summer's devastating floods in the Midwest, the economy
would have grown by an even healthier 3.4 per cent between July and
September. Second, the cost of gross domestic purchase, an important measure
of inflation, rose by only 1.8 per cent in the third quarter, down from the
2.9 per cent rate of growth reported in the previous three months and the
lowest rate since 1986.
The news of moderate growth coupled with low inflation was exactly what the
equity markets needed. Although many share indices have been trading at or
near record highs, there has been a feeling among many analysts that
investors were growing cautious about stocks.
This assessment was based on the fact that recent demand for equities has
been very patchy. Since mid-summer, analysts believe investors have been
'rotating' their portfolios, rapidly shifting funds from sector to sector in
search of value. Just this month, for example, investors were initially keen
on semiconductor stocks in expectation of a revival in the industry's
fortunes. Then, they moved on to financials in the wake of further declines
in interest rates, before news of a bank prime rate cut forced them to
switch back into cyclicals. Later it was the turn of airline stocks to
benefit, as investors kept searching for the next updraft.
On Thursday this approach was abandoned as investors moved into equities on
a broad front, spurred by a rare combination of optimistic economic data and
positive earnings from some big corporations.
There was more to the markets' gains than that, however. Almost half of the
Dow's 23-point advance on Thursday was attributable to one stock - Eastman
Kodak. Late on Wednesday, Kodak stunned Wall Street by announcing that
George Fisher, highly-regarded chairman of Motorola, was joining the company
as its chief executive.
So enthused were investors by Fisher's track-record that they stampeded to
buy Kodak stock in the hope that he would be able to engineer a rapid
turnaround in the faltering company's fortunes. By the close of trading
Kodak shares were up almost Dollars 6 at Dollars 63 1/2 , although the bulk
of those gains were achieved in after-hours trading.
Fisher now has the difficult task of living up to the expectations of
investors who bought Kodak shares and analysts who hailed his appointment
as, in the words of one stockwatcher, 'beyond the dreams of avarice.'
Kodak's coup partly overshadowed what was another good week for corporate
America. Although the week had its share of laggards - Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing, Phillips Petroleum and RJR Nabisco reported weaker profits -
the balance of earnings data was again bullish. Among those announcing
either narrower losses or stronger profits were IBM, General Motors, Ford,
US Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Delta and United Airlines.
With the bulk of the latest reporting season now out of the way, it is clear
that corporate profitability is firmly established on an upward path. One
compilation of third quarter results published this week showed that 60 per
cent of companies which have reported earnings for the latest period either
matched, or exceeded, analysts' forecasts.
The next quarter should see this trend maintained, especially if economic
growth continues to pick up. After Thursday's GDP report, economists
upgraded forecasts for fourth quarter growth from 3 per cent to nearer 3.5
and 4 per cent.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Two more equity bonds launched - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two more guaranteed equity bonds have been launched. Bristol &amp; West's fourth
issue allows investors to put up to 50 per cent of their money in a one-year
interest paying account paying 7.5 per cent gross. The rest goes into a bond
which will match the capital performance of the FT-SE 100 Index over five
years, with guaranteed return of capital. Scottish Amicable's fourth issue
gives investors the benefit of reinvested dividend income on top of the
FT-SE 100's rise.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Housing now 'more affordable' - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British housing is more affordable than it has been for a decade, according
to a report by TSB this week. The Affordability index calculates the
proportion of the take-home pay of a first time buyer which is needed to
service the mortgage on the average first-time home. As the graph shows,
that proportion has fallen to 26 per cent, compared with 65 per cent in 1989
and 1990 (when interest rates were at their peak). One needs to go back to
1983 to find a time when the ratio was as low.

At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust sales for the first nine months of 1993 have now outstripped the
figures for the whole of 1987, the previous record year. Although net sales
in September at Pounds 669m were down on the Pounds 900m plus figures
recorded in July and August, they still pushed the total for the year Pounds
6.91bn, according to the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Financial Times Guide To Secondary Education (1): State
schools close in on the top dogs - The results of the FT's unique survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN DE BONO and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT schools dominate the top of this year's FT survey of 1,000
schools, holding 92 of the first 100 positions. But the challenge from the
state sector is gathering momentum.
In last year's FT-1000 only three state schools earned a place in the top
200. This year the figure is 23. Last year the top state school was ranked
63rd, but this year's top state school, Colchester County Girls High in
Essex, is ranked 37th.
So while there is reassurance for fee-paying parents who, on average, pay
Pounds 36,200 for one child's secondary education at a private day school,
or Pounds 65,800 at a boarding school, in some areas the state sector offers
an alternative which cannot be ignored.
Essex is blessed with two other high-flying state grammar schools,
Chelmsford County High (78) and King Edward VI (81), both of which outshine
the county's best independent schools. Buckinghamshire, which also retained
grammar schools in several areas, and Kent also have excellent state school
records.
Placing schools as precisely as this is a difficult and controversial job,
which the FT has done as fairly as possible. The FT - 1,000 is the result of
six months' research. Questionnaires were sent to the 1,100 top performing
state schools according to last year's government statistics. These
represent one third of state schools teaching A-levels.
In addition, the Independent Schools' Information Service (ISIS) supplied
compatible data on over 500 (the majority) of its members. Before the tables
were completed, head teachers were sent checking sheets to enable them to
verify their entry and amend A-level grades where necessary.
All schools with at least 10 A-level candidates are included in our table.
As most parents choose a school within 10 miles of home, they are listed
alphabetically within counties, to show local choices at a glance.
Unlike league tables that assess schools only on the performance of their
best pupils by ranking them according to the percentage of A and B grades,
the FT-1000 compares the results of all A-level candidates using the points
system of the Universities Central Council of Admissions (UCCA).
The FT-1000 rank positions represent a weighting of the average number of
UCCA points achieved per pupil (the quantity of grades attained) with the
average number of UCCA points per subject entry (the quality of grades
attained).
However, rank positions can exaggerate differences between schools,
particularly between middle ranking schools. Although there are marked
disparities between schools at the top and bottom ends of the league table,
schools ranked between 280 and 630 all achieved results within 10 per cent
of the average - equivalent to each pupil achieving three grade Cs.
For this reason, the FT score is an important corrective to rankings. It has
been scaled so that a score of 1.00 represents the average performance of
all the schools in the FT-1000. The table opposite enables you to convert FT
scores into average A-level grades attained.
It is not surprising that grammar schools, often more selective than
competing independents, lead the state sector. For example, 17 Kent grammar
schools achieved an FT score greater than 1.00, equivalent to average
A-level grades of between BBC and CCC.
Yet in spite of their wide ability intake, many comprehensives achieved
impressive results. Three took places in our top 200 - Hasmonean High in
Hendon (ranked 73rd), Dame Alice Owen's School in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire
(ranked 131), and Cherwell in Oxford (ranked 185). Of the 315 included in
the FT-1000, 135 came within 10 per cent of the average FT score - the
equivalent of at least three grade Cs per pupil.
Overall, opted-out comprehensives achieved similar results to local
authority comprehensives. But for grammar schools, opted-out schools
out-scored those staying with the local authority with average FT scores of
1.05 against 0.99. This may for the moment reflect the fact that successful
schools are more likely to take the risk of opting out, but this trend must
be monitored carefully.
Parents keen on independent day schools can be cheered by the fact that 78
out of the top 100 charge annual fees below the average of Pounds 5,170.
Those contemplating boarding schools are less fortunate. With a few
exceptions, the FT-1000 reveals that you have to pay a premium for
exceptional results. Eighty five out of the top 100 independent boarding
schools charge above average fees (Pounds 9,400 a year).
Nor are academic returns so rewarding. Although two of the most prestigious
 -Winchester and Eton - remain anchored in the top 10, boarding school
pupils achieved less impressive results than those at independent day
schools, achieving average FT scores of 1.04, rather than 1.08.
This means that Winchester, Eton and the girls' school Wycombe Abbey manage
to appear in the top 10 of the FT's rough and ready value-for money tables
(see page 4), in spite of high annual fees of Pounds 12,270, Pounds 11,934
and Pounds 11,538.
The boarding schools' problem could stem from the 6 per cent fall in rolls
which they suffered last year.
As a result of the recession, boarding schools now receive fewer applicants
and must be less selective.
State schools with boarding facilities should not be overlooked. Several
achieve impressive results, including the Royal Grammar, High Wycombe
(66th), Reading (177th) and the Royal Grammar, Lancaster (189th). Fees
average Pounds 4,000. They can be identified by the Boarding % column in our
main table.
Comparisons of A-level results around the country with average house prices
make startling reading. With the exception of Greater London and
Oxfordshire, the 10 best performing counties have below average house
prices.
In Leicestershire, fourth in the country, the average house price is Pounds
49,250 - 22 per cent lower than the national average. Fees for
Leicestershire independent schools are also slightly below average.
Single-sex schools achieved better results than fully mixed schools in both
the state and independent sectors. The FT scores for single sex schools are
identical for boys and girls (1.09 in independents and 1.04 in grammar
schools), whereas mixed independent schools averaged 1.01, with grammar
schools on 0.95.
The strong showing for single-sex schools still leaves plenty of room for
controversy. None of the top 20 schools is mixed throughout its age range,
and the recent decision by a mixed state school in Essex to segregate boys
and girls for classes shows that the idea is gaining in favour.
However, these figures demonstrate only the academic impact of single-sex
status and say nothing about the broader effects on a child's upbringing.
John Sugden, head of Leicester Grammar, the top co-educational school at
number 29 in the rankings, says the strength of single-sex schools is a
historical coincidence. He points out that that most well-off selective city
schools happen to be single-sex. Leicester Grammar is already approaching
the very best results in spite of being co-educational because it is
selective. Boys' school heads tend to agree.
Girls' schools, however, take a different approach, and plainly believe that
single-sex education is vital for their pupils. Joan Clanchy, headmistress
of North London Collegiate, is not given to understatement: 'Girls are
actually cleverer than boys. So if you have got a school full of girls, you
will do better.'
In other words, the figures may just say something about the relative
development of the two sexes. Research suggests that at the age of 16 girls
are more mature and intellectually advanced than boys.
The issue is less clear at A-level where the boy's half of 'twin' schools
such as Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree, St Paul's, and King Edward's,
Birmingham, tend to do slightly better.
The strongest criticism of school league tables is that no allowance is made
for schools' selection policies at age 11 or 13. Nor do they take into
account socio-economic variations in catchment areas.
Ian Mellor of Sir Roger Manwood's grammar school in Sandwich, Kent (ranked
330) speaks for many: 'The hoary old argument that it is easier for a
suburban grammar school to produce results of a high order than it is for a
school in a deprived city area is so obvious as to make comparison between
the two types futile. Even grammar schools cannot readily be compared, since
they have different catchments. My area takes about the top 25 per cent of
applicants, whereas others take anything from 10 to 40 per cent.'
Sceptics can further point to the catchment areas of the top comprehensives
 -for example Hasmonean High serves the Jewish community of North London,
and Cherwell is in North Oxford, home to most of the university's dons.
Schools with a selective sixth form also have an advantage, as the deputy
head of St Martin's comprehensive in Brentwood (640th) said: 'We have a
policy of entering all pupils with a chance of passing, however slim. We
could produce impressive statistics by changing this policy to the detriment
of our students.'
Alex Clarke, head of Poole Grammar, Dorset, also made the point that A-level
results do not always reflect the achievements of a school's original
intake: 'Although we are a selective school at 12-plus, about 40 per cent of
our A-level candidates join us at 16-plus where our entry requirements for
A-level are similar to most schools.'
These problems explain why the government is looking for ways of measuring
'value added', or the extent to which pupils improve while they are at a
school, rather than printing raw exam results.
This year, as last, the FT-1000 has excluded general studies A-level in its
calculations. Roger Dancey, headteacher of King Edward VI Camp Hill School
for Boys in Birmingham (ranked 103) was one of many who insisted on its
value: '50,000 Joint Matriculation Board candidates should not be ignored.
General studies is an excellent predictor for higher education.'
But the weight of educational opinion is against them. Earlier this year the
Engineering Council published a report written by Alan Smithers, professor
of education at Manchester university, which said that general studies
counted for little in the competition for university places and had failed
to broaden the curriculum. Some pupils even revised for it by playing the
board game Trivial Pursuit.
Other heads lamented the omission of a five year FT score - a feature of
last year's survey - pointing out that A-level results can vary considerably
from year to year, especially for schools with small sixth forms.
Unfortunately, so many state schools were unwilling or unable to produce the
information last year that the five-year comparisons had to be abandoned
this year.
Nor do A-level league tables reflect the achievements of sixth-formers who
combine one or two A-levels with vocational courses, which are fast gaining
popularity with employers. Many excellent schools offer superb sixth form
vocational courses but will never excel in A-level league tables.
Other heads who may justifiably feel hard done by are those who run the
schools which entered fewer than 10 candidates for A-levels. Results for
these schools can be so volatile that it could be misleading to publish rank
orderings which include them, but some produced impressive results this
year.
In spite of these objections, all of which must be taken into account, these
tables still help parents to shortlist schools that might suit their child's
academic aptitude. And for all their protestations, schools cannot deny that
the tables have an impact.
Early in the morning of August 28 this year, the head of a boarding school
in Surrey was woken by one of his governors. A copy of the FT guide to
independent school A-level results was thrust into his hands.
The governor, chairman of the finance committee, had been awaiting the new
league tables with trepidation. The school was higher up in the tables, but
not by as much as had been hoped, and the head had to do something about it.
The head of the school in question has spent the last year attempting to
raise academic standards. While parents continue to want to read league
tables, he will continue to respond to them. If that means attempting to
improve academic standards, then the FT league table has achieved something.
Extra copies of the FT-1000 can be ordered from John White, Marketing
Department, The Financial Times, Number One Southwark Bridge, London SE1
9HL.
The minimum order is five copies, price Pounds 3.50, including postage and
packing. The price for 10 copies is Pounds 6 and for 20, Pounds 10. Orders
should be returned before November 6.

Type: IDy = independent day school; IBd = independent boarding school; G
= grammar school. Sex: B = predominantly boys; G = predominantly girls.
Boarding schools are deemed to be more than 50 per cent boarding, of
which more than half are full-boarders. In a fully coeducational school,
each sex must account for more than 25 per cent of pupils.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Long View: Victims of the glut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY VERY first lesson in applied economics came on the day in April 1949 that
post-war sweets rationing of 4 ounces a week was ended. Alas, the Ministry
of Food had blundered: demand exceeded supply and rationing had to be
re-imposed until 1953.
Scarcity, in the experience of the generation in Britain with which I grew
up, was part of the natural order of things. There were waiting lists for
many goods, and rationing was imposed not just by the need for coupons but
through restrictions on capital flows and property development (which
persisted for decades after the Conservative government's 'bonfire of
controls' in 1951). We had a final taste of shortages in the 1970s with the
oil shocks and various other commodity crises, including the bizarre sugar
famine of 1974.
Now, we one-time ration book kids must cope with the economics of glut.
There is serious over-capacity in most of the western world's manufacturing
industry; meanwhile, in the commodity markets this week, oil slipped to
little more than Dollars 16 a barrel and aluminium crashed towards the
'disaster level' of 45c a pound. As for the other factors of production, the
number of unemployed people in the European Community is rising towards 20m
and surplus capital is sloshing around the globe, depressing real interest
rates and threatening to generate destabilising asset price bubbles.
Some of those post-war scarcities were fundamental, being caused largely by
the destruction of much of the capital stock of Europe. Rationing and
central planning were natural consequences and, because of the absence of
effective competition, the returns on capital often were very high. It was
natural for investors to put their money into the famous names of British
manufacturing industry. including high-tech wonders like Ferranti (which
last Tuesday, announced its willingness to be taken over for 1p a share).
Other shortages have resulted more from policy than from the fundamentals
and so have persisted longer.
The property market in the UK, for instance, did not finally reach its
confrontation with the age of glut until the end of the 1980s. But now, it
seems, even Somerset beauty spots are being opened up by planners to
Sainsbury's bulldozers. True, some of the old property market distortions
persist, notably through upwards-only leases, and the remaining backlog of
superstore permits means that the leaders in the food retailing industry are
still enjoying an artificial enhancement of margins through restriction of
competition (although these surplus profits will now crumble fast).
European airlines - the flag carriers, at least - have held out the longest
against liberalisation, and have been able to exploit their right to carve
up the profitable international routes between them. But Air France is at
last approaching its moment of truth, however unwillingly.
It is ironic that the airlines should be among the last to accept open
borders. Elsewhere, the globalisation of world trade has become a dominant
factor in generating production surpluses. A huge and cheap supply of most
manufactured goods (but not of services, with the important exception of
travel and tourism) has overwhelmed the economies of countries that allow
them in.
You can see this in the changing shape of the stock market. In the UK, for
instance, manufacturing of tradeable goods now probably accounts for only
about a fifth of the value of the market as a whole. Returns in the heavy
manufacturing sectors in Europe have been forced down by the influence of
state subsidies, and levels of profitability in basic industries such as
steel, chemicals or cars are grim.
Many of the traditional defences of manufacturers - such as control of
distribution, or the exploitation of technological superiority - are no
longer effective. Vast increases in productivity have benefited not the
manufacturer or the employees, as once they mainly would have done, but the
customer.
In recent years, too, a crisis has developed for the brand, the standard
means of adding perceived value to a consumer product. Too many brands have
allowed their pricing premiums to drift up in a period when the wider
diffusion of skills in production technology has actually been undermining
the advantages of market leaders.
In any case, some of today's big retailers have stronger brands than many of
the big consumer goods manufacturers. Who has the more powerful brand: a
retailer like Sainsbury or a food manufacturer like Brooke Bond or Tate &amp;
Lyle?
In the stock market, value has shifted to those sectors where there is seen
to be protection against the gluts apparent elsewhere. There is obvious
appeal in regulated utilities which, through privatisation, have come from
nowhere to nearly 14 per cent of aggregate capitalisation inside 10 years;
and in drugs, which are defended by patents and the still crucial role of
technological skills. The same used to be true of defence, but the great
cost-plus days of this once-sheltered industry are well past.
Out there in the exposed sectors, the awful word 'commoditisation' has been
coined to represent the downgrading of premium products into mere standard
items, the price of which is set by increasingly fearsome competition
between efficient factories. In these circumstances, the profits in the
economy tend to percolate down towards niche providers of specialist goods
and services. Hence the higher activity in the stock market in the smaller
companies sector, where there may be some shelter from the intense pressure
of global competition, but where decent growth in the domestic economy is
essential.
Adjusting to the economics of glut can be tough indeed. Back in 1949, the
Riley family used to listen to the Home Service and the Light Programme on a
Ferranti wireless set. It seems a long, long time ago.

FT  30 OCT 93 / State schools begin to gain on private sector: . . . But
fee-payers dominate the league tables. John Authers and Gillian de Bono
study the FT schools survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and GILLIAN DE BONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S state schools have been gaining academic ground against the fee
paying sector, according to this year's FT-1000 survey of Advanced Level
examination results published with the Weekend FT today.
Although private schools still dominate the upper reaches of our league
table, 23 state schools made it into the top 200, compared with only three
last year. More significantly, some famous and expensive independent schools
failed to achieve A-level scores as good as those of the top state schools.
Essex girls at Colchester County Girls' High, the top state school at no 37,
showed a clean pair of heels to those of Benenden, Cheltenham Ladies'
College, and Roedean. Lower down the list, John Hamden grammar school in
High Wycombe in 411th place, still beat respected boarding schools such as
Blundell's and Sedbergh.
This year's survey has also raised controversial questions about what type
of school is most likely to get the best results. It suggests that, with
impressive exceptions, day schools do better than traditional boarding
schools and that single sex schools do better than co-educational schools.
But one of the most striking revelations from the publication of exam
results is the success - in one area at least - of the despised selective
system, based on grammar and secondary modern schools.
While most of the country was converting these '11-plus' schools into
comprehensives, particularly under Margaret Thatcher when she was education
secretary in the early 1970s, Buckinghamshire retained selection at aged 12.
Now it boasts not only the top state boys' school in the FT-1000 survey, but
average results well ahead of those for the country as a whole. Last year's
government figures put the county's A level performance in fifth place out
of 108 education authorities. Our survey suggests it has done even better
this year.
But was good performance by the cleverest children achieved at the expense
of the less fortunate - those who used to be stigmatised as '11-plus
failures'? It seems not. Buckingham gets excellent results from pupils with
a wide range of abilities, including those who fail the grammar school exam.
In High Wycombe, for example, The Royal Grammar School (66th in the
FT-1000), was up with famous names in the independent sector, such as
Dulwich College, Charterhouse, Shrewsbury, and Haileybury. Last year it
gained more places at Oxford and Cambridge than any other state school.
However, the town boasts two other successful grammar schools and, more
remarkably, several secondary moderns (now called 'upper schools') with good
examination results. Because our league table is based only on A-levels, it
does not show the upper schools' success. But in GCSE exams, taken at 16,
some of these schools finished ahead of comprehensives in neighbouring
Milton Keynes.
So the latest evidence from the FT-1000 and the government's exam statistics
suggest that the selective education system which Britain has been
dismantling during the last 25 years can be successful for a wide range of
ability - under certain conditions. The figures for Buckinghamshire also
illustrate a more general truth - that where state schools achieve good
results, the independent sector tends to be pushed into second place.
It might be objected that High Wycombe, like some other places with good
state school results, is inhabited by the ambitious middle classes whose
children would do well in any system. Our survey shows, for example, that
the best performing comprehensive schools are those which serve areas where
affluent and educated people live, such as north Oxford, or Sunningdale in
Berkshire.
In Buckinghamshire, Andrew MacTavish, head of John Hampden, confirms that
many parents who work for international companies have moved to the Wycombe
area on the advice of their employers.
Wycombe, situated in the leafy Bucks commuter belt, is indeed attractive to
prosperous parents. But it is not wealthy enough to explain such outstanding
results. Unemployment has followed the decline of the town's traditional
furniture industry, and a strong influx of immigrants means that it is not
without 'inner-city' problems.
The good rating of Wycombe's grammar schools in the FT-1000 no doubt
reflects the fact that parents send their children from a wide radius,
including the far corners of Berkshire and Surrey.
Weak competition from local independent schools also helps. It seems that in
this area, the dream of many idealists of the 1950s and 1960s has been
fulfilled: they hoped then that strong middle class demand for improved
state education would make private schools unnecessary.
But the middle classes always want the best for their children, which in a
selective system, means grammar schooling, good A level grades and a
university degree. What happens to the others? In High Wycombe the answer
might be that they go to the Sir William Ramsay upper school.
In that case their prospects would be quite good. Last year 34 per cent of
the school's GCSE exam entries resulted grades A to C, equivalent to a pass
in the old GCE O-level. This was close to the average for the whole of the
UK and much better than the performance of Milton Keynes's comprehensives,
which accept children with a much wider range of abilities. There, the
average is only 23 per cent. Two other upper schools in Wycombe, St
Bernard's, which is Roman Catholic, and Wye Valley, also managed to better
the nearby comprehensives.
If the entire Wycombe area is viewed as one big comprehensive school, to use
an analogy suggested by Bill Richards, head of Sir William Ramsay, then in
1992, 52 per cent of pupils win at least five GCSEs at grades A to C. The
average for the whole of the UK last year was 38 per cent.
Sir William Ramsay has even started a sixth form, once an unimagined
development for a school intended only to take the 70 per cent of pupils who
did not make the grade at the age of 12.
Although such successes might encourage those Conservatives who want to
return to some form of selective education system, recent attempts in
several counties to reintroduce selection, have run into fierce local
opposition.
In Wycombe, however, there is equally fierce local commitment to selection.
Heads of the area's 13 schools agree this stems from the council's battle in
the mid 1970s with Shirley Williams, then Labour education secretary, to
preserve the grammar schools.
Ever since that successful rearguard action, the Conservative county council
has wanted to prove that its system works and can win popular support. In
Buckinghamshire, a Conservative vote is a vote for selective education. It
was the only county in England to retain a Conservative council after the
May elections this year.
As Richards points out, this popular support could not have been won only on
the basis of A level results by grammar schools. If parents believed that
exam grades were achieved at the expense of sub-standard education for the
rest, there would have been strong pressure to change the system.
So it is instructive to look behind the examination results, at the
strategies which the education authority has used to fulfil the ideals, as
it saw them, of the 1944 Education Act. This envisaged a harmonious
relationship between three types of schools, grammar, secondary modern and
technical based on selection.
First, the authority has promoted a traditional ethos in all its schools. In
Wycombe, all schools enforce uniform and discipline strictly.
Second, it has formed a sixth-form consortium of Wycombe schools which
allows pupils of one school to take lessons at another. This emphasises to
pupils who miss the grammar school boat that they have a second chance.
The idea is that each school should play to its strengths. Grammar schools
offer academic A-levels, while upper schools such as Cressex and Sir William
Ramsay have introduced new vocational qualifications, intended to persuade
less academically able 16-year-olds to stay in education. Upper school
pupils are now more likely to take A-levels, as they can do so without the
disruption of moving to a new school.
Third, co-operation has been encouraged below the sixth form, to give
children who under-perform at 12 a second chance. Late developers can be
transferred to the grammar school. Thus, many children who fail their
12-plus exam, win good A level grades in the grammar school.
Fourth, the authority administers the applications and entries for all
schools in the area, even including the Royal Grammar which has opted out of
the authority for financial reasons. This reduces wasteful competition for
ther best pupils and makes forward planning easier.
Fifth, in Wycombe, the authority has kept the traditional division between
the sexes in its grammar schools, in spite of the shift to co-education
elsewhere, even in the top independent boarding schools.
Does this segregation help to explain the area's good results?
Certainly our survey shows that, on average, single sex schools get better
examination grades in both state and independent sectors.
But there is much debate about the significance of this result. Do boys and
girls really learn better without the distraction of the opposite sex? Or is
it merely an historical accident that schools with an established record of
academic success tend to have remained single sex?
Muriel Pilkington, head of Wycombe High, champions the traditional view that
girls can flourish better in classrooms without boys, who, she says, tend to
be less mature.
If girls want to meet boys, they can do so after class, since Wycombe High
and John Hampden face each other across a road.
Nevertheless, many parents dislike segregation by sex, as the shift to
co-education in other parts of the country amply attests. And this is only
one reason to be cautious about Buckinghamshire's laboratory of
'traditional' education, despite the achievements.
However enlightened and flexible the system may claim to be, dividing young
children by academic 'success' and 'failure' can be cruel.
In Buckinghamshire, these words were formerly used in letters sent by the
authority to the parents of every 12-year-old.
At Sir William Ramsay, pupils appear happy, well-disciplined, and by no
means the dejected or embittered failures which mythology might suggest.
Five out of six prefects say they want to go to university, an ambition
which seems quite realistic.
Meanwhile, the school's cricket captain says: 'We were rained off last
summer, but we'll beat the Royal Grammar this year. Just you wait and see.'
And yet, and yet . . . in spite of all this optimism and fighting talk,
pupils and teachers attest to intense pressure on children to 'succeed' by
winning a place at grammar school.
One of the prefects at Sir William Ramsay who is aiming for university,
unwittingly summed up the argument, which will always remain against
selection: 'Of course if I was good enough, I would go to RGS. But I wasn't
good enough.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Catalogue of mistakes at Queens Moat: Debt-ridden hotel
group suffers losses of Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CORPORATE horror story unfolded yesterday when Queens Moat Houses
published a 34-page catalogue of mistakes and mismanagement with its results
for 1992.
The once high-flying hotel group formerly run by Mr John Bairstow, a
typically aggressive 1980s entrepreneur, has been brought almost to its
knees by nearly Pounds 1.2bn of debt.
Though some investors had become concerned by the company's rapid expansion,
funded by high levels of debt and a number of rights issues, few were
prepared for yesterday's revelations. One shareholder said yesterday 'there
was no way you could have discovered what was going on from previous sets of
accounts'.
The revelations included alleged breaches of company law, including the
unlawful payment of more than Pounds 20m in dividends; the earlier
overstatement of profits; losses of more than Pounds 1bn and a Pounds 803.9m
property write-down, and an apparent lack of financial controls. There were
minimal reporting systems, a scarcity of management information and no
monthly consolidated accounts. There was no clearly defined treasury
function.
These revelations could lead to an investigation by the department of trade
and industry, although the company has not requested one.
Legal action against the group's former advisers and directors is under
consideration by the new management team - probably over the question of the
dividend payments.
The former advisers included Bird Luckin, the auditors, Charterhouse Bank,
the merchant bank, and Beeson Gregory and De Zoete &amp; Bevan, the joint
stockbrokers. All either failed to return calls or refused to comment.
Mr Bairstow admitted the group had got out of control but defended himself
yesterday blaming the spirit of the times. 'The sheer size of the growth in
the 1980s was such that it would take care of any mistakes,' he said.
He said he was 'perplexed' by the Pounds 1.1bn difference between a property
valuation by Weatherall Green and Smith at the end of 1991 and that by Jones
Lang Wootton at the end of 1992.
'With so much at stake and with such a vast difference in the valuations the
issue should go to arbitration,' he said.
Mr Andrew Coppel, QMH's new chief executive, said he could not comment on
the differences, but said the JLW valuation had been subjected to lengthy
and detailed examination before being adopted.
He said financial controls in the group had been severely lacking. The new
management team appointed in July had been unable to locate the working
papers from which 1992 interim profits were constructed. An outsider close
to the group said of the financial controls, 'it was a complete and bloody
shambles'.
A number of the group's hotels were run by managers paid under an incentive
scheme. Mr Andrew Le Poidevin, the new finance director, said 'in the past
there was very little financial information from these hotels'.
In its rush to expand into continental Europe, QMH had acquired hotels in
France which were subject to leasing deals making it 'unlikely that these
hotels can ever be profitable', Mr Coppel said. In Austria hotels had been
acquired with excessive debts making them 'heavily loss-making'.
The group first announced it was in difficulties in March, when its shares
were suspended at 47 1/2 p.
QMH has been surviving with the support of its banks. These are now entering
discussions with the company over a financial restructuring. This is
expected to give the banks control and substantially dilute the interests of
existing shareholders.
A banker said that when the details of QMH's losses and property revaluation
were given to a meeting of the company's banks on Thursday there was a
'shocked silence'. One banker said he had 'no idea how a company could build
such a complicated banking structure with such inadequate security'.
With nearly 200 subsidiaries, loans from 65 banks in a number of different
syndicates with varying levels of security, and operating in many countries,
the restructuring will be extremely complicated.
The plan is to concentrate on a core of 50 UK hotels which will be renamed
and form a base for eventual expansion. The other 53 hotels in the UK and
the 86 hotels elsewhere in Europe will be managed to maximise returns for
shareholders and creditors.
Although the business plan assumes some recovery in hotel values, one banker
said the assumptions were sensible and if lenders 'sit tight' they could
eventually get all their money back.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Bank cools speculation over cut in interest rates: Governor
sounds a strong warning on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday damped
speculation about an imminent cut in UK interest rates by suggesting this
could jeopardise the goal of price stability.
Sounding a warning on inflationary pressures, Mr George said British
industry needed a long period of monetary stability rather than short-term
economic boosts provided by interest rate cuts.
Speaking to journalists in London, the governor said he was 'not confident'
that cutting interest rates from 6 per cent would be compatible with the
government's target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent.
'As of now, I think monetary policy is appropriate for the conditions we
face,' Mr George told the Foreign Press Association.
He added that any adjustment to monetary policy was likely to be finely
balanced. Commentators calling for rate cuts of up to two percentage points
had not seriously thought through the implications for inflation of such a
large cut.
The remarks from the governor weakened short-dated gilts - which normally
track expectations about likely levels of interest rates - and boosted the
pound, which recovered from early weakness against the D-Mark to close
unchanged on the day at DM2.4975. Against the dollar, sterling closed down
just over half a cent at Dollars 1.4865.
However, Mr George's comments failed to shake the general belief in
financial markets that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut base
rates by up to 1 percentage point around Budget day on November 30, possibly
to offset a fiscal tightening to curb Britain's Pounds 50bn budget deficit.
Mr George was fairly bullish about the UK's growth prospects, arguing that
even with the weakness of important export markets in the rest of Europe,
many British companies were well poised to take advantage of the general
turn upwards in UK demand.
Mr George stressed that the top priority for the Bank was 'to achieve and
maintain price stability in the medium and long run.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Row looms over MPs' 5.5% pay rise plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW was brewing last night over plans to offer pay rises to MPs that would
increase their salaries by more than 5.5 per cent.
Union leaders joined MPs from across the political spectrum in attacking the
proposed rise which would take effect in two stages by January 1995.
If implemented, the move would be widely expected to stiffen resistance to
the government's efforts to rein in public-sector pay. Ministers are this
year seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent ceiling on the public-sector pay bill,
and may try to impose a freeze next year.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, leader of Unison, Britain's biggest union, said it would
be 'grossly hypocritical' for ministers and MPs to vote themselves such an
increase. The move would 'result in my members . . . redoubling their
efforts to achieve justice in the next pay round'.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said: 'Aren't they the
lucky ones? I wish our members had the chance to vote themselves a pay rise
at twice the rate of inflation.'
Mr Michael Bates, the Conservative MP for Langbaurgh, described the plan as
'an absolute outrage' and called for MPs to lead by example.
Mr Max Madden, Labour MP for Bradford West, said salary increases should
apply only to MPs who did not have outside financial interests.
Under the proposals - which will be debated next Wednesday - MPs would be
awarded a 2.7 per cent increase, taking their salaries to Pounds 31,687 with
effect from January 1994. This would be followed by a further 2.68 per cent
the following year. The government also proposes a new remuneration formula
linking MPs' pay to civil service bands.
MPs did vote themselves a 38 per cent rise in office-cost allowances to
nearly Pounds 40,000 a year in July 1992.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Salomon Brothers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is nice to see that time has not dimmed Salomon's inventive talents.
Strips - bonds which are separated out into a stream of interest payments
and one lump sum principle repayment - have made Salomon plenty of money.
Having started the market in the early 1980s, Salomon is now turning full
circle and putting the bonds and their interest payments back together
again. Doubtless this is not what Salomon intended in the mid-1980s. But
luck has intervened, since the high-coupon bonds which it split have become
the benchmark for the vast T-bond futures market. Fortune has smiled on
those who take a supple view of markets.
The futures fluke allows Salomon to buy large quantities of the split bonds,
put them back together and hedge them perfectly. Since Salomon's split bonds
have underperformed comparable whole securities, it can also afford to pay
up for their strips and still guarantee themselves a handy profit. Of
course, customers may not be quite so chuffed to buy a premium-priced
product from Salomon, watch it fall behind the basic bond over the best part
of a decade and then sell it back to the same arbitrage desk. Salomon scores
on the way in, the way out, and dealing in between. But on Wall Street,
that's a good trade.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The big three superstore groups this week conducted a highly effective
marketing campaign. Unfortunately, it was for their new rival, Costco. Their
legal challenge ensured much media space was devoted to the threat of
warehouse clubs, unnerving the stock market. More than Pounds 800m was
lopped off the value of the big three's shares in two days as a result. Such
a response is surely out of proportion to the immediate threat to their
market position. But fears of margin pressure over the longer run may yet
prove well founded. Amid the hysteria, almost no attention has been paid to
the possible knock-on effects on retailers' suppliers. If the superstore
groups over-react to Costco's arrival and cut prices, then manufacturers'
margins will clearly suffer. A lowering of the food industry's whole margin
structure would be just as painful for the manufacturers as the established
retailers in the near term.
Strangely, though, the branded food manufacturers could view warehouse clubs
as their biggest allies if they become a substantial presence in future. UK
manufacturers are desperate to lessen their exposure to the big three and
develop alternative distribution channels. Not only do UK superstores exert
ever greater buying muscle, they are also committed to developing their own
rival private label products. Yet, in the US, warehouse clubs stock leading
branded goods almost exclusively. For manufacturers, higher sales volumes
through warehouse clubs could be their best chance of offsetting the
inevitable margin squeeze.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The whirring cogs of the UK economy emitted some discordant noises this
week, but they were drowned out on the equity and bond markets by the shouts
of 'buy' orders down telephones. The CBI's quarterly industrial trends
suggesting the UK recovery was faltering as a result of recession in
mainland Europe caused only a momentary flutter of concern. Anxieties about
the outlook for corporate earnings were also shrugged off. Since the
beginning of October, NatWest Securities' analysts have downgraded their
earnings forecasts for 18 companies while upgrading only five. The market
worries not a jot.
The benign interpretation is that such anxieties matter very little, given
the trend in global interest rates. Indeed, even bad economic news, such as
the CBI survey, is seen as encouraging because it only makes more certain
further interest rate cuts. Moreover, if the UK really has tamed its
inflation problem, 10-year gilts yielding 6.7 per cent continue to look
cheap against the 5.8 per cent obtainable on German bunds. Such logic may
well underpin a further run in UK equities and bonds. But in a European
context, the UK will steadily lose its charms when compared with continental
markets. Investors may switch into France and Germany, where real interest
rates remain high and the economic cycle has not yet swung upwards.

FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Drowning in Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Until March this year when its shares were suspended, Queens Moat Houses
appeared a respectable hotel chain with a long and successful history as a
publicly-quoted company. The document released by the company's new
management, however, depicts a company lacking the most basic financial
controls. Some of the choicer elements include the payment of unlawful
dividends over three years and the non-existence of records used to
construct the 1992 interim results. Even among the many horrors unearthed by
the recession, this catalogue of concerns ranks high. Despite the
praiseworthy efforts of the Cadbury committee and Accounting Standards
Board, many questions about corporate governance and financial reporting
remain unaddressed.
The most disturbing aspect is the flimsiness of opinions expressed by the
company's past advisers. It is perplexing, to say the very least, that two
firms of property valuers could arrive at such different valuations of QMH's
hotels in the space of a year. QMH's previous auditors and brokers deserve
censure for permitting the publication of misleading accounts. The
Department of Trade and Industry would appear to have much to investigate.
The new management has done its best to draw a line under past errors. But
given the incompleteness of records at QMH's 200-odd subsidiaries and its
remaining lease liabilities, this can only be drawn in pencil. The future
strategy of the group is dictated by circumstance. There is little point in
QMH's banks appointing receivers and dumping 200 properties on a glutted
hotel market.
The following months will doubtless see much haggling between QMH's 65 banks
and the two classes of preference shareholders over the terms of the
restructuring. Ordinary shareholders, though, have little hope of any
redress. QMH may only make Pounds 20m of trading profits this year,
sufficient to support about Pounds 250m of debt. The forthcoming
debt-for-equity swap will surely obliterate any remaining value.

FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexico recovers from its NAFTA worries
 -But investors remain unenthusiastic about poor recent third quarter
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The optimism of the Mexican stock market returned yesterday as investors put
behind them worries over disapointing third quarter results and obstacles to
the passage of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. The
impressive rally over the previous month faltered badly earlier in the week.
However, the market ended up only marginally down over the week. Yesterday
the index leapt 42.28, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,020.26 - still 14 per cent
higher than September 21 and 15 per cent up on January 1.
The majority of the blue chip companies reported third quarter earnings
during the week, and in many cases they were below expectations. Cemex, the
construction company, Vitro, the glass company, TMM, the shipping group and
Dina, the truckmaker, among others, saw sharp falls in their prices, as the
weak economy and high interest rates took their toll.
Even the 15.3 per cent increase in profits at Telmex, the telephone
monopoly, failed to stem a short-term sell-off.
The market rally over the month as a whole comes as investors appear
increasingly confident that the economy will start to pick up towards the
end of this year and that, regardless of NAFTA, growth in 1994 will exceed
the modest 1.5 per cent expected this year.
Optimism is partly based on the steady fall in interest rates on news of
lower inflation and a reduced trade deficit, as well as the government's
intention to boost spending and cut taxes in the run-up to next year's
election.
The market has also been more confident about the prospects for Nafta, the
fate of which is expected to be decided by the US House of Representatives
in November.
But uncertainties have never been far away. The near universal view among
brokers is that rejection of Nafta would lead to sharp reversal in the
market in the short term, with some predicting a return to the 1,500 or
1,600 level.
The sweeping victory of Canada's Liberal party in last Sunday's general
election, and its demand that parts of Nafta should be renegotiated came as
a blow, although it was widely expected. The fear is that Canada's
opposition could provide cover for US congressmen wanting to oppose the
treaty.
Political uncertainty is also beginning to climb. The ruling party is set to
nominate a presidential candidate, probably by the end of the year: this
person will be the overwhelming favourite to win next August's election.
Investors recall that the candidacy of President Salinas in 1987 led to a
spectacular market rise. If Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, is chosen,
the market might be expected to take off again. However, if one of the less
economically experienced candidates is selected a reversal could be in
store.
Third quarter earnings seem set to follow the pattern of results over the
past year. Industrial companies facing international competition, and those
depending on trade, have performed poorly throughout the year. However,
consumer-orientated businesses, such as Maseca, the flour producer, have
continued to show strong gains.
The government's recently announced economic pact for next year is not
expected to help industrial conglomerates. The pact would reduce energy
prices but, in theory at least, the savings have to be passed on to the
consumer. On the other hand, the pact will lead to a pick-up in wages and a
rise in costs.
The industrial sector has also been hit by an exchange rate which, adjusted
for inflation, has appreciated against the dollar every year since 1989, and
remained strong throughout this year. If Nafta is rejected, the government
has said that it will defend the currency with high interest rates, thereby
hurting the generally indebted industrial companies.
By pushing interest rates down, SG Warburg expects Nafta to raise economic
growth next year by an additional 50 basis points to 3.5 per cent, and
increase earnings growth from 13 per cent to 17 per cent. Faster growth, a
stronger currency and lower interest rates, should help retail companies,
such as Cifra, Gigante, Liverpool, construction concerns such as ICA and
Cemex, and banks such as Banamex and Banacci. Their earnings are sensitive
to economic growth and greater consumer and government spending.
Picking companies that would be relatively unaffected by Nafta's rejection
depends on whether or not the government reacts with higher interest rates,
as well as the effect such a decision would have on the currency. Some
companies, such as Vitro, that might do well under devaluation, are also
heavily indebted, and would suffer from high interest rates.
Companies with low net interest payments are Cifra, Kimberly Clark, Telmex
and Liverpool, according to Baring Securities, and might be relatively
unaffected by higher interest rates. Industrial conglomerates with revenues
in dollars, such as Vitro, or mining companies, would gain from a
devaluation.

FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow consolidates Thursday's
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices mostly traded in a narrow range on either side of opening
values as investors consolidated the gains earned during Thursday's
record-breaking rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.27 at 3,680.59,
and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 0.11 at 467.84.
Secondary indices fared better, with the Amex composite finishing up 4.09 at
481.44, and the Nasdaq composite up 5.77 at 779.26. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 266m shares.
After Thursday's big advance, when the Dow rose to a new record high of
3,687.86 on news of stronger-than-expected third quarter economic growth,
investors took a breather yesterday. Some chose to take some of the profits
earned earlier in the week, while others decided to sit out the session and
await the markets' next decisive move.
Weakness in bond prices (the yield on the 30-year bond ended the day up at
5.967 per cent) also contributed to the subdued opening of equities trading.
The declines in Treasury prices were sparked by the day's only economic news
 -an increase in the Chicago Association of Purchasing Management's index of
manufacturing activity from 54.5 in September to 57.0 in October.
That news, plus gains on foreign stock markets, ensured that profit-taking
did not make a big dent in share prices during the day.
Among individual stocks, Eastman Kodak, which had jumped sharply on the news
that Motorola's chairman Mr George Fisher had been hired as the company's
new chief executive, gave back Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 63. In contrast,
Motorola, which fell on the news, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 104 3/4
. Xerox continued to benefit from positive reaction to its third quarter
results, rising another Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 .
General Motors was hard hit by profit-taking, declining Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 47 5/8 , as were Chrysler, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 56 and Ford,
off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 61 7/8 , all in heavy trading.
Brokerage stocks were in demand. Merrill Lynch climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 96 7/8 , Morgan Stanley rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 5/8 ,
Salomon added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 45 1/4 , Charles Schwab put on Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 34 1/2 and PaineWebber firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 29
3/8 .
Exide enjoyed a strong debut on the NYSE, the battery maker's stock rising
from an offer price of Dollars 20 to Dollars 26 7/8 in volume of 3.8m
shares.
Aetna climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 65 3/4 on news of improved third
quarter earnings.
On the Nasdaq market Microsoft rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 80 1/8 and Dell
Computer added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 20 1/4 . Canada
TORONTO prices closed solidly higher in moderate end-of-the-week trading, as
a late-session rally propelled the TSE-300 composite index to another record
high. It rose 20.37 points, or 0.48 per cent, to close at 4,255.61 above the
previous peak of 4,235.24 achieved yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES were supported by public and arbitrage fund buying and the
Nikkei average advanced by 1.1 per cent after three consecutive days of
declines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 223.52 to 19,702.97 after a low of 19,500.95 and a
high of 19,744.27. The index, which had lost 4.1 per cent during the past
three trading days, rose in tandem with the futures market on index-linked
buying, and ended the week down 2.7 per cent.
Volume was 280m shares up from 235.5m and advances led declines by 709 to
266 with 146 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 28.20, or 1.8 per cent to 1,630.59, its first gain in 10 days. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.23 to 1,296.42.
Confidence was also supported as the slide in East Japan Railway abated
somewhat, with the shares closing down Y5,000 at Y520,000, having initially
fallen to Y500,000.
Buying interest concentrated on large capital issues and high-technology
blue chips. Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y24 to Y861, while
NEC gained Y20 to Y951. Nippon Steel added Y14 to Y334 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Y30 to Y675.
Consumer electronics gained ground, with Matsushita Electric Industrial up
Y30 to Y1,470 and Sony gaining Y70 to Y4,920. However, Pioneer Electronic
fell Y20 to Y2,770 on prospects of weak earnings.
Banks recovered some of Thursday's losses: Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y80 to
Y2,400 and Sakura Bank Y50 to Y1,680.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined to Y810,000 in early afternoon, but
later trimmed its losses to Y1,000 closing at Y831,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 235.29 to 21,621.65 in volume of 14.1m
shares.
Roundup
RECORD highs were the order of the regional day.
HONG KONG continued to ignore Sino-British differences over political
reform, the Hang Seng index closing 318.82, or 3.5 per cent higher at
9,329.09, 7 per cent up on the week.
Turnover hit an estimated HKDollars 9.72bn, up from HKDollars 6.83bn on
Thursday, and Jardine Matheson, seen as sensitive to Sino-British friction,
climbed HKDollars 3.00 to HKDollars 74.00.
AUSTRALIA broke through 2,100 on the All Ordinaries index to close at
2,112.2, up 35.9 on the day, 2.5 per cent better on the week, and at its
highest in 6 years. Turnover soared, from ADollars 398.2m to ADollars
908.5m.
Good corporate prospects, and the possibility of lower interest rates after
a modest 0.5 per cent rise in September quarter inflation lent support, and
offshore buyers looking for quality stocks drove BHP up 52 cents to ADollars
17.70, CRA up 60 cents to ADollars 16.34, and News Corp by 36 cents to
ADollars 11.50.
NEW ZEALAND chalked up its sixth successive gain and a four year high in the
NZSE-40 index which closed 28.59 higher at 2,159.77, 2.9 per cent higher on
the week. There was heavy trading across the board, but especially in the
market leaders, Brierley, Carter Holt and Telecom.
KUALA LUMPUR reached its new peak on strong foreign demand for Telekom,
which drove the KLSE composite index up 25.24 to 971.99, 4.1 per cent up on
the week. Telekom registered a high of MDollars 22.00 before closing at
MDollars 21.60, up MDollars 1.70.
BANGKOK and MANILA hit their highs in spite of profit taking, the SET index
putting on 21.73 to 1,260.91, 9.7 per cent higher on the week, and the
Manila composite 46.23 to 2,372.83 for a week's gain of 4.9 per cent.
TAIWAN, still well below April's high, rose only 20.30 to 4,086.17 on the
SEC's proposed removal of ceilings on foreign investment in individual
stocks.
BOMBAY's BSE index fell 31.4 to 2,667.9, 1.9 per cent down on the week, as
fears remained of a political crisis in Kashmir.

FT  30 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Switch is seen back into
German equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET's overnight gains inspired the early closing markets, but this
stimulus was noticeably absent in the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended the 15-point gain it saw in Thursday's post-bourse, the
DAX index closing 30.54 higher at 2,069.00, virtually flat on the official
week. Turnover recovered from DM6.9bn to DM9.5bn.
Ms Barbara Schulz at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, observed that English
investors have returned to the market after a long period on the sidelines,
and that this may have affected individual stocks. For instance, the metals
and engineering group, Metallgesellschaft, saw a gain of DM17.50, or 4.6 per
cent to DM401.50 on a big UK order. British institutions were probably
trying to find underperformers, said Ms Schulz.
News based movers included Volkswagen, which rose DM7.20 to DM394 on its
four day week and retreated to DM390.50 later as its works council chairman
poured cold water on the idea; and Bayernverein, up just 50 pfg on the
session but accelerating to DM528 in the afternoon after the bank publicised
its restructuring plans.
AMSTERDAM remained in good spirits, although the CBS Tendency index closed
off a year's high of 137.7, up 0.3 at 135.9 and down 0.8 per cent on the
week.
Doubts over the future direction of the proposed link-up between four
European airlines, including KLM, weighed on the Dutch carrier, and the
shares moved down 70 cents to Fl 39.70. Problems have surfaced this week
over the choice of a US partner, with KLM having links with Northwest and
Swissair with Delta.
Heineken fared better, rising Fl 1.20 to Fl 201 on the day and 2.7 per cent
on the week. Kleinwort Benson's Dutch team has recently issued a buy note on
the brewer , and noted good sales for the group's products in the US,
eastern Europe and the far east.
The team said that it had upgraded its 1993 eps to Fl 12.70 from Fl 11.50 in
1992; it added that the disappointing share price performance over the past
12 months had been partly a consequence of an over reaction to the recent
bottling scare, as well as the market's neglect of defensive stocks.
In the chemicals sector, both DSM and Akzo lost some of Thursday's gains as
investors took another look at DSM's third quarter results. DSM slipped 70
cents to Fl 102.10 and Akzo Fl 1.70 to Fl 179.30.
PARIS settled lower on the expiry of futures and options. The CAC-40 index
lost 14.03 to 2,181.95, down 2.2 per cent over the week.
Canal Plus shed FFr20 to FFr1,328 in spite of returning a 9 per cent rise in
third quarter turnover, while Elf Sanofi was off FFr10 at FFr989 in reaction
to news that its Yves Saint Laurent division was to be prohibited from using
the 'Champagne' brand name in a new product range. YSL is to appeal against
the court ruling.
Michelin rose FFr2.00 to FFr181.50. Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on the
stock during the week, and expected the price to rise by over 30 per cent
during the next 12 months.
The brokers said in support of this view that first half earnings had been
depressed by a FFr2.6bn restructuring charge, covering the period up to
mid-1995. 'This brings a degree of predictability to the path of earnings
recovery which will be absent in the rest of the European automotive sector
in 1994 and even in 1995.'
MILAN's improvement stemmed partly from victory by the government in a vote
of confidence. The Comit index rose 7.66 to 583.41, down 1.7 per cent on the
week.
There was activity in Ifil and Rinascente as the former began its bid for 33
per cent of the retailer, which is being sold by Fiat as part of its
financial restructuring. Shares in Ifil added L117 to L5,114, while
Rinascente lost L40 to L9,462 and Fiat was unchanged at L3,723. The tender
period closes on November 19.
MADRID featured a Pta90 gain to Pta2,740 in Banesto, which reported a 76 per
cent drop in nine-month profits but said that it was sacrificing immediate
profits for a stronger balance sheet.
The general index rose 1.65 to 308.20 for a 0.7 per cent fall on the week.
STOCKHOLM saw its second record high helped by strong gains in the bank and
insurance sector. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 4.9 to 1,426.2, a
rise on the week of 0.6 per cent. Turnover was estimated at SKr1.8bn.
S-E Banken A shares put on Skr1.50 to SKr60.00 and Handelsbanken A SKr2 to
SKr112. OSLO rose to a new 1993 high as the All Share index put on 9.37 to
613.99, in turnover of NKr655m. COPENHAGEN posted a recovery after two days
of declines, the KFX index rising 1.42 to 103.65, a fraction higher on the
week. DDL, which controls the Danish share of SAS, rose DKr110, or 4.8 per
cent to DKr2,400 on speculation that the Alcazar airline alliance is falling
apart.

FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs pressured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bears in the drugs sector were to the fore with more uncertainity moving
through the sector mostly on the back of caution over Wellcome. The stock
continued the slide it began after its disappointing results on Thursday and
lost a further 22 yesterday to 690p with 9.3m shares traded. A number of
brokers distanced themselves from the stock, declaring it either overvalued
or recommending a sell. Several thought that 650p could prove a settling
price for the stock.
Most bears stopped short of saying that the sector could face a re-rating
after Wellcome's aftermath soured sentiment for other stocks. But one said:
'This will certainly add to the nervousness in the sector.'
One stabilising force for pharmaceuticals was that fears over the Clinton
healthcare plan appear to be receding. One analyst said: 'The feeling in
Washington is that only parts of it will be implemented.'
Kleinwort Benson was offering to buy Invergordon shares at 298 1/4 p for a
48-hour cash settlement, which was the signal for a huge rush of investors
seeking a quick return on their holdings. While one leading institution was
said to have sold its entire 7.75m shares, directors were also said to be
active, one selling 675,000 options at 4p for a net return of over Pounds
2m. Total turnover reached 55m. Kleinwort is acting for Whyte &amp; Mackay which
has made a 300p-a-share offer, reluctantly accepted by the Invergordon board
on Thursday.
Food retailers stayed under pressure as the predicted price war broke out,
with Asda beating the expected combatants to the gun as it announced a price
freeze on 5,000 items. The other supermarkets groups are expected to respond
in kind, with one analyst commenting: 'It's going to be a bloody Christmas.'
Asda shares slipped 1 1/2 to 54p in another day's big turnover of 25m. Tesco
dropped 3 1/2 to 203p in volume of 6.3m, J Sainsbury 6 1/2 to 395 1/2 p in
turnover of 4.8m and Kwik Save 9 to 642p.
Broker upgrades followed the trading statement and analysts meeting with
Rank Organisation. The Rank share price, which has been under some pressure
recently, reacted favourably and closed 9 ahead at 841p in busy turnover of
2.5m. Such was the recent caution surrounding the stock that many brokers
were preparing to reduce their profit estimates ahead of yesterday's
meeting, worried over the group's debts and Xerox contribution. However,
some improvement had been seen in the group's overall trading and the market
forecast for this year shifted from Pounds 240-260m to Pounds 250-265m.
The revelations of write-downs on the hotel valuations at Queens Moat
Houses, which was suspended earlier this year with financial problems, had a
surprisingly mild effect on the hotel sector. Forte actually shot forward in
early trading as Rank announced a good price for the sale of one of its
central London hotels. The shares later slipped back to close a half-penny
off at 221 1/2 p.
Several factors put a bit of vim into the oil sector, despite the weakness
of the crude price. Shell enjoyed investor interest after its oil figures
were well received and moved ahead 9 to 711p in turnover of 4.9m.
A successful auction of shares in its scrip dividend helped to push up the
price of Enterprise Oil 4 to 484p. BP continued to attract keen support
ahead of Thursday's third quarter figures, the shares closing 4 up at 349
1/2 p.
Brisk two-way business was reported in Cable and Wireless as the shares
underwent a split. Opening at 486p, they went to 498p and edged up in a
perky telecoms sector to close 3 up at 501p. Turnover was 10m. The move was
put down to the hectic activity in the Far East market, still buzzing with
the huge flotation of Singapore Telecom. Vodafone gained 8 to 553p. Dealers
said that the forthcoming flotation of Pac-Tel's cellular arm was exciting
interest in the UK group's valuation.
There was another day's huge turnover in Ferranti, the electronics and
aerospace group undergoing an agreed 1p-a-share bid from GEC. Over 63m
shares traded hands as they edged down a quarter to 1 1/2 p. GEC gained 2 to
352p, partly from relief over the Jubilee line extention.
There were no real features in the insurance areas of the market, with only
Sun Alliance, having any exposure to the massive storm damage afflicting
northern California. Sun Alliance shares eased 2 to 369p.

FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record high for Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent upsurge in the merchant banking area of the market, triggered by
expectations of substantial trading profits from booming international bonds
and equity markets plus the probability of increased mergers and acquisition
business, continued apace.
SG Warburg, the more marketable of the two merchant banks in the FT-SE 100
index raced up 11 more to a record 924p, leaving the stock on the brink of
the exclusive Pounds 2bn market capitalisation club. Turnover in the shares,
rarely above 1m a day, totalled 1.5m. The bank is scheduled to announce
interim results on November 9, with analysts looking for something like a
150 per cent increase in profits and a near 15 per cent jump in the interim
dividend. Marketmakers are talking the shares up to Pounds 10-plus in the
short term.
The upsurge on Hong Kong markets had a big impact of the UK banks with
widespread and lucrative interests in the far east. HSBC was the big winner
in the sector, closing 15 higher at 762p -within 13p of the all-time high -
after heavy turnover of 7.8m shares. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, raced up
18 to a peak 1088p.

FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market rallies as account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SHARE prices continued to edge forward yesterday, responding to a modest
end-account rally, and still helped by the recent upsurge in overseas
markets which has seen Wall Street reaching new all-time records and
European markets staging a useful recovery.
Gilt-edged stocks, however, came under moderate downside pressure, with
long-dated stocks settling around four ticks lower and index-linked stocks
making minor progress in subdued trading.
The FT-SE 100 index, which has see-sawed all week, influenced in turn by
bouts of profit-taking by UK and then European and US institutions, moved up
8.0 yesterday to close at 3,171.0. Over the week the 100 index has retreated
28 points, or 0.9 per cent, from its all-time closing high of 3,199, as UK
funds began to lock in profits from the record strong performance of the
market.
Then overseas institutions turned aggressive sellers, reacting to a rather
gloomy message from the latest survey published by the Confederation of
British Industry which highlighted a distinct slowing in the pace of
recovery in the UK and calling for a reduction in interest rates in the
November 30 Budget. And dealers noted early signs that some of the big
Continental funds had begun to reduce their weightings in the UK market back
into Germany, following the recent interest rate cut.
Wall Street's overnight performance was viewed as slightly disappointing to
London dealers who had seen the Dow Jones Average power above the 3,700
level during London trading late on Thursday. Consequently, there was a
degree of certainty at the outset of trading yesterday when the FT-SE 100
moved up cautiously during the morning session, reached a session high of
3,172.3, before slipping back in the afternoon and then picking up again at
the close.
There was genuine surprise among institutional traders yesterday at the
exceptionally high level of turnover in equities. Just over 800m shares
changed hands, the highest single-day's business for many weeks. It was
pointed out, however, that almost 18 per cent of that total, around 140m
shares was accounted for by activity in just three stocks. Ferranti, which
has attracted a 1p-a-share bid from GEC, Invergordon Distillers, where
Kleinwort Benson bid for stock on behalf of Whyte &amp; Mackay, and Asda, the
food retailer. The value of customer business on Thursday was Pounds 1.84bn,
the highest for two weeks.

FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKING time was the spirit of the day in Footsie futures with the December
contract showing no real sense of direction, writes Christine Buckley.
A quiet opening was followed by a squeeze on the contract which pushed it up
higher. In thin volume, it edged its way up to the psychologically important
resistance level of 3,200 but fell 3 short of that at its day's high.
Hopes had been raised in the morning that there would be a strong gilts
market, mainly fuelled by optimism that the chancellor could be forced into
a full point cut in interest rates in the Budget. That hope proved fruitless
and no positive lead was offered by gilts.
The contract drifted off in the afternoon and it touched its day's low of
3,182. A small rally was mustered to push it up to a closing level of 3,186,
just marginally ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Volume was steady
at 8,104.
Traded options were subdued with a total of 26,545 lots dealt. Index options
proved a substantial part of that activity with 11,735 lots traded in the
FT-SE 100 option.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Futures close easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL futures contracts eased slightly on the last trading day of the
month following technical presures and comment in the UK suggesting that
interest rates may not fall as fast as expected, writes Peter John.
Short sterling was volatile, dropping in the afternoon after Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was not confident that
a cut in UK base rates would fit the government's goals for inflation.
Some dealers suggested the comments acted as a useful excuse for traders
keen to balance trading books at the end of the month. The futures contract
for December, which had reached a high of 94.64 in earlier trading dropped
to close four basis points lower on the day at 94.55.
The German Euromark contract for the same month eased slightly to 93.85 and
the French contract fell four basis points to 93.60, both slipping on
end-of-the-month adjustments.
Monetary conditions in the UK money market continued tight as banks were
unwilling to take up the Bank of England's early offer of help. The Bank of
England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.85bn, later revised
down to Pounds 1.75bn but by midday only Pounds 28m of help was provided.
The tight conditions pushed overnight rates to 9.5 per cent and one-month
money to 6 15/16 per cent. Among the main factors affecting the position
were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands
which drained Pounds 1.852m from the system.
A rise in note circulation - traditionally heavy on a Friday as banks
prepare for big withdrawals from cash machines over the weekend - withdrew
Pounds 810m. Partly offsetting, these Exchequer transactions added Pounds
1.555bn.
The Pounds 28m of assistance at midday consisted of Pounds 6m of band one
bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent and Pounds 22m of bills for resale to the
market in equal amounts on November 16, 17 and 18 at an interest rate of 5
29/32 per cent.
The Bank provided a further Pounds 1.525bn assistance in the afternoon. It
bought Pounds 840m of band one bank bills and Pounds 6m of band two bank
bills, both at 5 7/8 per cent.
The Bank also bought Pounds 679m of band two bank bills for resale to the
market in equal amounts on 16, 17 and 18 November at 5 29/32 per cent.
Finally, the Bank gave Pounds 220m of late assistance.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Technical trading dominates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONGER D-Mark exerted early pressure on several European currencies as
international investors adjusted their books on the last trading day of the
month, but most affected currencies recovered by the close, writes Peter
John.
Some encouraging economic data came out of France and the US yesterday,
while Belgium suffered political pressures. However, the foreign exchange
market tended to concentrate on technical factors.
The French franc was one of the more volatile currencies. It picked up in
early trade as Mr Edmond Alhpandery, the minister for the economy, said that
data from the French statistics office INSEE, showed the country was pulling
out of recession.
Then, the franc slipped back in the afternoon after it was announced that
unemployment in France had risen to 11.8 per cent from 11.7 per cent
previously, in line with the consensus forecasts.
The franc traded in a half centime range, between FFr3.5000 and FFr3.5050
against the D-Mark, for most of the day and closed unchanged at FFr3.4990.
The Belgian franc was down at BFr21.72 to the D-Mark earlier in the day as
the country's transport system was crippled by a strike but the currency
picked up in late trading and closed at BFr21.64 to the D-Mark, up from
BFr21.80 previously.
Mr Avinash Persaud, economist with JP Morgan, takes a gloomy view of the
Belgian and French economies. He argues that the Belgian franc will fall to
BFr23 to the D-Mark within the next three months while the French currency
will hit FFr3.60 and French unemployment will top 12 per cent by the end of
December.
The Spanish peseta, Italian lira and Danish krone were also weaker against
the D-Mark in early trade.
The dollar was lifted slightly by promising regional data ahead of figures
from the National Association of Purchasing Managers next week. It was taken
back from the highs by profit-taking but closed more than half a pfennig up
at DM1.6795 from DM1.6735 and better against the Japanese yen and sterling.
The pound recovered from early weakness against the D-Mark as some investors
took comments from Mr Eddie George the governor of the Bank of England as an
attempt to dampen recent speculation of a further cut in base rates.
Sterling closed unchanged at DM2.4975.
The Bulgarian lev opened steady against the dollar and slightly lower
against the D-Mark after the Bulgarian National Bank raised its key interest
rate to 47 per cent late on Thursday.

FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo chairman moves to assuage
Renault link fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle manufacturer, yesterday stepped up efforts to
persuade sceptical shareholders to support the proposed merger of its car
and truck operations with France's Renault. The move came as uncertainty
grew over the outcome of a stockholders meeting to decide the issue.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, acknowledged the goal for the merged
company, of achieving average operating returns of 7 per cent, was high in a
tough industry.
However, he said: 'That shows how beneficial we believe the merger will be.'
Addressing concern that the 65 per cent balance to be held by state-owned
Renault amounted to a French government takeover of Volvo, Mr Gyllenhammar
said the merger could not be delayed until after Renault was privatised.
He said this could delay the privatisation because potential investors
needed to know the extent of Volvo's commitment to the merger.
Mr Gyllenhammar and Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, told a
Swedish newspaper that a letter or public statement from the French
government to Volvo shareholders spelling out its commitment to Renault's
privatisation would be helpful.
The fate of the merger depends on a group of Swedish institutional
shareholders who have yet to decide how they will vote at the shareholders
meeting on November 9.
Yesterday the insurance group Skandia, which holds 3.7 per cent of the
voting capital, delayed its expected decision, saying it needed more time to
analyse the merger deal.
Other fund managers said they were still pressing Volvo for more information
before making up their minds. A key participant, a government pension fund
which is the second-largest shareholder after Renault with 7.5 per cent of
the votes, has retreated from its earlier positive position. It now says it
will make its final decision next Wednesday.
Another state pension fund, with a 2.5 per cent stake, has already said it
will vote against the merger.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S finance ministry is to cancel a tender for 45 per cent of the
equity in the state-owned Bank Slaski after failing to receive an offer from
'a satisfying investor'.
The tender, organised by Banque Paribas, aimed to produce a strategic
investor for Bank Slaski, the second big bank to be offered for sale under
Poland's bank privatisation programme.
The sale of the bank's stock, however, is to continue. Small investors are
being offered 30 per cent of the equity, starting on November 3, with the
government setting the price at 500,000 zlotys per share.
Foreign banks and domestic investors had been invited to bid for the 4.17m
of the bank's 9.26m shares, with a minimum price per share set by the
government at 230,000 zlotys.
Earlier this year, the government sold off the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy
(WBK) with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as its major
foreign investor. The Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy is next in
line.
The failure to find a large foreign partner for Bank Slaski will delay
privatisation. Even if employees and management take up their 10 per cent
allocation, and all shares offered for sale to the public are bought, a mere
40 per cent of the equity will be in private hands.

FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Galeries Lafayette in retailer
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GALERIES Lafayette, one of France's leading stores groups, is taking full
control of Monoprix, the retail chain. It is buying a 37.77 per cent stake
from the Malard family in a FFr500m (Dollars 85.3m) deal.
The Monoprix deal, which increases the Galeries Lafayette holding from 54.96
to 93.79 per cent, comes only two years after its last significant
acquisition, the FFr2.87bn deal for the Nouvelles Galeries retail concern.
Galeries Lafayette, still burdened by heavy debts due to the Nouvelles
Galeries deal and the cost of opening its troubled New York store, has
negotiated to pay for the Monoprix stake in a series of instalments until
the end of 1996.
Monoprix is one of the largest and best-known retail chains in France
selling general merchandise, such as clothing and household goods, as well
as food. Galeries Lafayette has already installed Monoprix supermarkets in
some of its own sites.
The Monoprix deal comes at a turbulent time for French retailing. Many
retail groups have been badly affected by the recession.
Galeries Lafayette reported a net loss of FFr140m for the first half of this
year, having only just broken even in 1992.
The retail sector has also been destabilised by a series of mergers and
acquisitions. Pinault-Printemps is still selling assets in an attempt to
reduce the debts incurred by its takeover of Au Printemps. FNAC, the music
and books chain, was sold this autumn because of the financial problems of
GMF, its old parent company.
Tesco, the UK food retailing group, earlier this year bought Catteau
supermarkets.

FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: JAL forced to revise forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAL, Japan's largest airline, yesterday reported a substantial deterioration
in its first-half performance and passed its interim dividend. It also
revised its forecast for the full year, citing a difficult business outlook.
The airline blamed the recession, a strong rise in the yen, and an unusually
cold summer, which kept Japanese people at home.
Its international passenger traffic declined, compared with the same period
last year, while demand dropped for cargo exports to Europe and the US.
The drop in revenue was also a result of intense price competition, which
the company has been trying to combat with a belated attempt to introduce
frequent-flyer incentives.
Flight operations were also adjusted to meet changed demand. New package
tours and new traveller services were introduced.
Despite JAL efforts to build up its domestic passenger base, the number of
domestic passengers carried rose just 0.1 per cent compared with the same
period last year.
Overall, the airline was unable to introduce sufficient measures to offset
the fall in demand and price competition from other airlines.
'This year we regarded as crucial for our survival,' JAL said. It added that
the operating environment would get tougher and competition would increase.
There were no signs of recovery in demand for air travel.
The airline is implementing a survival plan to cut costs.

<TEXT>
NISSAN Motor, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday unveiled a drop in first-half
sales and deeper pre-tax and operating losses. The result confirmed fears of
a deteriorating business climate for Japan's automotive industry.
The second-largest Japanese carmaker passed its interim dividend and warned
it would not make a profit in the year to March. The group is undergoing a
restructuring programme and hopes to cut 5,000 jobs over the next three
years.
Although Nissan is uncertain of when it will be able to return to the black,
it is sticking to an earlier forecast of a break-even in the current year,
and a return to profits in fiscal 1994.
However, Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, an executive managing director, conceded 'it is
becoming extremely difficult to attain that goal'.
'Whether or not we can return to profitability next fiscal year depends
largely on the speed of recovery in domestic demand,' he said.
The Japanese carmaker saw a 10 per cent decrease in total vehicle sales over
the period. Much of this was due to the shift of production overseas.
Domestic vehicle production fell 13 per cent, while overseas production rose
22 per cent.
However, the rise of the yen was also a significant reason for the decline
in vehicle sales. Nissan said during the first half, the impact of the yen's
rise amounted to Y100bn (Dollars 926m).
Although about Y50bn was absorbed through forward exchange dealing and price
rises, the net impact of the currency's surge was Y50bn.
Nissan has tried to combat the adverse affects of the yen and weak sales
through cost-cutting, which resulted in savings of about Y60bn.
It has, however, also been able to make non-operating income of Y13.2bn from
sales of marketable securities.
Nissan's European operations are also under heavy pressure. The European
market's weakness meant production at the UK plant would have to be reduced
by about 9 per cent from 270,000 units to 246,000 units. The company was
studying ways to reduce production without laying off people, Mr Hamaoka
said.
'It is a very abnormal situation,' he said.
Nissan is expecting to suffer an operating loss in the second half. This
could force it to consider selling securities and fixed assets to break even
at the pre-tax level.

FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Singapore Telecom sells well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFER for a 10 per cent stake in Singapore Telecom (ST), the posts and
telecommunications utility, has been four times oversubscribed, surprising
the most bullish of brokers.
Based on the value of shares offered, the market capitalisation of ST, which
is being partially privatised, was SDollars 55bn (USDollars 35bn).
'It's fairly amazing when you make comparisons,' one analyst said. 'ST is
being valued at about 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of British
Telecom.'
Fifty per cent of the offer, in categories A and B shares, priced at
SDollars 1.90 and SDollars 2 respectively, was available to Singaporeans
only. The rest, the C share category, was open to Singaporeans and
foreigners on a tender basis at a minimum price of SDollars 2.
The offer closed on Thursday after aggressive tendering for C shares pushed
up the strike price to SDollars 3.60, giving a prospective price/earnings
ratio of 48.
While no-one doubts the credentials of ST - which has a monopoly on
Singapore's highly-efficient telecoms sector until 2007 - there are some who
feel many share-buyers have rushed in without thinking.
An abundance of liquidity in Singapore, an influx of foreign funds, and an
intense government campaign to encourage wider share ownership have resulted
in hectic share buying.
It is believed slightly more than a third of the C category shares were
taken up by foreigners.
The Singapore government had structured the ST offer to discourage stagging.
It offered heavy discounts to Singaporeans who would keep their shares for a
six years.
However, analysts say A and B shareholders might be tempted to take a quick
profit. The Singapore stock exchange announced that, from Monday market
hours will double to 12 to cope with the expected surge in trading volumes.

<TEXT>
NIKON, the Japanese photo-graphic group, has blamed poor demand for cameras
and optical glass for a loss in the first six months to September. A fall in
exports due to the sharp appreciation of the yen also hit results, writes
Emiko Terazono.
Nikon, which paid Y4.5 per share in interim dividends last year, said it
would forego dividend payments.
It reported a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y1.6bn (Dollars 14.8m),
against a Y1bn pre-tax profit a year earlier. Sales declined 12.1 per cent
to Y91.6bn, and the after-tax loss was Y799m.
The company expects to return to the black for the year to March.

NEW World Development, the Hong Kong property developer, posted a HKDollars
3.4bn (USDollars 449.3m) profit this year - a 46.5 per cent jump, from
HKDollars 2.36bn, on the previous period.
It attributed the growth to a sharp increase in property development sales,
bolstered by a rise in luxury residential prices in the first half in 1993.
There was also an improvement in the hotel division.
Turnover rose 7 per cent to HKDollars 13.32bn.
The company recommended a final dividend of 62 cents a share, amounting to a
full-year payout of 87 cents, up from 68 cents previously.
New World has put considerable emphasis on its activities in China, where it
has accumulated some 50m square metres of land for development, in addition
to a number of infrastructure projects.
Although profits continue to be dominated by Hong Kong residential property
sales, the company's Chinese investment programme will make a maiden
contribution in the current fiscal year.
The group will complete its first Chinese power station project and two toll
roads in the country. It is also launching the sale of several large
property developments.
New World aims to have up to 25 per cent of its net assets invested in
China.

FT  30 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wall Street turns to long bond
engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FACED with a shortage of long-term bonds issued by the US government, Wall
Street has decided to create its own.
Or rather, recreate them. In the 1980s, investment banks made money by
tearing Treasury bonds apart and selling the components for more than the
value of the whole.
Now, led by Salomon Brothers, the banks are ready to start putting the bits
back together to make whole T-bonds again.
The process has been spurred by the US Treasury's decision to issue fewer
30-year bonds. This has contributed to the bull market in so-called 'long
bonds', where yields have fallen to historic lows.
The dismantling, known as 'stripping', involved separating the coupons (or
interest payments) on the bonds from the underlying principal. Each part was
then sold separately as a zero-coupon bond.
On Thursday, Salomon - Wall Street's pre-eminent bond trading house and the
bank which first started stripping T-bonds back in 1982 - became the first
to reverse the process publicly. It launched an offer to buy back Dollars
10bn of zero-coupon bonds, which it and other investment banks had created
in 1984. The parts will be reassembled to create Treasury bonds which mature
in 2014, Salomon said.
The economics underlying this feat of financial engineering remained a
closely-guarded Salomon secret.
In return for their zero-coupon bonds, the bank is offering investors
identical instruments issued by the US Treasury - which started its own
'strips' programme in 1985 - or cash. These Treasury-created instruments are
worth more than those of the investment banks because they are traded in a
more liquid market, Salomon said.
Even after paying this premium, Salomon believes current market prices are
sufficiently out of line to yield a profit by turning series of zero-coupon
securities back into whole bonds.
Technical factors explain part of this: given their 20-year maturity and
high coupon rates (the stripped bonds were issued when interest rates were
at 12-13 per cent), the reconstituted bonds will prove cheap for investors
looking to deliver bonds in settlement of futures trades, Salomon said.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium prices hit
8-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHAKY foundations of the aluminium market slipped again this week,
allowing prices for the metal at the London Metal Exchange to subside to the
lowest levels for eight years.
The three months delivery position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,067.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 8.25 on the day and Dollars 47.75 on the week, after the
already-tottering market was shaken by news of another five-figure addition
to the record stocks in exchange warehouses.
Most of the week's fall happened on Tuesday, when long-standing support
around the Dollars 1,100-mark gave way under the weight of gloomy world
economic conditions, the seemingly inexorable stocks rise and continuing
unrestrained exports from the former Soviet Union.
On his return from talks in Brussels, Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy
prime minister for foreign economic relations, said in Moscow on Wednesday
that agreement had been reached with the European Commission on the outlines
of a solution to the row over the aluminium exports with which his country
is flooding the world market.
But with details of the agreement's thorniest component, the ceiling to be
set for Russian exports, remaining to be decided the market was able to take
little heart from that.
Although the pace of the fall was slower during the second half of the week
most analysts thought it would only be a matter of time before a bear
assault was mounted on the next technical support area, around Dollars 1,050
a tonne for three months metal. And if that gave way the market could soon
find itself within hailing distance of 45 cents a pound (Dollars 991 a
tonne), which the Anthony Bird consultancy group has identified as 'a
disaster price' that would quickly force western producers to close another
2m tonnes of annual capacity, on top of the 1.4m tonnes already temporarily
shut down.
Early in the week zinc had been among the weakest of the LME contracts, the
three months price falling Dollars 29.50 to Dollars 920 a tonne at one
point. That fall was regained with interest, however, as buyers were
encouraged by persistent, though unconfirmed, rumours that a European
production cut announcement was imminent. At yesterday's close the three
months price stood at Dollars 958.75 a tonne, up Dollars 9.25 on the week.
Lead also recovered from an early decline to end marginally higher on
balance. Support was found on a dip to Dollars 403 a tonne for three months
delivery on Tuesday and with trade buying appearing at Dollars 410 yesterday
the price closed at Dollars 416.50 a tonne, the highest level since early
August.
Dealers explained the the lead market had been helped to shrug off a further
LME stocks rise to a record 293,450 tonnes by continuing bullish sentiment
following Thursday's news of a shutdown at Mexico's Monterrey smelter,
tightness in supplies of concentrates (an intermediate material) and an
upturn in consumer demand.
The tin market fared less well, although the appearance of demand in the Far
East yesterday ensured that the three months price finished more that
Dollars 100 above Tuesday's low of Dollars 4,660 a tonne.
Last week's near-Dollars 200 rise had been wiped out by Monday's close and
the sellers remained in the ascendancy until after Tuesday's announcement
that members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries had agreed at
their meeting in Kuala Lumpur to cut exports by 13 per cent in 1994 to
78,000 tonnes.
Earlier news that China, the world's biggest tin producer, had decided to
join the association made little impact on the then bearishly inclined
market.
At the London bullion market gold prices fluctuated quite violently without
ever threatening to break out of the present narrow trading range. After
alternating rises and falls of up to Dollars 4.50 a troy ounce had been met
by trade selling at the top and bargain hunting at the bottom the price
ended the week just 80 cents up at Dollars 368.80 an ounce.
Silver followed a similar pattern, though in this case the sellers got the
better of the exchanges and the cash price ended 6 cents down at Dollars
4.38 1/2 an ounce.
Coffee futures were in retreat early on at the London Commodity Exchange,
but ended near the top of the week's range.
Technical selling in New York pushed the January position down to Dollars
1,171 a tonne at one stage before the market responded positively to news
that Brazil had approved funding arrangements for the stockpile purchases it
would be required to make under the producers' export retention scheme.
Doubts about Brazil's effective participation in the scheme had been
undermining market sentiment in recent week's.
The January price climbed to Dollars 1,222 a tonne at one stage yesterday
but edged back to close at Dollars 1,210, up only Dollars 5 on balance but
still comfortably above the psychologically significant Dollars 1,200 level.
Cocoa futures peaked early, the March contract touching Pounds 985 a tonne
on Tuesday. With this and subsequent movements towards Dollars 1,000 meeting
strong resistance, however, dealers concluded that the market was becoming
'range-bound' and that some fundamental encouragement would be needed to
provide fresh impetus for the stalled bull run, which many thought still had
a long way to go.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Flextech shows increased midway
deficit of Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEXTECH, the cable and satellite television group, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.2m for the six months to June 30, against a
deficit of Pounds 2.91m in the comparable period which covered the six
months to September 30.
Losses per share deepened to 6.68p (5.86p).
The results reflected the change in the accounting year from March 31 to
December 31 and included only media interests following the disposal of the
oil services interests, completed in July 1992.
The company, which earlier this week announced plans to buy for shares the
European programming business of Tele-Communications by Christmas, increased
sales to Pounds 2.66m (Pounds 2.15m).
The deal would give TCI, the US broadcasting company which is itself in
merger talks with Bell Atlantic, a controlling stake in the enlarged
company, more than doubling Flextech's capitalisation to Pounds 200m.
'Notwithstanding the losses incurred during the period the board, given the
changes taking place, are convinced of the potential of the core business
and look forward to the future with confidence,' said Mr Stanislas
Yussakovich, chairman.
Flextech, which holds a 50.1 per cent interest in The Children's Channel and
will hold 39 per cent of The Family Channel, also plans to hold 85 per cent
of Action Stations, a project to open children's indoor play areas in the
UK.
The sites will consist of games and play areas combined with retail outlets
and food facilities. Flextech said participants will include The Discovery
Channel, TCC and TFC.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Time running out for Greycoat rescue
architects

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to construct a financial package to save Greycoat, the ailing
property company, from liquidation are taking longer than the architects of
the rescue, Mr Julian Tregor and Mr Bryan Myerson, had expected.
Greycoat and its advisers have only one full working week before passing a
30-day deadline within which it is required to rectify a breach of the
gearing covenant on the zero bonds. Trustees for bondholders would then have
to consider whether to issue default notices.
The two corporate financiers, who advise the UK Active Value Fund, said they
were arranging a rescue shortly after share and bondholders rejected
proposals for a Pounds 120m rescue package from Postel, the UK's largest
pension fund.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lep reduces losses to Pounds 5.05m - Number
of debt-reduction possibilities under consideration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP GROUP, the freight forwarding and security company which was last year
restructured by its banks, has cut its interim pre-tax loss from Pounds
14.7m to Pounds 5.05m.
However, Mr David James, the company doctor who was appointed chairman by
the banks, yesterday reiterated the health warning he made at the AGM in
July.
'We don't feel the investing public has realised that there is no prospect
of a dividend in the foreseeable future,' he said.
The company was looking at a number of possibilities for the future, he
said, and might float off all or part of the equity in core businesses to
reduce its debt, which stood at Pounds 340m at the end of the first half.
The pre-tax outcome was struck after a Pounds 1.77m loss for the disposal of
property and Pounds 17.5m of net interest payable.
While the interest charge was down from a previous Pounds 23.7m, the company
said it was still high in relation to profitability. This reflected the fact
that the residual debt is attributable to losses on former activities and
discontinued operations.
Total operating profit rose from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 14.3m. The latest
figure included a contribution of Pounds 71,000 from associates, compared
with a loss of Pounds 137,000 last time.
Mr James said the group's trading activities had benefited from the
stability following restructuring in August last year. This had helped
investment in the freight forwarding division, which would have a long-term
benefit.
Operating profits in the division fell from Pounds 6.52m to Pounds 3.45m.
However, the division is expected to be ahead in the full year as the latest
figure reflects an adjustment in the accounts for last year.
Operating profit at the National Guardian Corporation increased from Pounds
8.84m to Pounds 10.6m. The group said a small improvement in its trading
performance had been enhanced by the sterling-dollar exchange rate.
Total turnover was unchanged at Pounds 703m. However, last time's figure
included Pounds 8.42m from discontinued operations.
Losses per share fell from 12.7p to 0.7p.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram shares dip as Masco talks break
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING RAM said yesterday that Masco Corporation had withdrawn from bid
talks after the kitchens and bathrooms group, where changed accounting
policies recently revealed heavy losses and gearing, told the US building
products company its price range was too low.
Shares in Spring Ram dropped 4 1/2 p to close at 55 1/2 p - little more than
a third of the year's high of 146 1/2 p but above its recent 40p low.
Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said: 'They did not make an offer. The price they
were thinking of was too low.' He said he valued the company more highly
than the Americans: 'At that point Masco decided that their ambitions to buy
the company at a bargain price would not be fulfilled so they continued
discussions about other issues.'
Mr Regan said Masco made a number of products such as taps and valves which
Spring Ram might buy and that co-operation on fabric design was possible.
He said the board was now concentrating on the future: 'We are just getting
on with the hard work we have got to do on our organisation, getting our
marketing effort sorted out and things of that sort.
Masco Corporation declined to comment.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Flotation expected to value Azlan in excess
of Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AZLAN GROUP, a distributor of advanced computer networking systems based in
Wokingham, Berkshire, is expected to have a market capitalisation in excess
of Pounds 40m when it comes to market later this month.
The pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday and impact day is November
12. Dealing in the shares will start on November 24.
The placing and intermediaries offer is designed to raise some Pounds 7m,
out of which Pounds 1m will be accounted for in expenses and Pounds 1.3m
will be used to redeem preference shares held by existing institutional
investors. The balance of Pounds 4.65m will be used to strengthen the
group's capital base, enabling it to exploit future business opportunities.
Azlan also published results for the half year to September 30 yesterday. It
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.88m on turnover 69 per cent up at Pounds
28.5m. For the year to March 31 pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.9m on turnover
of Pounds 41.2m.
Azlan was formed in 1984. In 1991 Mr David Randall, the current managing
director, led a management buy-out supported by a group of institutional
investors including CINVen.
The company has taken an approach to networking distribution which demands
that it adds significant added value to the 500 or so products it sells.
Distributors are now faced with choosing between selling high volumes of
product at low margins or smaller product volumes of new and innovative
products which can benefit from Azlan's networking skills.
Azlan aims 'to maximise the sales of a product in the early days of its life
before competition and familiarity with the product erode the initial higher
margins,' Mr Randall says.
The vendors from which it buys products include Digital, Intel, Lotus,
Microsoft and Novell. It is not an easy strategy to follow but one which
should guarantee higher profitability than conventional electronics
distribution. Azlan's skills include network infrastructure and integration,
network management and workgroup productivity.
The prospectus points out that in addition to expanding its market share and
range of products, Azlan intends to establish new businesses in continental
Europe.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals push LIT Pounds 21m into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIT HOLDINGS, the marketing services, investment and fund management group,
plunged deeply into the red in the first half, reporting a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 20.6m.
The deficit follows exceptional items of Pounds 27.5m related to the sale in
July of LIT America, its US futures and options clearing subsidiary, for
Dollars 23.6m (Pounds 15.6m). The sale resulted in a loss of Pounds 7.7m and
a charge, under FRS 3, of Pounds 19.8m for goodwill previously written off
to reserves.
In the first-half of 1992 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.25m.
The group is planning to restructure and change its name to Johnson Fry
Holdings. Mr Paul Gildersleeves, company secretary, said yesterday that the
restructuring would mark the end of a troubled period of three or four
years, leaving the company to face the future without debt.
The company is repaying its Pounds 12m of outstanding debt through the
proceeds of the LIT America sale and profits from Johnson Fry, the UK
financial services company, this year.
Johnson Fry boosted operating profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 7.73m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 24.7m - higher than for full year
1992, when turnover was Pounds 22.5m.
Mr Gildersleeves said that Johnson Fry's performance had been boosted by its
success with business expansion scheme issues. The company raised Pounds
281.5m of BES funds in the half compared with Pounds 98.2m in first-half
1992 and Pounds 159.2m for the whole of last year.
Business expansion schemes, which end this year, accounted for 62 per cent
of the turnover. Mr Gildersleeves said it was inevitable revenues would dip
next year.
The company would concentrate on investment management and residential
property management.
Losses loss per share were 42.9p (earnings 1.8p). Without the LIT America
charge, earnings would have been 5p.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook to pay interest on Dollars
350m-worth of loan notes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the UK container leasing and transport rental group, said yesterday
that it would be paying US bondholders the interest on two unsecured loan
notes worth Dollars 350m (Pounds 232m) which falls due on Monday.
The decision to make the payments will relieve some of the pressure from
bondholders in the US while the group works out a refinancing arrangement
with its bankers.
Had the group decided not to pay the interest immediately, it could have
taken advantage of a 30 day grace period before it would have been in breach
of the terms of the notes.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: GPA signs rescue deal with GE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing company which has been struggling with
debt of Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn), yesterday signed its rescue deal with
GE Electric of the US.
Mr Dennis Stevenson, chairman of his own consultancy groups, the SRU, and
the Tate Gallery, has agreed to become non-executive chairman.
GPA has finalised plans for a Dollars 150m capital raising, the granting of
options to GE Capital, GE's financial services arm, to take control of the
company, and the deferral of Dollars 750m of debt repayments for three years
plus the injection of Dollars 150m of new money.
Although the deal was largely agreed in May, the complexity of the
documentation has delayed finalisation until now. It is designed to give the
company the stability to enable it to reduce debt through aircraft sales
within three years.
GE Capital will have an option to buy up to 67 per cent of the company by
March 1998, paying between Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m. For three years
after that it can buy further shares and could take 100 per cent control of
GPA.
GPA will pass management of its assets to GE Capital Aviation Services,
under a 15-year contract.
Its new chairman will be Mr Tony Ryan, who is steping down from the aircraft
leasing company he founded in 1975. An arbitrator is still looking into his
Dollars 2m claim for compensation for loss of office.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Depth and complexity of the problems stuns
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER, MICHAEL SKAPINKER and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TAKE a map of the London underground, superimpose it on Network South East
and you get some idea of the complexities.' So Mr Andrew Coppel, chief
executive, describes the challenge of sorting out troubled hotels group
Queens Moat.
Observers were stunned yesterday at news that Britain's third largest hotels
group had incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.04bn, and had been operating
for at least two years with virtually no financial controls.
'We never had a whiff of it,' the head of a rival hotel group said
yesterday. While the industry knew the City had concerns about the group's
debt, QMH's hotels had seemed operationally sound.
Mr John Bairstow, the former chairman who left after the group was plunged
into crisis talks with bankers in March, would have held the same view. 'It
was a growth company and was doing extraordinarily well,' he said yesterday.
'The thing that went wrong was insufficient profits in 1992.'
Mr Bairstow, who created the south of England estate agents Bairstow Eves,
is unashamed of his entrepreneurial habits, which some have blamed for QMH's
troubles today. 'When a company is run with an entrepreneurial flair, it is
not the way accountants would run it . . . with everything done absolutely
properly, and due diligence on every acquisition and disposal.'
Mr Bairstow was unquestionably the driving force behind QMH's expansion. The
story is well documented of how Mr Bairstow built the company out of his
front room, opting to run an 18-room hotel from his Tudor home in Essex.
Less well documented is just what happened within QMH to bring it virtually
to its knees. QMH was hailed as a doyenne of the leisure sector in the late
1980s when it consistently produced strong profits, rising from Pounds 24.8m
in 1987 to Pounds 94.1m in 1990. Other leisure groups were puzzled by its
achievements and attributed them to a lean central office.
Mr Trevor Ward, a director of the Horwath hotels and leisure consultancy,
says the group's small head office and the management incentive scheme
appeared to fit in with the fashion for cutting central overheads and
delegating responsibility. 'They took it to extremes. They were delegating
responsibility but retaining no control.'
The latest revelations show that QMH's real achievement was in making a
string of acquisitions which buoyed profits growth but were basically
unmanageable with the group's resources. Even Mr Bairstow will admit as
much: 'We were certainly lacking in management expertise.'
The report issued to banks showed QMH had no monthly consolidated management
accounts which would allow the board to monitor the group's progress.
Board directors were also kept ill-informed, claim insiders. Although given
documents as they entered the boardroom, directors were asked to surrender
them as they left.
QHM's lax controls allowed it to enhance profits by booking in early the
earnings from hotels which were run on an incentive scheme.
Yesterday's statement also reveals that there had been no proper treasury
function. That lack, say insiders, resulted in a foreign exchange fiasco
which accounted for almost half the Pounds 300m increase in debt in 1992.
That year was the watershed for Queens Moat. The market was expecting
profits of some Pounds 80m for the year to December 31, a forecast which now
looks ridiculously high. During 1992 the group installed the incentive
scheme in Germany, which insiders say turned a group of hotels making
operating losses into contributors of more than Pounds 20m in profits.
Coincidentally, Mr Martin Marcus, the deputy chairman, aroused controversy
just before the results were to have been announced when he sold 1.1m shares
at 57p, making a profit of Pounds 600,000. The shares were suspended the
following month at 47 1/2 p.
Such entrepreneurial flair appears somewhat tarnished when confronted with
yesterday's results. Even Mr Bairstow will admit that his style of
management may not be appropriate to the 1990s. 'I never felt I was entirely
wrong, but if I had run the company more conservatively it would be much
smaller and . . . safer today.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat plans to form core hotel chain
 -New management puts strategy to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESSENCE of the business strategy Queens Moat Houses has put to its banks
is a plan to form a core chain of 50 UK hotels, which will be rebranded and
form a base for eventual expansion.
The new management expects to be ready to launch this chain by the first
quarter of 1995. The 50 hotels are expected to contribute 80 per cent of
budgeted trading profits for 1994.
The new chain, a name for which has yet to be chosen, will be 'leading,
three star plus' hotels, each with more than 100 rooms, located in or near
city centres, and having a restaurant and bar.
QMH believes these can achieve 'substantial increases in both trading
profits and cash flows'. The operational gearing in hotels is such that
profits can rebound sharply once occupancy and room rates are moving
upwards.
The rest of the group's hotels, another 53 in the UK and 86 in continental
Europe, will be not be put up for sale immediately. They will run for profit
with the aim of maximising their value either through eventual sales or as
additional security for the group's lenders.
Hotel sales in the present climate - with large numbers of UK hotels in
receivership and the market in continental Europe worsening - are unlikely
on a large scale although some, such as the Dutch hotels, are up for sale.
At the same time the financial restructuring will give the group a balance
sheet more appropriate to its operations. This will involve a substantial
debt for equity swap, cutting the interest charges QMH must service from its
operation and giving the banks control of a majority of the equity. The
exact size of the swap has yet to be decided but it is certain the existing
shareholders will be substantially diluted.
Bankers who have seen the business plan say the new management team has put
forward 'sensible projections' which indicate a beginning of a recovery in
UK profits in 1993 and 1994, with a larger rise later on. Profits from
continental Europe are still under pressure.
In the UK occupancy rates began to pick up in late May and early June, QMH
said yesterday, although room rates were still under pressure. A rise in
room rates is expected in 1994, however.
UK hoteliers were increasingly confident that the downturn had ended, Mr
Trevor Ward, a director of the Horwath hotels and leisure consultancy said
yesterday. The consultancy's quarterly survey in September found that nearly
80 per cent of hoteliers questioned believed recovery had started, compared
with 57 per cent three months previously. Over 80 per cent, however,
believed full recovery was a year or more away.
Mr Maurice Segal, chairman of Expotel, a large reservations agency, said
yesterday that QMH appeared to be trading reasonably well but that room
rates for the industry were still lower than last year.
The plan assumes some revival in hotel prices in the longer term, which
could even repay the group's loans in full. One banker said yesterday, 'if
the banks sit tight the restructuring has to be better than receivership'.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Former advisers face prospect of legal
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER professional advisers to Queens Moat Houses were keeping a low
profile yesterday as the company contemplated legal action following the
release of its substantially restated accounts.
Accountants, surveyors, stockbrokers and merchant banks all face the
prospect of harsh shareholder criticism and possible lawsuits.
QMH stated publicly that it was 'reserving its position' with respect to
possible legal action against advisers.
Asked about the prospects for law suits, the company said: 'In the army,
this is what is known as a target-rich environment.'
The company is believed to have consulted lawyers about litigation, and is
initially focusing on those connected to the illegal decision to approve
dividend payments which it did not have the profits to meet.
Much focus will be on Bird Luckin, a small accountanting firm which audited
the accounts, and the former auditor from which, Mr Maurice Hart, joined the
QMH board.
Prior-year adjustments in the restated accounts for 1991 reduced pre-tax
profits from Pounds 90.4m to losses of Pounds 56.3m.
Weatherall Green and Smith, the chartered surveyors, was the only firm
willing to comment, and yesterday vigorously defended its valuation of
properties.
It placed a value on the company's assets at December 31 1991 - which was
adopted in the 1991 audited accounts - of Pounds 2bn.
Its own valuation one year later was about Pounds 1.3bn, and the valuation
adopted for the 1992 accounts by another surveyor, Jones Lang Wootton, was
Pounds 861m.
Mr Terry Knight, senior partner of Weatherall, said: 'We stand by those
figures. I can understand the layman's difficulty in understanding them but
we happen to believe that our figures are right.'
Other advisers included de Zoete &amp; Bevan and Beeson Gregory, the
stockbrokers, and Charterhouse, its merchant bank.

FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals and interest charges behind
Pounds 1.04bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DETAIL of Queens Moat Houses' 1992 results reveals a staggering list of
exceptional items and prior year adjustments, headed by a property
revaluation cutting assets by Pounds 803.9m.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis assuming the
financial restructuring now being discussed is completed and the group's
banks continue to support it. Even without the property write-down, Mr
Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said that a refinancing would have been
necessary as the group could not service its debt.
Although the group almost broke even at the operating level, losing Pounds
700,000 compared with a restated profit of Pounds 22.4m, exceptional debits
of Pounds 939m and interest charges of Pounds 112.6m gave a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.04bn.
The 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 90.4m was restated as a loss of Pounds
56.3m before tax following changes in accounting policies.
The Pounds 146.7m difference included Pounds 50.9m of depreciation which the
group had not previously provided and maintenance expenditure which it had
formerly capitalised. Other changes related to profits on fixed asset sales
which had been overstated, expenses which had been capitalised and sale and
leaseback transactions which have now been treated as finance leases.
The total loss for 1992 was Pounds 1.07bn (loss of Pounds 102.5m), and
losses per share were 116.4p (8.5p).
Interim results up to July 4 show an operating profit of Pounds 9.1m, but
after net interest of Pounds 57.5m, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 48.4m. The
group said it could not restate the 1992 interim figures as the papers from
which they had originally been constructed could not be found. In August
last year the group reported an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 38.1m.
The end-1992 balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 1.17bn and negative net
worth of Pounds 388.9m. By July 4 debt had risen to Pounds 1.18bn and
negative net worth fallen further to Pounds 435.5m.
Fixed assets, shown in the 1991 accounts at Pounds 2.12bn had fallen to
Pounds 891.1m by the end of 1992 and Pounds 855.7m by July 4.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clouds of smoke from dry ice parted to reveal Lisa, aged 16, on a concrete
breeze-block, clad in hot-pants and platform boots, jerking her body to the
beat that pumped from the sound system. Her eyes were shut and in one hand
she held a small bottle of Evian mineral water. It was 4am at the Ministry
of Sound, the south London night club, and the Friday night rave had only
just got going. A decade ago, Lisa might have been sipping lager at a
friend's house, or more probably at that hour tucked up in bed. But
increasing numbers of her generation are spending their time and money in a
new wave of clubs - of which the cavernous Ministry of Sound, run by James
Palumbo, son of property-developer Lord Palumbo, is a thriving example. The
club has a no-alcohol, no-drugs, no-weapons policy, enforced by hulking
bouncers. The attraction is the rave culture of all-night dancing in a
sweaty, intimate atmosphere induced by the stimulant Ecstasy which is taken
by many dancers before they arrive, or secretively when there. It is about
seven years since rave - which combines hedonistic Mediterranean discos and
the electronic dance music of 1970s New York and Detroit - seized the
imagination of Britain's 15 to 24-year-olds. But it is only this week that
its economic impact - in particular on the nation's pubs and off-licences -
has been quantified.
According to estimates from the Henley Centre, the research institute, young
people make 1m visits to raves each week. Each time, they spend as much as
Pounds 35 and stay up to 24 hours.
The annual spending at raves is estimated at between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds
2bn - five times more than total UK spending on cinema admissions, and
equivalent to a quarter of spending on spirits. In addition, up to a third
of those at a rave will have taken drugs such as Ecstasy - at about Pounds
15 a tab - speed (amphetamine) or cocaine.
The biggest losers have been pubs, where visits by young people fell by 11
per cent between 1987 and 1991. They are forecast by the Henley Centre to
fall a further 20 per cent by 1997.
The trend will hardly thrill Britain's publicans. But there is reason for
them, and other traditional leisure venues, to relax a little. Rave has been
a fast-changing culture in its short life, and today's fads may look
outdated in a year.
Among the cognoscenti, the original concept of a rave is already
old-fashioned. Asif Noorani, a 21-year-old who writes about popular culture
for the Modern Review magazine, says young people are rejecting the large,
expensive raves that mushroomed in the late 1980s to seek a cheaper rave
experience in clubs.
' 'Rave' suggests hordes of 16-year-olds with bottles of Vick's VapoRub
(which is inhaled to clear the head before taking Ecstasy). The first ravers
were people who lived for Ecstasy, and didn't understand music,' he says.
Until about 1989, rave centred on events in open fields in the West
Midlands, for example, or on an 'orbital rave' around the M25. Organisers of
such raves had no licence to sell tickets; they took advantage of a legal
loophole and claimed the gatherings were parties - and passed around a
bucket for contributions.
'It was all about thousands of people taking as many drugs as possible,
listening to hardcore music. It was illegal and therefore a kick,' says
Matthew Butcher, 16, a pupil at Pimlico comprehensive.
But under pressure from the government and residents, the police cracked
down on raves organised without local council permission.
A number of entrepreneurs then tried to fill the gap in the market by
organising licensed, mass-attendance raves costing up to Pounds 25 a head.
These offered 'interactive' alcohol-free entertainment, combining
attractions such as laser shows, funfairs and trampolines with soft drinks
and powerful sound systems. A sell-out crowd could generate an income of
Pounds 400,000 a rave, excluding merchandise sales.
But the scene has changed again - partly because the profitability of
organised large-scale raves did not last. Fantazia, one of the few surviving
promotors, is organising a 'dance party' to raise money for the Terence
Higgins Aids charity in Glasgow next month. It is charging Pounds 25 a
ticket but needs a 12,000 crowd just to break even. It expects to spend more
than Pounds 300,000 on organising the event: security alone will cost Pounds
40,000.
Though the large-scale rave has probably peaked, experts agree with the
Henley Centre that the culture is more than a passing fad. In the eyes of
many young people, the new night clubs that offer a rave experience and that
are replacing the large-scale events, have more of a buzz than pubs. Matt
Paice, 21, a London student, enjoys a drink. But to him an average night out
means 'kids sitting at home having a puff on a joint and then going to a
club'.
Many young women, according to Lifeline, the Manchester drugs advisory
agency, go to dance parties because it is more fun burning off calories
there than at the gym. Women also find the atmosphere induced by Ecstasy -
the so-called 'hug drug', because it triggers empathetic emotions - less
threatening than the alcohol-induced aggression of pubs.
'Unlike punk or grunge, raves are not a cult but rather a new leisure
activity enjoyed by different types of young consumers,' the Henley Centre
concludes.
To combat the threat, pubs could offer themselves as rave venues. But the
attraction of clubs such as the Ministry of Sound is that they do not open
until midnight - and ravers want to escape the staid conventions of a night
at the local. It seems decibels and mineral water will be the scene for some
years to come.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Government must heed public in local
government changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor JOSIE FARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Curry may well believe what he says about the benefits of
reorganising local government (Personal View, October 28), but the public
does not - as polls carried out for the Local Government Commission in the
first phase of the review so graphically illustrated. He should stop to
consider the democratic implications of what he advocates.
By endorsing unitary councils, he and the government are pre-judging the
will of the people and the outcome of the review. Despite government's
claims that the wishes of the public would be of utmost importance in
finding a new council system for England, it is becoming patently obvious
that so long as ministers get what they want out of restructuring, then the
public can just be ignored.
What kind of democracy do we live in when a secretary of state can launch an
independent commission to examine an issue, gauge public opinion on it and
then just disregard what people say? And when people are to be denied the
choice of whether they have Pounds 1bn spent on local government
reorganisation?
The will of local people must be heard in the local government review. By
effectively limiting the choices of the public to what the government thinks
is right, the government is ignoring the very people it claimed it would
heed. Local democracy will suffer. And the public will have to foot the bill
for bringing in unitary councils without being given much freedom to choose
if they actually want to change their councils, and how.
If the government - unlike the people in tranche one areas, the
Confederation of British Industry and Sir John Banham, chairman of the LGC -
is so sure of its proposals for changing local government, then it should
let them be judged fairly in the court of public opinion. If the people
demand change, then so be it. But if they decide change is unnecessary, then
the government must heed their views. To do otherwise would be an assault on
their democratic rights and would call into question the independence of the
commission and the validity of the review.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Plucking the wrong geese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'How to pluck the geese' (October 27) does a disservice to
the wealth-creating sector, which is your constituency. Government spending
has risen by about 50 per cent in real terms since 1979-80. In the five
years between 1992-93 and 1997-98 it is expected to rise by 32 per cent. In
the five years to April 1994 government spending has been rising three times
faster than taxes.
Public spending is forecast to be Pounds 314bn in 1993-96. A Pounds 20bn cut
would be a reduction of less than 6.5 per cent. Few of your readers would
balk at achieving such a budget reduction in their own business over a
30-month period. Most of them have already done it more than once.
You conclude: 'Whatever Mr Clarke does, the geese will hiss. But he has no
prudent alternative. They will have to be plucked once again.' This is
defeatist. The industrial sector went through the mill in the early 1980s
recession. The service sector has gone through it in the early 1990s. Now it
is the turn of the public sector. You are encouraging the chancellor to
pluck the wrong geese.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Hackneyed cabbies versus rank outsiders: Fare deals in taxis
around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Love them or hate them: taxis prompt strong reactions. The taxi driver is
often the first 'local' you meet in a strange city, and the treatment you
receive can set the tone for the whole visit.
Travellers like to think that someone in authority will have vetted the
person at the wheel. But as our international round-up shows, this is not
always the case. Friction between London's highly regulated black cabs and
its unregulated minicabs (outside London, minicabs do have to be licensed)
has persisted for at least 30 years. Black cab defenders argue that tough
regulation is essential. Minicab supporters say there are already enough
rules on the statute book to ensure, for example, that unsafe cars are not
allowed on the road. Deregulation would reduce prices and increase customer
choice, they claim.
To get at the truth, the UK government published a consultative paper on
Wednesday seeking the views of travellers, cabbies' organisations and the
like. If deregulation's supporters prevail, it could mean the end of the
road for that evocative symbol of London - the black cab.
NEW YORK: New York taxi drivers have a fearsome reputation for rudeness and
an inability to speak English, despite the fact that to drive a Yellow Cab
they must pass an English proficiency test. They must also complete taxi
driver school and pass a physical exam.
There are nearly 1,800 Yellow Cabs on the city streets, and more than 3,000
livery cabs whose drivers are not required to speak English since they serve
ethnic communities. Most of the Yellow Cabs are Chevrolets, but this is not
a requirement.
Fares are remarkably inexpensive. The meter starts at Dollars 1.50 (Pounds
1) when you get in (Dollars 2 after 8pm), and thereafter you pay 25 cents
for every half mile. New York cabbies are often compared with kamikaze
pilots - weaving in and out of traffic at high speed with little apparent
regard for life or limb. On Tuesday, thousands of cab drivers marched to
protest their lack of safety - 35 drivers have been killed in the city this
year.
PARIS: The Paris taxi is one of the unsung bargains of the City. They tend
to be far cheaper than their London counterparts - fares within the centre
of the city rarely run to more than FFr40-FFr50 (Pounds 4.60-Pounds 5.70) -
and cabbies tend to know where they are going. It is unusual for them to
refuse to take you anywhere in the city unless, of course, your destination
is on the other side of the Peripherique.
A trip in a Paris taxi also tends to be safe. The cabs are generally
well-kept Mercedes, with the occasional Renault Espace. The drivers are
prone to saving their tempers - and their impressive array of Gallic
obscenities - for anyone foolish enough to drive or, worse still, cycle into
their path, rather than for their passengers.
Tipping is not essential (although the drivers do their best to imply to
tourists that it is) but it is polite to add a few francs to the fare.
MOSCOW: Taxi driving in the former Soviet Union is not for the
faint-hearted: nor is being a passenger. Although state-registered cab
drivers are formally required to pass a test showing knowledge of their
city, entry on to the market of any driver willing to pick up a fare means
that taxi driving has ceased to require any kind of skill beyond the ability
to drive (and sometimes does not obviously include that).
It is very rare for a driver to put on the meter, assuming he has one:
inflation has made the tariff structure meaningless. In practice, all fares
are negotiations. Foreigners are expected to pay a premium.
Most unreasonable are the 'mafias' outside big airports and hard-currency
hotels: these enforce high prices on the mafia members (and thus on the
customers) with a ruthless ferocity. One distinguished visitor told of
hiring a car below the mafia price: the car was stopped as he left the
airport, and his driver was led away and told to hand over his fee to the
mafia leaders on pain of a beating.
Cars can be in any condition, often terminal.
LAGOS: The vital qualities for a Lagos cab driver are brinkmanship and
skilled use of the horn. Although both driver and car show signs of the
daily struggle, a good taxi driver will get through the traffic jams and
road blocks in safety if not in comfort, and still manage a smile.
The official Lagos taxi is a bright yellow saloon, usually a Peugeot 504.
The drivers must have an official certificate but are not examined on street
knowledge. Taxis have fixed fares, about USDollars 3 for 3km, but you
usually need to bargain.
Unlicensed operators, known as cabo-cabo, are to be avoided.
TOKYO: The average white-gloved Tokyo taxi driver is confused not by a lack
of street knowledge, but by a complex address system in which houses are
distinguished by a three-tier number that jumps erratically out of sequence.
This encourages the driver to leave passengers in the general vicinity of
their destination.
Drivers are generally courteous, though they tend to prefer listening to
baseball games or agony aunt-style radio programmes rather than their
customers. The fare starts at Y600 (Pounds 3.70), though the government has
suggested that fares be liberalised to encourage competition.
BUENOS AIRES: One of the few bargains on offer in an otherwise expensive
Buenos Aires are its taxis. A three-mile trip will set you back about Pounds
3 - the price of a (small) beer.
Drivers are occasionally drunk, but the greatest threat comes from their
disdain for the speed limit. They sometimes take offence at being told which
way to go and dump their passengers there and then.
The taxi driver's favourite car is the Ford Falcon, production of which
ended last year. Renault 12s are taking their place.
ROME: Italian taxi drivers are tested on their local knowledge and must
obtain a certificate of good behaviour from the local prefecture. Then comes
the hard part: would-be drivers must get a licence to operate.
For this he or she must wait for an existing driver to retire since the
number of taxis is restricted. Rome has roughly 5,500 taxis for 4m
inhabitants. A driver may unofficially lease a licence to someone else.
Local authorities fix standing minimal fares - in the case of Rome the metre
fare starts at L6,400 (Pounds 2.60). A 3km ride in average traffic would
cost about L12,000.
FRANKFURT: On the ride from Frankfurt airport, the taxi driver will do his
best to accelerate to 200kmph within as short a time as possible and will
invariably try to test the brake system by driving his Mercedes to within
centimetres of cars in front.
There are 1,700 taxis in Frankfurt and, while there is no rule specifying
the make of the cab, 70 per cent are Mercedes. The cars must be painted
light yellow. The driver must be at least 21, have had a driving licence for
a minimum of two years, and have passed a test on city knowledge.
A ride costs an initial DM3.80 (Pounds 1.50) plus DM2.15 or DM2.35 per
kilometre, depending on the time of day. Drivers range from the garrulous
and friendly to the taciturn and downright rude.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rail privatisation, with BR as a
bidder, is route to necessary investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord MOUNTEVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Right lines for rail privatisation' (October 21)
unintentionally highlights the huge pitfalls that surround railway
privatisation.
One of the benefits of the proposals (and the reason I have supported them
in the House of Lords) is that they should open access to private capital
for the expansion of railway investment which is needed now.
You point out that Sir Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, wants to involve
private finance for infrastructure investment, yet while Railtrack remains
in the public sector he will presumably be subject to the same constraints
as is BR currently.
You acknowledge that short franchises are unlikely to attract the investment
needed in new rolling stock, so where will the investment come from?
I would also challenge your view on Lord Peyton's amendment (which I
supported), allowing BR to bid. The experience in Sweden, where this has
been tried, is that the state railway, SJ, did indeed secure the majority of
franchises, but that the stimulus of competition both improved services and
helped to reduce costs by some 30 per cent.
It must be in the interests of the taxpayer for private bids to be tested
against those of BR. It is certainly important in terms of the motivation
and morale of the many railway staff that will remain with BR that it should
not be seen as a 'rump' operator, managing those parts of the network that
are scorned by the private sector.
While those of us in parliament can legislate for privatisation, its
successful implementation depends on the enthusiastic co-operation and
participation of those who work for British Rail.

<TEXT>
Sir, It is impossible not to comment on EC social affairs commissioner
Padraig Flynn's prescription that hours of work be reduced to generate
employment ('EC plans 5 per cent jobless target', October 20). This is new
Euro-madness - that the pie can be divided into smaller pieces leaving each
with as much to eat.
The only way to increase employment is to increase productivity, thereby
increasing wealth. It is either that or Pharaoh building pyramids (that is,
the insanely ponderous governments of developed nations today). But that is
slave labour in a managed economy - which generates neither wealth nor
happiness.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Sense and sensitivities: UK building societies' resistance
to mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has not been a happy week for Mr Michael Varney, general manager of the
tiny Bexhill-on-Sea Building Society. After 80 years gathering deposits and
lending mortgages from its single branch, his society is to disappear. Its
3,000 savers and 600 borrowers are throwing in their lot with the Bradford &amp;
Bingley Building Society, which is 750 times larger in terms of assets.
Bexhill-on-Sea could hardly resist the might of Bradford &amp; Bingley. But it
was a different matter for the two societies which this week disclosed the
failure of their attempt at merger. Leeds Permanent and National &amp;
Provincial abandoned plans to create the third-largest UK society, having
found too wide a gulf in their management cultures.
The societies had settled contentious issues such as their future name and
chief executive - the society would have been called Leeds Permanent and
been headed by Mr David O'Brien, N&amp;P's chief executive. But the senior
managers seem to have decided that it would be hard to combine Leeds's
traditional management hierarchy with N&amp;P's emphasis on teamwork.
The failure saves the 1,600 staff who would have lost their jobs as
overlapping branches closed. But it raises questions over the apparently
inevitable process of consolidation among the 88 remaining societies, and
throws into further doubt the outcome of the struggle between banks,
societies and life insurers to sell financial products.
Mr Varney says the Bexhill-on-Sea gave up the ghost because of the growing
weight of regulation. He will now take early retirement after 40 years in
the industry. 'You reach the point where it is a crushing and expensive
burden for a small society, and you cannot go on any more,' he says.
Many of the tiny societies formed in the 18th and 19th centuries as mutually
owned savings clubs appear to have only a limited life. They are being
forced into mergers either because they have run into trouble through
ill-advised lending, or because they cannot compete with the marketing and
branch networks of the largest societies.
Until this week, the over-capacity in the retail financial services industry
which has led to big cuts in banks' branch networks also seemed to be
bearing down hard on medium-sized societies such as National &amp; Provincial.
Fierce competition seemed to be forcing them to grow through merger, or risk
becoming also-rans to Halifax or Abbey National.
Many societies think that, in order to compete with banks, they will have to
offer a range of products including credit cards, insurance and cheque
books. An amalgamation between two societies that complement each other's
branches and products offers each a way of developing a full service at a
lower cost than doing so alone.
But the Leeds/N&amp;P failure highlights a crucial weakness in this argument.
Because societies are mutually owned by their borrowers and savers, there is
little short-term pressure on them to merge. Indeed, the cost-cutting and
rationalisation which might attract shareholders of public companies can put
off savers who feel sympathetic to local branch staff.
The lack of external pressures on societies was one reason why the last big
amalgamation - between the Nationwide and Anglia societies in 1987  - took
several years to be a merger in anything but name. The societies preserved
their separate identities under the same banner, pushing up the Nationwide's
costs and producing limited benefits.
A study by Touche Ross management consultants last year concluded that
mergers between equal-sized societies causes more difficulty than
'takeovers' of small ones. 'You have got to have a senior partner, otherwise
there are three years of struggle to find compromises,' says Mr Donald
Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, the third-largest society.
This lesson has been reinforced just as several top 10 societies appear to
be struggling to find a direction. Bristol &amp; West, the 10th-largest society,
which has suffered from poor lending in the south during 1989 and 1990, has
said that it is looking for a merger after the departure last month of chief
executive Mr Tony FitzSimons.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Halifax, argues that there is 'clear
over-capacity' in retail financial services. 'How many personal financial
services providers of national stature is there room for?' he asks. Mr Peter
White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, says that large mergers
remain inevit-able for this reason.
But the internal obstacles to society mergers - in spite of the general
pressure to consolidate - have prompted questions over whether there is an
alternative. The most obvious would be the takeover of a medium-sized
society by a bank. Most speculation has focused on Lloyds, which tried to
take over Midland last year to reduce industry over-capacity.
Other clearing banks have also cast covetous eyes on some societies. The
chief executive of one high-street bank says that he has examined at least
three societies. He says that the advantages would be access to cheap retail
deposits, and an immediate share of mortgage lending.
Yet banks cannot simply launch hostile bids for societies. There are two
obstacles. One is that societies can only merge if their members -
consisting of their savers and borrowers - vote for it. The second is that
the industry is regulated by the Building Societies Commission, which is
widely seen as hostile to the notion of banks acquiring societies because of
the complications it would create for supervision.
All this raises the prospect of a stalemate among banks and societies.
Nearly all agree that there are too many suppliers of retail financial
services, but the short-term pressures on societies may not be strong enough
to force them to overcome the obstacles to big mergers. The issue will only
come to a head when over-capacity has cut profits substantially.
For societies such as Bristol &amp; West, it is not a happy prospect. They face
struggling on in a difficult market, with no prospect of escape through a
large merger. The Leeds/N&amp;P failure has not put off forever the
consolidation of societies, but it has shown there could be a painful wait
for it to happen.

FT  30 OCT 93 / A very British clash: Two society cultures that refused to
gel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
However sudden the abandonment of the Leeds Permanent - N&amp;P merger may have
seemed, it came as no surprise to many employees in Yorkshire's close-knit
building societies.
From the outset the proposed deal was viewed with scepticism locally. How,
one employee of a rival society asked this week, could the conventional
Leeds ever have merged with a society which allowed a middle-ranking
employee to buy a four-year-old Porsche, using a company scheme?
'Most Yorkshire societies,' he said, 'would very strongly dissuade the
employee from it.'
Some of the financial gossip in Yorkshire may be a little extravagant in
describing the yawning gap between the two societies' management styles -
'feudal' and 'off the wall' were among the epithets used to characterise,
respectively, the Leeds and the N&amp;P.
But there is no disguising the glaring difference between the sober culture
of the Leeds, said to be 'hierarchical', by one employee, and the more
innovative approach of N&amp;P, where staff are 'players', the executives are
the 'direction management team', the marketing department is called the
'customer requirements process' and meetings are styled 'events'. N&amp;P has
three 'role levels' of staff; Leeds has 15 grades.
N&amp;P's unorthodox management style has even fostered a witticism. 'At these
events, they go on talking until there are no more challenges to proposed
changes,' says one insider. 'It gives a new meaning to 'three-day
eventing'.'
'It's just not British. It's an American-based system of equality,' says Mr
David Holmes, Yorkshire Building Society's communications director. 'A lot
of the stuff seems like gobbledegook science fiction. We all know the
realities of working for large organisations.'
He adds, however, that Mr David O'Brien, N&amp;P chief executive, termed
'messianic' by some rivals has created a strong body of disciples among his
staff, committed to his approach. 'The people who work there find it
invigorating,' says Mr Holmes.
At the Leeds' imposing new headquarters many employees including middle
management - a level the N&amp;P calls 'managers of implementation' - were
evidently not ready to follow a new messiah. 'There were a lot of people
celebrating in the pub on Tuesday night,' says a Leeds middle manager.
After the announcement, staff at both organisations were instructed not to
talk to the media. But a few, anonymously, were willing.
'When I heard the merger had been called off, I had mixed feelings,' says
one Leeds HQ employee. 'It was good news because it was 1,600 jobs saved,
and that's 1,600 families. But on the other hand the merger would have made
us stronger and better able to compete against the Halifax.'
At N&amp;P, the staff association chairman, Ms Janet Wojtkow, says 'players'
were relieved, although some were disappointed too, having seen in the
merger the opportunity for career progression.
'We remained to be convinced the merger was in the interest of the staff,'
she adds. 'Our feelings have been proved right.'
For the N&amp;P, the merger debacle has produced some unflattering comment on
its management style. 'Our customers don't see us as some kind of wacky
organisation,' said the company's spokesman.
The feeling that N&amp;P was not 'British' reflected, he suggested, the British
wariness of change. 'While the rest of the world is looking at new ways of
working, we don't adopt them. N&amp;P has implemented them successfully.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Monetarism in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER the days, not so very long ago, when fighting inflation was the
sole aim of monetary policy, when fixed rules were thought the best guide to
monetary policy and when fine-tuning demand by using fiscal policy was a
cardinal sin? Times have changed. Slow growth is now the number one enemy
for most policymakers, discretionary monetary policy has replaced fixed
rules, and fiscal-activism, where possible, is positively encouraged.
Monetarism is out of fashion - Keynesianism is back. US officials, in both
the Bush and Clinton administrations, have led the new rhetoric, repeatedly
calling for lower interest rates in Europe and tax cuts in Japan. And
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was one of the first to spot that
slow growth and indebted banks, rather than inflationary pressure, were the
main threats to economic stability. The Fed cut short-term interest rates
early and sharply before the US recession began, dragging long-bond yields
down to record lows. Mr Greenspan has also ignored the siren monetarist
voices who have argue that double-digit narrow money growth spelt
inflationary dangers ahead. But, for all its lecturing, the US has not been
able to use fiscal policy to stimulate its sluggish recovery. With the US
budget deficit expected to be nearly 4 per cent of gross domestic product
this year, a further fiscal stimulus might well have provoked a rise in
long-term bond yields and choked off America's still sluggish recovery.
Instead, reversing the Keynesian logic, the promise of future fiscal
tightening has been used to keep bond rates down.
Japan, not the US, has been most effective at translating the Keynesian
rhetoric into reality. Blessed after years of restraint with a large
structural budget surplus, the Ministry of Finance has sanctioned three
successive fiscal packages to revive growth, switching a general government
budget surplus of 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year to a
deficit of 0.1 per cent next year.
Risky strategy
Yet, so far at least, Japan has little to show for its efforts. Output and
retail sales are still falling, the volume of bank lending continues to
contract and the OECD has already downgraded its forecast for Japanese
growth this year to zero. Not surprisingly, another fiscal package is
rumoured to be in the pipeline: a Y5,000bn (Pounds 31bn) tax cut, to take
effect next April, followed by a consumption tax rise in 1995.
This is a risky strategy: the negative effects of a prospective consumption
tax increase could blunt the stimulative effect of the income tax cut. In
any case, it is doubtful whether fiscal policy alone can revive Japanese
growth. No one can be sure whether Japan's sluggish credit growth is caused
by low demand from its bloated, job-shedding companies, or by restricted
supply of credit resulting from the parlous state of bank balance sheets.
But so long as monetary growth remains sluggish, the outlook for economic
recovery looks poor.
Germany, meanwhile, has experienced a huge and unexpected Keynesian boost,
followed by high interest rates imposed by an unflinchingly monetarist
central bank. As the growth effects of the fiscal boost have dwindled, so
this tight monetary policy has bequeathed a recession which may yet deepen.
Only five of German's six economic research institutes were able this week
to predict a modest economic recovery next year. The Berlin-based, and
Keynesian-leaning, Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW)
produced its own minority report predicting a further fall of 0.5 per cent
in output in the western Lande, after a 2 per cent fall this year.
Inflation-fighting
The DIW report called for lower interest rates and public investment to
revive the economy. But, like the US, Germany does not seem to have room for
a further Keynesian stimulus. This year's public sector borrowing
requirement is already expected to reach 7.5 per cent of GDP, a third higher
than the largest US deficit in the 1980s. More encouragingly for growth in
Germany and Europe, the Bundesbank appears to be edging away from its
earlier monetarist rhetoric. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer used a
speech this week to reaffirm his inflation-fighting credentials. But less
than a week earlier, he justified a surprise half-point cut in German
interest rates by emphasising the need to stimulate the German economy,
while downplaying the fact that broad money growth is still running outside
its target range.
There is one European capital which is defiantly refusing to enter the
pro-growth era. Since the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism this
summer, the French government has continued to link its monetary policy to
that of Germany by trying to maintain a stable D-Mark-franc exchange rate.
In so doing, it has refused the significant cut in interest rates that
France's low inflation rate justifies. As a result it continues to pay a
heavy price in terms of depressed growth and high and rising unemployment.
In Paris, at least, monetarism lives on.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Warehouses disturb the retail club: The effect of US-style
shopping on supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S retailers are bracing themselves for the arrival of warehouse
clubs after a High Court ruling on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to the UK's
first such development in Thurrock, Essex.
The UK's three biggest supermarket chains, J Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco,
asked the court to quash planning permission granted to Costco, the US
warehouse club operator. They argued that the project should have been
assessed as a retail rather than a wholesale operation, and so have been
subjected to tougher planning controls.
Mr Justice Schiemann rejected the supermarkets' application, clearing the
way for Costco to open the club on November 30. Costco has two other
projects under way, while Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the UK cash-and-carry operator,
is building two warehouse outlets and Littlewoods, the department store
chain, has a joint venture with Price Club of Canada to open a warehouse
club in Liverpool.
But while warehouse clubs are expected to expand quickly in the UK they seem
unlikely to 'revolutionise' UK retailing. It has also become apparent that
Wednesday's ruling has not ended the debate about whether warehouse clubs
should be treated as retailers or wholesalers. The supermarket chains are
still considering further legal action.
Warehouse clubs have been the fastest-growing form of selling in the US for
the past 10 years, achieving sales of Dollars 34bn (Pounds 22.5bn) last
year.
The clubs are huge out-of-town warehouses selling a selection of goods at
prices 25 per cent or more below the high street. But they sell in bulk,
only to fee-paying members.
Warehouse clubs undoubtedly offer big savings, but there are several factors
which suggest their impact in the UK may be limited. One is that there is no
evidence that UK shoppers will be as willing as US counterparts to drive
long distances to shop, or buy in bulk, even though it has become
commonplace for retailers to talk of a growing price-sensitivity among
British consumers.
Many bargain-hunters may find their desire for lower prices satisfied by
fast-expanding high-street discounters such as Kwik Save and Shoprite,
without the need to travel to warehouse clubs.
While clubs' ranges stretch from mincemeat to motor lawnmowers they offer
only 3,500 product lines, compared with about 16,000 in a typical
grocery-only superstore.
The clubs are not open to everyone - and that was the basis for the court
ruling. Mr Justice Schiemann said that if there was a restriction on who
could shop at a warehouse club it was not open to 'visiting members of the
public' and so was not a retailer.
Members will have to be businesses, or belong to groups such as charities or
churches.
Finally, analysts' estimates of the potential size of the market for
warehouse clubs range from about Pounds 1bn sales a year to Pounds 3.25bn a
year, from between 30 and 50 outlets.
But even Pounds 3.25bn would represent only 2 per cent of UK retail sales,
and compares with the more than Pounds 10bn turnover achieved by Sainsbury
alone last year. As only about half of the clubs' turnover is expected to be
accounted for by food, they are unlikely to take large sales from
supermarkets.
Mr Paul Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, said:
'Evidence in the US is that the clubs cream off a little bit of business
across a range of sectors.'
But their most important effect may be to set a new low price 'floor',
leading to increased competition on price among retailers accustomed to
large profit margins.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Asda freezes grocery prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, THE food retailer, yesterday fuelled speculation about a new round of
supermarket price wars by freezing more than 5,000 grocery prices until next
January.
Retail food stocks came under pressure in a second successive day of heavy
trading. Kwik Save fell 9p to 642p, Sainsbury closed 6 1/2 p off at 395 1/2
p, Tesco slipped 3 1/2 p to 203p and Asda was 1 1/2 p lower at 54p.
Mr Allan Leighton, Asda's marketing director, said the move was to mark the
anni-versary of the relaunch of the 'Asda price' advertising slogan.
City analysts said Asda's move was less a response to any threat from the
Costco warehouse club project than an attempt to regain market share from
existing rivals. It was likely to put pressure on other supermarkets to hold
prices down, however.
One analyst said: 'We are not going to see many price rises in the
supermarkets.'

FT  30 OCT 93 / Plugs plan prompts cost fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MANUFACTURERS of plugs and sockets are trying to kill a proposal for a
common European system, which they say could cost as much as Pounds 20bn to
introduce - about Pounds 1,000 for each UK household.
The proposed round-pin plugs would be unsafe if used in existing square-pin
sockets and could seriously damage the British manufacturing base,
threatening jobs and trade, they warn.
Mr David Dossett, director of the Electrical Installation Equipment
Manufacturers Association, said about half the Pounds 1.3bn of capital
employed by UK plug and socket manufacturers and subcontractors could be
made redundant if the system were introduced.
Smaller plug and socket manufacturers could be forced to cease trading, with
their place in the market taken by importers.
At issue is the future of both the British plug, with its three rectangular
pins, introduced in 1947, and the latest in a number of attempts over the
past 20 years to introduce a European-wide standard.
Supporters of standardisation say it would benefit travellers and create
economies of scale for plug and socket manufacturers, and for producers of
household appliances.
But the UK plug and socket industry - 20 companies employing 10,000 people
directly and a further 10,000 in support jobs - says the proposal does not
achieve genuine harmonisation, which it supports, and is unfair to the UK.
Under pressure from the European Commission, Cenelec, the European
electrical standards setting body, has produced unpublished proposals for a
system based on three types of round-pinned plug.
Mr Dossett said one of these - the existing 2.5 amp two-pin 'Europlug' -
fits many UK three-pin sockets. This is potentially lethal, he warned,
because it is possible to touch the live pins when inserting or removing it,
and because the plug is unfused. The UK ring-main system depends on fused
plugs.
The UK system would therefore have to be replaced, causing 'massive expense
with no obvious payback', according to the association. Mr Dossett said that
using adaptors for the 800m sockets in the UK would have aesthetic drawbacks
and possible safety implications because the number of electrical contacts
would be doubled.
Plug manufacturers, meanwhile, would have to invest heavily in lathes to
produce round pins, while European manufacturers would need to make only
modest changes.
One other option is for the UK to be granted a 'derogation', meaning that it
would not have to abide by the proposals. The Commons trade and industry
committee is due to consider the issue next month.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Individuals increase company holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of the total shareholding in UK companies owned by
individuals has increased since the late 1980s, partly due to a rash of
privatisation issues which have been aimed at members of the public.
At the end of last year individuals owned 21.3 per cent of the share capital
in UK companies, up from 20.6 per cent in 1989.
Pension funds held the biggest stake in public companies registered on the
London Stock Exchange, accounting for 34.7 per cent of total share capital
valued at Pounds 620.6bn. In 1989 the stake held by pension funds was
slightly lower at 30.5 per cent.
According to an article in the latest edition of Economic Trends, published
by the Central Statistical Office, the shareholding owned by insurance
companies has decreased over the same period to 16.5 per cent from 18.5 per
cent.
Almost two thirds of the value of shares held by individuals at the end of
December were in blocks of less than Pounds 100,000, and more than one
quarter in holdings of less than Pounds 5,000.
Individuals owned 24.5 per cent of shares in privatised companies, a higher
figure than the proportion for the market as a whole.
Overseas residents owned 12.1 per cent of total shares, worth about Pounds
75bn at the end of last year.
People and organisations in the United States accounted for just under 50
per cent of overseas investment, while other European Community nations
accounted for 17.5 per cent.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Customs traces Pounds 1.96bn of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise narrowly failed to meet its target of tracing Pounds 2bn
in underpayments of value added tax, its 1992-93 annual report says.
It traced Pounds 1.96bn, out of a total of Pounds 63.5bn in VAT and duties
raised during the year, up from Pounds 62.2bn in the previous 12 months.
Costs rose to Pounds 879m from Pounds 797m.
There were 1.63m traders registered for VAT during the year, down from
1.68m, with new registrations totalling 187,000. Total tax written off or
not pursued rose to Pounds 825m from Pounds 553m. Customs said the increase
reflected the effects of the recession and also cases being processed more
quickly.
The running costs of gathering trade statistics under the new European
Community single market were Pounds 14.7m, against a planned Pounds 15.9m.
During the year Customs seized consignments to Iraq in contravention of
United Nations sanctions valued at Pounds 181,606. It also brought
prosecutions against a company and its owner for the export of riot gear to
Angola without export licences.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Canary discharged with seven short words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE most complex administrations under UK insolvency law ended
successfully yesterday in the High Court in London with just seven words
from the Chancery vice-chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls.
'I approve the discharge with immediate effect,' he said after a 35-minute
presentation on behalf of the administrators by Mr Jonathan Mance, QC.
Court approval was the final step required 28 days after creditors voted for
a voluntary arrangement after Canary Wharf first entered administration in
May last year.
It followed provisional approval on October 19 subject to there being no
objections or challenges to the plan.
It clears the way for payment of a first dividend to creditors by the end of
January next year. The administrators ultimately forecast total dividends of
15p.
This payment will go to an estimated 1,400 unsecured creditors who voted in
favour of the exit strategy from administration.
A further 25p in the pound will be paid as dividends to the 130 construction
trade creditors to provide warranties to them on work already done.
Yesterday's approval means that Sylvester Investments - named after the
cartoon cat that pursued Tweety Pie, the canary - will become the holding
company, with shares held by the 11 creditor banks.
Sylvester will control a separate vehicle called Canary Wharf Holdings,
which will in turn own Canary Wharf Limited, the operating company for the
Docklands development.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Midland aims at small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK yesterday confirmed its intensified competition for small
business clients by announcing the freezing of its small-business tariff for
the coming year.
About 100,000 small businesses will continue to pay 60p for each credit and
debit item and a monthly maintenance charge of Pounds 2.50, the level they
have been since December 1990.
Charges have also been frozen for a further 200,000 on the standard business
tariff, which is no longer available to new customers.
The move reinforces the bank's high-profile advertising campaign which
emphasises that it has Pounds 1bn to invest in viable small businesses.
It comes at the end of a week in which Lloyds said it was cutting
transaction charges to small businesses and National Westminster announced a
slight increase in its tariff.
Banks should recognise their social obligations by not misusing their
economic power, by providing banking services to the entire community and by
acting to prevent unsustainable environmental practice, Bankwatch UK, the
research group, says.
Its report, published by the 'green' pressure group New Economics
Foundation, highlights the withdrawal of banks and building societies from
parts of Birmingham as an example of how banks have the power to 'pull the
plug' on a community.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S lossmaking lines are likely to appeal to the private sector
more than the flagship InterCity services, thanks to public subsidies,
according to the government.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, said yesterday that he thought the
subsidies would make lossmaking Regional Railways and Network SouthEast
attractive to bidders. Almost half their operating costs will be met by the
government over seven years.
The argument that bidders may be most interested in services which need big
subsidies was one factor which helped defuse a potential Tory backbench
revolt over the rail privatisation bill.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, this week outlined the
government's response to the amendment passed in the Lords which would have
allowed BR to bid for franchises. Under the new rules BR will only be
allowed to bid if there are no 'credible alternatives' from the private
sector or management buy-outs.
Labour has accused the government of negating the Lords' amendment.
Mr Freeman dismissed Labour fears that the private sector may 'cherry-pick'
the most profitable services. He said: 'The franchising director will fix
the subsidy for seven years; half the operating costs will be underwritten
by the government. This will give those interested in running the franchises
an ability to plan over the long term.'
BR now receives an annual subsidy and decides how to share it between its
different services.
Mr Freeman said: 'What we are proposing is a fundamental change in the way
we subsidise our railways.'
This appears to have been one of factors which swayed a number of potential
rebels to support the government when the bill returns to the Commons for
its third reading on Monday.
Mr Gary Waller, Tory MP for Keighley who had threatened to vote against the
privatisation proposals, said: 'The Labour party has overlooked the fact
that so-called rump railways, which are making a loss, could become the most
attractive franchises.'
Mr Chris Green, who will run Scot-Rail from April as a 'shadow franchise'
said: 'After we see the figures our team may well be interested in forming a
management buy-out.'
ScotRail relies on an annual government subsidy of Pounds 120m on a turnover
of Pounds 240m. However, the east coast line from London to Edinburgh and
Glasgow, which is responsible for InterCity remaining in profit, has not yet
attracted any serious potential bidders.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Collective view backs farm tenancy reform: A general desire
for new agricultural legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS JANE Jenner-Fust, a Gloucestershire landowner, would like her son to
have the option one day of taking over the dairy farm she lets to a young
tenant farmer on her 1,500-acre estate near the River Severn.
But her son is only 15 and has not yet decided on a career. If in the
meantime she lets her tenant stay when his Ministry of Agriculture licence
runs out in 2 1/2 years, the farmer will be entitled to tenure for life.
'He's a very good farmer and I'd like to be able to give him 15 years to get
on with it uninterrupted, and without feeling the axe is going to fall,'
said Mrs Jenner-Fust. 'But if I let him farm on a permanent basis, then I'm
cutting our own throats.'
Cases like hers prompted Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, to
announce plans earlier this month to reform legislation on agricultural
tenancies, which is seen throughout the farming industry as a mockery.
Under the 1986 Agricultural Holdings Act any tenancy longer than two years
entitles the tenant to stay for life. As a result, landlords resort to a
range of short-term arrangements, licences and loopholes - such as
agreements of between 13 and 23 months - to get round the law.
Mr Marshall Taylor, who farms a 300-acre dairy enterprise on the Crown
Somerset Estate in the Quantock hills and is vice-chairman of the Tenant
Farmers' Association, said: 'The current situation is just hand to mouth.
Land is being farmed short-term, which is neither good for the land nor the
farming business.'
The legislation also means young farmers without a private income or a farm
to inherit find entry into the business barred. Land is too expensive and
tenancies are too few.
Tenants farm 26 per cent of Britain's 213,000 agricultural holdings,
covering about 15m acres, or 37 per cent of the agricultural land.
Both landlords and tenants want reform, but they will probably have to wait.
Mrs Shephard made clear that her proposals were jostling for space in a busy
parliamentary timetable, so the earliest that legislation is likely to be
enacted is 1995.
She also needs to be sure her proposals will not split the government's
supporters. In spite of consensus on the need for change, her blueprint has
not met universal approval.
Mrs Shephard's plans, which would affect only new tenants, are to create a
new form of farm business tenancy to encourage diversification and to allow
contracts to be freely negotiated between landowners and tenants, subject to
three safeguards.
These would ensure tenants were fully compensated for improvements, that
either side could settle compensation disputes by arbitration rather than
through the courts, and that tenants received a minimum of one year's notice
to quit.
Not surprisingly, the Country Landowners' Association, whose 50,000 members
range from the Duke of Westminster and the Duchy of Cornwall to small
landowners with less than 100 acres, fully supports the Shephard plan.
Mr Nick Way, the association's political adviser, said: 'Landlords want
flexibility. Some of the institutions will let for long periods. Some
landowners will want to let for intervening periods if they've got a
successor who will be ready to take over in a few years' time. Some will
want to let to a new entrant for a short period in case it goes wrong.'
But the National Farmers' Union is sharply critical of the lack of
protection for tenants against ever-increasing rents.
Mr Ian Gardner, the union's policy director, said: 'In an industry like
agriculture, which has a staggering up and down record of profitability,
we'd be very worried about the implications for rural society of one-way
rent reviews.' The union wants a statutory clause stating that rents should
be reviewed according to prevailing market conditions, so landlords do not
hold all the cards.
The union has to be sensitive to the demands of its tenants' committee,
which represents nearly a third of its 97,000 members. Twelve years ago
tenants who felt the union was failing adequately to represent their
interests set up the Tenant Farmers' Association, which has 3,500 members.
The association argues for flexibility on the length of tenancies, rather
than a fixed minimum term. Mr Taylor said: 'We wouldn't want to be in a
position of having locked farmers long-term into holding land in difficult
times.'
The union has recently softened its earlier insistence on 15-year minimum
tenancies, which suggests the differences in the industry are more tactical
than strategic.
But even if these differences can be overcome the government will face
demands for further reforms, which landowners say are crucial to encouraging
more land to be put on the market. They want compensation for any fall in
land value resulting from tenant farmers leaving and taking their European
Community sheep quotas with them.
The Country Landowners' Association would also like the Treasury to extend
100 per cent relief from inheritance tax to landowners who let farms.
Given the state of government finances they may have to wait some time for
that too.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Auditors told to inform on fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS MUST examine companies' accounts so as to have 'a reasonable
expectation' of finding any fraudulent statements, under draft guidelines
issued by the Auditing Practices Board yesterday.
When they detect extreme cases of fraud they should notify the authorities
without informing the company, according to the standards-setting body.
The drafting of SAS 110, the auditing standard on fraud and error, has been
based on a proposed international standard on auditing published in July.
The standard appears to place a relatively low burden on the auditor in
detecting fraud, stressing that auditors are entitled to accept
representations as truthful and documents as genuine unless the audit
reveals evidence to the contrary.
But it stresses that auditors cannot assume that an instance of fraud or
error is an isolated occurance unless circumstances clearly indicate
otherwise.
It says auditors should have higher standards of fraud and error detection
for government entities.
The standard says auditors should qualify the accounts if necessary without
regard to the consequences and even if corrections have been made since the
balance sheet was signed.
It says if auditors can no longer have confidence in the integrity of
directors and they believe a fraud is contrary to the public interest, they
should report matters to the relevant authorities.
The draft has been circulated for public comments by 28 February 1994.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Employers' abuse of casual work laws attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABUSE OF employment law by employers was in danger of creating an
'industrialised peasantry' of casual workers, the director-general of the
Institute of Personnel Management said yesterday.
Mr Geoff Armstrong told the institute's annual conference in Harrogate that
companies which dismissed workers just before they qualified for employment
protection were abusing the law.
His fears were supported by a MORI poll of conference delegates. Most of the
senior personnel managers canvassed said their organisations had increased
part-time working, temporary work and fixed-term contracts for individuals.
More than half of the managers believed that the desire to cut overheads by
avoiding the legal terms and conditions due to full-time workers, might
influence decisions to introduce flexible working patterns.
Mr Armstrong said that while flexibility in organisations should be
encouraged there was a need to make a stand against abuse. He said: 'The
creation of a permanently casualised industrial peasantry, with little
protection and no stake in the future, can't be in the interests of
organisations or society.'
He added: 'Paying women less than men, when they are contributing equal
value for the same employer can't be justified.'
His comments underlined recent findings by the National Association of
Citizens' Advice Bureaux, which reported a big rise in the number of people
complaining to its branches about abuse of employment laws by the companies
that employed them.
He urged a reduction in the threshold at which workers received employment
protection from the current two years in most cases to six months. This
would help to dispel the 'notion that when you have worked a year and 11
months you get fired'.
Failure to introduce such reforms risked creating a permanent underclass of
disaffected employees who had 'no stake in anything', he said.
Employers should invest more in skills training, to give workers the
necessary skills to enable them to find alternative employment if they lost
their jobs.
Mr Armstrong, a former group exective director of Standard Chartered bank,
also criticised the government's funding squeeze on Acas, the conciliation
service.
'Cutting Acas back to a level of penny-pinching which impedes its ability to
operate as a respected, independent and authoritative defender of employment
rights is short-sighted and counter-productive,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace, the defence equipment and aircraft manufacturer, has won
a contract from the Ministry of Defence worth 'more than Pounds 100m' for
its seaborne Seawolf missile.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, yesterday said the
order would 'sustain some 100 jobs within the company, and many more at
sub-contractors throughout the country'.
BAe said: 'The engineering order book is full but straightforward production
contracts are quite welcome at the moment.'
The contract, for 450 of the vertically launched anti-aircraft and
anti-missile missiles, is BAe's second from the Royal Navy. They will be
built at BAe Dynamics' site at Lostock, Lancashire, and fitted to the Type
23 frigate, the core of the Navy's surface fleet.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Need for stronger RSI evidence stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONGER medical evidence will be required if future legal actions claiming
damages for alleged repetitive strain injuries are to succeed, specialist
lawyers agreed yesterday.
But the number of actions set to come to court is unlikely to fall in spite
of Thursday's ruling by a High Court judge that RSI was a meaningless
medical term.
Lawyers working on personal injury cases were yesterday considering the
implications of the judgment by Judge John Prosser in dismissing the case
brought against the Reuters news agency by Mr Rafiq Mughal, a journalist
formerly with the company.
The judge ruled that Mr Mughal's injuries, although genuine, had been caused
by personal stress rather than his computer keyboard.
Mr Simon Allen, a solicitor with Russell Jones and Walker, a law firm
specialising in industrial injury claims, said more precision would be
needed in proving a causal link between working conditions and RSI-type
injuries.
But his firm would not drop any of the 200 RSI cases - almost all involving
the use of keyboards - it is handling on behalf of white-collar unions.
He suggested that a Court of Appeal ruling on the medical standing of RSI,
which would be binding on lower courts, would assist future cases.
It is unclear whether the Mughal case will result in such a ruling - the
cash-strapped National Union of Journalists, which is bringing another 70
cases, has yet to decide whether to mount an appeal.
Mr Nigel Johnson, a solicitor with Cameron Markby Hewitt, a City law firm
specialising in defending personal injury claims for insurers, said the
judgment was good news for employers and insurers and would deter tenuous
cases being brought to court.
He said: 'Potential claimants might get the message that to succeed they
have to have very strong medical evidence to support their claim.'
Mr David Scrutton of Kennedy's, one of the leading law firms acting for
insurers in RSI cases, thought a fall in the number of cases was unlikely,
however, and warned employers against a cock-a-hoop reaction to the
judgment. 'All the judge has done is highlight the debate. He has not
altered things.'
People suffered genuine injuries, he said. What those injuries were called
might be open to question but employers would still be liable if negligence
were proved.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Customs traces Pounds 1.96bn of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE narrowly failed to meet its target of tracing Pounds 2bn
in underpayments of value added tax, its 1992-93 annual report says.
It traced Pounds 1.96bn, out of a total of Pounds 63.5bn in VAT and duties
raised during the year, up from Pounds 62.2bn in the previous 12 months.
Costs rose to Pounds 879m from Pounds 797m.
There were 1.63m traders registered for VAT during the year, down from
1.68m, with new registrations totalling 187,000. Total tax written off or
not pursued rose to Pounds 825m from Pounds 553m. Customs said the increase
reflected the effects of the recession and also cases being processed more
quickly.
There were 1,058 civil cases of VAT evasion, representing arrears of Pounds
17.2m, and 136 criminal cases which led to the imprisonment of 110 people. A
total of 5,320 appeals were made to VAT tribunals from Customs' assessments,
of which 1,806 were decided at a full hearing, with 431 found fully in
favour of the taxpayer and 43 allowed in part.
The running costs of gathering trade statistics under the new EC single
market initiative were Pounds 14.7m, against a planned Pounds 15.9m.
During the year Customs seized consignments to Iraq in contravention of UN
sanctions valued at Pounds 181,606. It brought prosecutions against a
company and its owner for the export of riot gear to Angola without export
licences. It seized more than Pounds 3m worth of strategic goods such as
military and high technology industrial equipment and atomic energy
materials.
The number of people searched at the borders of the UK fell 35 per cent to
36,646.
The 15.5m litres of unleaded petrol released for consumption was for the
first time almost equal to the amount of leaded petrol - 16.6m litres, down
from 19m litres in the previous year.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Midland aims at small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK yesterday confirmed its intensified competition for small
business clients by announcing the freezing of its small-business tariff for
the coming year.
About 100,000 small businesses will continue to pay 60p for each credit and
debit item and a monthly maintenance charge of Pounds 2.50, the level since
December 1990. Charges have also been frozen for a further 200,000 on the
standard business tariff, which is no longer available to new customers.
The move reinforces the bank's high-profile advertising campaign which
emphasises that it has Pounds 1bn to invest in viable small businesses. It
comes at the end of a week in which Lloyds said it was cutting transaction
charges to small businesses and National Westminster announced a slight
increase in its tariff.
Mr Geoff Ellerton, general manager of business development at Midland said:
'As opportunities appear for small businesses to develop and grow, they will
require additional investment and working capital.' Banks should recognise
their social obligations by not misusing their economic power, by providing
banking services to the entire community, and by acting to prevent
unsustainable environmental practice, research group Bankwatch UK says in a
report.
The report, published by the 'green' pressure group New Economics
Foundation, highlights the withdrawal of banks and building societies from
parts of Birmingham as an example of how banks have the power to 'pull the
plug on the entire community'.
The British Bankers' Association said: 'A bank thinks very carefully before
it withdraws its services from a community, but it can't run uneconomic
outlets.'
The report is intended to be the first in an annual series.

THE European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which will co-ordinate drug
licensing and safety throughout the European Community, is due to start work
in London in 1995 with a staff of 300.
Officials at the UK department of health say EMEA could indirectly create
'several thousand' jobs.
'The agency will act as a magnet for the international pharmaceutical
industry,' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Britain's health secretary, said
yesterday. It would attract European head offices of American and Japanese
drug companies and a host of consultants and lobbyists.
The UK government and drugs industry lobbied hard for the agency to come to
London.
From 1995, the EC will have a twin-track approach to drug licensing.
Companies will be able to submit a conventional medicine either to the EMEA
(the 'centralised' route) or to one of the 12 national regulatory agencies
(the 'decentralised' route).

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: United stand in fight against crime

EC LEADERS yesterday threw their weight behind common efforts to fight
organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of
France both stressed the importance of a co-ordinated effort, taking
advantage of the new framework provided by the Maastricht treaty, which
comes into force on Monday.
The other leaders agreed with their view that the new European Union should
aim to reinforce its co-operation in justice, immigration and police
matters.
In a final communique, they said member states should reassure European
citizens that the removal of border posts and controls would not weaken
security. Not only that, 'the creation of a barrier-free space should
guarantee even better security in the future, thanks to systematic and
organised co-operation between member states'.
In his opening comments to his summit colleagues, Mr Kohl placed particular
emphasis on the fight against organised international crime.
Until the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty, such matters have been
dealt with by loose co-operation between governments. But the treaty will
set up an institutional framework for closer co-ordination of policies.
The treaty should also give new impulse to Europol - a central agency
overseeing the pan-European fight against drug trafficking and terrorism.
The EC leaders agreed that Europol would be based in The Hague and that the
drugs unit of the agency should be operational by October 1994.
The Hague was selected in spite of vocal objections from the French Interior
Ministry, which claimed the comparatively relaxed Dutch attitude towards
soft drugs would make it an inappropriate site.
Justice and home affairs ministers will present proposals to the December
summit of EC leaders in Brussels for the rapid establishment of Europol;
effective measures against drugs and against money laundering; common action
on asylum, including a list of third countries whose nationals have to carry
visas in the Community; and reinforcement of judicial co-operation,
particularly on extradition.

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: European bank a boost for Frankfurt - Wrangling
ends as EC institutions are parcelled out among competing member nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the decision to put the European Monetary
Institute in Frankfurt after months of wrangling and resistance from the
British government, is a much-needed demonstration of solidarity from his EC
partners.
For the city of Frankfurt, it will provide a welcome boost to a flat
property market and to the more distant hope of becoming a greater rival to
the City of London as an international financial centre.
Mr Kohl has argued all along that he needed to persuade doubting German
voters that the future European currency would be as stable as the D-Mark -
and the one way to do so was to site the EMI in the shadow of the German
Bundesbank.
His unwavering commitment to the cause of European union, both political and
economic, has yet to produce much visible reward for Germany. He can now
present the EMI, which is supposed to become the future European central
bank, as just that.
There was celebration in Frankfurt last night that the decision, blocked
only by a British veto at the Lisbon EC summit in June 1992, has at last
been made.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank, said the decision was
'above all, a well-earned recognition of the outstanding role of the
Bundesbank in its lasting commitment to monetary stability. It is an
expression of trust and an obligation, at the same time'.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, head of Dresdner Bank, said it presented Germany with
'the great responsibility of making a further step forward for Europe.'
The Bank of England said last night: 'It's a pity, not for the City but for
the EMI.' However, the Bank added that London would retain its pre-eminent
position as a financial centre irrespective of where the EMI was sited.
The UK Treasury said: 'We thought all along London would be the best place
for the EMI on the grounds that it is the financial centre for Europe. But
the decision is not a body blow to London in terms of its standing in the
financial markets. London will be able to survive the decision.'
Mr Avinash Persaud, economist with J P Morgan, the US bank, said: 'Frankfurt
as a location for the EMI will give a much needed injection of credibility
back to the European exchange rate mechanism.
'But it is clearly a disappointment for London. In the longer term, if the
Maastricht process is put back together again, London will lose out as a
major foreign exchange centre.'
Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, the Japanese Bank,
in London said: 'I don't think it comes as any surprise given the
Bundesbank's decision to cut rates a week or two ago. It did itself no harm
by cutting them rather surprisingly when it did.'
He added that the location of the EMI in Frankfurt was seen as underpinning
the credentials of a future European Central Bank, 'but the idea of a
central bank ever emerging still remains a dream rather than a reality'.
The Association of French Banks acknowledged last night that over the long
term the choice of Frankfurt as the seat of the future European central bank
would attract some business away from Paris and other financial centres.
In the meantime the Paris market is increasing its links with Frankfurt,'
said an AFB official.
No fewer than three French cities - Lyons, Lille and Strasbourg - had touted
for the EMI but none received official backing from the French government
which knew from the start that basing the central bank in Germany was the
price to be paid for monetary union.
Where in Frankfurt the EMI might set up headquarters has yet to be decided.
One proposal has been to put it in the former headquarters of the IG Farben
chemical combine, a gigantic, marble-clad building dating from the late
1920s, currently used as headquarters of the US Army in Germany. The
disadvantage is the historical connotation of a company closely identified
with the Nazi regime, and responsible for the deaths of thousands of slave
labourers during the Second World War.

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: Leaders agree to act together abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC LEADERS yesterday agreed to send monitors to cover the parliamentary
elections in Russia in December, according to a draft communique at the
Brussels summit.
The move was heralded as a first, modest step towards fulfilling the
Maastricht treaty's provisions for a common European foreign and security
policy.
EC leaders also identified four areas for similar 'joint actions,' including
central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and the former
Yugoslavia.
Joint actions is the Brussels code-word for something less than sending
combat troops to trouble zones around the world, but something more than the
reactive diplomacy characterised by the EC's so-called 'political
co-operation.'
The EC has plenty of experience in supporting and monitoring democratic
elections. Notable examples include recent polls in Nicaragua and Albania, a
European Commission official said.
The UK, which jealously guards its sovereignty in matters of foreign policy,
pushed hard for sending monitors to Russia. 'This is something the EC can
offer. It's urgent, time-limited, and it's cheap,' said one British
official.
Other diplomats noted that President Boris Yeltsin's government had
expressed support for the move, despite some western criticism about his ban
on opposition newspapers and media.
The UK has made Pounds 500,000 available for supporting democracy in Russia.
This includes funds which officials said could be spent not just on election
leaflets, but also news-sheets for alternative points of view to the Yeltsin
government.
On the former Yugoslavia, EC leaders were cautious, calling for measures to
restore a viable economy 'if the peace process takes on concrete form,'
according to the draft.
Separately, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe,
French foreign minister, were said to be close to agreeing new measures to
ensure safe passage of UN aid convoys to Sarajevo this winter.
British officials said the UK was anxious to avoid an open-ended commitment
to keep open supply routes, because of the risk to British, French and UN
ground forces. 'We don't want to be punching our way through,' said one
aide, 'we are thinking more in terms of engineering works and rebuilding
bridges.'
On central and eastern Europe, the twelve expressed support for the Balladur
plan for a stability pact in the region 'to settle the problem of ethnic
minorities and strengthen the inviolability of borders.'
One objection to the Balladur plan is that it could be interpreted as an
invitation to minorities to bring latent, or existing frontier disputes to
the Community for resolution.
On the Middle East, EC leaders resolved to support the peace process by
political, economic and financial means. This could include police training
in the occupied territories, as well as engineering works such as drainage
and telecommunications.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is to
visit Brussels early next month to discuss these measures, as well as the
EC's five-year Ecu500m (Pounds 388m) aid plan for Jericho and the Gaza
strip.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has unveiled a mildly expansionary 1994 budget with substantial
increases in development spending and a cut in corporate tax aimed at
promoting more investment in the country.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, said GDP growth would be more than 8 per
cent this year.
'With this growth, the Malaysian economy would have experienced growth rates
of 8 to 9 per cent for six successive years, an attainment which has never
been achieved before,' said Mr Anwar.
But fast growth had put serious strains on infrastructure. Mr Anwar said
that to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks, developmental expenditure would
be increased by 35 per cent to MDollars 13.35bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
In spite of this increase in spending a rise in government revenues meant
there would be only a marginal budget deficit, said Mr Anwar. The growth of
both domestic and foreign investment in Malaysia has slowed over the past 18
months.
Mr Anwar announced a 2 percentage point cut in corporate tax to 32 per cent
in 1994, with a further reduction to 30 per cent in 1995.
While there were no reductions in income tax, Mr Anwar announced measures to
help lower income groups, including a multi-million dollar plan to build-low
cost urban housing.

OFFICIALS of the South African government and the African National Congress
said yesterday they expected to reach agreement within days on a
post-apartheid constitution, but the government appeared to have made little
progress in persuading the right-wing Freedom Alliance to accept that
constitution.
Working under a self-imposed deadline of 5 November to complete a new
constitution, negotiators from the African National Congress and National
Party met yesterday to try to resolve remaining obstacles. They said they
would meet again on Tuesday and possibly Wednesday to finalise joint
constitutional proposals. Government negotiators including President FW de
Klerk later met a delegation from the Freedom Alliance, led by Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, but appeared to have made
little progress.
Joint proposals from the ANC and the government on how power should be
shared within a multi-racial government of national unity are not yet
complete, but they appear to give the National Party a much weaker position
than originally envisaged.
The National Party would have no constitutionally-entrenched power to block
the decisions of the majority in a post-apartheid government. In an earlier
constitutional draft, the National Party had been guaranteed what amounts to
a veto in the areas of budget, finance and security.
The party now appears to be moving closer to a form of voluntary rather than
enforced power sharing, with Mr de Klerk appearing to rely on assurances
from Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, that fundamental decisions will not be
taken without his approval.
According to proposals made on Thursday, the cabinet would be composed of
all parties winning more than 5 per cent of the vote, with each party
holding cabinet seats in proportion to their voting share. The president
would come from the majority party, likely to be the ANC, and there would be
two deputy presidents: one from the ANC and one from the next largest party,
likely to be the National Party.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Meat import ruling throws Rabin coalition into disarray:
Secular and religious parties are at loggerheads over non-kosher meat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN no country other than Israel could the importation of pork chops and
bacon provoke such a storm of controversy, threaten the government's fragile
coalition, put at risk an historic peace process and challenge the
government's economic reform programme.
For the past week Israeli politicians have been obsessed by the matter,
which goes to the heart of Israel's confusion about whether it is a secular
or a religious state and which has exposed the continuing power of the small
ultra-orthodox religious parties to determine the political agenda.
Throughout it all Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has appeared
philosophical. 'Cabinet crises in the past have occurred because of real
issues, but more often due to religious issues. What a strange people we
are. What strange political institutions we have,' he said this week.
A week ago Israel's high court ruled that the government must allow private
importers to bring in meat even if it was non-kosher. Ruling in favour of
Meatreal Ltd, a private meat processing and marketing company, the High
Court said private importation of meat was legal under the government's
privatisation policy and under the Basic Law of Israel which grants freedom
of choice. (Before the High Court's ruling all meat was imported by the
government, which only brought in non-kosher meat. Despite its privatisation
policy the government had suspended private meat imports.)
'Israel is not a theocracy,' said one of the High Court judges in his
ruling.
The decision immediately sparked a storm of protest among Israel's religious
parties and Jewish fundamentalists who claimed the policy would make kosher
meat more expensive and drive Jews to eat non-Kosher meat.
More importantly the ultra-orthodox Shas party, which has six members of
parliament, said they would not continue supporting the government unless
the decision was reversed. Shas quit the coalition recently after its two
senior politicians were charged with fraud, breach of public trust and
misallocation of public resources. Without Shas, Mr Rabin's coalition
commands only 56 seats in the 120 member Knesset and must rely on support
from two Arab parties with five seats. Mr Rabin has been stressing the
importance of getting Shas back into the coalition to support the peace
process.
After the High Court's ruling Shas threatened to join the opposition and
vote against the State Budget, which was essentially a vote of confidence in
the government. If the opposition had gained a majority the government could
have fallen.
Mr Rabin responded immediately to defuse the crisis promising Shas he would
introduce new legislation to ban the importation of non-kosher meat.
But Mr Rabin immediately ran into problems with his main coalition partner,
the left-wing Meretz bloc which has 12 members of the Knesset and which
represents secular interest groups. Several Meretz parliamentarians charged
that Mr Rabin had violated the coalition agreement which requires prior
agreement of all coalition partners for laws on basic religious matters.
Some Meretz MPs warned that they would consider quitting the coalition. On
Thursday Mr Eli Dayan, a Labour MK and chief whip of the coalition, said the
threat could end the peace process.
Also furious about Mr Rabin's decision were private meat companies which had
already made orders for several tonnes of non-kosher meat. Mr Eyal Erlich,
owner and managing director of Meatreal, said: 'I hope Rabin will not take
part in making Israel a country like Iran. Freedom of choice and freedom of
occupation are a democratic country's ABCs.'
Mr Rabin is left sandwiched between the religious extremists and the
secularists. He told Meretz that it must be prepared for sacrifice in order
to bring Shas back into the coalition and secure the peace accord.

FT  30 OCT 93 / US personal income, spending edge up

US personal income and spending rose modestly in September, but by
sufficient amounts to suggest that the current consumer-led economic
recovery is in no immediate jeopardy.
Additionally, the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose to 57 per cent
this month, compared with 54.4 per cent in September, pointing to further
steady growth in manufacturing.
The 0.2 per cent rise in personal income and the 0.3 per cent advance in
personal spending were much in line with market expectations.
Personal income had risen sharply by 1.3 per cent in August, but that in
good measure represented the recovery from the midwestern floods of the
previous month. Both figures are reasonably good auguries for the coming
Christmas shopping period.
On Thursday the government reported an encouraging 2.8 per cent real annual
advance in gross domestic product in the third quarter, a figure that would
have been 0.6 per cent higher but for the dislocation of the floods.
Economists are now predicting growth in the 4 per cent range for the final
quarter.

<TEXT>
MR SERGEI SHAKHRAI, a deputy prime minister and one of Russia's leading
political figures, has sought to steal a march on other candidates in the
forthcoming parliamentary elections - by declaring his poverty on the front
page of the country's leading daily.
It is a move calculated to win support from a population deeply cynical
about their politicians' ability to enrich themselves through office.
It comes as the Central Electoral Commission has declared 25 parties or
groupings registered for the election so far - with many of the established
and aspirant names in Russia's political scene evident among their leading
candidates for the 450-seat State Duma, or lower house of the proposed new
parliament.
The key groups are Russia's Choice, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime
minister; the Yavlinsky-Lukin-Boldyrev bloc, led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky,
the prominent economist; the grouping Civic Union in the name of Stability,
Equity and Progress, headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, the industrialists' leader;
the August party headed by Mr Konstantin Borovoi, the entrepreneur; the
Russian All-Peoples' Union, led by Mr Sergei Baburin, the nationalist
leader; the Movement for Democratic Reform, headed by Mr Gavril Popov, the
former mayor of Moscow; and Mr Shakhrai's own Party of Russian Unity and
Agreement - which, however, is not yet registered.
Mr Shakhrai's initiative appears to be an attempt to distinguish himself
from candidates compromised by as yet unproven charges of corruption.
In a declaration which Izvestiya published as its lead story yesterday Mr
Shakhrai revealed that he earns Rbs332,000 (about Pounds 187) a month as
deputy premier; that he has two young children and a non-working wife who
live in a three-room flat (but expect to move to a five-room flat); that he
shares a Volga saloon with relatives and that 'each member of the family has
a bicycle;' that he has Rbs14,000 (Pounds 7.86) in the savings bank.
Mr Shakrai admits that he has the use of a four-room state dacha, but adds
that it lacks 'a sauna, swimming pool, cook and servants,' just in case
anyone thought he was enjoying himself.

<TEXT>
FRENCH unemployment hit a record in September, rising to 11.8 per cent of
the workforce from 11.7 per cent in August, according to figures announced
yesterday by the labour ministry. The number of unemployed rose by 26,400 to
3.24m.
The rise in unemployment, which is forecast to breach 12 per cent by the end
of the year, is the biggest problem facing the government of Mr Edouard
Balladur. It has prompted demands for a more expansionary economic policy
and has weakened the government's ability to implement restructuring of
public sector industry.
The weak state of the French economy was confirmed by trade figures released
yesterday which showed a surplus of FFr10.44bn (Pounds 1.19bn) in July,
reflecting the low level of demand for imports. But the statistics also
brought encouragement for Mr Balladur's government, demonstrating that
French industry remains competitive in international markets.
The seasonally adjusted trade figures included a surplus of FFr1.6bn with
Germany and were within a shadow of the record FFr10.6bn surplus recorded
last May.
The unemployment and trade statistics come amid a series of indicators which
suggest that the economy is stabilising and heading towards recovery from
the recession which it has suffered since the end of 1992.
'The number of favourable signs are increasing,' said Mr Alphandery, the
economy minister, referring to a 0.7 per cent rise in consumption in
September and a 1.3 per cent rise in industrial production in July and
August compared with June. But Mr Alphandery remained cautious about the
prospect for the economy. 'The situation is moving in the right direction
but we have not yet had lift-off,' he said.
Such caution was justified by the composition of the trade figures. The
total value of imports in July was FFr86.3bn, a fall of about 15 per cent on
the same period in 1992. Imports of capital goods had been particularly
weak.
Exports, however, continued their upward trend of the past few months,
rising from FFr94.9bn in June to FFr96.8bn in July. 'The trade figures show
that the external sector is doing much better than the rest of the economy
and that French industry is competitive,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier,
economist at Salomon Bros. Mr Mercier forecast a surplus in excess of
FFr45bn for the full year.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Malaysia to cut company taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA has unveiled a mildly expansionary 1994 budget with substantial
increases in development spending and a cut in corporate tax aimed at
promoting more investment in the country.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, said GDP growth would be more than 8 per
cent this year.
'With this growth, the Malaysian economy would have experienced growth rates
of 8 to 9 per cent for six successive years, an attainment which has never
been achieved before,' said Mr Anwar.
But fast growth had put serious strains on infrastructure. Mr Anwar said
that to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks, developmental expenditure would
be increased by 35 per cent to MDollars 13.35bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
'The present infrastructural constraints, especially in power and transport,
have occurred too often and are now being addressed as a matter of urgency,'
said Mr Anwar.
In spite of this increase in spending a rise in government revenues meant
there would be only a marginal budget deficit, said Mr Anwar.
The growth of both domestic and foreign investment in Malaysia has slowed
over the past 18 months.
Mr Anwar announced a 2 percentage point cut in corporate tax to 32 per cent
in 1994, with a further reduction to 30 per cent in 1995. 'Our company
income tax will be more comparable to those of neighbouring countries and
this will improve the investment climate of our country,' said Mr Anwar.
While there were no reductions in income tax, Mr Anwar announced measures to
help lower income groups, including a multi-million dollar plan to build low
cost urban housing.
Others measures include a financial package to encourage the development of
more skills, further moves towards the introduction of a sales and service
tax and the reduction or abolition of import duties on many items.
The worst news in the budget was for Malaysia's growing numbers of big motor
cycle riders.
Import duty on superbikes of engine capacity of 500cc and above will be
doubled from 60 to 120 per cent.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Japanese steel group to shed 7,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is to shed 7,000 jobs, a fresh
blow to Japan's employment market, which hit its weakest level for six years
last month.
The job cuts, spread over the next three years, are the heaviest so far
among Japan's top industrial companies, as they seek to cut costs amid the
worst recession for 20 years.
Nippon Steel said yesterday it aims to cut white-collar staff by 4,000 on
top of the already planned loss of 3,000 workers' jobs, totalling 19 per
cent of parent group employees.
Numbers will be cut through reduced hiring, non-replacement and job
transfers to affiliates. There will be no redundancies. Annual production
costs will be cut by Y300bn (Pounds 1.88bn) during the three years, the
group said. Nippon is expecting to lose at least Y15bn before tax this year.
Nippon Steel blamed the rising yen and a permanent reduction in domestic
demand for steel caused by a shift of production overseas by its car and
consumer electronics industry customers.
Similar factors were behind recent job cuts announced by two other Japanese
steelmakers, NKK, which is to reduce its workforce by 3,200, and Sumitomo
Metal Industries, which is to shed 3,000 jobs.
A fall in new employment in manufacturing industry was a big factor in the
reduction in the number of job offers in September, which fell from 70 per
100 job seekers in August to 69, the lowest since 1987, according to the
management and co-ordination agency.
This pushed the unemployment rate up to 2.6 per cent, 0.1 of a percentage
point more than in August. Although low by European standards, the number
out of work is climbing fast, by 17 per cent from September 1992 to last
month, to reach a total of 1.72m.
This is grim news for the Japanese government, which yesterday set up an
emergency team, under the most senior civil servant in the labour ministry,
to come up with plans by mid-November to support employment.
The worsening jobs market, in a country long accustomed to almost full
employment, provides an unwelcome distraction at a time when the seven-party
coalition is struggling to pass laws to reform Japan's corruption-prone
political system by the end of the year.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has implied he will resign if he
misses the deadline.

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY council of Malaga, the principal town on Spain's Costa del Sol, is
believed to be seeking government assistance to avoid defaulting on its
debts.
Malaga authorities were yesterday reported to be negotiating a refinancing
package with the central government to avert defaulting on principal of
Pta3.5bn (Pounds 17.5m), which is underwritten by Spain's leading corporate
lender, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.
The city's problems highlight dangerously high borrowing levels of other
city councils in Spain, but do not appear to have had any effect on Spain's
public debt market, where Spanish long-term bonds yesterday outperformed
Italy's.
Seven major city councils, including Madrid and Barcelona but not Malaga,
held a meeting earlier this week to lobby the central government for tax
rebates to help meet their deficits. Barcelona, which staged the 1992
Olympic games, has the largest debt with a total of Pta241bn. Spain's city
councils owe a total of Pta2,200bn.
Deficits have risen steeply in all levels of government, but they have risen
most of all among local councils, many of which have borrowed heavily on the
capital markets.
'This is a big problem for the councils and it is not going to be easy for
them to place paper from now on - but it is not a problem for Spain's main
bond and equity market,' said Mr Robert Maxwell, a senior partner at Madrid
securities house Maxwell and Espinosa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT of Italy and GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services
group, are discussing forming a joint company to supply Fiat with constant
velocity joints - the key element of front-wheel drive systems - from a new
manufacturing facility to be built near Florence.
If final agreement is reached, Fiat would close its Novoli plant in Florence
making the joints and concentrate production at the new facility at Campi
Bisenzio, 15 kilometres away.
The Novoli plant currently employs around 800 people.
GKN said yesterday the move would require 'substantial investment,' but
would not give details.
It is in line with Fiat's declared strategy of concentrating on designing,
developing and assembling vehicles while buying in key components from
partners with which it can form long-term relationships.
An agreement would be of considerable importance to GKN.
The components are a basic requirement for all front-wheel drive vehicles
and Fiat is Europe's second-largest carmaker, with output approaching two
million vehicles a year.
GKN has been supplying constant velocity joints to Fiat from its Brunico
plant, in northern Italy, for about 15 years.
The agreement could be in place early next year with production likely to
start in 1995.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Go-ahead for Jubilee Line extension into Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government gave the go-ahead yesterday for the Pounds 1.9bn London
Underground Jubilee Line extension following a High Court ruling which
released Canary Wharf, the Docklands property development, from UK
insolvency legislation.
The announcement was accompanied by the award of orders worth more than
Pounds 300m to GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, to supply
rolling stock and power systems for the line. This is the first of the
equipment orders to be announced.
A second order for Pounds 150m of construction work for BICC and AMEC was
also signed yesterday. Further orders will be signed over the next week
taking the total 'awarded and confirmed' to Pounds 900m, said Sir Wilfrid
Newton, London Transport chairman.
The decision to build the Jubilee Line ends four years of negotiations. The
government had insisted that the private sector contribute Pounds 400m to
the link. But for the past 18 months Canary Wharf has been in administration
and the development project's bankers said they would provide the funds only
when Canary Wharf was restablished as a going concern.
The extension will be one of the biggest construction projects to be carried
out in Britain and is expected to create 22,000 building and equipment
manufacturing jobs during the 4 1/2 years of construction. Ninety per cent
will be in the UK.
It is the first large-scale addition to London's Underground network in a
generation. The national Council of Building Material Producers said the
Pounds 600m of construction contracts already announced would increase
infrastructure spending by 4 per cent for 3 1/2 years.
The extension will run for 10 miles from Green Park in the west to Stratford
in London's East End and involve the construction of 11 stations. The
journey along the route, which passes under the River Thames four times,
will take 22 minutes.
The line will make a large area of south and east London accessible by
Underground and increase the ease with which travellers can reach the Canary
Wharf development.
Some 7,000 people work at Canary Wharf and this number is expected to rise
to 10,000 by the middle of next year.
Tunnelling is expected to start in the next four to five months. 'It is a
large and complex project, but we will build it well, on time and on
budget,' said Sir Wilfrid.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Ulster peace process role possible for Sinn Fein: London and
Dublin would 'respond imaginatively' if IRA ends violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments last night signalled that Sinn Fein could
be brought into the Northern Ireland peace process in return for a permanent
end to IRA terrorism.
Their statement came as Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds responded to
the escalating violence in the province by announcing a new drive towards a
political settlement.
A joint communique issued by the two leaders after talks in Brussels said
there could be no question of contacts with terrorists, but that 'new doors'
would open if the IRA and its supporters renounced violence for good.
In his most explicit recognition yet of a potential role for Sinn Fein, Mr
Major agreed that the political wing of the IRA could eventually be brought
into the peace process. The two governments said they would 'respond
imaginatively' to a permanent cessation of violence.
However, the British and Irish prime ministers rejected as a basis for peace
the conclusions of recent talks between Mr John Hume of the SDLP and Mr
Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. There could be 'no question' of the two
governments adopting or endorsing Mr Hume's report of the dialogue. Details
of those talks were reported yesterday for the first time to Mr Major by Mr
Reynolds.
At the end of a week of the worst sectarian violence for two decades, the
two leaders condemned the tit-for-tat killings by terrorists from the
Catholic and Protestant communities. Their communique attacked the
'murderous and premeditated acts which could serve no end other than to
deepen the bloodshed in Northern Ireland'.
Mr Major and Mr Reynolds reaffirmed their determination to restart the
stalled negotiating process designed to bring a permanent political
settlement to the province.
Their cautiously upbeat tone followed the Dublin government's
acknowledgement earlier this week of the right of the Unionist community to
exercise a permanent veto on changes in Ulster's constitutional status.
Both sides confirmed that the essence of any agreement would be a move by
the Republic to replace its constitutional claim to the province with the
aspiration of a united Ireland. Britain in return would offer a significant
extension of cross-border administration.
But the communique glossed over significant differences on the extent to
which elements of the Hume-Adams peace initiative could be incorporated into
their own negotiations.
Mr Reynolds told Mr Major that they could not ignore the potential for a
cessation of violence by the IRA in return for a place at the negotiating
table for Sinn Fein. But, speaking after their talks, Mr Major said there
could be 'no talks or negotiations between democratic governments and those
who use, threaten or support violence'.

FT  30 OCT 93 / EC revives spirit of unity: Site chosen for central bank as
summit settles wrangle over institutions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EC LEADERS yesterday restored a semblance of unity to the European Community
with a decision to base the future European Central Bank in Frankurt as part
of a wide-ranging agreement on the location of EC institutions.
But the deal struck at a special European summit in Brussels followed an
acriminious battle over the division of Euro-spoils which included veto
threats by the UK and Spain.
The summit chaired by the Belgian presidency of the EC was called to revive
Europe's faltering progress toward greater political and monetary
integration after the near failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The choice of Frankfurt as the location for the European Monetary Institute
 -the forerunner of the European Central Bank - was seen as a minimum step
towards rebuilding credibility in European Monetary Union after the August 2
currency crisis which led to the suspension of the ERM.
Germany, which stands to surrender the D-Mark under the Maastricht treaty at
the end of the century, fought tenaciously for the EMI. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's argument that the choice of Frankfurt was necessary to reassure
Germans about the loss of their symbol of post-war stability carried the day
over reservations from France and the UK.
The Bank of England said last night the decision was 'a pity, not for the
City but for the EMI.'
The EMI, whose president will be Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium, is the
institutional anchor for the second stage of EMU due to begin on January 1,
1994 under the Maastricht treaty.
With the treaty set to enter force on Monday, EC leaders used the one-day
summit to pledge closer co-operation in foreign policy and the fight against
organised crime, as well as a broad endorsement of the goal of a European
monetary union by the end of the decade.
EC leaders steered clear of any new initiatives to tackle mass unemployment
in Europe, preferring to wait for the European Commission's White Paper on
competitiveness, employment and growth which will presented at the next
summit in December.
They also avoided a damaging row over the Uruguay Round world trade talks in
which France is holding out for more concessions on farm trade.
Despite relief that the log-jam over the location of more than 10 new
institutions had been broken, there was also an air of contrition among EC
leaders and a general admission that mistakes had been made before and after
the agreement on the Maastricht.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European commission, said: 'In future,
all the EC's insititutions must be careful to be more transparent. This is a
pre-condition for the progress of Europe.'
During protracted lunchtime haggling yesterday, both the UK and Spain
threatened to veto the sites package unless they got the European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
After several hours, the prize went to the UK which immediately praised the
deal as creating several hundred jobs and confirming Britain as a world
leader in the pharmaceutical industry. Spain was given two sites as the
consolation prize - the EC trade-mark office and a new institution
responsible for monitoring health and safety.

The company cautioned that it also expected to post a loss for the fourth

The third-quarter figures take DSM's results for the first nine months of

The BFr34.9bn acquisition is being made by AG and by Amev, the Dutch

AG had said that it may make a share issue as part of the financing package.
Amev will also contribute BFr7.5bn to the acquisition, with the remainder of
the financing to be met by companies within the Fortis group. Some of these
funds were generated by recent divestments of stakes held in Generale Bank

<TEXT>
THE FINNISH government is set to take a 14.8 per cent stake in
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), the country's leading commercial bank, after
receiving shares worth FM1bn from the bank. This is part-payment for its
purchase of a share in the business of the Savings Bank of Finland (SBF),
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
KOP plans to issue 77m new shares worth FM13 each to the government
guarantee fund, which is selling SBF to four Finnish banks.
The bank will pay a further FM400m (Dollars 69.6m) in cash to the government
for its share of SBF's assets. It is poised to take over 135 SBF branches
and FM12bn of deposits.
The issue will raise KOP's share capital from FM4.42bn to FM5.19bn. The
government has undertaken not to sell its shares before March 23 1994.

FT  29 OCT 93 / 450MW dam to begin operating in 1997
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A controversial 450MW dam in southern Chile, potentially the first phase of
a Dollars 3bn hydroelectric project, is likely to begin operating in 1997
following signing by the International Finance Corporation of a Dollars 120m
loan deal. The Pangue dam, already under construction, is likely to cost
Dollars 450m.
Agreement from the IFC, which also plans to take an equity stake of up to
Dollars 4.7m, removes an important obstacle from a project plagued by
environmentalist opposition and courtroom wrangles.
Opponents say Pangue, the first of a possible six dams, will endanger the
ecosystem of the Bo-Bo river and threaten the Pehuenche Indian culture.
Endesa, the dam's main shareholder, says environmental impact will be
minimal; only 400 hectares of land will be flooded and a handful of people
relocated.
Although the IFC agreement has been signed, disbursement of funds depends on
'completion and public release of a satisfactory downstream impact study',
according to Mr Kent Lupberger, IFC manager for the region.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA and Paraguay are to privatise the huge Yacyreta hydro-electric dam
being built on the Parana River that marks the frontier between the two
countries.
Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay and Carlos Menem of Argentina
said this week they would decide next month how the Dollars 8.3bn project is
to be sold off. Morgan Grenfell, the London investment bank, is to deliver a
report in November analysing the various possibilities.
Yacyreta, being built by Impregilio of Italy and Dumez of France, is the
second big hydro-electric dam to be built on the Parana, and two more are
planned.
The Dollars 15bn Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu dam, the largest in the world,
lies 300km upriver from Yacyreta.
Construction of the dam, in which Argentina and Paraguay have equal shares,
began in 1983 and has already consumed Dollars 6.5bn.
The project has been repeatedly delayed by Argentina's political and
economic crises. Mr Menem once called Yacyreta a 'monument to corruption'.
Yacyreta is scheduled to comes on stream in September next year. Once all 20
turbines are installed, it will generate about 40 per cent of Argentina's
electricity.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Making good on pledge by Bolsheviks: Yeltsin hopes to make
'peasants the masters'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE daily Izvestiya yesterday heralded its announcement of President Boris
Yeltsin's decree giving Russian citizens the right to buy, sell, rent and
bequeath land by reprinting its own front page of exactly 76 years ago. That
contained the decree 'On Land' by the new Bolshevik government which
proclaimed that land would be returned to the peasants.
The decree, said Izvestiya, claimed to 'make the peasants the masters', but
remained a piece of propaganda, while the reality soon became one of state
ownership and dispossession of peasant proprietors in favour of
collectivisation.
The present decree eschews grand sounding phrases in favour of a definition
of rights and a description of the mechanisms under which citizens can buy
and sell land in order to create a class of farmer-proprietors with fully
guaranteed rights, for the first time in Russian history. The state will
guarantee and protect the right to buy, sell, rent, transfer and divide land
freely, reserving only the right to claim land for strategic state use after
paying the market price for it.
Foreigners and foreign companies can participate in the process of buying
and selling land, but apparently only (the decree is vague on the point) in
association with Russian companies. Land can be used for agricultural
purposes, or for development of any kind.
In a move analagous to the rights given to workers in state enterprises,
workers on state and collective farms will have the right to buy plots of
land at discounted prices. Land can be sold off in auctions or offered for
sale privately to competitive bids.
A new state body, with offices in all regions, the Russian Federation
Committee for Land Resources and Land Construction, will be the body charged
with ensuring that land sales go through. It will have offices in all
regions, and is clearly designed to override the inevitable objections and
barriers raised to land sales by local authorities and the leadership of
state and collective farms to a measure they have bitterly resisted for
years.
Resistance to the move to make land a commodity is not confined to former
communist leaders and bureaucrats in the regions, but is often strongly
expressed by the state and collective farm workers themselves - who see the
growth of a private farming sector as a threat to a life which, though poor,
is secure and undemanding. At the same time, those who have already embarked
on private farming have faced delays, hostility and sometimes intimidation -
as well as a lack of capital and equipment designed to the needs of small
farmers.
Russian land has only briefly been freely tradeable, in the decade before
the first world war following agrarian reform pushed through by Mr Pyotr
Stolypin, the prime minister. It succeeded in creating a class of
peasant-proprietors - who were dispossessed two decades later by ruthless
collectivisation which left only small plots in the hands of the peasants
throughout the Soviet Union.
Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agricultural MInister and as such the highest
representative of the agricultural lobby, has already sought to limit the
damage he sees the decree as doing - by saying that no foreigners can buy
land, that speculation in land should be avoided and that no small farmer
should be allowed to hire labour.
However, the decree gives a solid guarantee of the state's intention to
tackle what has been the largest inhibition to the dismantling of the
socialist system: it will, however, require a vigorous response from
would-be farmers if it is to herald the revolution in the countryside it
clearly hopes for.

<TEXT>
UZBEKISTAN has shipped Dollars 400m worth of gold to French, Swiss and US
banks to 'serve as guarantees for those who want to invest in our country',
Mr Islam Karimov, the republic's president, told French businessmen
yesterday.
The president of Uzbekistan, which is an important gold producer, raised
eyebrows when he told French businessmen that any doubters about the worth
of this guarantee could check his country's bullion in the vaults of Credit
Commercial de France (CCF) in Paris.
He gave the initial impression that he had brought the gold in his personal
baggage on his state visit to Paris. But CCF later said that the gold, which
it described as an amount of 'some consequence', had been sent to Paris a
short time ago in the usual manner of such shipments.
Other French banks appeared mildly piqued at learning that the CCF now has
the collateral of gold to cover credit for Uzbekistan which they do not. But
Mr Charles de Croisset, CCF's president, said that by depositing the gold in
CCF the Uzbek president clearly had no intention of conferring on CCF 'any
monopoly'. The deposit, Mr de Croisset said, was rather 'a symbol to show
that Uzbekistan is a serious economic partner for the world'.
Mr Karimov complained about the 'diktats' of the Russian central bank in
running the rouble zone of which Uzbekistan is still part. If this
continued, he said, Uzbekistan might set up its own gold-backed national
currency, on whose feasibility it had already consulted the Deutsche Bank.

A SICK Moslem infant died yesterday, after local Serb commanders blocked his
evacuation from Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, for medical
treatment in the west.
The one-year-old baby, Mohamet Rasenica, was tucked into a French army
convoy bound for Sarajevo, after Serb chieftains in Pale, their mountain
stronghold, gave permission for him to be evacuated with four other
critically ill patients.
UN relief officials yesterday were outraged by Mohamet's death, which
follows a similar case earlier this month when a two-year-old Moslem girl
died in Zepa, a nearby Moslem enclave also designated a UN safe area. In
both instances, Serb leaders gave permission for the medical evacuation of
besieged Moslems, only to block it hours later.
Doctors said the patients could be easily treated in normally-equipped
hospitals instead of in the Moslem enclaves. 'This child would not have died
if he had been able to get proper medical treatment,' said one.
Serb leaders routinely block the passage of medical supplies, food and
building materials desperately needed for the UN 'safe areas', cut off from
the outside world except when Serb authorities allow access.

Parliamentary elections ordered by President Boris Yeltsin will not be fair,

leader said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
'These elections are a far cry not only from democracy, but even from simple
logic,' said Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent economist and leader of a
large electoral bloc opposing Mr Yeltsin. 'But realising this we still feel
we have no way other than to take part in elections even under their dubious
rules,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin has ordered elections to the State Duma, the lower chamber of a
new-style legislature called the Federal Assembly, for December 12, with
presidential elections to follow six months later.

FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity was strong in British Petroleum, with the interest, according to
several analysts, coming from UK insti-tutions eager to increase weightings
in the shares. This, combined with a stock shortage, lifted the shares 9 1/2
to 345 1/2 p on heavy volume of 12m.
US interest in the stock has been strong recently and many UK institutions
are underweighted in comparison with one estimate putting American holdings
of the shares at 27 per cent.
The shares were also boosted by an upbeat note from NatWest Securities,
which said that BP's recovery has further to run in spite of the weak oil
price. The broker upgraded its earnings forecast from Pounds 220m to Pounds
250m for third-quarter figures due next week.
Some of the activity in BP was at the expense of Shell Transport, which
receded 7 to 702p. Figures for Shell Oil US are due today.
The telecommunications interests of Pittencrieff took the stock to a record
high of 400p for a gain of 26.
The rumour mill continued to surround Lasmo yesterday, with the latest
stories suggesting that Mr John Walmsley, former finance chief of Enterprise
Oil, was in talks with a US consortium over a potential bid for Lasmo.
Attention continues to focus on Mr Walmsley after the resignation this week
of Lasmo's finance director. The shares closed unchanged at 142p after a
brief period at 143p.
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, which has had a run of large turnover,
enjoyed healthy activity again yesterday at 2.5m. The speculation of a
merger with Clyde Petroleum returned to the market, but Premier stayed at 26
1/2 p.
The expectation of good results from the merchant banks, which start
reporting next month, boosted the sector. SG Warburg advanced 23 to 913p,
while Mercury Asset Management rose 9 to 708p. Kleinwort Benson moved ahead
19 to 525p and Hambros gained 17 at 402p.
Among high street banks, TSB firmed 4 1/2 to 224 1/2 p on a view that the
recent strength of merchant bank stocks might help it secure a higher price
for Hill Samuel, its merchant banking subsidiary that the group is known to
want to sell.
National Westminster gave up 8 to 555p after Kleinwort Benson advised
investors to switch into Barclays. The latter improved 8 to 564p.
BZW launched a warrant on Kingfisher, the move helping the shares put on 9
to 659p. The warrant, which allows investors to buy the shares at the price
on the day of the warrant's purchase over a set period, cost 78.1p at
yesterday's prices.
The strike price of the underlying stock is 680p and the exercise period is
18 months. BZW is issuing 50m warrants on a one-for-one exercise basis with
the shares. The move coincided with the broker's research team reiterating
its positive stance on the stock.
Guinness, which was the subject of a NatWest warrant last week, continued to
improve. US house Lehman Brothers was said to be positive as the shares
moved 10 higher to 433p.
Ahead of meeting with analysts today, Rank Organisation shot forward 24 to
832p. Dealers said the stock had benefited from Xerox Corporation figures in
the US.
Third-quarter results from ICI found a positive response in the market and
the shares appreciated 13 to 718p in turnover of 4.3m.
However, some analysts still caution that the stock seems overvalued and
that the US support it has enjoyed cannot necessarily be relied on.
Shares in troubled defence electronics group Ferranti International fell 2
1/4 to 1 3/4 p after the company said it was recommending a penny a share
offer by GEC, as widely predicted by market watchers. Strong two-way
business once again brought high turnover of 56.7m, although that figure was
lower than Wednesday's total of 82m. Buyers of GEC were seen soon after the
announcement and the shares moved 7 ahead to 350p, as dealers talked of the
long term asset attractions of the deal.
A return to profits and an increase in the dividend provided the spur for
Manganese Bronze and the stock climbed 17 to 114p.
Another busy session for Cable and Wireless saw the shares advance 14 to
986p, an all-time high, ahead of today's scrip issue and results next week.

FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome plunges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears over underlying sales growth in Wellcome sent shock waves through the
market and cut the share price by just over 11 per cent - equivalent to
nearly five Footsie points.
The results were largely in line with expectations, but some analysts feared
that sales growth could be less than 10 per cent in the current year and
many forecasts have been trimmed. The dividend was increased, but the level
of that rise also disappointed many investors.
One industry watcher feared more downside and warned that the stock had
received a bounce from currency factors but its future would depend on its
product portfolio.
Some analysts suggested that 700p would become a realistic price for the
shares and yesterday the price plunged very close to that figure, losing 91
to close at 712p. At one point the stock had fallen 100p to touch 703p.
Turnover was a hefty 18m, the highest level since July 1992.
However, there were some optimistic voices for Wellcome who considered that
part of the steep slide could be attributed to the volatile state of the
sector. Reflecting the confused feeling, the range of profits forecasts for
next year was said to stretch between Pounds 690m and Pounds 760m,
indicating that there is still some bullish sentiment surrounding the
shares.
Wellcome's ill wind blew a little good Glaxo's way and its shares gained 10
at 692p in turnover of 4.6m. The stock also benefited from a strong
performance on Wall Street. Zeneca also improved, adding 5 at 780p. In spite
of announcing consolidation of its R&amp;D operations, SmithKline Beecham 'A'
lost 2 to 420p.

FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Price war fears hit Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD retail stocks dropped dramatically as talk of a renewed price war was
heard amid frantic trading, which by the close accounted for nearly 10 per
cent of yesterday's total market turnover.
J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket group, was the focus of the
market speculation as strong rumours did the rounds that it was about to
launch a raft of price cuts on non-perishable goods. The story, which
suggested the move was imminent, came as the market opened and sent all the
leading stocks tumbling in hectic trading.
'This is the day when everyone has been selling everything in the sector,'
commented one harassed market-maker. But another dealer said there were
still plenty of buyers to be found. 'Investors are finding healthy yield
values at these levels,' he added.
Others took a different view, and there were reports that previously
positive brokers were backtracking and advising clients to sell. The sector,
which has been the worst performer in the London market this year, has
recently undergone a rerating as some analysts have considered the decline
overdone. However, one leading food salesman said yesterday: 'The recovery
has been called too early. The news flow will remain negative for some time
yet.'
Yesterday's talk once again focused investors' minds on price pressures in
the industry, highlighted by the weakness in the sector in the previous
session following the victory by Costco, the US discount warehouse chain, to
open its first site in the UK,
After refusing to comment to analysts for most of the session, Sainsbury
finally issued a denial to the press shortly before the end of the day's
trading. By then, the shares had tumbled 14 to 402p in turnover of 9.8m, the
highest in two years. Tesco dropped 9 1/2 to 206 1/2 p in volume of 16m and
Argyll Group fell 8 to 296p with 6.4m dealt. Elsewhere, Iceland retreated 9
to 175p and Kwik Save 14 to 651p.
Asda found some support as a block of 12.3m went through the market at 53.5p
and was sold on at a penny higher. There was also an institutional visit.
The shares lost 1 1/4 to 55 1/2 p on turnover of 38m.

FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures challenged the 3,200 level after a strong advance on
Wall Street which brought a sharp turnround in what had otherwise been a
dull derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Sporadic selling followed what had been a fairly subdued opening for the
December contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,174. That selling soon developed
into more general profit-taking which drove the contract lower.
An early attempt at a rally ran out of steam when US houses turned sellers
of the contract after the release of US GDP figures. Some had expected the
figure to be higher than the 2.8 per cent increase it recorded and December
fell to the day's low of 3160.
However, the strong recovery in US bonds that brought a better than expected
opening on Wall Street enticed buyers in London causing a reversal in
December's fortunes. It advanced to the day's high of 3,196 in the last hour
of trading before a bout of profit taking in the dying minutes saw it finish
below its peak.
December finished at 3,185, around 5 points ahead of its estimated fair
value premium to cash of 15. Volume was 9,230.
Traded options had a less active session and volume slipped back to 37,470
contracts. However, turnover in the FT-SE 100 option improved at 10,572.
Wellcome was the most active stock option after disappointing figures.

FT  29 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wall Street high halts London slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DAY of high drama in the London stock market ended with Wall Street's
early move to another all-time peak, prompting a strong rebound in the
leading UK stocks after an early bout of weakness.
The initial market trend came after a set of poorly received preliminary
figures from Wellcome, one of the top UK drug companies, and another dismal
showing by the top British food retailers on talk of a price war.
The sudden and generally unexpected upsurge on Wall Street followed a better
than expected increase in US gross domestic product during the third
quarter, up an annualised 2.8 per cent, plus in-line unemployment figures.
The Dow Industrial Average moved smoothly through the 3,700 mark shortly
after US markets opened and was holding above that level after London
closed. Giving added impetus to the upward trend in US stocks was a batch of
good results from leading US companies such as Kodak and General Motors.
The feeling around the City's dealing rooms late yesterday was that Wall
Street's big rise - if it holds - could shake European markets out of their
recent uncertain performances. 'The GDP data is an indication that the US is
now on the verge of emerging properly from recession,' said a senior market
trader at one of the US brokers operating in London.
Others said they continued to feel comfortable with London and that there
looked to be considerable scope for various sectors, most notably the oils,
where British Petroleum was given a big boost yesterday after NatWest
Securities upgraded its earnings forecasts for the company.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended a day of big swings a net 8.7 firmer at 3,163.0,
but the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has outperformed the senior index
recently, stubbornly refused to participate in the late upswing, settling
4.7 off at 3,532.4, and not far short of the day's low.
The day's biggest feature was Wellcome, the drugs company, whose shares
plummeted 100p at one point before edging off the bottom, as analysts
lowered their forecasts for the current year by around 10 per cent, citing
growing fears about the group's sales prospects. A closing fall of 91p in
Wellcome was worth 4.9 points off the FT-SE 100-share index. Some top
brokers, however, said the sell-off in Wellcome had been overdone.
The same was said about the big supermarket groups, where collective
turnover accounted for approaching 10 per cent of the market's turnover of
736.6m, including a significant block trade in Asda stock.
Yesterday's overall turnover was again inflated by exceptionally heavy
business - 56m shares - in Ferranti, the defence/electronics group, where
GEC surprised no-one in the City in revealing itself as the bidder for the
group.
In sharp contrast to Wellcome, ICI shares performed well after pleasing the
market with its third-quarter results. Other outstanding performances
yesterday came from the merchant banking sector, where SG Warburg and
Hambros moved up to all-time highs, and Kleinwort Benson extended the strong
rise which has seen the shares more than double in just over 12 months.
The market's newly revived strength was reflected in another outstanding
debut performance, this time from computer games group Centregold, the
shares surging 33 per cent on the session.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bullish factors propel Dow to
all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices soared to new record highs yesterday, spurred by good
economic news, strong quarterly earnings and heavy program buying, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.20 stronger at an all-time
closing peak of 3,687.86, but below its high for the day of just over 3,700.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.12 at 467.73, while the American SE
composite ended 2.29 ahead at 477.35 and the Nasdaq composite up 1.61 at
773.49. New York SE volume totalled 301m shares.
The tone was positive from the start after investors and analysts responded
to the news that gross domestic product climbed by 2.8 per cent in the third
quarter.
Although the increase was in line with expectations, what cheered the
markets was the fact that GDP would have risen by 3.4 per cent in the
quarter if it had not been for the impact of crop losses incurred during the
summer floods in the mid-western states.
There was other good economic news in the form of a decline of 4,000 in
weekly jobless claims. Yet it was the GDP data that initiated much of the
buying, coming on the heels of a string of recent figures showing a gradual
improvement in the economy.
These signs, allied with some good third-quarter corporate results, have
been behind the record-breaking surge in stock prices over the past few
weeks. Yesterday's gains were boosted by a round of mid-morning computerised
buy programs, which at one stage lifted the Dow above 3,700 for the first
time ever.
Eastman Kodak was the star of the day, forging ahead Dollars 4 7/8 to
Dollars 63 5/8 in volume of 8.2m shares as investors celebrated the
appointment on Wednesday night of Mr George Fisher as the group's new
chairman.
Mr Fisher was previously chairman of Motorola, where he earned a reputation
as a highly successful manager. The news left Motorola down Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 104 1/4 .
Xerox jumped Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 76 3/8 after reporting third-quarter
earnings of Dollars 1.28 a share, up from Dollars 1.07 a year earlier.
General Motors climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49 in volume of 5.5m shares
after the group revealed a narrowing in its third-quarter loss to 49 cents a
share, down from the Dollars 1.86 a share shortfall incurred a year ago.
Also sharply higher were Chrysler, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 57, and Ford,
ahead Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 .
Airline issues were in demand, with UAL advancing Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars
153 and Delta Dollars 1 to Dollars 58 1/4 , both lifted by news of improved
quarterly earnings.
Canada
TORONTO was driven higher in heavy trading by good third-quarter earnings
reports and the strong performance on Wall Street.
The TSE 300 index finished 37.8 ahead at 4,235.2, marking the first time it
has closed above the 4,200-point plateau. Advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 516 to 294. Volume came to 70.4m shares.
Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by the real estate group, up 2.8
per cent. Transportation gained 1.9 per cent and mining also 1.9 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Advances in region as
Nikkei falls by 1.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in East Japan Railway shares depressed sentiment, and prices lost
ground for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average declined 359.33, or 1.8 per cent, to 19,479.45. It peaked
at 19,863.09 in the morning session on small-lot purchases by dealers and
institutional investors, but arbitrageurs liquidated positions as the
futures market retreated, and the index dropped to the day's low of
19,443.54 just before the close.
Volume amounted to 220m shares, against Wednesday's 261m. Declines led rises
by 800 to 170, with 153 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 29.56 to 1,602.39, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 2.55 to 1,272.23.
Traders said the absence of public fund buying, which had supported the
Nikkei index around the 20,000 mark, had depressed sentiment. A fall in the
dollar against the yen below the Y108 level also weighed down
export-oriented stocks, which had gained ground on the recent rise in the US
currency.
All trading in JR East was conducted manually, instead of through the
computer system. JR East finished Y75,000 down at Y525,000, although it was
suspended briefly during the morning session due to a lack of sellers.
The decline of JR East prompted selling in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
which lost Y18,000 to Y832,000. Traders said margin buyers, who had bought
the stock six months ago and were hoping that the JR East listing would also
help NTT, were forced to liquidate their holdings.
A number of electronics companies announced weak interim results yesterday,
discouraging investors: Toshiba slipped Y4 to Y697 and Hitachi shed Y10 to
Y837. However, Mitsubishi Electric advanced Y8 to Y571 after reporting a
rise in profits because of foreign exchange gains.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 294.88 to 21,386.36 in volume of 14m
shares. Konami, a discount retailer of men's suits, rose Y150 to Y3,620.
Roundup
A FURTHER batch of record highs were seen in the region yesterday.
HONG KONG advanced through the 9,000 level in late trading on
futures-related buying and interest in major issues such as Hong Kong Land,
Sun Hung Kai Properties and Hong Kong Electric. The Hang Seng index added
107.07, or 1.2 per cent, at 9,010.27 in turnover of HKDollars 6.8bn.
HK Land moved forward 50 cents to HKDollars 20.30, Sun Hung Kai Properties
HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 51 and HK Electric 70 cents to HKDollars 24.
Siu-Fung Holdings, newly listed, was the day's most active stock in turnover
of HKDollars 533m. The shares closed at HKDollars 2.40, up 43 per cent from
the issue price.
SINGAPORE lost ground on late profit-taking but volume soared to a record
717.82m shares. The Straits Times Industrial index was off 5.68 at 2,101.73

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Wall Street enhances
Amsterdam's day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH on Wall Street galvanised bourses in the afternoon, but that was
not the whole story, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM saw activity in a number of stocks as the CBS Tendency index rose
by 1.8, or 1.3 per cent to 135.6.
DSM and Akzo were among the day's best performers following the former's
third quarter results. While the figures by themselves came in at the lower
end of most analysts' expectations, observers noted that the chemical
group's prospects now look to be much improved given the efforts it has made
recently to reduce costs. The shares closed up Fl 3.80 at Fl 102.80, having
earlier seen a day's low of Fl 98.80. Akzo, which rose Fl 5.10 to Fl 181.00,
is due to report next Wednesday.
Hoogovens was helped higher by a positive note from Goldman Sachs, which
noted that the steel company was in a good position to benefit from cyclical
recovery. The shares added Fl 1.80 to Fl 42.40, slightly off the day's high.
FRANKFURT's DAX index fell 4.62 to 2,038.46, but rose to an Ibis-indicated
2,053.66 by the end of the post-bourse. Turnover eased from DM7.3bn to
DM6.9bn. In the morning there were notable rises against the trend in
Commerzbank, up DM2 at DM336, and steels.
Commerzbank's gain followed a DM2 loss in the post-bourse on Wednesday,
after Moody's cut its senior debt rating. Traders liked the bank's response
 -that its profits were up more than 50 per cent after nine months of this
year - but analysts were inclined to be more cautious.
Steels continued this week's relative strength, Krupp Hoesch rising DM3 to
DM143.50 and Thyssen DM4 to DM232.50. Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest
Securities said that this reflected the strength of the dollar, and its
potential effect on export prices, and the impending end to EC industry
negotiations which should lead to capacity cuts.
There were no stars in the post bourse. Mr Nigel Longley, of Commerzbank,
said that a number of traders had been short, expecting the market to
consolidate to 2,000 or below, and that the rise in the Dow had forced them
to cover.
PARIS recovered from the day's lows for a gain in the CAC-40 index of 3.96
to 2,195.98 ahead of today's expiry of futures and options. Turnover was
close to FFr4bn.
Rhone-Poulenc dipped FFr1.00 to FFr152.50 on the first day of
pre-privatisation marketing of the government's 43 per cent stake. The
chemicals group said after the close that dividend payments in 1993 will
reflect the fall in earnings and will probably be lower than in the previous
year.
Axa shed FFr31 to FFr1,537 after reporting a slight rise in first half
figures which were below market expectations.
MADRID was turning round on a recovering bond market long before Wall Street
made its influence felt. However, US quoted stocks made their mark as the
general index closed 2.74 higher at 306.55.
In oils, Repsol climbed Pta70 to Pta4,005 as Cepsa, Pta60 higher at
Pta2,460, extended its gains on this week's James Capel buy recommendation.
Another US-quoted stock, Telefonica, rose Pta20 to Pta1,750 but the market
was not entirely discriminatory. Pryca, against which analysts have been
making an excellent case this year, recovered Pta40 to Pta1,445.
STOCKHOLM made a new life high with help from Volvo, Ericsson, forestry and
building and real estate stocks, the Affarsvarlden General index closing
14.50 higher at 1,421.30.
Volvo B, excited by the Renault merger, rose SKr8 to SKr444 although a state
fund said late in the day that it would vote against the plan.
Ericsson B put on SKr13 at SKr455 on the world telecommunications orders
boom. In forestry, with the sector up 1.4 per cent, Modo B rose SKr13 to
SKr245 on pulp price hopes; building and property shares ended 1.2 per cent
higher.
MILAN remained caught in the doldrums with volume continuing to be low. The
Comit index eased 0.39 to 575.75, while the general strike yesterday had
already been discounted, analysts commented.
News early in the day of the arrest of Sip's managing director initially
sent the shares down, but they recovered by the close, up L20 to L3,531.
Stet added L24 to L4,046.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: KSE rally on Bhutto win and the 1993
cotton crop - Pakistan's equity market gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 13 gains in succession, and breaking through 1,500 this week, the
Karachi Stock Exchange's KSE-100 index eased a token 11.20 to 1,541.23
yesterday, 44 per cent up from its 1993 low on April 19.
That low came the day after Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, was
sacked, ending a bitter confrontation between his administration and Mr
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the president. The rally followed the election of Ms
Benazir Bhutto's PPP (Pakistan People's Party) government in the October 6
elections, ending a year-long period of intense uncertainty; but recent
projections of a bumper 1993 cotton crop in Pakistan have added to the
optimism.
In addition to Ms Bhutto's electoral success after almost three years in
opposition, the PPP has succeeded in forming a government for the Punjab,
the country's largest and wealthiest province. The PPP's control over the
centre and the Punjab has strained the perceived ability of its opponents to
destabilise the government, and created fresh optimism over continuation of
economic policies.
As for the cotton crop, latest estimates are that this year's total output
will exceed the government's target of 12m bales. As a result, the textile
groups forming nearly one-third of the KSE's 644 listed companies are
expected to earn larger profits due to cheaper raw material costs.
Signs of fresh optimism are evident around the exchange building along
Karachi's Chundrigar road, right in the heart of the business district. 'The
KSE has suddenly become so crowded with investors in the last two to three
weeks, that it has become even more difficult to find a parking spot than
before,' says Mr Aslam Motiwala, a broker. He expects the index to rise
further, to a level above 1,700 by the year-end.
According to Mr Arif Habib, president of the KSE, the newly generated
optimism is also based on hopes that Ms Bhutto will be more successful in
attracting foreign investors to Pakistan, given her personal charisma and
her ability to establish a better rapport with foreign leaders and the
business community.
'Investors feel that Ms Bhutto is good in foreign policy and that she can
sell the economic policies of her government in a better way to foreign
investors,' he adds.
Mr Yasin Lakhani, another leading broker, agrees. 'With Benazir being the
darling of the west, people expect that she would be in a better position to
get things done and put the Pakistani view across much better than any other
person on the political scene.'
Some brokers say that fresh optimism has also been generated due to
expectations over improvements in government finances.
Ms Bhutto is widely expected to continue with many of the painful economic
reforms introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, during
his three-month tenure which began this summer.
As a result, Islamabad is expected successfully to conclude negotiations in
which it is seeking up to Dollars 1.2bn in fresh International Monetary Fund
credits over the next three years.
In spite of these optimistic sentiments, some analysts are still watching to
see the result of next month's presidential elections, to determine the
extent to which Ms Bhutto's government is likely to remain stable in the
coming years.
Since 1985, the year when martial law was lifted, four governments have been
elected. Each one was sacked before completing its term under presidential
powers which allow for the dismissal of any government.
'We have to see if the presidential elections conclude smoothly, to know if
the Bhutto government has good chances of lasting its five-year term,' says
one leading businessman in Karachi. However, such long term concerns over
the political future seem to have been shelved for the time being, with
investors and brokers cashing in.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling recovered yesterday as dealers began to search for a level
they could feel happy with in the run-up to the Budget at the end of
November, writes Peter John.
The futures contract for December expiry opened at 94.54, slightly up from
Wednesday's official close, and traded within a seven basis-point range
before ending at 94.59.
For the last few days of the month traders are squaring their books.
Increasingly over the next few weeks they will be taking positions to
reflect their opinion on interest rates.
Market opinion tends towards a  1/2 percentage point reduction at or shortly
after the Budget, and possibly another half-point cut before Christmas.
However, there is a camp which believes a full one-point cut will be made at
the Budget and some who argue that a case for any rate reduction at all is
disappearing.
Those polarised views are set to pull the December contract in either
direction from a trading range between 94.50 and 94.60 until the expiry of
the contract on December 15.
Meanwhile, a large liquidity shortage was dealt with by the Bank of England
in what one dealer described as 'text book fashion' and caused no serious
problems.
The Bank offered the money market an early round of assistance after
forecasting a shortage of around Pounds 1.95bn, later revised to Pounds
2.05bn.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 907m from
the system. Bills for repurchase by the market took out Pounds 566m and
Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 370m. Partly offsetting these,
bankers' balances above target injected Pounds 60m.
The Bank provided Pounds 1.503bn of early assistance, buying Pounds 3m of
band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 1.5bn
of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on November 16 and 17 at
5 29/32 per cent. It added Pounds 359m of assistance in the afternoon,
buying band one bank bills and bringing total help for the day to Pounds
1.862bn.
German call money rates eased following an injection of short-term funds by
the Bundesbank on Wednesday. Dealers were quoting call money at around 6.45
per cent yesterday, down from 6.57 per cent previously after the central
bank injected Section 17 funds late on Tuesday.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar swings after GDP data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATA on US economic growth eagerly awaited all week by international
investors caused few surprises. But the dollar subsequently swung sharply
against the D-Mark, reflecting comments from the Bundesbank and the US
Federal Reserve, writes Peter John.
Elsewhere, the French franc weakened, the Portuguese escudo was supported by
intervention and sterling gained ground.
US gross domestic product showed a rise of 2.8 per cent in the third quarter
on an annualised basis. This was slightly higher than the broad consensus
figure of 2.7 per cent, but the range of forecasts was wide and there was
nothing to justify a significant shift in the US currency.
When the statistics were released, however, the dollar jumped a pfennig to
hit a high of DM1.6920. It appeared that some relief over the data was
compounded by a comment from Mr Edgar Meister, a member of the German
Bundesbank council, suggesting that lower German interest rates were still
on the agenda. This defused the impact of comments on Wednesday by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the head of the Bundesbank, who said he saw no reason for a
further rate cut for the time being.
Shortly afterwards, a US Federal Reserve official said the growth rate for
GDP in the fourth quarter was likely to be lower than in the third. Many
economists had expected a steady rise and the comments sent the dollar
falling to a DM1.6735 close, down from DM1.6805. It ended New York trading
at DM1.6742.
The German currency was broadly higher in Europe as a result of technical
adjustments and political factors, although it lost some strength after Mr
Meister's comments.
The D-Mark initially rose above FFr3.50. Worries that the Air France strike
would spill over into other areas of the public sector were compounded by
growing doubts over the leadership of Mr Edouard Balladur, the Conservative
prime minister. A French public opinion poll taken before Mr Balladur ceded
to Air France union demands showed that only 46 per cent of those asked
approved of him, against 56 per cent a month earlier.
Also, there are worries over French unemployment figures due tomorrow. The
franc finished at FFr3.4990 to the D-Mark, down from FFr3.4970.
The D-Mark gained against the lira as the Italian government called a
confidence vote on a minimum tax for the self-employed. The lira weakened to
L976.50 per D-Mark before closing at L972.0, down from L971.4. The
Portuguese escudo was also under pressure and the country's central bank was
said to be intervening to support the currency around Es103 to the D-Mark.
Sterling rose but failed to break through DM2.50. There were suggestions
that German bond funds, which have big holdings of UK gilts, might have been
hedging their investments by selling the pound.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Judge orders seizure of
UK-bound mahogany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLIVER TICKELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRAZILIAN judge has declared that a shipload of mahogany half way across
the Atlantic on its way to Britain may have been felled illegally and has
ordered its immediate seizure.
The decision came from Justice Alvaro Eduardo Junqueira, who ordered the
sequestration of thousands of cubic metres of mahogany belonging to C &amp; C
Industria e Comercio because he feared that it was stolen from Indian
reserves in the country's Amazon region.
Some of the mahogany is destined for London-based timber agent Tradelink,
which, says director Mr Paul Gates, has been buying from C &amp; C for four
years. 'Its not as if we're buying our timber from Ronnie Biggs,' he says.
He added, however: 'If the information is confirmed anything outstanding
will be terminated immediately. It will be cancelled - as simple as that. If
any company is found guilty of illegal practices after due process of law,
we are obviously not going to be involved with them'.
C &amp; C was caught red-handed this summer by Brazil's environment protection
agency, IBAMA, with thousands of logs stolen from the Indian land in the
state of Para. The logs were confiscated and the company's export licence
revoked.
Then, at the end of September, C &amp; C obtained an export licence for 4,000 cu
m of timber from Justice Junqueira on the basis, says the judge, of false
information. When the deception was drawn to his attention last week by
IBAMA, he revoked the licence, initiated an investigation into C &amp; C and
ordered the sequestration of its timber.
The matter is causing embarrassment for Britain's Timber Trade Federation,
of which Tradelink is a member. The federation last month launched a scheme
designed to ensure that only legally-sourced Brazilian mahogany reached the
UK market. Members were informed that unless the scheme won their 'full and
wholehearted' support, 'we risk the scheme falling into disrepute and
increase the threat of legislation'.
However, Tradelink's Mr Gates is not yet aware of the scheme. 'I don't think
the TTF has got a list of approved companies,' he says.
Under the scheme, Brazilian companies supplying participating TTF members
must sign a declaration that they are only dealing in legal timber, which
must not come from indian lands. Mr Rupert Oliver, for the TTF, says that C
&amp; C is not on the federation's list of approved mahogany suppliers.
But even if C &amp; C were on the list, that would provide no guarantee of the
legality of its timber. Earlier this month three timber companies, Maginco,
Perachi and Impar, were ordered out of 36,000 sq km of indian reserves in
southern Para by the Brazilian federal court of appeal. The companies, which
collectively supply over two-thirds of Britain's Brazilian mahogany imports,
had all signed the TTF's declaration.
The Brasilia-based Nucleus of Indigenous Rights group, which obtained the
injuction, says that 64 per cent of Brazil's mahogany exports originate in
Para, and over 80 per cent of these are taken from indian lands or protected
areas, as legal supplies are nearly extinct.
Britain imports about half of Brazil's entire mahogany exports.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World grain estimate cut
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Wheat Council has scaled back its forecast for 1993-94
world grain production in response chiefly to lower-than-expected harvests
of coarse grains such as maize and barley in Kazakhstan, Russia and the US.
Total production of wheat and coarse grains in the current season is now
estimated by the London-based agency at 1.373bn tonnes, down from the 1.39bn
tonnes forecast a month ago and 50m tonnes below the 1992-93 outturn.
The IWC's latests Grain Market Report, published yesterday, puts the world
wheat crop at 570,000 tonnes, down 5m tonnes from the estimated quoted in
its September report but still 8m tonnes above the 1992-93 figure and, if
attained, the second highest annual production total on record. The coarse
grains total is estimated at 803,000 tonnes, down 12m tonnes from the
September report and 58m tonnes from last year.
The report attributes the lower wheat forecast to 'lower figures for Canada,
Kazakhstan and the United States'.
Canadian output would be reduced because of a lower planted area, late crop
maturation and excessive rainfall late in the season, the IWC said. In
Kazakhstan, it said, the harvest would be 'good. . . although lower than
last year's record' of 18.3m tonnes at 16.5m tonnes. 'Unfavourable weather
and shortages of fuel' had led to the lower estimate. Wet weather had led to
a 1.5m-tonne reduction in the US wheat estimate, comapred with the September
projection, but the outturn was still expected to be marginally higher than
last year's at 67m tonnes. The IWC said the wet weather had also raised
concerns about the quality of the US crop.
The US maize crop would be 'dramatically lower at 178m tonnes - compared
with the 186m tonnes suggested in the September report and 240.8m tonnes in
1992-93 - the IWC said.
It explained that harvesting in the midwest was well behind normal, 'mainly
due to the fact that farmers so far have concentrated on harvesting
soyabeans while waiting for the moisture content in maize to decrease'.
Coarse grain crops in the former Soviet Union were also expected to be lower
than expected 'but better than last season'.
The report blamed adverse weather conditions during harvesting, as well as
shortages of fuel and machinery.

COFFEE prices ended at the top of the day's range at the London Commodity
Exchange as buyers were encouraged by the New York market's apparent desire
to build on Wednesday's gains, brought on by the news Brazil had approved
the funding to begin buying coffee under the producers' export retention
scheme. After hovering just under Dollars 1,200 a tonne, for near January
delivery, for most of the day, the second position managed to make a more
substantive break above, closing at Dollars 1,211 a tonne, up Dollars 32 on
the day. Dealers said , however that the real test would come be when the
market ran into producer selling, which they expected at about Dollars 1,250
a tonne. COCOA prices also held steady with the March delivery position
reaching Pounds 980 a tonne, before closing Pounds 12 up on balance at
Pounds 976. Dealers thought the market was becoming range-bound after
repeated failures to improve on the recent high of Pounds 991 a tonne. ZINC
was the exception to generally dull trading at the London Metal Exchange.
The three months position gained Dollars 15.75 at Dollars 943.50 a tonne
against persistent background talk of a European output cut.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Millers scour the world for
bread-wheat supplies - Many crops have been hit by bad weather for the
second year running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BREAD-WHEAT CROPS around the world have been hit by bad weather for the
second year running, milling industry sources report. Harvests that have
been delayed or spoiled by cold, wet conditions are arriving on the market
with quality well below normal. Tight supplies in Europe are driving up
prices of high protein bread-grain - ironically in a year when price cuts
were expected to result from the reform of the European Community's common
agricultural policy.
When milling wheat crops ran into trouble last year, exporting countries
were lucky to have large stocks of high quality grain to eke out from
previous good harvests in 1991. Prices rose to levels unseen for some years
as stores were stripped almost bare but few customers went short. However,
as UK milling giant, RHM summed up last July: 'We can't afford any more crop
problems in 1993'.
It is not only the northern hemisphere suppliers that are short of good
quality bread-wheat - Australia had a rain-damaged crop last season and is
still some weeks away from its next harvest. Although Australian quality
looks much better this year, prices for its 'prime hard' high protein wheats
are already Dollars 50 a tonne more than they were last summer, following
the world trend.
High protein wheat is essential for millers producing the typical 'Anglo
Saxon' loaf - firm and aerated, ideal for wrapping and slicing. The protein
gives strength and elasticity to the bubbles that form as wheat dough is
baked, enabling the bread to rise and hold shape.
Despite the enormous advance in UK self-sufficiency in bread-wheat since it
joined the EC in the early 1970s (it usually grows between 2.5m and 3m
tonnes of its own 'soft' or lower protein bread-wheats), some hard, high
protein imported wheat is vital to get the right dough mix.
Some continental millers are better off than their UK counterparts; the
typical French loaf can get by on much less protein but the quality
shortages and the scramble for supplies is affecting prices for all.
Normally UK millers count on Canada to fill a protein gap of about 250,000
tonnes. But Canada's crops have been hit by early snowfalls and delayed by
weeks of wet and wintry weather. Average protein content of its top wheat
grades has dropped from a normal 14.5 per cent to just above I3 per cent,
according to the Canadian Wheat Board.
Even for Canada's lower protein wheats, prices are sharply higher, currently
nudging Pounds 250 a tonne, delivered to UK mills. One leading UK miller
estimated that Canadian 13.5 per cent protein wheat - the least he could get
by on - would probably cost him Pounds 300 a tonne delivered. 'Basically,
for every tonne of Pounds 140-a-tonne UK bread-wheat we don't get, we will
have to put in some Pounds 300 Canadian wheat - if we can get it,' he
explained ruefully.
UK Ministry of Agriculture figures show that the proportion of UK wheat in
the millers 'grist' has already fallen to only 56 per cent from 83 per cent
this time last year. Leading UK grain merchants Dalgety, recently estimated
UK wheat proteins were also down by about 1 per cent this season, raising
costs and requiring the use of other inputs.
The US is an occasional hard-wheat supplier to Europe but is unlikely to
fill the Canadian shortfall, following rain and disease damage to much of
its spring planted bread-wheat (which has recently traded at 13-year highs).
Millers will therefore have to scour continental Europe for high protein
wheat, where they will find a very mixed picture.
Despite a reported 4m tonnes of milling wheat downgraded by bad weather to
animal feed, French farmers are reported to have plenty of 'quality' grain,
'but high proteins are not one of their strong points', one shipper pointed
out. Germany also has a mixed bag of good-to-rain-spoiled milling wheats but
merchants there are now demanding higher prices - reportedly leaving many of
their own millers short. Denmark and Spain, other frequent sources of
bread-wheats have also been unable to provide the right high quality grain
so far.
Another traditional option for millers short of high protein wheat is to
incorporate large quantities of wheat gluten - a by-product of starch
manufacture - to solve the 'bubble problem' in loaves made from lower
protein wheats. But - more bad news - thanks to Europe's recession and a
glut of cheap, competing potato starch, wheat starch production has
collapsed and wheat gluten supplies along with it.
American millers have meanwhile been snapping up dwindling European gluten
supplies to offset their own protein wheat shortfalls (US starch, made from
maize and its by-product, corn gluten, is only fit for animal feed). Anyone
who bought EC wheat gluten in June at Pounds 700 a tonne should be
celebrating - its price has since rocketed to Pounds l,590.
Crunch time comes early in 1994. Many of the big UK milling concerns will
then run out of the Canadian 1991 crop stocks they prudently bought forward
before this summer's wash-out, 'After that we're on to what comes out of the
1993 crops and it doesn't look good,' one summed up.
Weather and other factors have also made a mockery of much vaunted cost
benefits grain consumers expected from reforms of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. 'Headline wheat price cuts of Pounds 59 per tonne have
simply not materialised due to the premiums quoted on bread-wheats (over
ordinary wheat),' one industry executive lamented.
'On top of that, many countries' domestic and imported prices have been
strengthened by weak currencies surrounding the ERM's (EC exchange rate
mechanism's) collapse.'
Even farmers may be robbed of profit from the rise in milling wheat values
because their bread-wheat crops failed to perform as expected, And there is
an ominous flip-side to this situation - a flood of cheap feed-wheat
sloshing around the European and world markets, pushing the export price
down to just Dollars 60 a tonne - its lowest for some years, Meanwhile, the
rise in bread-wheat prices shows no sign yet of levelling off.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further rise forecast for iron
ore demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD DEMAND for iron ore has picked up this year after being very depressed
in 1992, and next year should see further rises in demand and trade,
according to government and business experts from 31 iron ore producing and
consuming countries.
The experts, who met this week in Geneva under the auspices of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, noted weak economic activity in
Europe and Japan but higher demand from other steel producing countries,
especially China and South Korea. A rise in steel scrap prices this year has
also boosted iron ore deliveries.
Mr Dong Zhi Xiong, vice-president of the Beijing-based China Metallurgical
Import and Export Corporation, the country's biggest iron ore importer, told
the meeting that with an expected economic growth rate of 8 to 9 per cent a
year for the rest of the decade China would produce at least 100m tonnes of
crude steel by the year 2000. This would require, on conservative estimates,
imports of 45m to 50m tonnes annually, compared with 25m tonnes last year.
Chinese iron ore production has almost doubled from 118m tonnes to nearly
210m tonnes between 1978 and 1992, responding to an annual growth rate of
crude steel production of 6.9 per cent. As well as being the world's largest
iron ore producer, China last year overtook Japan and Russia to become the
largest pig iron producer, with about 20 per cent of its 76m-tonne
production coming from ore imports.
Although the world steel market has grown by just 1.8 per cent in the first
nine months of 1993, iron ore production is also rising and, on the eve of
annual price negotiations, the outlook is for further modest growth. The
experts noted that, in sharp contrast to late 1992, there was greater
activity in most steel market segments and prices for most steel products
had risen more than once over the past nine months.
World demand for iron ore slumped last year, accompanied by tumbling iron
ore prices, resulting in a decline of Dollars 700m in producers' export
earnings. World production fell by 5 per cent to 903m tonnes, the biggest
drop (18.5 per cent) being in the former Soviet Union, which in 1991 was
still the biggest producer.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China awards more offshore oil
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA HAS opened further its offshore areas to foreign investors. China
National Offshore Oil Corporation this week signed contracts with Texaco,
Agip of Italy and Maersk of Denmark jointly to explore three blocs in the
East China Sea.
In a competitive bidding with 14 other foreign bidders from Britain, Japan,
the Netherlands and South Korea, the three companies secured Chinese
approval to explore about 8,100 square kilometres, some 400km south-east of
Shanghai.
Under the contract, signed in the presence of Chinese vice-premier Zou
Jiahua, Texaco will hold a 40 per cent interest and Agip and Maersk 30 per
cent each in the exploration area.
Exploration costs in the first 3 years are estimated to exceed USDollars
100m. The region is regarded as highly prospective.
China opened its continental shelf to foreign bidders in 1982, the year the
offshore oil corporation was established, to attract what it needs most -
finance, technological know-how and modern management. It has now signed 79
contracts with 51 oil companies from 14 countries.
China's offshore oil output this year is expected to reach 4.5m tonnes and
onshore, 138m tonnes. The corporation's target is to increase its output to
12m tonnes by 1997.
'Although China's offshore oil production only amounts to a small percentage
of the country's total output now,' said Chen Bingqian, vice-president of
the corporation, 'we are growing much faster than the onshore sector.'
On present trends China is likely to become a net importer of oil by 1995,
and this has spurred efforts to secure foreign investment in the exploration
of offshore and onshore areas such as the Tarim basin in the country's
far-western Xinjiang region.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK flour and bread prices to
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK flour and bread prices are expected to rise shortly as a direct
consequence of the quality wheat shortage. Most millers are expected to
announce flour price rises averaging 5 per cent on Monday, writes John
Buckley.
The impact on bread prices may vary between vertically-integrated operations
that combine flour milling and baking, and independent bakers who have to
buy in supplies of flour. However food industry analysts believe the flour
price rise will add up to 4p to the cost of a loaf.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post solid gains despite GDP
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices recovered from early losses to post solid gains yesterday
in spite of a strong third-quarter GDP report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/8 at 104
1/16 , yielding 5.952 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 3.957 per cent.
Prices eased in early trading after the commerce department announced that
gross domestic product climbed by 2.8 per cent in the third quarter.
Although the number was in line with expectations, dealers and investors
started selling Treasuries when they saw that GDP showed growth of 3.4 per
cent when the impact of crop losses related to the big summer floods in the
mid-west was excluded from the figures.
News of a 4,000 decline in weekly jobless claims also depressed prices.
The market, however, gradually recovered, aided by comments from Susan
Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, who said fourth-quarter GDP growth
could turn out weaker than third-quarter growth.
Later in the day, retail demand, and a subsequent rush of short covering by
dealers, pushed prices even higher at the long end.
EUROPEAN government bonds had another volatile day, mostly tracking US
Treasuries in the absence of important local news. Most markets managed to
recoup some of the ground lost in Wednesday's sharp sell-off.
Many investors remained sidelined ahead of today's EC summit and the
three-day weekend in most of Europe. However, traders reported some buying
by dealers who needed to cover short positions following Wednesday's plunge.
GERMAN bonds recouped most of Wednesday's losses and ended slightly higher.
Failing to break key support at 99.65, the December bund contract returned
to above par, closing at 100.08, up 0.29 point.
Opinions are divided over the near-term outlook, with some seeing the
market's downside well-protected at current levels, but others warning it
could correct further.
'We've had five months of rally without serious setbacks, and I think we're
in for more weakness at the long end,' said a senior Frankfurt trader,
pointing to remarks by Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer that long
yields had little scope for further easing.
FRENCH bonds shadowed bunds, leaving their 10-year yield premium over
Germany unchanged at 12 basis points. Traders reported late retail buying of
shorter-dated bonds following Wednesday's weakness.
Today's focus will be on September unemployment data, with bond traders
forecasting a rate of 11.8 per cent. A bad number could trigger more
rate-cut talk, although easing hopes were damped by warnings from prime
minister Edouard Balladur that the pace of easing should not be forced.
UK GILTS also staged a strong recovery, with the long gilt contract rising
17/32 on the day to 114 7/16 .
Traders reported healthy cash buying across the curve, with particularly
strong demand for the new 6 per cent gilts due 1999 from international and
domestic investors.
Market participants are now set to turn their attention to the Pounds 500m
tap offering of 7 3/4 per cent gilts due 2006 which the Bank of England
announced last week. The bonds are being offered at 116, a point above the
current market price of 115 21/32 . So far, little or none of the paper has
been taken up, traders said.
Italian bonds were rattled by political jitters after the government called
a confidence vote for today.
However, after an initial sell-off, prices recovered amid widespread
confidence that the government would survive the vote, and the BTP future on
Liffe rose 0.71 point to 117.04.
JAPANESE bonds hit new highs on more switching out of equities, as the stock
market continued to weaken. However, profit-taking eroded the gains and
bonds closed slightly lower.

Telecom float

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE public offering for Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's
state-run telecommunications and posts utility, closed yesterday with
indications that shares have been heavily oversubscribed.
The Singapore government is floating about 10 per cent of ST in this, the
first phase of the group's privatisation.
The government has set a minimum value of SDollars 30.5bn (USDollars 19.5bn)
on ST. However, Singapore-based analysts say aggressive share purchases,
mainly by Singaporeans, could push the group's market valuation to between
SDollars 40bn and SDollars 50bn.
Analysts say ST's A and B share categories, restricted to Singapore citizens
and sold at SDollars 1.90 and SDollars 2 respectively, have been more than
three times oversubscribed. The government has said all applications for A
shares will be satisfied in full, while B shares will be allocated through a
ballot or partial allotment.
C shares, which comprise half the ST offer, are open to both Singaporeans
and foreigners on a tender basis, with a minimum price of SDollars 2. Given
the interest in the flotation and the amount of liquidity in the Singapore
market, analysts are expecting the strike price, due to be announced today,
to be high, possibly more than SDollars 3.
Trading in ST shares is due to start on Monday. The stock exchange of
Singapore, anticipating hectic trading in ST shares, has announced it will
double the length of its trading session, to 12 hours, from the start of
next week until further notice.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: IFC helps finance Grupo Idesa
plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, is providing a Dollars 57.5m syndicated loan to Grupo Idesa, a
Mexican petrochemicals company, to help finance the construction of two
plants at an estimated cost of Dollars 108m.
The IFC is also providing an equity investment of Dollars 8m. It has
approached DEG, the German finance company for investments in developing
countries, to put up an additional Dollars 7.5m as a separate loan.
The rest of the project's cost will be financed by Idesa's internal cash
generation. The plants should take between two and three years to build.
Idesa, one of Mexico's largest exporters of chemicals, will pay a spread of
between 2 1/4 and 2 1/2 per cent over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor). It will pay the banks participating in the loan through the IFC.
Of the IFC's total loan, Dollars 42.5m has been placed with a group of
banks, lead-managed by Dresdner Bank Luxembourg. The lead manager will earn
a front-end fee of 1 per cent and the managers will earn  3/4 per cent.
The syndicated tranche of the loan will have a maturity of seven years,
while the IFC's own-account loan will have a maturity of nine.
The IFC said environmental considerations weighed heavily in Idesa's
decision to locate its plants in an industrial park in Morales, in Veracruz,
next to the petrochemicals complex which will supply the raw materials. The
proximity will eliminate the need to transport hazardous chemicals over long
distances.
One of the plants will produce 200,000 tons per year of ethylene glycol,
used to make polyester fibres and resins for packing applications. The other
will produce 20,000 tons yearly of ethanolamines.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Bold pricing of EIB's Pounds 400m deal
surprises traders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank (EIB) stunned many participants in the
international bond market yesterday with the bold pricing of its Pounds 400m
issue of five-year Eurobonds.
The pricing of the bonds had been expected to be very tight, due to the
increased competition among banks for mandates and the EIB's ability to
command aggressive terms.
Indeed, some banks had declined to participate in the bidding because they
felt there would be little room to make a profit on the deal.
Nevertheless, the yield spread on the EIB's bonds of just one basis point
over the new five-year UK government bond still came as a surprise.
The joint lead managers of the EIB's issue, IBJ and SG Warburg, did not form
a group of banks to sell the bonds because they had already identified
sufficient demand from eastern Asia and continental Europe to enable them to
place the bonds by themselves.
However, there was a view in the market that their reluctance to form a
group had more to do with defending the price of the bonds more effectively.
The bonds, which were priced at launch at 98.261, closed yesterday at 98
3/16 bid, giving a spread over the underlying gilt of two basis points.
SG Warburg said many investors had bought them as a substitute to the UK
government's auction on Wednesday of Pounds 3.5bn 6 per cent gilts due 1999.
In addition, the payment date on the EIB's bonds of December 2 offered
investors a play on UK interest rates, which are widely expected to be cut
as part of the UK budget on November 30.
An official at the EIB said the issue was designed to to establish a new
five-year benchmark for the EIB in the Eurosterling sector. He also
expressed confidence that the bonds would eventually yield less than the
underlying gilts.
The EIB did not expect to tap the Eurosterling sector for another three
months, but syndicate managers said it was likely the offering would be
re-opened in the new year.
By comparison to the EIB's issue, the coupon of 15 basis points over
six-month London interbank offered rate (Libor) on Ford Credit's Pounds 200m
issue of three-year floating-rate notes (FRNs) looked positively generous.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the notes, which marked the first offering
by Ford's amalgamated European credit operations, carried a 20 per cent
capital risk weighting. The notes were kept in syndicate overnight and are
expected to be freed to trade today.
The bidding environment is likely to remain acute for the near future.
Commerzbank, the German bank whose long-term credit rating was downgraded by
Moody's on Wednesday, is expected to raise Dollars 750m today through an
issue of five-year FRNs. The notes, via Merrill Lynch, are expected to yield
one basis point over Libor.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric passes payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OKI Electric, the Japanese communications equipment maker, reported a loss
of Y6.8bn (Dollars 65.6m) in the first half of the year and passed its
dividend. The company blamed its poor performance on continuing weakness in
private businesses demand and personal consumption, as well as the sharp
appreciation of the yen.
The loss came on sales of Y256. bn, 2.2 per cent down on the previous first
half. Oki's pre-tax losses were lower than last year's first-half losses of
Y19.3bn.
The company said it was able to contain losses through cost-cutting efforts.
However, the net loss of Y12.4bn was worse than its previous loss of Y8.7bn.
Oki, which has close ties with NTT, the telecommunications group, saw
substantial declines in its communications equipment and information
processing equipment divisions. This was blamed on private business moves to
cut capital spending. Strong demand for memory chips, on the other hand,
helped raise sales in its electronic devices division.
Oki is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y8bn on sales of Y5,550bn for the full
year to March 1994.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Australian Air write-offs push
Qantas into red
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
QANTAS, Australia's state-controlled international airline, has slumped into
the red in the June year following heavy write-offs associated with
acquisition of the domestic carrier, Australian Airlines.
Qantas, in which British Airways last year acquired a 25 per cent interest,
turned a ADollars 147.6m (USDollars 95.2m) pre-tax profit into a ADollars
413.5m loss despite a revenue jump from ADollars 4.02bn to ADollars 5.81bn.
The chairman of Qantas, Mr Gary Pemberton, said yesterday the loss reflected
abnormal provisions of ADollars 446.4m (ADollars 45m abnormal profit
previously), of which ADollars 282.3m related to Australian Airlines.
Before abnormals, earnings fell from ADollars 102.6m to ADollars 32.9m. The
result, which included 10 months of Australian Airlines' operations, was
after a jump from ADollars 371.8m to ADollars 446.7m in financing costs.
Mr Pemberton said Australian Airlines' domestic network added significant
value to the group, but the write-offs represented the intangible assets
associated with the merger and the loss of the Australian brand.
He said over time the Australian acquisition would prove to be a turning
point for Qantas. 'Although many opportunities for cost reductions from the
integration of activities have been taken, it is clear that the
single-minded pursuit of rationalisation can have broader implications for
customer service and revenue earning capacity,' he said.
'There is no question that the demands and distractions of the merger have
provided a window of opportunity for Qantas' competitors.'
Mr Pemberton said the partnership with British Airways had provided access
to new markets and promised cost benefits for both companies.
He said the decision, earlier this year, by the Australian government to
defer the proposed public flotation of its remaining shareholding in Qantas
had afforded time to strengthen the group's financial performance.
The result excluded a ADollars 36.7m tax credit, against a ADollars 10m
provision last time.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Drop in demand hits NSK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NSK, Japan's leading producer of ball bearings, yesterday reported a sharp
decline in taxable profits for the six months to September, and reduced its
earnings forecast for the year.
It attributed the setback to a fall in demand from carmaking customers.
However, NSK avoided falling into loss thanks to the sale of securities, a
technique used by several industrial companies to tide them through the
recession.
Taxable profits fell by 47.5 per cent from the first half of the previous
year, to Y1.47bn on sales down by 7.9 per cent to Y162.73bn over the same
period.
Operating profits fell even more sharply, by 84.3 per cent to Y722m (Dollars
6.6m), reflecting high fixed costs and the fact that NSK's plants were only
able to operate at between 80 and 85 per cent of capacity.
NSK's security sales brought in a Y2bn capital gain, on top of which it
earned another Y2bn in dividends from affiliate companies.
Operating profits will recover in the second half, thanks to cost-cutting
efforts, but taxable profits for the year will be only Y3.5bn, down from
Y4.16bn in the previous year and well below the group's Y4.1bn forecast.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Profits dive at Hitachi, NEC and
Toshiba - Electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For Japan's comprehensive electronics companies, the first six months of
fiscal 1993 were a race to cut costs and restructure their operations in a
desperate bid to beat both the adverse impact of a surge in the yen's value
and severe economic conditions at home.
The results announced yesterday for the period revealed that their efforts
have not yet filtered through enough to combat the severe deterioration in
their business environment.
Hitachi, NEC and Toshiba, which manufacture a wide range of products from
semiconductors to telecommunications equipment, all reported declines in
first-half pre-tax profits to the end of September. Mitsubishi Electric
reported a strong rise in pre-tax profits but a 66 per cent reduction in
operating profits.
Fujitsu, meanwhile, reported a larger loss and said that its full-year
results would be worse than previously forecast.
During the period concerned, all five companies came under heavy pressure as
the Japanese economy remained severely depressed and kept a lid on both
private sector demand and personal consumption.
Demand by private businesses for computers, information processing systems
and office automation products remained particularly weak. Fujitsu, for
example, saw a 21 per cent decline in sales of its computers and information
processing division. The sluggishness of demand for these products led to a
deterioration in prices particularly for computers and office automation
equipment.
For those companies with consumer electronics businesses, a continuing lack
of interest in audio-visual products among consumers as well as a sharp drop
in air conditioner sales due to an unusually cool summer, had a severe
impact on profits. Air conditioner sales in Japan this year are down more
than 1m units compared with last year.
Mitsubishi reported a 14 per cent decline in sales in its consumer products
division while Toshiba saw its sales in consumer electronics slump 12 per
cent. The depressed consumer electronics market in turn affected demand for
devices made by many of the large electronics companies, which were, as a
result, subject to intense price cutting.
Meanwhile, in overseas markets, the near 20 per cent rise in the yen's value
against the dollar was a harsh blow to their cost competitiveness and
profitability which could not be entirely offset by short-term measures,
such as foreign exchange hedging.
Toshiba, for one, noted that the yen's rise was a major factor in its 70 per
cent drop in operating profits to Y5.6bn (Dollars 52.8m) from a previous
Y19.1bn. But the company was able to offset the drop with a foreign exchange
gain of Y20bn through forward contracts.
The performance of the comprehensive electronics companies would have been
significantly worse, however, had it not been for their ability to offset
declines in some of their core businesses with increases in other business
areas on the back of strong public sector demand and a buoyant market for
semiconductors in the US.
Strong orders from utilities, for example, supported a 22 per cent rise in
the heavy electricals business at Toshiba. At the same time, demand for
products such as semiconductor memory chips rose strongly on demand from US
computer makers.
Nevertheless, the general outlook for the industry remains bleak. Most
companies do not expect the Japanese economy to recover significantly in the
second half of the fiscal year. Their main hope in lifting profits thus lies
in their cost-cutting efforts, which are being carried out across the
industry in varying degrees.
Fujitsu, for example, is hoping to reduce its workforce by 6,000 over the
next two years through natural attrition. The company is recruiting just 300
employees next spring compared with a peak of 3,870 in 1991. Fujitsu is also
reducing capital expenditure by about Y100bn and R&amp;D costs by about Y10bn.
Hitachi is reducing its workforce by 2,000 by the end of March through
transfers and natural attrition, in addition to a reduction of 2,500 in the
past year.
In contrast, Toshiba is taking a more moderate approach to cost-cutting.
While Toshiba aims to reduce its workforce by 5,000 over five years, it is
still recruiting 1,800 people next year compared with a peak of 3,000
earlier in the decade. Neither is the company planning to reduce capital
expenditure or R&amp;D costs this year.
Another way in which Japanese electronics companies are trying to reduce
costs is by buying more components and even complete products from overseas.
Fujitsu, for example, is planning to double procurement of foreign parts by
1995. NEC, for its part, will for the first time develop and manufacture
some of its PCs for the Japanese market in Hong Kong. NEC also plans to
increase the proportion of foreign-made components in its mainline PCs made
for the domestic market from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.
In the longer run, however, efforts to reduce costs will also have to be
supported further by development of higher value-added products.
Even amid the general downturn, Toshiba, for example, saw strong demand for
its colour liquid crystal display notebook PCs in the US, which increased
its PC sales in the US by 30 per cent.

<TEXT>
A FALL in passengers in both international and domestic flights hit All
Nippon Airways, a leading Japanese airline, which reported falls in interim
sales and profits for the first time in 10 years.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the first half plunged 62.5 per cent to
Y6.5bn (Dollars 59.9m) while sales declined 4.8 per cent to Y404.4bn.
After-tax profits dropped 80.8 per cent to Y1.3bn.
Domestic passengers fell 5.7 per cent to 16.6m while the number of
passengers on international routes fell 4.4 per cent to 770,682.
Mr Kazuhiko Komiya, managing director, said the company would have fallen
into the red if it had not reduced depreciation costs by extending the
assumed life of an aircraft to 13 years from 10 years.
While the yen's appreciation against the dollar also supported ANA's profits
by pushing down fuel costs, it also squeezed revenue from its international
operations, forcing the company to suspend four international routes.
For the full year to March, the company expects a 62 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Y6bn on a 3.2 per cent decline in sales to Y782bn.
ANA does not expect to make after-tax profits for the year, but said it will
maintain its annual dividend of Y4 per share.

flotation of Elders
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELDERS, the Australian rural group once central to the corporate empire of
Mr John Elliott, is being refloated to the public through a ADollars 99m
(USDollars 66m) offering.
The float, rumoured for some weeks, involves the sale for ADollars 311m of
the Elders business by Foster's Brewing group, the Australian beermaker, to
a new company, Elders Australia Ltd.
The new company will offer ADollars 98.7m in shares at ADollars 1 each, with
up to 30 per cent of the float reserved for sale to Australian farmers
through the Farmers Investment Trust. A further 15m Elders shares will be
offered to existing Fosters' shareholders.
The transaction continues the sale of surplus assets by Fosters', now
controlled by BHP, the Australian resources group. Fosters' chief executive
officer, Mr Ted Kunkel, said yesterday the sale price represented a book
loss of about ADollars 10m, but this had already been provisioned.
The sale price involves ADollars 89m for the main Elders pastoral business,
including wool-broking and livestock marketing, and a further ADollars 222m
for the company's rural loan book.
Mr Kunkel said proceeds from the sale would be used to reduce Foster's debt,
which fell from ADollars 4.1bn to ADollars 2.6bn in the latest June year.
The sale excludes Elders' 45 per cent stake in Australian Meat Holdings, one
of the country's biggest meat groups.

McCAW Cellular Communications, the largest US cellular telecommunications
company which has agreed to merge with AT&amp;T, yesterday reported a
third-quarter net loss of Dollars 28.7m, or 14 cents a share, against a
deficit of Dollars 58m, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to
Dollars 562.6m from Dollars 448m.
Revenues from cellular operations grew 28 per cent to Dollars 332.2m while
cash flow attributable to cellular operations climbed 30 per cent to Dollars
202.3m. McCaw's interest expense in the quarter narrowed to Dollars 96.2m
from Dollars 123.3m.
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are taking bold
steps, as significant as agreeing to merger our company with AT&amp;T, reducing
rates - with the introduction of digital as much as 20 per cent - and
reducing customer activation time from two hours to 15 minutes.'
LIN Broadcasting, another cellular broadcasting telecommunications company
that is majority-owned by McCaw, revealed a widening of its third-quarter
loss, to Dollars 26.4m or 51 cents a share, from Dollars 16.67m or 32 cents.
Revenues increased to Dollars 175.1bn from Dollars 145.7bn.
Net loss for the first nine months totalled Dollars 57.7m or Dollars 1.12 a
share, against Dollars 60m or Dollars 1.17, on revenues of Dollars 497.6m
against Dollars 412.5m. The 1992 nine-month figures were restated to include
an accounting charge of Dollars 19.6m or 38 cents a share.

Tiger

<TEXT>
MR Archibald Cox, who resigned four months ago as chief executive of First
Boston, the Wall Street investment bank, is to join Tiger Management, the
New York investment group.
Mr Cox will become chairman of the Hong-Kong based Tiger International Fund,
which will invest Dollars 1bn directly into the developing economies of Asia
Pacific, Latin America and eastern Europe.
'The securities markets in many of these nations are not large enough to
accommodate the growing institutional investor interest in the area, and in
some cases are not completely open to foreign investors. We believe that
attractive opportunities exist for direct investment in many of these
countries,' Mr Cox said.
Mr John Griffin, president of Tiger Management, described Mr Cox as one of
Wall Street's most respected investment bankers, and said that his 15 years
of experience doing business in Asia 'should mesh perfectly with Tiger's
expanding role and expertise in the region'.
Mr Cox made his reputation as an investment banker in Asia Pacific and
London, where he helped Morgan Stanley establish a presence in Euromarkets.
He joined CS First Boston in the late 1980s and rose to the top of the New
York operation.
Mr Cox was unseated this year after clashing with senior managers at CSFB

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Statoil rises to NKr2.9bn
despite weaker oil price

STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a rise in
nine-month net profit to NKr2.9bn (Dollars 414m) from NKr2.4bn in the same
period last year, in spite of lower crude oil prices and a decline in crude
oil production.
The group forecast lower operating profits for the fourth quarter, on the
basis of oil prices, and warned of uncertainties over the balance of the oil
market and price trends, particularly for crude oil.
Nevertheless, its revenue rose by NKr2.2bn to NKr63.3bn in the first three
quarters of this year while operating profit remained unchanged at NKr9.9bn.
Statoil said Brent Blend reference crude secured an average price of Dollars
17.64 per barrel in the first nine months of this year, down from Dollars
19.36 for the same period last year. Crude oil availability fell to an
average 406m barrels a day in the first nine months of this year from an
average 416m last year.
The third quarter was affected by declining oil prices and continued low
prices for petrochemical products, but net profit increased to NKr1.1bn from
NKr592m as revenue rose slightly to NKr20.8bn.
For the group's individual business units, exploration and production lifted
nine-month operating profit by NKr600m to NKr7.2bn, helped by higher oil
prices in domestic currency terms - NKr124 a barrel versus NKr119 - and
lower operating costs.
The natural gas division suffered a decline of NKr500m in operating profit
to NKr2.4bn in the nine-month period, due to lower revenue from gas
transport operations.
Refining and marketing lifted operating profit by NKr200m to NKr772m, helped
by higher margins at the Mongstad refinery, improved operations and better
results from marine transport operations.
Petrochemicals and plastics saw operating losses increase by NKr127m to
NKr405m due to a charge of NKr196m against accounts to cover winding-up
costs of a major methytertiary butyl ether (MTBE) project which the group
shelved.
Statoil said that excluding the charge, the unit's result was improved by
better margins and lower costs.

SHISEIDO, Japan's largest cosmetics company, reported a fall in sales for
the first six months to September due to the decline in consumer confidence,
but managed to post a marginal rise in profits thanks to cost reductions.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose 1.8
per cent to Y15.7bn (Dollars 148m) on a 0.6 per cent fall in sales to
Y199.8bn. After-tax profits rose 1.8 per cent to Y7.7bn.
Sales of cosmetics remained flat at Y138.6bn, while toiletries declined 3.2
per cent to Y48.1bn. The company said higher overseas procurement of
ingredients and materials due to the high yen, contributed to profits.
For the year to March, Shiseido expected pre-tax profits of Y32.5bn on sales
of Y401bn and after-tax profits of Y15.3bn.

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge Canada, the integrated forest products group, reduced
losses in the first quarter of fiscal 1994. The company, controlled by
Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, was helped by higher timber and coated
paper prices, increased pulp and newsprint shipments and a lower Canadian
dollar.
For the three months to September 30, the company posted a loss of CDollars
12.9m (USDollars 9.9m) or 11 cents a share, against a deficit of CDollars
18.8m or 24 cents, on sales ahead to CDollars 378m from CDollars 207m last
time. The rise in sales came partly from inclusion of the Elk Falls pulp and
paper operation acquired last February.
FCC, which had a small profit in the June quarter, is putting most of its
wood products and logging operations into a new company, TimberWest. It will
then sell 49 per cent of the company to the public.
The group said industry-wide shutdowns appear to have stabilised pulp prices
and there might be an improvement in 1994.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: BCE drops 57% on poor results at
telecom unit
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GIBBENS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest company, suffered a 57 per cent drop in third-quarter
profit because of poor results at Bell Canada, its fully-owned
telecommunications subsidiary and at Northern Telecom, the equipment
affiliate.
BCE said NT's recovery was under way and Bell Canada's results would improve
next year as a result of broad restructuring and cuts in capital spending.
Intense competition in the long-distance sector reduced Bell Canada's
earnings. Another factor was the federal regulator's decision to refuse its
request for higher local rates.
Traditionally, long distance traffic has subsidised local services, but
deregulation of long distance services and the entry of Unitel and numerous
resellers into the market has changed this.
BCE's third-quarter profit was CDollars 128m (Dollars 98.5m) or 42 cents a
share, down from CDollars 294m or 96 cents a year earlier, on revenues
steady at CDollars 5bn.
At the nine-month stage the groups suffered a loss of CDollars 218m or 71
cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 790m or CDollars 2.56, on little
changed at almost CDollars 15bn.
The latest period included BCE's share of nearly CDollars 1bn of NT special
charges. Excluding these, BCE earned CDollars 1.33 a share.
Bell Canada contributed 66 cents per BCE share in the third quarter and
CDollars 1.73 in the nine months, down from CDollars 2.33 a year earlier.
Local business is growing in volume, with more network access services but
more revenue is being lost to competitors. In addition, depreciation was
higher in the nine months.
NT made a negative contribution of 7 cents per BCE share in the third
quarter and CDollars 2.14 in the nine months, compared with a positive
contribution of 58 cents per BCE share a year earlier. NT's margins
contracted and it took heavy restructuring charges.
Mobile communications improved as did international telecommunications. But
Montreal Trust made a negative contribution. It posted a nine-months loss of
CDollars 32.6m or 79 cents a share after further provisions for doubtful
property loans.
BCE is trying to sell this unit and tackle the problem of BF Realty, its
insolvent property unit.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Elkem turnround at nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday disclosed a nine-month
pre-tax profit of NKr64m (Dollars 9.1m), against a loss of NKr307m last
year. It was helped by cost reductions, a decline in domestic energy taxes,
favourable currency exchange rates and slightly higher sales volumes.
The company said it was holding debt restructuring negotiations which are
expected to be completed by the end of autumn.
Group net sales rose by NKr285m to NKr5.72bn as operating profit shot up to
NKr282m from NKr40m last year. Operating costs increased slightly by NKr63m
to NKr5.23bn.
Elkem reduced nine-month net financial expenses by NKr46m to NKr217m,
including a decline of NKr68m in net interest costs to NKr242m. 'The fall in
interest expenses is mainly due to a reduction in net debt,' which fell to
NKr3.4bn at end-September from NKr4.5bn at the end of 1992, Elkem said.
It said agreement in principle had been reached with its banks to
restructure the group debt which falls due at the end of this year and 1994.
The restructuring proposal calls for four syndicated credit facilities -
which mature during December 1993 to December 1994 - to be consolidated into
one facility of about Dollars 275m to be repaid during a four-year period
from 1994.
Elkem's prospects will be affected by the lack of growth in demand for
metals and alloys. 'There are no signs yet of a significant improvement in
the world economy,' it said.
While anti-dumping measures and structural changes contributed to a slight
increase in prices for ferrosilicon and ferromanganese during the second
half of this year, prices for aluminium, silicon metal and ferrochrome
declined, the company added.

VITRO, Mexico's dominant glass maker, reported consolidated net profits of
Dollars 546m new pesos (Dollars 175m) in the first nine months of the year,
an increase in real terms of just under 1 per cent over the same period last
year.
The company's results continued to be affected by Mexico's high real
interest rates, sluggish demand for glass products and the appreciation of
the peso in real terms against the US dollar.
More than half of Vitro's earnings are denominated in US dollars.
Vitro's operating income rose to 931m pesos, a 5.5 per cent real increase
over the same period last year. Sales reached 8,235m pesos, a 2.7 per cent
gain.
Exports continued to be a bright spot, climbing to Dollars 326m, a 13.4 per
cent increase in dollar terms.
Vitro said it reduced its workforce to 41,040 people from 47,913 at the end
of the third quarter last year.

VITAL Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, yesterday announced a
sharp rise in nine-month value-adjusted pre-tax profit to NKr3.13bn (Dollars
447m) from NKr22m in the same period last year.
The group's free shares rose by NKr4 to NKr90 on the Oslo bourse on the news
as the A-shares added NKr1.50 to NKr70.50. Vital attributed the advance to a
16.5 per cent increase in premium income and gains on securities.
Premium income in the first nine months of this year rose by NKr327m to
NKr3.64bn as gross financial income shot up by NKr2.02bn to NKr3.64bn, of
which NKr1.27bn was due to securities gains. By the end of last month, the
value of the group's securities portfolio had increased by NKr2.09bn to
NKr2.67bn. Insurance payments rose by NKr109m to NKr1.52bn as operating
expenses increased by NKr14m to NKr413m.
'Private market sales were fairly static until the end of summer, but the
September figures show an increasing awareness among the public of the need
for financial security and a good return on savings,' said Mr Bjoern
Elvestad, president.
He added that Vital's performance this year had strengthened the group's
capital base. Group assets increased to NKr40.01bn from NKr34.08bn. Of total
assets, bonds accounted for 44.9 per cent, loans 33.9 per cent, equities 9.3
per cent and real estate 4.2 per cent. Vital's capital adequacy ratio was
put at 9.2 per cent of risk-weighted assets.
Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, explosives and plastics group,
said nine-month pretax profits improved to NKr234m from NKr133m in the same
period last year, helped by securities gains and low interest rates.
Group revenue rose by NKr49m to NKr6.07bn due to a stronger dollar and the
addition of businesses since last year.
Operating profit dipped by NKr17m to NKr298m as financial income increased
by NKr45m to NKr168m. Dyno cut financial expenses by NKr59m to NKr245m as
operating expenses rose by NKr442m to NKr5.38bn.

NATIONAL Petrochemical Corp, the Thai olefins producer, is planning to raise
some Dollars 64m by offering a 22.5 per cent stake in the company in the
latest initial public offering to be floated on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Asia), lead manager, said yesterday that NPC would
offer 70m new shares, of which between 27.5m and 31m would go to foreign
investors, bringing the total number of shares to 310m.
NPC produces ethylene and propylene, used as feedstock for the plastics
industry, at its upstream petrochemicals complex in Rayong on Thailand's
eastern seaboard. The offer price has not yet been set but stockbrokers in
Bangkok say the company plans to raise Bt1.5bn (Dollars 59.3m) to Bt1.7bn to
finance expansion of its plant.
The state Petroleum Authority of Thailand owns 49 per cent of the company,
with the rest held by local investors.

UAL and Delta
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of cost-cutting measures were reflected in the earnings of
United Airlines and Delta Airlines, two of the biggest US carriers, which
turned in sharply higher profits for the three months to September 30.
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, posted third-quarter net income
of Dollars 149m, or Dollars 5.74 a primary share. Excluding extraordinary
items, it earned Dollars 159m, or Dollars 6.16, in the latest quarter. This
compares with earnings of Dollars 6m, or 27 cents, in the same period of
1992.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, attributed the improved
performance to the company's stringent cost-controlling measures, and to
stronger revenues on its longer haul routes.
United's shorter haul operations faced intense competition from low-cost
competitors, and produced a loss in the quarter.
'Despite the third-quarter profits, we will report a loss in the fourth
quarter and for the year as a whole,' Mr Wolf said. UAL's operating income
soared to Dollars 281m in the quarter, from Dollars 49m a year earlier.
Operating revenues were 11.6 per cent higher at Dollars 3.99bn, while
operating expenses rose 5.2 per cent to Dollars 3.71bn.
Delta also attributed its improved performance to efforts to reduce
expenses. Like United and the other big US carriers, Delta has been hit by
tough competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. In
September it offered early retirement to 3,000 staff.
Delta said yesterday that it expects about 1,400 to join the plan, and that
it would take a charge of about Dollars 100m in the second quarter to cover
the programme's costs.
For its fiscal first quarter, Delta recorded net income of Dollars 60.4m, or
65 cents, compared with a net loss of Dollars 125.2m, or Dollars 3.07, last
year.
Delta's operating income for the latest quarter was Dollars 121.5m before
accounting changes, against a loss of Dollars 194.7m a year earlier.
Mr Ronald Allen, Delta's chairman, said: 'We can celebrate the improvement
but we can't relax.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indupa seeks protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUPA, a leading Argentine chemical company, has filed for protection from
bank creditors. It owes them Dollars 450m.
Indupa made the announcement after it decided not to sign a debt
rescheduling package with banks led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banco
Roberts, a local bank 30 per cent owned by Midland Bank.
The company's problems are blamed on poor management, high operating costs
and low prices for its bulk chemical commodities. Sales in the financial
year to June fell by one third to Dollars 64.3m and its net loss rose
slightly to Dollars 79.9m.
Argentine law offers troubled companies privileges similar to those under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law. The Argentine code stipulates no term
for debt repayment, but is under revision by the government.
One banker said: 'Indupa negotiated a rescheduling but then decided it was
unable to sign when it realised that a 5 per cent fall in prices would cost
it Dollars 9m a year in cashflow.'
Indupa shares have fallen by over a quarter since Wednesday.

MR LARS Ramqvist, chief executive of Ericsson, said yesterday the Swedish
telecommunications group was losing orders around the world because it
lacked the political connections of its American, Japanese and European
rivals.
'We could easily double our revenues today if we had the same political and
financial muscle as our competitors,' he said.
He said Ericsson, which holds about 40 per cent of the world mobile
telephone market, was having to spend about Dollars 2bn a year, or 22 per
cent of its sales, on research and development to keep up with fast-changing
telecommunications technologies and markets.
'Frankly, 22 per cent is too high a number,' he said. 'We are gambling that
we can expand the business enough to keep spending levels where they are.'
Ericsson has grown rapidly this year on the back of soaring mobile telephone
sales. It says it will double 1992 profits of SKr1.3bn (Dollars 160m). Its
share price has risen from SKr186 at the end of 1992 to more than SKr440,
greatly strengthening the group's financial position.
Ericsson also swallows more than half of Sweden's export credit support.
However, Mr Ramqvist warned that this was dwarfed by the financial and
political support its rivals had access to.
He said Ericsson emerged recently as the lowest bidder for a large public
fixed-telephone system in Saudi Arabia. Its bid of Dollars 1.7bn was below
those of AT&amp;T of the US, Northern Telecom of Canada, Germany's Siemens, and
Alcatel of France.
However, Mr Ramqvist said other factors such as political influence could
swing the contract away from Ericsson.
He complained that outsiders still did not have free access in many markets,
and were at a disadvantage in deals such as the Saudi contract, which
involved heavy offset conditions. Agreement in the Uruguay Round of talks
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was essential to Ericsson.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: US insurers lifted by absence of
catastrophes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US property/casualty insurers continued to benefit from the absence of big
catastrophe losses this year, helping both American International Group and
USF&amp;G report stronger earnings for the third quarter.
However, the absence of devastating claims, such as those a year ago
stemming from hurricane Andrew in the US, has prompted fears in some
quarters that catastrophe insurance premiums are set to fall again next
year.
Catastrophe losses at AIG amounted to Dollars 47.3m, compared with Dollars
153.3m a year before. The turnround helped the insurer to report
third-quarter net income of Dollars 451.1m or 1.42 a share, compared with
Dollars 338.9m or Dollars 1.06 a year ago.
USF&amp;G, in figures released on Tuesday, said property/casualty operating
profits had improved by Dollars 93m over a year before, with the 1992 figure
depressed by losses from hurricane Andrew. The insurer said net income had
risen to Dollars 20m in the latest period, from Dollars 5m.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, AIG's chairman, said catastrophe losses during the
third quarter stemmed mainly from flooding in the Midwest, the earthquake in
Guam and typhoons in Japan.
AIG has taken steps to 'reduce catastrophe exposures throughout our business
and further tighten our underwriting standards,' he said.
Higher reinsurance premiums for catastrophe business have attracted about
Dollars 4bn of new capital into Bermuda-based companies this year.
However, Mr Greenberg said: 'Even with this additional capacity, prices for
catastrophe reinsurance should remain stable.' He said that one year's
claims experience would not be enough on its own to drive down premiums.
However, other industry executives say the improved performance will make it
difficult for insurers to maintain catastrophe insurance premiums at current
levels when negotiating rates for next year.
The insurers' results were bolstered by rising premiums in general
property/casualty business. Mr Greenberg said premiums had firmed in many of
AIG's overseas markets, and rates in property and specialty casualty classes
had improved in the US.
Mr Norman Blake, chairman and chief executive of USF&amp;G, said the improved
underwriting environment had helped to lift profitability, 'despite the
industry-wide impact of lowered investment income due to interest rate
reductions and higher reinsurance costs'.
Pre-tax capital gains at AIG in the third quarter were Dollars 25.4m,
compared with Dollars 26.8m a year before.
Leaving aside capital gains and catastrophe losses, pre-tax income rose by
13.7 per cent compared with a year earlier, the company said. Gross revenues
climbed by 10 per cent to Dollars 5.12bn, as general insurance premiums rose
by 10 per cent and life insurance premiums were up 18 per cent.
AIG took a further Dollars 90m charge to cover an expected loss on
investments at AIG Financial Products, its derivatives unit.
This follows a Dollars 120m charge in the previous quarter.
The company, which has been one of the most ambitious and successful
derivatives businesses outside the banking industry, was rocked by the
departure of its founder, Mr Howard Sosin, earlier this year, along with
other senior managers.
Mr Greenberg said that most of the unit's core management group remained,
and that the business was 'going forward strongly'.
Pre-tax operating income in AIG's financial services businesses fell to
Dollars 98.7m, from Dollars 99.6m.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Unexpected advance at Xerox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
XEROX, the US document processing group which has consistently disappointed
Wall Street this year with its earnings performance, yesterday unveiled an
unexpected improvement in third-quarter earnings.
The news spurred active trading in Xerox shares, which climbed Dollars 5 to
Dollars 75 5/8 at mid-session.
Net income for the three months to September 30 rose 25 per cent to Dollars
150m, or Dollars 1.28 a primary share from Dollars 121m, or Dollars 1.07 the
previous year. Revenues were flat at Dollars 3.59bn.
Income from the core document processing business included a one-time tax
credit of Dollars 23m, or 22 cents which contributed to the unit's profits
of Dollars 148m, or Dollars 1.26 in the quarter. In the same period of last
year, Xerox earned Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.05 from document processing.
Stripping out the extraordinary gain, earnings from the business grew 6 per
cent in the latest quarter.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive, said equipment sales
increased in the third quarter after two quarters of decline. 'The increased
sales in part reflected benefits from the realignment of the US sales force
earlier this year and recent black-and-white copier introductions,' he said.
The disruption wrought by Xerox's unexpectedly lengthy reorganisation of its
sales force contributed to the company's poor performance earlier this year.
Looking ahead, Mr Allaire expects earnings to remain under pressure from
competitive pricing, a strong dollar and the economic environments in Europe
and Brazil.
For the first nine months, earnings from document processing rose to Dollars
384m, including a one-time Brazilian tax credit of Dollars 17m, compared
with Dollars 346m a year ago.
Net income for the first nine months was Dollars 451m or Dollars 4.01 a
share. A year earlier, Xerox posted a loss of Dollars 284m, or Dollars 3.49
including a special charge of Dollars 764m for accounting changes. Revenues
slipped to Dollars 10.42bn from Dollars 10.46bn.

<TEXT>
WEAK metal and forest-products prices pushed Noranda, the Canadian resources
group to a third-quarter loss.
The net loss was CDollars 8m (Dollars 6.1m), or eight cents a share,
compared with earnings of CDollars 26m, or six cents, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped to CDollars 1.29bn from CDollars 1.40bn.
The worst setback was in the mining and metals division, where last year's
earnings of CDollars 48m turned into a CDollars 10m loss.
The forest products division posted earnings of CDollars 10m, compared to
breaking even last year. A strong performance in the building materials
market was partly offset by a further fall in pulp prices. Noranda said it
expected no improvement in the pulp, newsprint or commodity papers market
until well into 1994.
Oil and gas earnings were virtually unchanged, with the stronger natural gas
market making up for a slide in oil prices and volumes.
Noranda, controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, earlier
this year sold its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast
forestry company.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fisher aims to give Kodak a
sharper focus - The appointment at the photographic group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Eastman Kodak, the troubled US photographic products company,
has achieved a big coup in wooing Mr George Fisher, the head of electronics
group Motorola, to be its new chairman.
For the 52-year-old Mr Fisher, whose appointment was announced late on
Wednesday night, is one of the most highly regarded managers in the US.
He has overseen a period of remarkable growth at Motorola which has turned
the company into a global leader in the cellular telephone and paging
markets and the world's fourth biggest chip maker.
At Kodak, he replaces Mr Kay Whitmore, ousted because of the company's
lacklustre financial performance.
His task will be to restore growth to a company facing mature markets and
increasing competition for its film products, while groping for a strategy
to cope with the global information revolution.
A short, articulate man with a modest manner and penchant for running five
or six miles a day, he has been chief executive of Motorola since 1988 and
chairman since 1990.
An engineer by background, with a doctorate in applied mathematics from
Brown University, he began his career in research and development at
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Bell Laboratories, one of the world's
foremost industrial R&amp;D labs, and joined Motorola in 1976.
He is one of the leading US proponents of total quality management - the
theory that businesses must concentrate on the highest quality in all
aspects of their operations, and in meeting customer needs. Motorola is
often held up as an example of the success that can be achieved through TQM.
He said yesterday that the fundamentals for success, be it at Motorola or
Kodak, included 'first and foremost, a focus on the customer, because they
are the people who pay the bills . . . if you get that right, almost
everything else follows.'
Companies had to focus on cycle times - how quickly they did everything -
and on leadership products: 'products that customers want, not just products
that technology can provide'.
He is well known in Washington as the outgoing chairman of the private
sector Council on Competitiveness, which has worked closely with the Clinton
Administration in developing its industrial and trade policies.
His departure from Motorola shocked that company and the US electronics
industry yesterday, prompting speculation over the reasons for his move.
After all, he spurned IBM's advances earlier this year when the troubled
computer company approached him about its chairmanship.
Mr Fisher himself explained that he saw Kodak as an extension of what he had
been doing at Motorola - helping a company accelerate the information
revolution.
Motorola was doing a great job building the wireless infrastructure for this
revolution and was on a tack he could see going forward successfully for
many years.
Kodak gave him the chance to get into the content side of the revolution
'and come out in five, 10, 15 years with a company as high growth and
exciting as Motorola is today'.
Some analysts felt that pay may have had much to do with his decision.
Mr Fisher played down this idea. However, he did acknowledge that Kodak
would be paying him much more than Motorola, provided it performed well.
'I'm betting that Kodak is going to perform very well.'
Analysts speculated that he might have been feeling pressure at Motorola to
make room for Mr Christopher Galvin, 43, the senior vice-president and
grandson of the company's founder.
He is widely expected to become chief executive - though not necessarily
immediately following Mr Fisher.
Mr Gary Tooker, the company's president, is to take over as interim chief
executive until the Motorola board decides on the succession.
Whatever the reasons for his departure, there is no doubting Mr Fisher's
track record at Motorola.
He has presided over five consecutive years of rapid sales and earnings
growth and the company's stock has appreciated at a compound rate of 26 per
cent.
Still, much of the credit for Motorola's success is often given to Mr
Fisher's predecessor, Mr Robert Galvin, the son of company founder Paul
Galvin and a dominant presence at the company as chairman of the board's
executive committee.

USDollars 900m.
Time Warner stock has risen from USDollars 38 in June to about USDollars 44
a share this week.
Mr Edgar Bronfman, senior chairman, said Seagram would invest about
USDollars 2bn for 15 per cent in Time Warner.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Argentina rejects call to help
Aerolneas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA has rejected demands by Iberia, Spain's national airline, that it
inject Dollars 215m into loss-making Aerolneas Argentinas, the privatised
carrier operated by Iberia.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said: 'The state will not make any
capital contribution to Aerolneas.' He told Iberia it should seek the
Dollars 500m in fresh capital it needs from Aerolneas's private
shareholders. Argentina's government still owns one third of Aerolneas.
The company lost over Dollars 200m in the financial year ending in June,
against Dollars 80m in 1992, contributing heavily to Iberia's severe losses
this year. Aerolneas said it needed new funds to make good losses and
finance acquisition of new aircraft, as required under its November 1990
privatisation contract.
However, Argentina's transport department said yesterday that 'if the
company has financial problems it should go bankrupt like any other
company'.
It added that if Aerolneas failed to comply with its privatisation contract,
the government would call in bank guarantees backing the investment plan.
Iberia owns 30 per cent of Aerolneas and the Argentine government 33 per
cent. Minority shareholders include two Spanish banks and several small
local investors. Employees own 10 per cent of the company, although this
stake is held in trust by the government.
The confrontation between Iberia and Mr Cavallo is the latest in a long
battle over Aerolneas that began with its privatisation three years ago,
when the Iberia-led consortium paid Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and debt for
equity swap for 85 per cent of the airline.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: French-US team eyes Matav stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE Telecom, the French state telecommunications utility, and US West,
the regional Bell operating company, are forming a consortium to bid for a
stake in Matav, Hungary's state telecommunications company.
The sale of the 30 per cent stake is expected to raise at least Dollars
420m, making it the biggest single privatisation in eastern Europe.
The two foreign companies have reached an agreement in principle and expect
to seal the tie-up today, according to France Telecom officials.
The consortium, led by France Telecom, will challenge front-runner Deutsche
Telekom, the state-owned German operator, which has teamed up with Cable &amp;
Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US.
Matav is the first state telecommunications utility to be sold in eastern
Europe. Advisers believe that the new Greek socialist government's halt to
that country's telecoms privatisation will lead international industry
investors to focus on Hungary. 'It is the only near-term game in town,' one
adviser said.
Preliminary bids are due on November 5 and contenders will have to make
final offers in early December if the transaction is to be closed, as
planned, by the end of the year.
Rivals of Telekom have held back because of a suspicion that the Hungarian
government, which has close relations with Bonn, favours the German company.
Hungarian officials have stressed that the race is open. But Telekom
recently missed winning one of two concessions to operate digital mobile
telephone networks, and some observers detected official hints that the
Matav stake would go to Telekom in compensation.
While the main battle appears to be between the French- and German-led
consortia, privatisation advisers point to interest from Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone of Japan. Eight companies are participating in the
due-diligence process.
France Telecom's consortium was to have included Stet, the Italian telecom
company, but the parties could not reach agreement over their relative
weights.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also
set to take a stake in Matav, and the EBRD board last week committed
Ecu52.7m (Dollars 46.3m) to purchase convertible preference shares. These
will be exchanged for ordinary shares at the price of the winning bid in the
main transaction.
Indications of intensifying competition are reassuring to Hungarian
officials, who have been worried that only the Telekom consortium would bid,
depressing Matav's price.
The privatisation tender specifies that the first Ft40bn (Dollars 420m) of
the proceeds will go to meet Matav's investment needs, but beyond that there
are no public guidelines.

FOND 92-94, one of Volvo's prominent institutional shareholders, said
yesterday that it would vote against the planned merger of the company's car
and truck operations with Renault, Christopher Brown-Humes writes.
Its board decided unanimously that the merger should not take place before
Renault had been privatised and had gained a market value.
Fond 92-94 has 2.5 per cent of the votes in Volvo and 2.8 per cent of the
capital. It is the first institution to declare its position since Volvo
published its merger prospectus earlier this week. Its decision was not
unexpected because of tensions between the fund's management and the Volvo
board.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Axa musters modest rise to
FFr831m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
AXA, the second largest French insurance group, mustered a modest increase
in net profits to FFr831m (Dollars 146.8m) in the first half of this year
from FFr813m in the same period of 1992, and confirmed that it was on course
for profits growth in the full financial year.
'We think that our results for 1993 should be slightly better than the
figures for 1992,' said Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, who also forecast an
improved performance in the second half from Equitable, the US insurer in
which Axa holds a 49 per cent stake.
Axa last year saw net profits fall sharply to FFr1.5bn from FFr2.4bn in
1991, because of the sluggish state of the French insurance market and a
disappointing performance from Equitable. The French group earlier this year
staged a FFr3.65bn convertible bond issue to strengthen Equitable's capital
position.
However, Mr Bebear said that the outlook for Equitable was improving.
The US associate contributed FFr430m to Axa's net profits during the first
half, due to a robust performance from its financial services operation and
reduced losses from its insurance interests.
Equitable also contributed FFr27.4bn to Axa's turnover during the first
half, thereby fuelling an overall increase in turnover of 85 per cent to
FFr64.8bn.
Mr Bebear said that Equitable represented 42 per cent of the group's
activity. 'We're turning into a company that's more American than French,'
he said.
Axa, like other French insurers, has been affected by the pressures of the
recession, although the competitive strains on the market are now easing.
Insurance profits slipped to FFr724m from FFr895m, but the group benefited
from brisk growth in financial services, due to Equitable, with net profits
rising to FFr636m from FFr289m.
Mr Bebear confirmed that Axa might be interested in GMF, the French mutual
insurance group, in order to expand its motor insurance business.
However, he said that 'right now Axa doesn't have a plan of action regarding
GMF', and that the two companies were not even in negotiations.

A fresh round of talks would be held next week, an Austrian Airlines
spokesman said. Swissair and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said they expected to
reach a conclusion in the next few weeks.
Press speculation in Holland, Scandinavia and Switzerland about a collapse
of the talks sent shares of KLM and Austrian tumbling 3 per cent yesterday,
while Swissair registered shares eased SFr8 to SFr694.
The partners had aimed to complete the negotiations, which began earlier
this year, by mid-September. However, it proved more difficult than expected
to resolve key issues, such as the relative valuations of the airlines and
the selection of directors and a headquarters location.
One of the toughest issues has been the selection of a US partner. KLM wants
Northwest Airlines, in which it has a 20 per cent stake, while Swissair is
arguing for Delta, with which it has a co-operation agreement.
On Tuesday, Mr Paul Reutlinger, marketing director of Swissair, said
Northwest was not a satisfactory partner, partly because of its financial
weakness and partly because it has only two hubs in the continental US.
'Swissair would not want to get into bed with a sickly partner,' Mr
Reutlinger said at a travel industry fair in Montreux. 'If Alcazar is to
become a worldwide carrier, the choice of a US partner must fall on Delta,'
he added.
A Swissair spokesman said these remarks did not mean that Swissair would
pull out of Alcazar if Delta was not selected. 'It only implies that we
prefer Delta. We are still negotiating on a US partner.'
The spokesman denied reports that Germany's Lufthansa had made an offer of
co-operation to Swissair.
He also played down Scandinavian reports indicating that Scandinavian
Airline System, the fourth partner in Alcazar, was losing interest in the
project. He attributed them partly to stresses arising from SAS's latest
rationalisation plans.

<TEXT>
CREDITANSTALT-Bankverein, Austria's second largest bank, said the Austrian
government has agreed to sell a large portion of its controlling
shareholding next year.
The bank would like the placing, which could be worth up to Sch6bn (Dollars
500m), to be spread widely among both domestic and international investors.
The government holds 49 per cent of the equity, but 70.5 per cent of the
voting power.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chief executive, said that timing would depend on
market conditions, but the issue would probably come shortly after the bank
reports its 1993 results in late April or early May.
The bank reported third quarter pre-tax profits up 47 per cent to Sch1.38bn
and forecast 'substantially improved' results for the full year.
The Creditanstalt preferred share has been among the most active and buoyant
on the Vienna Borse this year, and the group is now capitalised at about
Sch34bn.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, has made clear that the
government is eager to fully privatise the bank. But he wants at least one
large shareholder to take the government's place.
Last year, Mr Lacina held negotiations with General Electric of the US, and
earlier this year an abortive attempt was made to merge the bank with
Austria's Raiffeisen co-operative banking group.
If no such strong shareholder is found, the government may retain enough
shares after the placing to keep its voting control.
For the nine months, pre-tax profits were up 64.2 per cent to Sch3.7bn, but
the bank warned that its results in the first half of last year were
extremely depressed. Total assets at the end of September stood at
Sch530.6bn, down 4 per cent since the end of June.
Provisions for bad loans would again be high, but not as high as last year's
Sch5.66bn.

FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc plans to cut
dividend payment for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which is due
to be privatised within the next few weeks, plans to cut its dividend for
1993 and adopt a more conservative dividend policy over the medium term.
The company said that the percentage cut in the dividend for this year, to
be paid in 1994, is not expected to exceed the percentage decline in net
profits.
In an announcement last Sunday, Rhone-Poulenc indicated that net profits for
1993 would be about 30 per cent lower than the FFr1.52bn (Dollars 258m)
achieved in 1992.
Analysts in Paris forecast that the dividend for 1993 would be between FFr2
and FFr2.5, compared with the FFr3 per share paid last year, accounting for
a split of each share into four.
In the medium term, Rhone-Poulenc said its objective would be to reduce its
dividends to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent of earnings per share.
Market observers said they did not expect yesterday's announcement to affect
the privatisation issue. 'It is bad news, but we were expecting it' said Mr
Vincent Bazi, head of research at Barings Securities in Paris.
Mr Bazi said that Rhone-Poulenc was trying to present all its problems
before privatisation to avoid surprises and to bring the share price down to
a more attractive level for investors. Yesterday, shares in the group fell
FFr4 to FFr152.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, the company's chairman, has said that the Paris stock
market has risen faster than warranted by the outlook for corporate
earnings.
Rhone-Poulenc is facing what Mr Fourtou has described as the most difficult
chemicals market since the second world war and depressed demand for fibres
and polymers.
The Rhone-Poulenc issue, which is expected to raise between FFr15bn and
FFr16bn, is aimed principally at individual investors. Of the 79.3m shares
to be sold, 47.6m will go to a public share offering for French and EC
citizens and there will be a placement of 31.7m shares for French and
international institutional investors.

privatisation next year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government is aiming to privatise the merged Renault-Volvo
vehicle group in the second half of next year, according to Mr Gerard
Longuet, France's industry minister.
Mr Longuet's statement, in an interview in yesterday's Dagens Industri, a
Swedish financial daily, appeared to be aimed at reassuring Volvo
shareholders and union members who have voiced concerns about the merger and
the fact that there is no firm date for privatisation.
'The intention of the French government is not to 'nationalise' Volvo but to
privatise the new group as quickly as possible,' Mr Longuet said. 'If the
situation in the automobile industry stabilises then we have as our
objective privatisation in the second half of 1994.'
But he added that the merger between the French and Swedish car groups must
be implemented, as scheduled, from the beginning of next year for
privatisation to go ahead.
The merger agreement, concluded at the beginning of last month, has faced
strong opposition from small shareholders in Sweden, some union members and
much of the Swedish press. Their main criticisms are that the privatisation
schedule is too vague and that the valuations, which have given the
state-controlled French car group 65 per cent of the shares and Volvo 35 per
cent of the combined company, are unclear.
Earlier this week, 900 Volvo engineers called for the merger to be postponed
until the combined group is privatised. A committee representing 5,000
white-collar workers has also decided to vote against the deal at the
company's extraordinary general meeting on November 9.
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, has said there is an 'urgent
need' for the merged group to be privatised.
French industry ministry officials also clarified the terms of the 'golden
share' to be retained by the French government after privatisation.
The officials said that even in the event of a rupture in the shareholder
agreement between the two groups and the failure to privatise the group, the
French government could not use its golden share to force Volvo to reduce
its shareholding.
Volvo could, however, lose voting rights on shareholdings above 20 per cent
of the group.

Mr Peter Swales, chairman of Manchester City Football Club, yesterday
dismissed an approach for the Premier League club from a consortium led by
Mr Francis Lee, the former England international.
Speaking at the club's annual meeting, Mr Swales said a proposal from the
consortium was received on Tuesday.
'It contains a number of conditions and does not involve a proposed offer to
all shareholders,' he said.
It fell 'well short' of reflecting the full value of the club, Mr Swales
added.
He reiterated that other parties remained interested.
The club has appointed Henry Ansbacher to 'establish the nature of their
interest'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEZZANINE Capital &amp; Income Trust 2001, a split capital investment trust
which invests in US debt and unquoted equities, yesterday declared a 10 per
cent increase in its interim dividend to 5.5p.
The capital shares of the trust were the best performing of all investment
trust shares over the five years to October 1 with growth of 307.6 per cent
(mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested). The net asset value per
capital share rose by 7.1 per cent from 255.3p to 273.4p over the six months
to September 30.
The trust paid a special interim dividend of 4p during the first half
following the flotation of American Safety Razor, one of Mezzanine's highly
concentrated portfolio of investments. Mezzanine also realised its equity
holding in Custom Chrome, which supplies accessories for motor cycles.
In June, the trust, which is managed by Jordon Zalasnick Advisers, invested
Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) in LePage, a tape manufacturer.
Earnings per income share were 6.96p (5.22p) and net assets per income share
at the end of September were 122.7p.
The trust has an unusual split between the rights of capital and income
shareholders. The first 100p of assets goes to those who own capital shares;
the next 100p to income shares; after that 90 per cent goes to the capital
and 10 per cent to the income shareholders.

BRISTOL SCOTTS, which owns the Bristol Stadium and is involved in property
development and restaurants, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 500,000 to
Pounds 116,000 in the first half of 1993.
The result was achieved despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 4.31m (Pounds
5.09m).
Mr Anthony Kerman, chairman, said that most of the Eastgate Retail Park rent
reviews had been completed, with rents rising on average by 28 per cent. On
the residential side, the company intended to dispose of properties when the
time was right.
Greyhound racing and open markets continued to trade successfully but the
restaurant side continued in loss. Steps had been taken which Mr Kerman
anticipated would eliminate losses from that source by the year end.
Losses per share were reduced to 1.85p (9.07p).

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon gives way to W&amp;M's 300p offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERGORDON Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, yesterday bowed to the
inevitable and recommended shareholders to accept the offer from Whyte &amp;
Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands.
Mr James Miller, Invergordon's chairman, said the board still considered
that the offer price of 300p failed to recognise the strategic value to W&amp;M
of the business.
However, control of the company had passed to W&amp;M which, with its purchase
of a 13.5 per cent stake from Fleming Investment Management, had raised its
shareholding to 54.7 per cent.
'It is unfortunate, therefore, that in all the circumstances the board has
to recommend shareholders to accept the offer rather than remain in a
minority position.'
After discussions between Invergordon and W&amp;M, the offer has been amended to
include a loan note alternative which may provide shareholders with an
opportunity to defer any UK capital gains tax payable.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, Mr Geoffrey Whittaker, sales and
marketing director, and Mr Edward Pickard, finance director, who in total
hold about 7m shares, or 5.5 per cent of the company, intend to accept the
offer.
It is not yet clear whether any of the three, who are employed on three-year
rolling contracts, will remain with Invergordon.
Mr Greig, who has led the group since the 1988 management buy-out from
Hawker Siddeley, said yesterday: 'If I were to be offered an opportunity to
make a worthwhile contribution to the future of the group, I would give it
full consideration.'
Five directors, nominated by W&amp;M, will be appointed to the Invergordon board
next week. Mr Miller said that he and two other non-executive directors
would resign as soon as they were satisfied they had discharged their
responsibilities.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Country Casuals declines to Pounds 117,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRY CASUALS, the women's wear group that in April acquired one of its
suppliers - House of Lerose - in a Pounds 10.8m agreed offer, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 405,000 to Pounds 117,000 for the
six months to July 24.
Mr John Shannon, chairman, said the downturn was largely due to the current
economic environment and the costs associated with the setting up of the
Wild Women chain - now trading as Koto.
Turnover, boosted by an Pounds 832,000 contribution from new operations,
grew to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 14.8m). The pre-tax outcome was bolstered by
net interest income up from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 108,000.
Mr Shannon said the group retained a strong balance sheet, with a net cash
posi-tion after borrowings of Pounds 3.2m.
An interim dividend of 1.41p is declared, uncovered by earnings per share of
0.41p (1.88p).
The Country Casuals spring/summer collection was launched in a difficult
economic environment, Mr Shannon said, and for the first time the company
had seen its core customer base reacting to the recession by purchasing
fewer units per transaction.
However, the autumn/winter collection had made a good start, with a high
level of sales growth compared with that of last year.
The Wild Women chain was formed in the final quarter of last year as a 100
per cent subsidiary of Country Casuals with Ted Baker supplying merchandise
and design. However, the 'aspirations of the two parties proved
incompatible', Mr Shannon said, which caused operational problems in the
shops.
The design and supply of merchandise has now been brought in-house and the
name changed to Koto, said Mr Shannon, and stock throughput had increased
dramatically.
The Elvi brand was targeted for expansion over the next 18 months with a
further 20 to 30 shops planned, while the Lerose Manufacturing busi-ness was
also trading well, he said.
The company planned, however, to run down the wholesale operations of Lerose
to concentrate on the group's main objective of brand retailing. It was also
intended to dispose of or close the textile printing operation in the
Netherlands.

THOMAS COOK, the world's largest travel agency, has expanded in Germany with
the purchase of Auto-Fischer, a leisure travel company operating in the
north-west of the country.
Thomas Cook, which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, would not

It said that the move was part of a strategy to expand in continental Europe
generally, particularly in Germany, regarded as a core market, and also in
Switzerland, Sweden and France.
The company said it regarded these as 'key markets' for expansion.
The acquisition will add 28 offices to Thomas Cook's overall operation which

<TEXT>
ICI AUSTRALIA, the chemical group controlled by Imperial Chemical
Industries, announced increased profits and dividends after a year of
restructuring.
The company lifted net profits by 39 per cent, from ADollars 85.4m to
ADollars 118.9m (Pounds 50.5m), in the year to September on turnover ahead
from ADollars 2.77bn to ADollars 2.83bn. The annual dividend goes up from 18
cents to 23 cents.
Directors said the result came against a background of low economic activity
in the company's main markets. 'The improved profitability reflects the
ongoing benefits of restructuring and of increased productivity,' they said.
'Trading conditions in 1994 are likely to be similar to those of the past
year, with most markets reflecting continued modest recovery. Improvement in
prices for some key products, notably plastics, depends on recovery in
international markets.'
The plastics division reduced its pre-tax loss from ADollars 35m to ADollars
24m, with chemicals operations lifting their contribution from ADollars 73m
to ADollars 90m, but fertilisers easing from ADollars 34m to ADollars 32m.
The consumer products division increased profits from ADollars 124m to
ADollars 139m. The overall result was after tax of ADollars 65.6m (ADollars
53.9m). Depreciation took ADollars 117.9m (ADollars 126.6m) and net interest
payable was down from ADollars 40.9m to ADollars 36.9m.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Asset value rises at Scottish Mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Mortgage, one of the 'big ten' international investment trusts,
reported an 11.7 per cent increase in net asset value, from 220.3p to
246.1p, over the six months to September 30.
The Baillie Gifford managed trust declared an unchanged interim dividend of
1.35p but the directors said they hoped to declare a final to at least
maintain the real (inflation-adjusted) level of last year's total.
Last year, the company borrowed money to invest in a portfolio of gilts and
Bulldog bonds. To date, it has enjoyed a positive income stream and has made

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pathfinder puts Pounds 30m price tag on
Lilliput
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLIPUT GROUP, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of miniature hand painted
cottages, is expected to have a market capitalisation of more than Pounds
30m when it is floated next month.
The flotation is expected to raise about Pounds 20m, made up of Pounds 3m of
new money and Pounds 17m for the existing shareholders.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said Pounds 1.5m of the new
money would be used to redeem preference and deferred shares. After Pounds
500,000 of expenses, about Pounds 1m would be left to fund future growth.
Mr John Russell, chairman and chief executive, said the company was likely
to report operating profits of close to Pounds 3m in the year to January 2.
Last year operating profit was Pounds 2.13m on turnover of Pounds 13.6m.
Lilliput was founded by Mr David Tate, now the technical director, in 1982.
It ran into difficulties through diversification, and in 1990 was rescued
with Pounds 1.2m of venture capital.
North of England Ventures and investors headed by Lazard Ventures own 50 per
cent of the company, Mr Tate and his family 29.9 per cent, other directors
15 per cent and other investors 6 per cent.
The two venture capital groups are expected to realise Pounds 8m from the
flotation and retain a 20 to 25 per cent stake. Mr Tate will have 10 per
cent of the company and realise Pounds 5.5m. Other directors will keep a 6
per cent stake.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Regal Hotel reduces deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ITS first set of results since undergoing a restructuring in December
1992, Regal Hotel Group, the USM-quoted hotel operator, reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 403,000 for the half year to July 4 against losses of
Pounds 663,000.
Stripping out the results of Bramhope, its wholly owned trading company
which had been ring-fenced, the losses are Pounds 181,000, representing
Regal's continuing operations.
The company said it had ceased to treat Bramhope as a subsidiary with effect
from March 25 in accordance with FRS 2.
Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman, said the acquisitions, Catermax and
Woodmount, contributed to the accounts from March 24 and Dudley Hotels from
May 11. He added that the second half should see an acceleration of the
acquisition programme.
Turnover was Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.5m), with ongoing activities
contributing Pounds 674,000. Losses per share fell to 0.17p (6.2p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Ramco Oil Services improved from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 297,000
pre- tax over the six months to June 30. Turnover slipped by Pounds 300,000
to Pounds 2.57m.
Directors of the USM-quoted energy services group said there were
contrasting performances from the operating companies.
'Excellent' figures from the Ramco Alnas associate were partly offset by
weaker results from the tubular services activities overseas, in particular
the pipeline business.
They added that the tubular services arm was to relocate to new premises at
Badentoy, which they believed would improve its competitive position in the
UK.
Associates contributed Pounds 143,000 (took Pounds 11,000) to first half
profits. Earnings per share emerged at 1.27p (0.95p).
The shares dipped 5p to 150p.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze clocks up Pounds 1.53m for
the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANGANESE BRONZE Hold-ings, the maker of London taxi cabs, returned to the
black in the year to end-July with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.53m, compared
with losses last time of Pounds 2.5m.
The shares closed 17p ahead at 114p.
Profits on continuing operations last year were Pounds 498,000. The loss was
struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.73m for the closure of the
Darlington foundry, which lost Pounds 898,000.
Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said he was pleased with the results
relative to the previous year, but believed the group, which had an overall
turnover of Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 71.2m), could do better in future.
Profits in the vehicles division in particular could make a significant
contribution to profits in the coming year, he said. The division edged into
the black with Pounds 39,000 on turnover of Pounds 41m, compared with a
previous loss of Pounds 310,000 on turnover of Pounds 40.7m.
The turnround had been achieved through cost cutting and improved
efficiency. The group had been making 36 taxis a week since August 1 after
12 months of making only 32 vehicles a week. In 1990 it was making 60 taxis
a week.
Mr Borwick said the taxi business appeared to be coming out of recession. He
was confident that the taxi licensing review announced on Wednesday would
not be detrimental to sales.
The Deans Powered Doors division, which makes doors for buses and trains,
also returned to the black, making Pounds 2,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.1m,
compared with a loss of Pounds 1.24m on turnover of Pounds 4.9m. Mr Borwick
attributed the recovery to a new management team.
Profits in the components division, which supplies bearings and precision
castings to the automotive industry, eased from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds
1.81m, on turnover up from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 25.1m.
Total net interest paid dipped from Pounds 327,000 to Pounds 320,000.
Earnings per share were 6.04p (12.27p loss). A final dividend of 2p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 2.5p (1p).

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Companies seek index reclassification -
Unhappiness over allocations to FT-SE Actuaries share quotation sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOZENS OF companies have written to the FT-SE Actuaries Industry
Classification Committee objecting to the sectors or sub-sectors they have
been put in under the new classification system announced last month.
Companies have until the end of this month to make submissions asking for a
change.
Among leading groups which are understood to have asked for reconsideration
are Rank Organisation, RTZ, Inchcape and BTR. Many of the letters are
suggesting relatively minor changes, for example a move between sub-sectors,
or asking for a change of a sector name.
The new classification system will come into effect at the start of 1994. It
involves three tiers, economic groups, sectors and sub-sectors. Indices for
economic groups and sectors are published daily.
For the first time the ground rules for deciding how companies will be
placed in sectors were published. Essentially, they are allocated according
to the business from which they derive most of their profits.
Companies believe that the sector or sub-sector they are put in can affect
their share rating. They also fear that if included in a sector which they
regard as wrong for them they may be followed by stock market analysts
unfamiliar with their business.
One investment manager, who is a large shareholder in Inchcape, said
yesterday: 'The sector makes a considerable difference to the rating, and
eventually to the cost of future equity finance'.
However, one broker who has made a study of share price movements following
sector reclassifications, said yesterday: 'I can't find any evidence
supporting the theory that stocks are re-rated after moving sector.'
In a strongly worded letter to the committee, Sir David Plastow, chairman of
Inchcape, said the group was 'deeply concerned' by its classification in the
'retailers, vehicle distributors' sector and wants to shift to
conglomerates. He says only 14 per cent of group profits come from retailing
cars, although this is aggregated in the group's accounts with profits from
motor importing and distribution, to form 46 per cent of total profits.
Further, Inchcape is much larger than other companies in the sub-sector, and
would tend to distort the sector's performance. Another company in the
sector is understood to have asked the committee not to include Inchcape for
that reason.
Rank Organisation has been placed in the office machinery sub-sector of the
electronic and electrical equipment sector. This is because more than half
Rank's pre-tax profits, according to the classification system, are derived
from its Rank Xerox associate.
Mr Nigel Turnbull, finance director, said Rank should be included in
leisure, because of its interests such as Butlins holiday camps and bingo
clubs, rather than office machinery.
The group does not provide a split of pre-tax profits between activities,
but Mr Turnbull said it was a question of how interest on the group's debt
was allocated between its businesses. The committee has not attributed any
to the Rank Xerox activities. Further, Rank Xerox, as an associate, is not
directly managed by Rank.
RTZ is unhappy to be included in the copper mining sub-sector, although
broadly content in the extractive industries sector. RTZ said it was
impossible to say what proportion of profits came from copper, but the metal
accounted for less than 20 per cent of sales.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gerrard declines 27% despite
diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERRARD &amp; NATIONAL, the financial group which owns a City discount house,
yesterday announced a 27 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits reflecting
depressed earnings in its traditional money market and gilt trading
activities.
Gerrard, which disclosed interim figures for the first time in line with the
European Community second banking directive, said profits had fallen to
Pounds 10.4m, against Pounds 14.4m, in the half year to October 5.
It said that the results showed its four-year-old strategy of diversifying
into broking operations in securities and money markets was having the
desired effect of smoothing out volatility in traditional marketmaking
activities.
Pre-tax profits of the trading division, which includes the Gerrard &amp;
National Limited discount house and Gerrard &amp; National Securities, the
gilt-edged marketmaker, fell to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 8.1m), and its earnings
per share fell to 4p (13.7p).
Mr Brian Williamson, chairman, said discount house profits had fallen
sharply to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 5.3m) because the first half of last year
had been boosted by the UK's exit from the ERM and the subsequent interest
rate volatility which increased money market trading.
The broking division, which includes the GNI Holdings futures and options
brokerage, Gerrard Vivian Gray, the stockbroker, and LM (Moneybrokers), the
stock lender and borrower, reported a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.7m
(Pounds 3m).
Mr Williamson said he expected the broking division to achieve this year's
target of covering the holding company's dividend without recourse to the
trading division's profits.
The broking division's earnings per share were 10.6p (8.5p) and overall
earnings per share were 14.6p (22.2p). The interim dividend is maintained at
6p.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wellcome improves 46% to Pounds 667m -
Special factors rather than strong growth behind profits surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S 11 per cent plunge in the shares of Wellcome, to 712p, came
despite a very strong rise in annual profits, dividends and cash.
However, the increase in earnings per share of 61 per cent was heavily
affected by special factors.
The adoption of the new FRS 3 accounting standard depressed the previous
year's profits by Pounds 47.7m, made up of losses previously counted as
extraordinary.
In addition, the comparison was heavily affected by last year's devaluation
of sterling. In underlying terms, Wellcome said, earnings per share were up
only 9 per cent on sales up 7 per cent.
Reported pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 667m, up 46 per cent, on
sales of Pounds 2.04bn. In real terms, the pre-tax increase was 9 per cent.
The full year dividend was raised by 33 per cent, while Wellcome's cash
mountain rose 38 per cent to Pounds 567m.
Underlying growth in Wellcome's two most profitable drugs, the herpes
treatment Zovirax and the controversial Aids drug Retrovir, slowed sharply.
Sales of Zovirax, at Pounds 760m, were up 11 per cent in real terms compared
to 24 per cent the year before. Sales of Retrovir, at Pounds 248m, were up
only 3 per cent in underlying terms, compared to a rise of 22 per cent in
the previous year.
In several markets, sales were held back by government efforts to control
healthcare costs. In the US, underlying sales growth was 4 per cent, while
there was a real contraction of 4 per cent in Germany. However, real sales
were up 16 per cent in both France and Italy, and by 11 per cent in Japan.
Group investment in R&amp;D increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 326m. Some 41 per
cent of the total R&amp;D spend was on research into antivirals and other
anti-infectives. Clinical studies on two novel anti-herpes compounds,
Valtrex and Zonavir, continued.
Wellcome said the results to date continue to support its belief that both
compounds may offer clinical advantages over Zovirax.
Also in late phase clinical trial are 51W, a drug used to relax muscles
before and during surgery, and Navelbine, an anti-cancer compound licenced
from Pierre Fabre Medicament for marketing in North America. Wellcome filed
a new drug application for Navelbine in August in the US.
Projects in the earlier stages of clinical trials include 311C, a potential
treatment for acute migraine attacks, RhothRx, which has been licensed from
CytRx to establish its potential as a therapy in the treatment of heart
attacks, and 619C, a potential treatment for conditions including strokes
where the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS representing 12 per cent of the equity of International
Communication &amp; Data have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting of the
company to consider board changes.
The notice was issued to ICD by the PSB Group's advisers and was signed on
behalf of various nominee companies holding a total of 6.87m ICD shares (12
per cent).
PSB is proposing resolutions for the removal from the ICD board of Mr David
Cicurel, chairman, Mr Ralph Elman, finance director, and Mr Daniel Unger,
non-executive director.
If the resolutions are passed, Mr S Kingsland, Mr J Self and Mr J Porter
would be appointed to the board, thus giving the PSB candidates control of
ICD's board.
The ICD directors, who hold 2.5 per cent of the shares and are being advised
by Dawnay Day, will recommend shareholders to vote against the proposed
resolutions.
They said they would 'resist PSB's attempt to take board control without
making a general offer to all shareholders.'
Notice of the requisitioned meeting will be sent to ICD shareholders in due
course.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Broadgate sells EBRD leasehold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROADGATE PROPERTIES has sold for Pounds 170m cash its long leasehold
interest in One Exchange Square, home of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in the Broadgate development near London's
Liverpool Street station.
The purchaser of the 999-year leasehold interest is Deutsche Grundbesitz
Investmentgesellschaft. Jones Lang Wootton, who advised the German
investment group, believes the sale to be the largest individual property
investment transaction in London for more than two years.
The building comprises 360,000 sq ft of office accommodation and 12 retail
units. The EBRD leases the office space for a rent of Pounds 14.4m a year,
not including ground rent to British Rail, the freeholder.
Broadgate Properties said the effective value of the sale was worth a total
of Pounds 179m to the company. The property had a book value of Pounds 165m
on its last audited consolidated balance sheet in June 1992.
The company will use the proceeds to repay in full the bank mortgage of
Pounds 135m on the property and add to working capital. After the sale total
debts will be about Pounds 750m, down from Pounds 1.2bn a year ago.
Broadgate Properties is 50 per cent owned by Stanhope Properties, which
continues to trade, and 50 per cent by administrative receivers called in
last year by Rosehaugh, the joint developer of the Broadgate complex.
Broadgate is also thought to have either let or have under offer 350,000 sq
ft at its Ludgate development near St Paul's Cathedral. It said yesterday
that once the 500,000 sq ft development was let it would be close to
breaking even.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti doctor gives up on his patient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FERRANTI's head office at London's Millbank yesterday, Mr Eugene Anderson
was stoical in defeat. A company doctor brought in in an attempt to save
Ferranti three and a half years ago, he had just agreed to sell the company
to GEC for a nominal 1p per share.
'There are several roots to Ferranti's downfall,' he said. 'One was firmly
Jim Guerin' - the now jailed boss of International Signal and Control, a
fraudulent US defence company which Ferranti made the disastrous mistake of
buying in 1987.
'Another is the fact that the defence business went south. We could have
probably handled either by itself, or even the fact that the com-pany wasn't
as well run as it should have been. But I'm not blaming anybody. I've been
here for three and a half years, and we should have turned it around.'
The basic problem, he said, was straightforward. 'The company has been
progressively weakened as losses have mounted. The only way out was through
additional business. But the weaker we got, the less credible we were in
bidding for big contracts. If you're trying to bid for a Pounds 100m
contract with net worth of Pounds 45m, you're bound to raise an eyebrow or
two.'
One such Pounds 100m contract was the so-called Delmon Eye deal, involving
an early warning system for Bahrain. In the past week, Mr Anderson said,
'we've been advised that we would have to re-price and re-scope that. The
last time we were told that, it took six months to get it back into the
Kingdom and onto the appropriate authority's desk.'
Ferranti did not have that long. The obvious question is who decided that:
the banks, for instance? No, Mr Anderson said. 'We had not breached any
covenants. But the board took the view that we had the responsibility to
trade lawfully. We could see that in the absence of major additional
business, we were coming up against a brick wall.'
Therefore, he said, there was no alternative to GEC's offer. 'The
fundamental business of Ferranti needs some finance and confidence put into
it. By this method, we'll save the bulk of the jobs. The shareholders suffer
badly, and I'm sad about that. The alternative would have been disastrous.'
So what happens to the company doctor now? Has he had any personal
undertakings from GEC? Absolutely not, he said. 'There has been no
discussion of my job or any of the other board members. It wouldn't have
been appropriate.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Honeysuckle climbs 8%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HONEYSUCKLE Group, the USM-quoted designer of women's wear, reported an 8
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 720,435 to Pounds 781,586 for
the year to May 31.
The improvement came from turnover up by Pounds 2m to Pounds 15.8m. Earnings
came out at 6.9p (6.3p) and an increased final dividend of 1.5p is proposed,
making a 2.25p (1p) total.
Mr David Serr, chairman, said growth in business was encouraging, if patchy,
and an extremely healthy start to the winter season had been only slightly
tempered by a recent slowdown in the retail sector.
The chairman added that orders for spring 1994 had exceeded expectations and
he was, again, projecting increased turnover and profits.

FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Danka turns in 91% advance to
Pounds 13.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANKA BUSINESS Systems, the acquisitive office equipment supplier which is
based in the US and quoted in London, yesterday reported a 91 per cent jump
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m, largely due to exchange rates
and a string of acquisitions.
The surge in profits for the six months to September 30 was achieved on the
back of a 90 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 141.1m
In dollar terms, Danka's pre-tax profits rose by 54 per cent to Dollars
18.9m. Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the group had shown a 16 per cent
increase in dollar sales and profits before acquisitions.
Danka paid Pounds 36m for 13 companies during the half year, including its
first company in the UK, which contributed total operating profits of Pounds
1.2m and sales of Pounds 21.2m. The acquisitions resulted in a Pounds 22m
goodwill write off, increasing the drain on reserves from Pounds 24.8m to
Pounds 46.9m.
Net assets declined from Pounds 21.2m to Pounds 19.2m, partly due to an
increase in stocks and debtors. Mr Mark Vaughan Lee, chairman, said Danka
had built stocks when prices rose due to exchange rate movements. However,
he said, the group was confident it would be able to maintain operating
margins.
The group has cash of Dollars 8m, and no short term debt, following this
month's Dollars 86m share issue and a refinancing of longer-term borrowings.
At the end of September, Danka had long-term debt of Pounds 69.3m (Pounds
11.4m).
Danka doubled its interim dividend from 0.375p to 0.75p. Earnings rose by 34
per cent to 4.1p.

<TEXT>
CREST PACKAGING has priced its flotation at 135p a share, giving the
flexible packaging and cartons group a market value of Pounds 54m.
The float is by way of a placing of 10.6m shares, 26.5 per cent of the
total.
The shares are being sold by directors and their families. Mr Rodney Webb,
his wife and family trusts are selling 9.01m shares, raising Pounds 12.2m.
Mr Webb and his family were 85 per cent shareholders before the float and
will have 62.5 per cent afterwards.
In all, directors and their families will own 73.5 per cent of the shares.
Employees have asked to buy 222,418 shares in the placing.
No new shares are being issued; the company's costs relating to the placing

At the issue price the shares are on a p/e of 16.8 on the year to end-April,
when pro forma earnings were 8.04p a share.
A notional dividend of 3.65p would have given a gross yield of 3.4 per cent,
covered 2.2 times by earnings.
Dealings in the new shares are due to start November 4.

FT  29 OCT 93 / ICI reports sharp profits rise since Zeneca demerger:
Exchange rate gains and cost cutting bring benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI'S first quarterly results since the demerger of Zeneca in June revealed
a sharp improvement in profits due largely to exchange gains following
sterling's devaluation and cost-cutting that started three years ago.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the UK's biggest chemicals company,
welcomed the improvement but said prices remained under pressure across the
business.
ICI's third-quarter pre-tax profit on continuing operations rose to Pounds
73m, up from Pounds 22m, on sales 19 per cent higher at Pounds 2.17bn.
Profits for the nine months rose to Pounds 240m from Pounds 168m on sales up
13 per cent at Pounds 6.35bn.
Earnings per share in the quarter were 5.8p, compared with 0.5p, and 18.2p
for the nine months, up from 11.7p.
Sir Denys said the group had benefited from more competitive exchange rates
and the benefits of rationalisation and cost-cutting that has included the
slimming of the workforce by 30 per cent since 1991.
ICI's shares rose 13p to 718p as the results came in above expectations.
Some analysts, however, said they were concerned the market was taking too
much recovery in product prices for granted in its assumption that profits
by 1996 could be between Pounds 800m and Pounds 1bn.
There was also some concern at the extent of the currency effect, which
could not be repeated next year, and questions over to what extent the group
would be able to continue squeezing savings through its so-called
'self-help' cost-cutting programme.
Mr Colin Short, finance director, said ICI had benefited from Pounds 80m of
currency gains in the nine-month period but that Pounds 75m of that had been
lost because of pricing pressures.
In the first nine months ICI had also made savings of Pounds 260m as a
result of the self-help measures begun in 1991. The cost-cutting and
rationalisation remained central to ICI's continuing profitability and the
group would continue to push towards becoming the most efficient and
lowest-cost producer.
On group prospects, prices remained under pressure in all business sectors.
The group was experiencing steady but unexciting recovery in the US and
difficult trading conditions in continental European markets.
Nine-month trading profits in paints fell after strong growth in Asia
Pacific was offset by difficult conditions in North America and Europe.
Materials profits rose strongly as volumes recovered. Explosives' results
were flat while industrial chemicals profits more than doubled as volumes
increased.

FT  29 OCT 93 / GM cuts its net loss to Dollars 113m in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, which is battling to return its US vehicle operations to
profit, yesterday reported a Dollars 113m (Pounds 76.5m) third-quarter net
loss after adding Dollars 950m pre-tax to reserves for its extensive North
American plant closing programme.
The third quarter saw the group significantly cut losses in the North
American vehicle market, though these remain heavy. Internationally, a
strong performance in Latin America offset lower profits in recession-hit
Europe.
Wall Street analysts said the figures were surprisingly strong and showed
steady progress in turning around North America. GM shares closed up Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 49.
The net loss, which is equivalent to 49 cents a share, compared with a loss
of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.86 a share, in the same period of 1992. Sales
and revenues rose 2.4 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 30.2bn.
The latest results were affected by three special items. One was the plant
closings charge, announced on Monday, which worked through at Dollars 589m
after tax. Another was a Dollars 144m charge for costs relating to the new
labour contract the company agreed with the United Auto Workers union over
the weekend. These Dollars 733m of charges were partly offset by the Dollars
444m positive effect of a change in the US corporate income tax rate.
GM's troubled North American automotive operations produced a net loss of
Dollars 1.12bn, including special items, down from a loss of Dollars 1.88bn
last year. The company believed its North American operations could
break-even in 1993.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Fisher pictures Kodak at heart of media revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Fisher, who surprised Wall Street on Wednesday by moving from the
chairmanship of Motorola to head Eastman Kodak, said yesterday he had
accepted the job because of the important role Kodak could play in the
information revolution.
His appointment as chairman and chief executive of Kodak sent the company's
stock soaring yesterday, and it closed up Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 63 5/8 in
New York.
Mr Fisher is one of the most highly regarded managers in the US, and
analysts saw his combination of technological expertise and team-building
skills as positive for Kodak, which has been suffering from lacklustre
financial results and a bureaucratic, self-absorbed culture.
Shares in Motorola, the semi-conductor and mobile communications equipment
maker, dipped Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 104 1/4 .
The company, which was taken by surprise by Mr Fisher's move, appointed Mr
Gary Tooker, its president, as interim chief executive.
Mr Fisher said he was attracted to Kodak because of the role it could play
in the 'content', or imaging side of the information revolution, which is
bringing together the computer, media and communications sectors in one
large industry.
Kodak, he said, had a 'a franchise and a market position second to none in
the world on the content side of the information revolution'. He said
profitability and return on assets had to improve, while the company also
needed to cut its large debt burden.
He envisaged the company's photographic imaging and healthcare businesses as
'dual pillars of future growth'. He did not intend to sell the healthcare
business, but said there were 'pockets' of business across the group which
might be divested.
Mr Fisher declined to give details of his pay package, but acknowledged it
was 'generous'. Last year Motorola gave him Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 990,000) in
pay and bonuses, relatively modest for such a successful US company.
Mr Roberto Goizueta, the chairman of Coca-Cola and the non-executive
director of Kodak who led the search for a new chairman, said Mr Fisher had
been top of the list of candidates drawn up by Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the
executive search firm.
Kodak began the hunt in August when the board forced the resignation of Mr
Kay Whitmore, chairman since 1990, for not moving decisively enough to
improve its performance.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Tiphook may seek to reschedule bond interest payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the UK container leasing and transport rental group, is facing a
key decision regarding its US bondholders, some of whom are threatening to
sue the loss-making group.
The company, which is trying renegotiate new covenants with its bankers, is
due on Monday to pay interest payments on two tranches of unsecured debt,
worth a total of Dollars 350m (Pounds 239m), which Tiphook issued in the US
within the past year.
Tiphook yesterday declined to confirm or deny that the interest payments
would be made. Meetings are still being held with the group's bankers, who
now have an update on Tiphook's finances prepared by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
group's auditors.
Bond market specialists said Tiphook could take advantage of a '30-day
grace' period allowed for payment in the US, but any decision will be
closely scrutinised for clues as to how the group will be refinanced.
US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m in the past year, fear
that any restructuring dictated by the banks could be at the bondholders'
expense.
It is understood that the talks with Tiphook's bankers, led by NatWest, are
'moving along' and that the aim is to reschedule debt and keep the present
financing structure intact, suggesting the interest payments will be met.
Tiphook did pay the interest due on another Dollars 350m tranche of US debt
issued in March. The payment was made on September 15, but that was before
the company warned this month it would breach its bank covenants.
Lehman Bros, the US securities house, declined to comment on rumours that
might sue Tiphook. Lehman acted as lead underwriter in March and April on
separate Tiphook debt issues worth Dollars 550m.
Lehman is likely to face litigation from US funds, who saw the Tiphook debt
downgraded to so-called junk-bond status within months of issue.
In a statement last night, it said: 'Lehman Brothers made markets in the
securities until October 5, when it became restricted from engaging in any
secondary market-making activity. Since that time, Lehman Brothers has been
acting only in capacity as agent. Lehman Brothers is certainly aware of the
situation at Tiphook and is closely monitoring developments at the company.'
Lehman declined to elaborate on why it had become restricted from trading in
Tiphook's bonds.

FT  29 OCT 93 / GEC in 1p per share bid for Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD WEINSTOCK extended his grip on the UK defence industry yesterday with
confirmation that his company, GEC, is the mystery bidder for Ferranti
International. The agreed offer will cost GEC a minimum of Pounds 110m, of
which Pounds 10m will go to Ferranti's shareholders and the rest to its
banks.
Ferranti's board defended the token 1p per share bid on the grounds that the
company had no alternative. Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, said a large
prospective deal with Bahrain, the Delmon Eye contract, had run into delays
within the past week. 'When it became clear the order wasn't coming in
within days or weeks, it was a question of doing a deal like this or calling
in the receivers,' he said.
Mr Anderson said he had been talking to Lord Weinstock about various
possible deals for at least a year. 'He has been interested in parts of
Ferranti from the beginning, and has already bought several of them,' he
said. 'This is the final piece.'
GEC would not specify how much of Ferranti it intended to keep, beyond
saying it was interested in its systems for naval combat and air defence,
and its sonar and simulator business. It dismissed speculation that it would
gain access to Ferranti's Pounds 100m pension fund surplus. Mr David
Newlands, GEC finance director, said: 'The pension fund is the pension fund.
It would be a matter for the trustees.'
GEC said its bid might depend upon it gaining 90 per cent of the shares,
then it could compulsorily buy the rest. Mr Newlands said: 'We may have to
reorganise some of the businesses, and that can be difficult when you have
minority shareholders.'
Since the 1p offer was announced on Tuesday, there has been a heavy turnover
of Ferranti shares at prices up to 4p. They fell 2 3/4 p to 1 3/4 p
yesterday.
Mr Anderson said he was concerned that shareholders might be led by
'complacency or apathy' to hold out against GEC's offer. 'This way
shareholders suffer badly, and I'm sad about that,' he said. 'But 1p is
better than no p'
One large institutional shareholder said it was 'slightly resigned' to the
deal, adding 'what are you going to do if the board calls you up and tells
you that you accept the offer or the liquidators are called in?'

FT  29 OCT 93 / Worry over Wellcome's sales growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS marked down shares in Wellcome, the UK-based international drugs
group, by 11 per cent yesterday in response to a 46 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits, a one-third rise in the dividend and Pounds 157m rise in the cash
mountain to Pounds 567m.
Analysts expressed concern about a sharp slowing in the underlying rate of
sales growth. Wellcome's 20 per cent rise in sales was chiefly due to the
devaluation of sterling. At constant exchange rates, the rise was only 7 per
cent, made up of 11 per cent in the first half falling to 3 per cent in the
second.
Mr James Culverwell, drugs analyst at broker Hoare Govett, said 'the problem
with all drug companies is you have to keep increasing the research and
marketing expenditure, because that's the company's future. If your sales
growth slips below 10 per cent, that starts to hit profit margins.'
Mr John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, said double-digit sales growth
remained the company's target. This would now be achieved partly by
aggressive price-cutting.
'There is disappointment in the market about our sales level, and that has
to be given our attention,' he said. 'With our cash and margins position as
strong as it is now, it's clearly right to focus on things like extracting
maximum sales from existing drugs. Our attention is going much more to the
top line and getting double-digit growth.'
There was now much more sensitivity to price in all Wellcome's main markets,
he said. 'We need to do more on price competition. There may be a neutral
effect on profitability if you get more volume. We are in a financial
position now to get our factories working at a higher level than before, and
we'll use price as one way of doing that.'
Wellcome gave as example a neuro-muscular blocking agent called Nuromax,
where in response to poor US sales it had cut its price in recent months by
more than half. As a result, it hoped to more than double sales volume.
Mr Robb said 'historically, pharmaceutical companies would discover and
develop a drug, then go in with the highest price and hope that by the time
the patent had expired, you would have come up with something else. That
game is over.'
He said some of Wellcome's cash mountain might be spent on collaborative
deals with other companies, the aim being to extend the range of Wellcome's
products across more therapeutic classes.

FT  29 OCT 93 / RSI ruling casts doubt on future claims for damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of legal actions claiming damages for repetitive strain injury
(RSI) was thrown into uncertainty yesterday after a High Court judge ruled
that the condition was meaningless as a medical concept.
Judge John Prosser dismissed a claim by Mr Rafiq Mughal, a former journalist
with the Reuters news agency, that his work conditions for using computer
keyboards were responsible for injuries to his upper limbs.
Although agreeing that Mr Rafiq suffered pain in his hands, arms and
shoulders, the judge said its most likely cause was his emotional state. He
lacked confidence in his work as a sub-editor, took sleeping tablets and
felt he was being watched and even victimised by his colleagues.
'These factors more than anything lie at the root of his problem,' the judge
said.
His ruling goes against judgments in other recent RSI cases. In cases
involving both British Telecom clerical staff and manual workers employed by
Bernard Matthews, the turkey producers, the courts recognised RSI as a
medical condition and awarded damages to those injured at work.
Mr Mughal's case was the first in a series being brought by the National
Union of Journalists. Yesterday, the union said it was disappointed at the
outcome, but insisted it would continue with some 70 individual actions
against newspaper employers.
Several hundred RSI cases involving office workers who used computer
keyboards, such as secretaries and solicitors, are also due to come to
court.
In his judgment, Judge Prosser said RSI could not be recognised as an
authentic medical condition because, unlike tenosynovitis or tennis elbow,
no specific symptoms could be ascribed to it. The term had no place in the
medical text books and served only to confuse, he said.
He said no pattern existed between Mr Mughal's physical symptoms and his
working conditions and no causal relationship had been proved.
Reuters welcomed the ruling and said it took 'the very greatest care' of its
employees.
Mr Mughal turned down the offer of a Pounds 20,000 payment to settle out of
court. The NUJ was ordered to pay Reuters' costs which were described as
'substantial'. The union said later it was considering an appeal.
Yesterday's judgment was criticised by some medical experts. Mr Peter Wells
of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, a specialist in upper limb
disorders, said RSI was not in medical textbooks only because of its recent
emergence as a problem.

FT  29 OCT 93 / State schools increase presence near top of A-level results
survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATE schools have made strong improvements in this year's A-level results,
as shown in the Financial Times survey to be published in full tomorrow.
While big-city independent day schools continued to dominate the upper
levels of the survey, 23 state schools appeared in the top 200 - up from
three last year.
Most were grammar schools, with particularly good performances from schools
in Buckinghamshire, Essex and Kent. However, three comprehensives -
Hasmonean High in Hendon, north London, Dame Alice Owen's in Potters Bar,
Hertfordshire, and Cherwell in North Oxford - reached the top 200.
Single-sex schools continued to do well, with the highest-ranked fully
co-educational school coming only 29th. The top-ranking school overall was
St Paul's, an independent day school for boys in Barnes, west London.
Boarding schools were the most serious casualties. Hampered by falling
enrolments, which saw the total number of boarders in the UK drop by 6 per
cent last year, boarding schools' average A-level scores were well behind
those of independent day schools.
However, the most prestigious boarding schools were unaffected. Eton and
Winchester retained their places in the top 10 for overall A-level results,
and more surprisingly entered the top 10 of the FT's table of
'value-for-money' boarding schools for the first time.
'Value for money' is measured by dividing a school's average A-level score
by annual fees. Both schools achieved their places in spite of charging high
annual fees (Pounds 12,270 for Winchester and Pounds 11,934 for Eton,
against an average Pounds 9,350), confirming a trend - identified by the
survey - of parents having to pay a premium for exceptional results at
boarding schools. Of the top 100 boarding schools in the survey, 87 charged
above average fees.
The reverse was true for independent day schools - 78 of the top 100 charged
fees below the average of Pounds 5,150 a year.
The FT surveyed all independent schools in England and Wales, and also the
top 1,100 state schools identified by the Department for Education in its
survey of performance in 1992.
Unlike previous surveys, the FT list ranks schools according to their
A-level 'score' in accordance with the points system used by the
Universities Central Admissions System, taking into account all grades
achieved at both A-level and AS-level, rather than only the top A and B
grades.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Oil groups pull out staff after attacks in Algeria:
Repatriation follows violence by Islamic radicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN companies operating in Algeria, including many of the more than 20
oil groups exploring new concessions, have begun repatriating dependants and
non-essential staff because of worsening extremist violence.
Islamic radicals, angered by the cancellation of elections which would have
brought them to power in 1991, have this year launched an increasingly
violent campaign against government officials, local journalists and
foreigners.
Last Sunday, three employees of the French consulate in Algiers were
kidnapped. This followed the murders of two French surveyors, two Russian
army officers and three oil workers from an Italian company.
In Egypt, where three foreigners were shot dead on Tuesday in a luxury
hotel, Islamic extremists have adopted similar tactics in an attempt to
cripple the country's valuable tourist industry.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in Algeria since a state of
emergency was declared in January 1992, and diplomats in Algiers say that
clashes between security forces and Islamic extremists have worsened
significantly in the past two months.
Total, the French oil group and one of the biggest foreign oil interests in
Algeria, has shipped out dependants from all 120 French families and moved
its remaining male staff into a hotel. France has 24,440 nationals
registered with its three consulates in the country. Of these, 7,000 to
8,000 are expatriates on limited contracts and therefore are most likely to
return. Most of the rest have dual nationality.
The French foreign ministry has not instructed its nationals to leave
Algeria, but this week recommended that families might want to use the start
yesterday of a 10-day school break in Algeria to leave the country.
Occidental of the US said it had repatriated all family members and
tightened security at the villas of remaining staff.
All the oil companies reached by telephone emphasised, however, that work
would continue despite the fact that the loss of some personnel was already
starting to interrupt schedules. BP said some families of its staff had left
the country and that it was keeping a 'wary eye' on events. According to the
Italian embassy, almost all dependants in the 650-strong Italian community
were set to leave, though the embassy was, so far, leaving the decision to
companies' discretion. Agip, Eni, Enichem and Olivetti all have large
offices in Algiers and have made arrangements to fly families out. Among
German groups, Mercedes and Siemens are also understood to have begun moving
out dependants and some expatriate staff.
Anadarko, the Texas-based oil group, says it has also decided to repatriate
almost all its expatriate staff from Algiers.
Many foreign oil companies have entered into production sharing deals with
Sonatrach, the state oil group, after the government's decision to allow
foreign participation in the oil sector. The law change reflected the
government's acknowledgement that it could not fully exploit oil and gas
reserves without foreign technology.
A substantial part of Algeria's hard currency earnings go to pay off its
Dollars 27bn (Pounds 18bn) foreign debt and the government has been counting
on revenues from new oil and gas discoveries to increase earnings.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Police reformers reject many Sheehy proposals: New
performance-related pay formula introduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to cut about 2,000 middle-ranking police jobs and
introduce performance-related pay for all ranks as part of a fundamental
reform of police pay and conditions.
The proposals, outlined in the Commons yesterday, will also result in police
pay being linked to an unspecified private-sector benchmark.
But ministers have decided against implementing many of the most radical
proposals put forward by the government-appointed Sheehy inquiry into police
rewards and responsibilities.
This was widely interpreted as an attempt to head off a damaging
confrontation with the police at a time of widespread public concern over
law and order.
The government, which intends to make law and order one of the principal
unifying themes of the next parliamentary session, hopes to secure Royal
assent for a bill implementing the changes by next summer.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the 'very far- reaching' reforms
would help bring about more effective policing, while recognising the
'unique nature' of a police officer's job.
In its response to the Sheehy inquiry's main recommendations, the
government:
Accepted that the ranks of deputy chief constable, chief superintendent and
chief inspector should be abolished. This process is to be completed by
April 1995. Ministers will take powers to enable a structural severance
package to be implemented but hope that natural wastage in the ranks
concerned means they will not have to use them.
Rejected the introduction of fixed-term appointments for ranks below
superintendent. Fixed-term contracts will apply to chief officer
appointments from two months after the bill becomes law. Ministers will
consider extending this to superintendents at a later date.
Accepted the principle of performance-related pay while rejecting the
formula proposed by the inquiry. Arrangements depending on an 'overall
appraisal' of performance will be introduced 'as soon as they can be worked
up'. Under one possible scheme, police constables may be offered a Pounds
750 rise for commendable performance and Pounds 1,500 for outstanding work.
Rejected lifting the police retirement age to 60.
Accepted the linkage of pay uprating to non-manual private sector pay
settlements and of pay levels to an unspecified private sector benchmark.
Accepted the abolition of housing allowance for officers recruited after
September 1994.
Rejected a reduction in starting pay levels.
Undertook to review police pension arrangements.
Police leaders welcomed the package as 'a triumph of common sense' and a
vindication of their four-month campaign against the Sheehy proposals.
Mr Howard's announcement also met with a generally warm response from the
Tory backbenches, with Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary,
characterising it as a 'very sensible, practical and realistic response'.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said there had 'unquestionably been
the great clamour of a government retreat' but it was still 'entirely
unclear' in what direction it was retreating. He called for the government
to spell out in more detail its proposals in a number of areas.

FT  29 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC's offer of between Pounds 110m and Pounds 150m for Ferranti seems to be
pitched at a level which allows it to acquire the business with a minimum of
fuss. Whether the bid is priced correctly is more uncertain. Arguably, GEC
could have picked up the pieces of Ferranti from the receiver for far less
than the nominal Pounds 10m being paid to shareholders and the assumption of
Ferranti's debts. Against that, GEC argues that many things can go wrong
once the undertakers are called in and the body starts to decompose. Yet it
seems improbable that Ferranti's business is worth almost exactly the value
of its outstanding debts. Perhaps GEC's judgment is that it can squeeze more
from the corpse and do the Ministry of Defence a favour at the same time.
That should leave the banks offering thanks in the general direction of Lord
Weinstock, who has relieved them of a sticky position and, in all
probability, a messy insolvency. GEC's preparedness to take the banks out at
face value may prompt shareholders to feel that there is more in it for
them. If so, they are probably mistaken, as Ferranti's chairman, Eugene
Anderson, was at pains to point out yesterday.
Given that GEC has made its offer conditional on obtaining 90 per cent
acceptances, disgruntled shareholders could frustrate the plan. But unlike
equally contentious offers such as Amstrad or Greycoat, the alternative for
Ferranti probably is immediate receivership. The offer is a poor reward for
the rights money and loyalty offered to a company whose track record
scarcely deserved it.

The doubts surrounding the future of the Globex futures trading system are a
smudge on Reuters' recent record. Globex has proved itself technically, and
experience with the system on Matif has shown it can operate successfully.
But tensions between Reuters and the two Chicago exchanges, which have
jointly developed Globex, have hindered its expansion and are now
jeopardising its future viability.
The current relationship is untenable and must be altered. To succeed,
Globex needs significantly to increase trading volumes. This will require
the inclusion of other exchanges. But some of them, including Liffe,
justifiably worry about surrendering control of their products to the
Chicago exchanges, which are their main competitors. The hope is that
forthcoming talks will break the log-jam with Reuters gaining control of the
day-to-day operations. The Chicago exchanges have little room for manoeuvre
given Globex's current losses.
Even if the talks break down and Reuters exercises its option to pull out of
Globex next April, the financial damage will be limited. Reuters has already
spent and written off an estimated Dollars 75m developing the system.
Moreover, Globex is the least important of Reuters' new generation of
products. Instinet is proving its worth. The Dealing 2000/2 foreign exchange
system also appears to be acquiring critical mass. Nonetheless, a failure to
capitalise on Globex would represent a serious blow to Reuters' reputation
and ability to transfer its technological skills into new markets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the sharp bounce in third-quarter earnings reinforces ICI's
status as a pure recovery stock now it has been stripped of Zeneca. Yet much
of the profits improvement so far stems from a combination of cost cutting
and one-off gains. The devaluation of sterling has added around Pounds 80m
to profits this year, against the overall improvement of Pounds 72m shown by
continuing businesses. The fibres-for-acrylics swap with DuPont flatters the
underlying improvement in materials. New plant coming on stream makes the
profits recovery in industrial chemicals look better than market conditions
alone would allow.
There are green shoots sure enough. Autumn price increases in PVC and
titanium dioxide appear to be sticking for the first time in years. The
regional businesses in Australia are showing genuine improvement. But the
message from other European chemicals producers is one of continued misery.
Over-capacity in petrochemicals will depress selling prices even if demand
recovers in line with the economy. The industry is more likely to pull
slowly out of recession than show the kind of sharp cyclical recovery seen
in the early 1980s.
A concerted effort to close inefficient plant now being mooted among
European producers offers a glimmer of hope for better times. Since ICI has
taken its medicine without the benefit of subsidies, such co-ordinated
action might seem a shade unfair. If the plan ever reaches fruition, though,
ICI is well placed to benefit.

FT  29 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Wellcome catches cold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hell hath no fury like a market caught off-balance. The 11 per cent fall in
Wellcome's shares yesterday follows a bull run lasting four months. A poor
performance from Retrovir, Wellcome's anti-Aids treatment, was expected
following negative clinical trials. The sharp deceleration of Zovirax, the
anti-viral drug which has been the engine of Wellcome's recent growth, is
more of a shock. While it is dangerous to project a trend from six months'
figures, as the stock market seems minded to do, there are reasons enough to
reappraise the prospects.
SmithKline Beecham's new anti-viral drug looks likely to provide Zovirax
with stiff competition starting next year. The newcomer does not appear to
have clear-cut therapeutic benefits, but SB will doubtless bring its
marketing muscle to bear. Wellcome's declared defence strategy will include
heavy discounting should this be required to keep sales growing. Margins
have risen by 10 percentage points over three years, so it might now
surrender some of the gain. Such threats might be aimed at dissuading SB
from pitching its product too cheaply. But there must be a danger of a
pricing battle from which neither company gains.
That might explain why Wellcome's generosity with its dividend fell on stony
ground, unlike Glaxo's similar effort last month. With almost Pounds 600m in
the bank and dividend cover of 2.7 times - against an industry average of
2.2 - Wellcome has room to repeat the trick. Until the profits outlook is
less clouded, though, the promise of dividends growing faster than earnings
does not hold much allure.

FT  29 OCT 93 / High hurdles if you're not fit: The special EC summit is
forced to take a realistic view of the pace of integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The special European summit in Brussels today is supposed to celebrate
ratification of the Maastricht treaty, but it looks more a stage-set for the
walking wounded.
The co-architects of the treaty are diminished figures: Chancellor Helmut
Kohl grumbles that Germans are not sufficiently grateful for German
reunification; President Francois Mitterrand is a virtual recluse; Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission president, laments the passing of an age when
Europe could think and act on a grand scale.
Not even this week's Franco-German initiative to inject fresh momentum into
European foreign policy could revive spirits. In Brussels, senior EC
officials described the joint paper as little more than an exposition of the
treaty, which paled beside past demarches.
Maastricht has claimed several casualties, but it has led to more realistic
views about the pace of political and economic integration in Europe. After
two Danish referendums, dozens of House of Commons votes, a wafer-thin Oui
in France, and this month's qualified approval in the German constitutional
court, EC leaders know there is nothing preordained about progress toward an
'ever closer European union'.
If the mood is modest, so is today's agenda. EC leaders will avoid the twin
minefields of the Gatt trade talks, and discussion about streamlining
decision-making once the EC completes the next round of enlargement
negotiations. The summit will not hear new prescriptions for the ailing
European exchange rate mechanism; and 'Big Bang' solutions to mass
unemployment - such as President Mitterrand's plan for an Ecu100bn loan to
fund public works - are likely to be given short shrift.
Instead, EC leaders will talk about the economy, primarily the need to
reform labour markets and improve Europe's declining competitiveness in
relation to Asia and the US. But no decisions are expected, because nobody
wishes to pre-empt Mr Delors' own White Book on employment and growth, to be
presented at the regular EC summit in December.
So what is the purpose of holding a meeting of 12 heads of government for a
few hours in Brussels, under the chairmanship of the Belgian presidency of
the EC, just three days before Maastricht enters into force on Monday
November 1?
The first order of business is horsetrading. At stake are the locations of
nearly a dozen EC institutions. These include the European plant breeders'
rights agency, the European environment agency, and the real prize: the
European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the European central bank, which
will supervise a putative single European currency.
Brussels officials are convinced that the original decision to hold a summit
was the result of German pressure to force a decision on the EMI. Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, was unhappy about staging a
special summit, not least because of the cost and the disruption to what has
so far been a meticulously planned and executed EC presidency.
But last summer Mr Kohl was adamant. He was impatient with the delay in
Maastricht ratification in the UK; and he was determined to bring home the
EMI in the hope that it would counter German opposition to giving up the
D-Mark and a fall in public approval for the Community.
The hardening of attitudes in Germany explains why the French appear willing
to drop their opposition to locating the central bank in Frankfurt. 'People
will say it's a German Europe,' says one official in Paris, 'but if Emu can
only be achieved with the price of Frankfurt, tant pis.'
The promise of gaining an influence over German monetary policy through a
future European central bank remains a driving force behind French policy on
Europe. The price, however, is steep: a high interest rate policy to
maintain the franc-D-Mark parity which is exacerbating the recession.
Some senior European Commission officials wonder privately how long the
French can hang on; theybelieve the Balladur government should have ordered
a reduction in interest rates immediately after the August 2 currency crisis
which led to the de facto suspension of the ERM. But none of these officials
is ready to call for an interest rate cut because they fear it would kill
the last vestiges of credibility in the Emu process.
If there is a deal struck today on the location of the EMI, EC leaders will
insist that Emu remains on track. But the test will be how member states
choose to interpret the so-called Stage Two process - which provides for
closer monetary and economic co-operation - due to begin on January 1 1994.
Under Article 103 of the treaty the European Council must draw up
macroeconomic guidelines in December on the basis of qualified majority
voting, in recognition that the national economies of the 12 members are
'matters of common concern'.
So far, EC finance ministers - led by France, Germany and the UK - have
brushed aside suggestions that the Commission might put forward specific
performance targets. Mr Delors himself remains dubious about Stage Two,
unless member states are willing to 'enrich' the process by giving more
leeway to the EMI to co-ordinate monetary policy.
The same question of political will applies to Maastricht's provisions for
greater co-operation on a common security and foreign policy, also to be
discussed today. EC leaders will identify possible 'joint actions'. This
Brussels code-word means a little more than reactive diplomacy, but a lot
less than sending combat troops to trouble-spots.
The UK's pet project is to send diplomatic observers to monitor the
parliamentary elections in Russia in December, and possibly the multi-racial
elections in South Africa next spring.
France is pushing the Balladur plan for central and eastern Europe; but one
objection is that the proposed stability pact's implied willingness to
examine all border disputes is an invitation to ethnic rivalry. Another
target is the Middle East, where the EC has drawn up plans to send Ecu500m
in aid to the occupied territories.
More complicated is former Yugoslavia, where the Community remains scarred
by its failure to secure a peace settlement but also by the divisions caused
by the successful German push for early EC recognition of Croatia and
Slovenia.
New provisions in Maastricht covering drugs and immigration and crime are
more promising. In Germany, where Mr Kohl frets about Mafia-type gangs
exploiting a frontier-free Europe, officials speak with genuine enthusiasm
about closer intergovernmental co-operation. Crackdowns on crime also sell
well in the UK, even when sold under the Brussels brand-name.
What is striking is the consensus inside Brussels and among member states
that it is time to call a truce in the quasi-religious war over Maastricht.
'No more permanent revolution,' says one EC official, 'there's plenty of
meat in the treaty and we have to make it work.'
UK officials agree. They detect that the tide is running in favour of looser
forms of co-operation between governments rather than centralised direction
from Brussels.
Thus, the cliche image of Brussels bureaucrats churning out directives on
standardised Euro-coffins and Euro-condoms is passe now that the Single
Market legislation is virtually complete. The Commission put out 162
directives in 1990 and 145 in 1991; barely 50 have been completed this year.
The Commission's role is evolving more as a regulator than as an initiator
of EC laws. EC officials say it was always meant to be so. Maastricht was,
after all, a good deal less ambitious than the Single European Act of 1986
which introduced a significant change in decision-making through qualified
voting.
The slogan of the day is subsidiarity - powers to be devolved to the lowest
appropriate level. It is a powerful tool, and EC officials worry that it
could be extended to scrapping established directives, particularly social
legislation such as the 48-hour working week. In recent months, Germany's
preoccupation with national problems has made it more enthusiastic about
subsidiarity.
In the short term, however, the challenge for the EC is to stop the forces
of fragmentation which have been in the ascendancy since the Danes rejected
Maastricht in June 1992. The second, Yes vote, did little to alleviate them.
Three tests beckon: the first is enlargement. The Community has set a target
date of January 1 1995 for the entry of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria.
Even if one or two applicants fail in referendums, it is a tough date to
meet.
Second, the 1994 European Parliament elections will offer a real test of
European public opinion about the EC. Two-thirds abstention rates will be a
bad omen.
Third, and most important, is whether the EC can reach a Gatt agreement by
the agreed deadline of December 15. One senior Brussels official warns that
failure would 'split the Community to the bone'.
A senior German official agrees: 'A Gatt agreement must be done with France.
But without France, it will be the beginning of the end of the Franco-German
alliance.'
EC leaders believe there is nothing to be gained by forcing the Gatt issue
at today's summit because it would risk isolating France and creating a
public spectacle of disunity. Their goal is to postpone a showdown in the
hope of persuading France to come back into the Community fold. It is a
traditional, but high-risk, strategy.

It starts heartwarmingly enough. In May, Bianca Jagger, representing the
Albert Schweitzer Foundation, takes out of Tuzla, Bosnia, two severely-ill
children. One dies, but the other, Mohamed Ribic, aged 8, undergoes
successful heart surgery and is installed in Bianca's Manhattan apartment,
where she proclaims her undying love for him.
Now Bianca says Mohamed is homesick and wants to go back to Tuzla. She and
her partner Robert Torricelli, a prominent New Jersey congressman, bombard
the UN High Commission for Refugees and the US embassy in Zagreb with
demands that transport be arranged immediately. UNHCR, Torricelli has
declared, 'did nothing to save Mohamed's life and now they're doing nothing
to help return him to his family'. He is now insisting he will take the boy
back to Tuzla by land from Zagreb if UNHCR does not provide a flight.
Officials point out that Mohamed's father is disabled and half-blind, the
family squatting in an unheated ruined house. Last week a Danish truck
driver was killed on the road to Tuzla.
Bianca says, heart-rendingly, that Mohamed wants to go home and who is she
to say he can't? Would that other refugees had such powerful patrons.

Has Philippe Maystadt got the right man? The Belgian finance minister has
been loudly singing the praises of Alexandre Lamfalussy, who will today be
confirmed as the first president of the European Monetary Institute. He has
found, he thinks, a 'true believer' in a single European currency.
Maystadt has also been at pains to point out how Lamfalussy, general manager
of the Bank for International Settlements, compares favourably with certain
sceptical European central bank governors.
But did he not read last year's BIS report, in which Lamfalussy's
hard-hitting comments on monetary union conveyed the impression of a man
less than wholly enthusiastic about the Emu endeavour? Then, the author was
not shy of enumerating the long list of 'adjustment problems' that would be
involved in moving to a single currency by the end of the century, or of
giving ample treatment to the 'many uncertainties' that lay ahead.
Indeed, so waspish was he deemed to have been on that occasion that he
earned a rebuke from the president of the Dutch central bank. Wim Duisenberg
is the man who, despite being France and Germany's favourite for the EMI
job, turned it down because it wasn't big enough for him. Perhaps Maystadt
should have tried one more heave to bring Duisenberg aboard.

In an attempt to display a sense of humour, Switzerland's PTT decided to
dispense with the usual children's drawings or maps of the area on its
telephone directory covers, and to go for cartoons instead.
The idea was to send up regional telephony habits, with the one for the
Valais, for example, showing punters queueing up atop the Matterhorn to use
a phone booth.
However, though the cartoons were vetted by psychologists, feminists,
vegetarians and all manner of special interest groups, no bells of alarm
rang over the cover for the Geneva directory. This features two fattish Arab
men in traditional robes standing beside their shiny Mercedes looking at the
city's famous water fountain spurting high above Lac Leman. 'Transparent
oil]', shouts one into his cellular telephone.
Unsurprisingly, the city's large Arab community is in high dudgeon, and an
official protest to the Swiss was duly lodged by the Arab mission at the
United Nations in Geneva. This in turn elicited an abject apology from PTT.
'Next time we will not try to be so original,' says Dieter Max Syx, the
chief executive.
