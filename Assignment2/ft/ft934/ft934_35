FT  29 OCT 93 / Observer: Good eggs and sugar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mushroom-pickers may not have their jobs back. But the taunts of the
gaggle of women, dressed as plantation slaves, who gathered outside this
week's Booker prize ceremony to protest at their dismissal after an
industrial dispute, seem to have wounded the food company to the quick.
Booker is actually rather proud of its liberal tradition. Chairman Jonathan
Taylor 'leans towards the soft centre' himself, while one of his
predecessors was the progressive Labour peer, Lord Campbell. The company
even used to give money to the Alliance.
But, 'surrounded in fiction and myth', Taylor sees references to the
company's origins in slavery and the slave trade wherever he turns. All
jolly inconvenient, given the sugar interests in Guyana and the management
consultancy business to assorted third world agricultural ministries.
Well, the history books are on his side, just about. For Booker Bros &amp; Co
was founded in 1834 in Demerara, now Guyana, by George and Richard Booker,
Liverpool merchants trading in sugar, hardware and dry goods. This was a
year after slavery had been abolished throughout the British empire, and 27
years after the trade in slaves had been halted.
The brothers may have traded in sugar pre-emancipation, but that makes them
no 'more involved in slavery than people who ate the stuff', Taylor reckons.
However, it was their elder brother Josias, who, having worked as an
attorney on a Demerara cotton estate, was awarded a gold medal for his
relations with the 'negro' by the Anti-Slavery Society. 'But one senses they
were all quite good eggs,' Taylor continues.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Chunnel link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLANNED high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel could
be a showpiece for the UK government's initiative of attracting private
capital to public infrastructure projects. It provides an opportunity both
to harness the private sector's skills in project management and to remove
at least part of a Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3bn project from the public sector's
balance sheet.
But to achieve these benefits, the Treasury will need to abandon its purist
line that all the risk of such projects should be borne by private
investors. Sticking to this line could delay or even kill off the project,
as Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary set up to develop the link,
will tell ministers later today.
The essential point is that the private sector is not well suited to bear
the political and regulatory risks associated with the early stages of large
infrastructure projects. Before construction on the Chunnel link can
proceed, planning consents must be won, public inquiries conducted,
legislation passed and safety standards determined. At each stage, there is
a danger that the project will be delayed and extra costs imposed.
This particular project does not start with a happy history as far as
private companies are concerned. Several construction groups have already
spent money making proposals, only to have them rejected largely for
political reasons. There is also the overhang from the main Channel tunnel
project, whose financial attraction has been reduced by a tightening of
safety regulations and the delay in building road and rail links.
It is doubtful whether private funds could be attracted at this stage and,
even if they could, a high risk premium would be required. Far better,
therefore, for the public sector to put up the Pounds 200m needed for the
project's next phase, tiding it over until political and regulatory
uncertainty is largely out of the way. After that, it should be easier to
find a further Pounds 2.5bn-plus from private investors. The remaining risks
 -concerning construction costs, operating expenses and customer demand -
are the type the private sector is best at managing.
Given the current budgetary pressures, it is reasonable to ask why the
Chunnel link should have priority over other worthwhile projects that are
now stalled. Part of the answer is that the link is already badly delayed.
Constructing it is important not only to maximise the economic benefits of
the Channel tunnel but also to ease congestion for commuter traffic in the
south-east.
But the most compelling reason for priming the pump is that a success with
Union Railways would give a boost to the government's private funding
initiative. It could open the door for private capital to flow into roads,
railways and prisons. That, more than almost anything else, would ease the
pressure on government finances.

FT  29 OCT 93 / It will not go away: Major must satisfy two audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a summit that Mr John Major would rather do without. Maastricht is not
a treaty that his battered government has any cause to celebrate.
Instead, in the words of one senior minister, the UK prime minister would
like Europe simply 'to go away for a while'. He has problems enough at home
without reopening the raw wounds in the Conservative party over European
integration.
So as foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd put it this week, Britain will be
seeking to persuade its European partners not to treat as a 'passport to
paradise' the creation of the European union enshrined in Maastricht.
In the familiar language of British pragmatism, Mr Major and Mr Hurd will
urge their counterparts to refocus the Community's gaze on the realities
facing its citizens: jobs, economic growth and the need for a new world
trade agreement.
Mr Major has found it difficult to disguise his understandable satisfaction
at the roadblocks placed on the road to European union by economic recession
and disarray in the European exchange rate mechanism.
In Number 10 Downing Street yesterday, senior officials were speaking with
open contempt at the notion that Britain's more federally minded partners
should seek today to reinstate the Maastricht timetable for economic and
monetary union. The prime minister himself has dismissed the hope of a
single currency by the end of the century as one having 'all the quaintness
of a rain dance and about the same potency'.
He can claim that the debate in Europe has started to go Britain's way. Of
the UK's priorities, enlargement is seen as inevitable, competitiveness
treated as a serious issue, and the Gatt trade deal has the support of all
member states bar France.
But the confident Euro-scepticism that has crept into Mr Major's rhetoric as
Germany, France and the other more federalist EC states have scaled down
their integrationist aspirations is far from universally shared in
Whitehall.
Appeasing the anti-Brussels right of the Conservative party will not win the
prime minister friends in Europe. Nor will it further his aim of keeping
Britain at the centre of the debate over Europe's post-Maastricht future.
Mr Hurd has set out the UK's aims in a less triumphalist tone. Acutely aware
of the price paid by Britain for isolation during much of Mrs Margaret
Thatcher's premiership, the foreign secretary said this week: 'There was a
time when we didn't find it easy to have a running, continuous dialogue with
our partners. Now it's easier and that's an important gain.'
But he was in no doubt that the greater 'realism' displayed by other EC
governments after the traumas of Maastricht ratification and the near
break-up of the ERM would not curb, in the long-term, their ambitions to
make a reality of economic and political union.
By tonight Mr Major may well have been forced to concede that the European
Monetary Institute, the first step towards economic union, should be set up
alongside the Bundesbank in Frankfurt.
So the government is aware that its disdain for Emu must be accompanied by a
determined effort to give substance to the intergovernmental pillars of
co-operation - in foreign and judicial policy - enshrined in Maastricht. If
Britain is to press the case for a Europe of nation states, co-operation
between governments must be seen to work.
Mr Major's problem is that he remains perched uncomfortably between two
audiences. The recalcitrant right in the Conservative party demands the
impossible: that the government turn back the clock of European integration
to a golden age that never was, when Britain decided its own destiny. The
UK's partners insist that, if their immediate ambitions have been curbed by
the chill wind of economic reality, their federalist dreams have not. Sadly
for Mr Major, Europe will not go away.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Article: America's choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT three weeks promise to be decisive for the future of global free
trade. Will the world's trading powers be able to proceed down the home
stretch towards an agreement in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade? Or will they have to brace themselves for an
escalation of bilateral trade conflicts that could poison international
relations and impair world economic growth? An initial answer may come on
November 17, when the US House of Representatives votes on whether to ratify
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and
Mexico.
Technically, the Nafta vote is quite separate from the wider Uruguay round
negotiations; in practice, the two are intimately connected. If President
Bill Clinton fails to prevail over Nafta's opponents - an alliance of trade
unionists, environmentalists and protectionists - he will be so weakened
that he will have little chance of gaining approval for the concessions
needed to secure a Gatt agreement. If he wins, he can choose to press ahead
with concluding the Uruguay round by the deadline of mid-December, when his
'fast-track' negotiating mandate expires.
The good news is that after months of hesitation Mr Clinton has finally come
out fighting for Nafta with a series of campaigning speeches for the
agreement and an increasingly sophisticated lobbying effort aimed at
congressional waverers. As a result it is beginning to look as if the
balance is tipping in his favour. Although Nafta could still be derailed by
the election of a new Canadian government, which claims to be committed to
renegotiating it, the US appears confident that Ottawa's ire is directed
more at its existing free-trade agreement with the US than at the new deal
which will supersede it.
Of course, Mr Clinton's efforts to secure Nafta come at a price. Sceptics in
Europe and elsewhere note that the US has lately taken a harder line over
the Gatt, withholding further tariff concessions, raising the stakes over
financial services with east Asian countries and refusing to mollify the
European Community over farm trade. They wonder whether Washington might,
having secured Nafta, be tempted to spurn the multilateral negotiations in
search of bilateral pacts with the Asian countries whose leaders Mr Clinton
is to meet in Seattle on November 19.
They should withhold judgment, at least for a time. Mr Clinton's current
negotiating posture may be more form than substance. There is no reason why
freer North American or Asian trade should do anything other than complement
America's commitment to the Uruguay round, while serving the useful purpose
of concentrating recalcitrant minds in the EC. It is in everyone's interest
that he secure Nafta. Then, if he is wise, he will decide it is in America's
interest to complete the new multilateral trading framework that the world
so badly needs.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Two cheers for Howard's way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS never going to be easy to reform police pay and conditions. Rooting
out restrictive practices in the UK police service is essential to increase
its efficiency and effectiveness. Yet these objectives will not be achieved
if change unnecessarily antagonises those in the front line of the
government's battle against crime. Nor will it command the support of the
general public who have only recently been reminded of the special nature of
police work with the murder in London of PC Dunne.
So Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has probably done as much as was
possible to preserve the thrust of the Sheehy report against the fierce -
often ruthless - opposition of the police staff associations. Yesterday he
announced his acceptance of several contentious elements in the package
recommended by Sir Patrick Sheehy's inquiry. These include the elimination
of three management levels and the simplification of the pay structure by
abolishing most allowances. The new pay formula should stop police pay
surging ahead as it has done over the past 15 years.
The home secretary has also endorsed the principle of performance-related
pay for the police, though in a simpler form than that recommended by
Sheehy. And while he has rightly rejected the controversial proposal for
fixed-term contracts for all ranks, the new disciplinary procedures he
announced last month will make it easier to get rid of poor performers.
Chief constables will have much greater flexibility to run their forces in
line with local needs.
On the other hand, Mr Howard has rejected Sheehy's call for police starting
pay to be cut. He says that he is anxious to attract older recruits, a
worthwhile ambition. Yet this could be achieved without having to pay
younger recruits salaries which the Sheehy inquiry found to be 'well above
the market'.
The home secretary has also passed on to others much of the detailed
discussion over the Sheehy recommendations. The police pension scheme is to
be further reviewed, though the proposal that police officers should work
for 40 years to get a full pension has been rejected. Overtime for
inspectors is to be abolished, but for other ranks the issue will be passed
to the Police Negotiations Board, along with other detailed work. While this
tripartite body should be consulted on such matters, it will find it hard to
take unpopular decisions.
The early welcome for the government's decisions from the chief police
officers is a good omen from the point of view of morale. Without the
backing of senior management, such reforms are unlikely to achieve their
ends. But there remains an uncomfortable suspicion that Mr Howard has been
bounced into conceding more than is necessary by the skilled campaigning of
the well-organised police staff associations. With the government lacking
confidence in its ability to carry a parliamentary majority, it is perhaps
the best that could have been achieved.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Identity cards to be welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL B HEATH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report, 'Benefit fraud costs Pounds 5bn a year, say officials'
(October 26), that the government is considering the introduction of
identity cards for benefit claimants to reduce fraudulent claims.
Such a measure could have much wider advantages in industry, particularly if
it is the first step to the introduction of a universal identity card.
As an industry with many thousands of employees and a turnover of more than
Pounds 1.5bn, members of this association would welcome such an initiative.
Our member companies, which have to abide by a code of practice as a
condition of membership, work under increasing burdens to ensure the
propriety of their employees. They have long been frustrated by the lack of
adequate means of checking the credentials of potential employees,
particularly in regard to the status of foreign nationals, National
Insurance and tax.
Any initiative which makes such checks easier and more effective, reducing
administrative burdens while improving the accuracy of checks on potential
employees, should be widely welcomed throughout industry.

FT  29 OCT 93 / The lame duck in winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's oblit-eration of its Progressive Conservatives is tempting. Our
Canadian cousins re-duced the party which had ruled them for the past nine
years from 153 seats, and an overall majority in parliament, to two.
It would be a delight so to humble Britain's Tories. They have governed us
for the past 14 years. British voters should decide which two Conservatives
to conserve, and defenestrate the rest. It merely requires some intelligent
tactical voting. We can rule out Mr John Major. The prime minister would
have to quit politics after such a disaster. Very well then, what about
preserving Mr John Patten, the education secretary? Not quite. Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary? Not exactly. Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary? Please. This is serious.
I need not list all the candidates for ejection. The choice of which ones to
keep makes itself. The secretary for social security, Mr Peter Lilley, and
the backbench rebel, Mrs Teresa Gorman, are the pair of Tories who most
deserve to be condemned to wander, lost souls, in the purgatory of a
Westminster in which all other MPs would be Labour, Liberal Democrat or
Celtic nationalist. 'I am now the leader, Peter,' the one will say, to be
met with an echo from the other. The torture would be the more exquisite for
the fact that the only congenial spirits the condemned could turn to would
be one another.
This phantasmagoria should not be taken as an argument in favour of Labour,
or a Lab-Lib coalition. We do not have the luxury of choosing a party with
whose governance we would be satisfied. There is none such. The Liberal
Democrats are not serious contenders. The Conservatives, Mr Lilley prominent
among them, have been musing about taking us back to the 1950s. Labour
demonstrated at its recent conference that it is still incapable of
reshaping itself. Its leader, Mr John Smith, has put the brakes on the
modernisers around him. With Labour in charge, it would be back to the
1960s.
We adherents of the 'none of the above' tendency must therefore remain
analytical. I have long assumed that Labour is out for ever; that we are
effectively in a one-party state, as the Japanese and the Italians used to
be. This has been the usual position taken in this space, although there
have been one or two wobbles, most regrettably during the weeks before the
April 1992 election. All assumptions should be questioned from time to time.
The 'one-party state' theory is looking thin. The result of the Canadian
election is one reason, but there are others. Japan's Liberal Democrats have
been dismissed after 40 years in power. Italy is in revolt against political
corruption, and fed up with its Christian Democrats. We will see what
happens in New Zealand's election next week. Mr Major is looking for a
surprise victory by Mr Jim Bolger, the incumbent Conservative prime
minister.
While keeping his fingers crossed, he should reassess the conventional
wisdom, which is that Labour is so unappetising that the southern English
will never vote for it in sufficient numbers to give it a majority. If that
is still true, the Conservatives will win again in two or three years' time,
following a return to relative prosperity. But what if it is not? The
daunting answer is that the troglodytes in the Labour party would then have
been proved right. Just wait for the Tories to rot on the vine, they say,
and we're in. In short, it is no longer certain that 'one more heave', Mr
Smith's cautious strategy of minimum disturbance, will fail. On this view it
is at least possible that the next government will be Labour-led, Liberal
Democrat-supported, and deeply, disappointingly, conservative.
The deciding factor may be the extent to which Mr Major can re-establish the
government's authority over its backbenchers. The Conservatives are still
recovering from the shock of Black Wednesday. The natural respect for the
leader of the party, the instinctive closing of the ranks in times of
trouble, the very will to govern were blown away when Britain was ejected
from the exchange rate mechanism. The prime minister was humiliated, his
stature diminished. Rehabilitation is turning out to be a longer, slower
process than anyone could have foreseen.
Some progress has been made. The divisive bill to ratify the Maastricht
treaty is now a statute; Europe, barring accidents at today's EC summit, may
become politically manageable, at least in the short term. An economic
recovery is under way, if fitfully. Mr Major's unashamed appeal to nostalgia
got him through his big speech at the party conference. The mood is better
now than it was in the spring. This rosy picture is spoiled by unruliness on
the backbenches. Backbench revolts have now become the norm. Disunity is the
problem; all else is secondary.
The recent spate of headline 'climbdowns', 'U-turns', 'threats' and the like
constitutes bad publicity of the kind that, if prolonged, could prove fatal.
If the sense of drift that it suggests persists, we are in for one of the
most drawn-out stretches of lame duck administration in British history. Yet
each act of tacking and trimming is different.
For example Mr Howard's a la carte approach to the Sheehy report on police
pay and conditions suggests a certain weakness. The home secretary was
selecting from a menu put up by the government's consultant. Managements
that appoint them should know that the purpose of consultants is to provide
intellectual support for ideas the client first thought of but could not
impose. Mr Howard got the report, but could not implement all of it. Again,
the government was obliged to accept a Lords amendment allowing British Rail
to bid for franchises under the new arrangements for the railways. Some
ground was recovered yesterday by tabling a new amendment, making it
difficult for Byzantine Rail to bid.
The big test is the Budget, due on November 30. One interest group is trying
to bounce Mr Major away from defence cuts; another from putting VAT on
domestic fuel; a third towards further social security restraint. The prime
minister must ensure that the Budget is decided by the chancellor and
himself, and supported by the cabinet and party. If he cannot achieve that,
talk of the decimation of the Tories at the next general election will no
longer be such a laughing matter.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You should be complimented on another excellent survey on derivatives
(October 20). There is, however, one point over which I must quibble. The
article on technology, headed 'Integration top of the agenda', inverts the
proper meanings of 'buy-side' and 'sell-side' when it refers to '. . . a
small but growing band of the corporations and investment institutions on
the sell-side'.
Perhaps this is not only an inadvertent oversight, but is also another clear
indication of how the distinction between 'buy-side' and 'sell-side' is
rapidly becoming an anachronism, as the two 'sides' of the securities and
investments industry are fusing into one, and an increasingly competitive
one at that.

Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL CASH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Leon Brittan's article, 'Time to retune for Emu harmony' (October
27), makes a powerful case - even if he may not realise it - for the
renegotiation of Maastricht and for a return to Title II of the Single
European Act which kept the words 'Economic and Monetary Union' in brackets.
We do not need the European Council to commission (yet another) outline
economic strategy. 'One Money, One Market' was hopelessly wrong - why should
anyone be taken in again?
We must not be. We live in hope that the government will make this clear at
today's EC summit.
Sir Leon and others at the summit should heed the implications of the recent
German court ruling and not attempt to interpret and implement Maastricht as
they please; it is not their right so to do. But even if they do try they
will find that no amount of realignment, co-ordination and reinterpretation
can paper over the fundamental inadequacies of Maastricht's economic and
monetary provisions.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Darkest hour before dawn: The travails of Reuters' futures
trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Globex, the international electronic network for dealing in the world's
fast-growing 'futures' market, may offer a foretaste of the shape of
financial trading in years to come. But at the moment its own future is far
from certain.
The volume of trade on the system, developed by Reuters, the London-based
news and information group, in conjunction with the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two largest futures
exchanges, is well below target. Apart from the Matif, the French futures
market, it has failed to attract members elsewhere.
Part of the problem is the rivalry between futures exchanges, which are
reluctant to join a system run by their competitors. But there is also a
more fundamental question: whether the market for futures - instruments
which commit the holder to buy or sell commodities, shares and bonds at a
later date - will ever be sufficiently global to make the system profitable.
Doubts over the system have this week prompted discussions between Reuters
and the CME over possible changes. A renegotiation of the agreement between
all three partners is due in April.
Reuters has most at stake. It contributed Dollars 75m (Pounds 49.6m) towards
Globex's Dollars 80m development cost. Though the idea was conceived in
1987, stock market analysts forecast that Globex will not make a
contribution to Reuters' revenues until 1995.
Mr Brian Newman, of stockbrokers Henderson Cross-thwaite, says the project
is 'intellectually important, but not vital for short-term profits'.
Globex's failure, however, could weaken Reuters' efforts to dominate the
market for financial trading systems: without Globex, it would have to rely
on its currency and equity dealing systems.
In April, Reuters has the option to pull out because its partners have
failed to reach the pre-agreed target of 50,000 of their contracts traded
every day on the system. (The current volume is only about 5,000 a day.)
Its commitment to its partners has been severely tested. Mr Pat Arbor, the
CBOT chairman, did not help relations by describing, during a Globex
marketing trip to the Far East, his exchange's own after-hours electronic
dealing system, Project A, as 'less expensive to introduce and easier to
use'. But withdrawal in April seems unlikely because Reuters is keen to
recoup its investment.
Reuters is believed, however, to be looking for a radical restructuring with
the aim of diminishing the role of the CBOT and CME so that other exchanges
are encouraged to join. In particular, it needs to win the backing of large
players such as the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange.
Yet such changes will only ensure Globex's success if the initial concept of
a global network for trading futures proves viable.
Globex was conceived to allow round-the-world trading of futures and
options, 24 hours a day. Its backers got one thing right: futures markets
have become an increasingly important part of world financial markets.
Because futures offer a cheaper and quicker means of dealing, they
frequently drive price changes in stock and bond markets. The value of
financial products and commodities traded via futures contracts on the
world's exchanges has reached an estimated Dollars 140,000bn a year. Most of
this business takes place in trading pits during local working hours by men
and women in brightly coloured jackets signalling prices to each other
across the floor.
Before Globex, futures trading stopped when markets closed. That meant, for
example, that if the US president suffered a heart attack outside hours,
traders in Japan or London were unable to react by buying or selling US
Treasury long bond futures during their own trading day. In the late 1980s,
when the trend across all financial markets was towards increased
internationalisation, Globex seemed a logical development. Now the
atmosphere is more sober, even among its backers.
In spite of the rapid growth of cross-border trading and investment, few
financial markets are truly global. Only currencies are traded actively 24
hours a day. Other markets, even the extremely liquid US Treasuries market,
trade mainly during the working hours of their own country.
This means that it may be difficult for Globex to attract heavy volume,
except in exceptional circumstances. For example, when President Boris
Yeltsin dissolved the Russian parliament after France's Matif had closed for
the day, 61,000 contracts in French government bond futures were traded
overnight on Globex.
The counter argument put by Globex's backers is that it has the advantage of
being the only electronic trading system for futures. Moreover, regulatory
hurdles in many countries have slowed the system's spread around the world,
and until screens are in place on more traders' desks, its value will not be
fully appreciated. 'How can we be measured at this point when we only just
got approval to put screens in the Pacific Rim? How do you sell hotdogs in
Japan when you don't even have a hotdog stand there?' asks Mr Jack Sandner,
CME chairman.
'We are making a long journey here and you don't do it in two years,' he
says. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, managing director of Reuters transaction products,
says: 'The key to transaction products is gaining a critical mass; that
takes time.' Reuters says it is confident about Globex's future. But it is
keen to improve the system's marketability.
That concern will be at the centre of Reuters' discussions with its partners
in April - although it is possible a resolution could come earlier. The
group has been reticent so far about strategy but it admits change is
probable. 'We want to explore all the various avenues and opportunities,'
says Ms Wilton.
A possible scenario is an agreement that Reuters will have overall charge of
running the system with all member exchanges - including the two founding
partners in Chicago - having equal influence over the day-to-day operations.
Mr Arbor of the CBOT hints that he would be prepared to go down that road,
adding that after the agreement is renegotiated, Globex 'will look more
open, more like a utility. I think the present structure may be too
restrictive.'
Such an accord may require Reuters to take a stronger hand in dealing with
the two Chicago exchanges, which have bickered over the handling of
negotiations with other exchanges. If a deal can be struck, however, any
additional members would bring new products and new users to Globex. It
would be at least a first step towards allowing the system the opportunity
to prove its worth as a trading tool that could survive into the 21st
century.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No fat, cosy system protecting
banking sector in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN MONRO-DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Peston's article on the Bank of England's aid to UK banks was
most interesting ('Silent launch of the lifeboat', October 19). However, I
found his conclusion perplexing. He argues that, although system stability
has been maintained, it came at a heavy cost, in terms both of the bail-outs
he mentioned and of market inefficiencies caused by perpetuating the
widespread belief that the Bank prefers to support banks rather than allow
the market to sort the weak from the strong.
I doubt it is true that the moral hazard cost has been a high one, but it is
virtually impossible to prove either way. However, the idea that we have a
fat, cosy system where the incompetent are protected is simply not true. In
the past few years we have seen numerous banks closing, being forced out of
the market and, in the case of BCCI, collapsing with enormous creditor
losses. We have seen runs on deposits at building societies, financial
institutions being forced to merge and volumes of loan losses at both big
and small banks never before experienced. Apart from setting the tumbrils
rolling though the City of London depositing (no pun intended) bankers at
Traitors' Gate, I cannot see what further could demonstrate a competitive
system with at times systemic risk.
Even if it were true that the cost of moral hazard were high, I cannot see
how setting up a separate supervisory institution would solve the problem.
It would he expensive and, because the new institution would find it
difficult to attract personnel of the same quality as the current Bank of
England intake, would result in a decline in the efficacy of supervision.
Losing the dignity bestowed by the Old Lady, the supervisors would join the
ranks of yet another industry 'watchdog'. (What about Ofbalance to join the
ranks of Oftel and Ofgas?)
I note that those who recommend such a change and cite other countries where
a dual system exists rarely mention the Nordic countries. I do not claim
there is a direct connection, but the staggering losses suffered by banks in
Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the huge sums the governments have had to
provide to support these banks, do not a priori make a strong case for
converting to such a system. Indeed, these countries now, in effect, have a
triple system; they have had to create a third agency to monitor the doling
out of the money. While splitting off the supervisory side would make the
life of the governor easier, it has little merit, and commentators should
concentrate on the issue of safeguarding the independence of the Bank of
England, which is a much more serious matter.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No reason to hold up Bosnia airlift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor SHIRLEY WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Please let me commend you for your leader on Bosnia ('Bosnia still',
October 22). As the world's attention moves away from Sarajevo and the other
remaining remnants of the territory of the independent, internationally
recognised nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so the Bosnian Serbs tighten the
noose. They have proved brilliant at moving whenever the world loses
interest. Yet, as you say, the United Nations Security Council has declared
its willingness to protect these enclaves, and to get humanitarian supplies
through, pledges that today clearly embarrass the western powers.
It should be possible to airlift enough food and medical supplies to these
enclaves. If Tuzia airport, still in government hands, is reopened, large
cargo aircraft could land there. It is inexplicable that this airport has
not been used because of Bosnian Serb objections. It should be possible to
protect cargo aircraft - indeed, it would give our Nato fighter aircraft,
now pointlessly and expensively overflying Bosnian air space, something
worth doing.
And it would show western resolve to stop the last flickering embers of a
brave attempt to create a civilised multi-ethnic society from being
extinguished for ever.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Biographer and historian - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The writer Sir Peter Quennell died on Wednesday at the age of 88.
The news will be heard with sadness by all who value purity and elegance of
expression in literature. Quennell was one of those for whom an ugly
sentence could cause more pain than an aching tooth.
He was a regular contributor to the Financial Times' weekly books page over
many decades. An eminent biographer himself, he was a natural choice to
review the lives of those famous or obscure authors who inhabit the highways
and byways of 18th and 19th century literature. His own extended
pen-portraits of Byron, Boswell, Baudelaire, Hogarth, Ruskin and others may
still be read with enjoyment.
But Quennell's link with the FT was stronger than that of an occasional
contributor. He was for many years joint-editor of the journal History Today
when it was part of the FT's stable of periodical publications, and he
worked from an office within the FT in Bracken House.
Quennell and his colleague, Alan Hodge, his co-editor, used to make a
striking contrast when they appeared together in the lift, the former tall
and matinee-idol-like in appearance, the latter with the anxious countenance
and concentration of a scholar. They were firm friends, however, and through
Hodge, who had served Brendan Bracken and Churchill, kept alive the spirit
of an illustrious past.
The then chairman of the FT, Lord Drogheda, was in the habit of sending
queries down about recondite literary topics to 'Peter Q' (as he always
called him) and receiving an instant response.
Born in 1905, Quennell was the son of C H B Quennell, the architect, and
Marjorie Quennell, a book-illustrator. The pair published jointly a number
of reference books of which A History of Everyday Things is the best known.
They sent Quennell to Berkhamsted Grammar School where he was a contemporary
of Graham Greene but, far from scarring him for life, it seems to have
equipped him with most of the resources required, not merely for success in
literature, but also socially.
In his youth no fashionable gathering was complete without Quennell's
handsome witty presence. He crops up with alarming frequency in the smart
memoirs of the period.
Quennell showed distinct promise as a poet in his youth, but then found his
true metier in biography and literary journalism. He reviewed for a variety
of journals with a long spell as chief book critic of the Daily Mail and he
was editor of The Cornhill Magazine in the 1940s.
Quennell had five wives and two children, a daughter Sarah and a son
Alexander, both of whom survive him. He was knighted in 1992.
Quennell was a delightful companion with an unexpected gift for mimicry, and
he will be much missed by his many friends, both for his conviviality and
for his lightly worn erudition.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Figures in a surreal landscape - Photography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKING at the hundreds of photographs by Bill Brandt, assembled in the
splendid retrospective at the Barbican, I did not see what I expected to
see. The more I looked, the more mysterious those familiar images became,
until I felt myself looking, not at a cherished record of recent history,
but at a stranger, darker world.
Image after image purported to illustrate the everyday lives of all manner
of folk, pluckily surviving in air raid shelters or enjoying the sunshine in
the park, but instead of convincing in their verisimilitude, they began to
seem more and more like exercises in fantasy, the recreation of dreams.
How could this be? How could Miss Hibbott, the Lyons Corner house 'nippy'
whose day was one of a series recorded in 1939, or Alice, the stalwart
barmaid of the 'Crooked Billet' (a strange and menacing name) at Tower
Bridge be anything other than real, brought reassuringly to life in the
Picture Post?
Then I began to realise: the people are the problem. Only very rarely do
their actions, their mundane lives, mesh with the grandeur of these dark
compositions to make photograph and subject one - the miner having his back
scrubbed beside the fire, taken in 1937, is perhaps the best example.
Otherwise, their fate is more uncertain.
Miss Hibbott, neat in her uniform, carrying her tray - so far so good. But
what is this? A visit to the hairdresser? The hairdresser stands behind her,
a huge corrugated metal tube in her hand, its monstrous coils just as
important an element of the composition as Miss Hibbott's pretty face,
smiling reservedly from beneath, its metallic framing completed by a row of
mysterious containers gleaming on the rim of the washbasin.
All the famous chronicles, from the earliest 'The English at Home' of 1936,
onward, are heavy with this sense of tension, of figures caught in a drama
whose meaning goes deeper than the mundane events chronicled.
The late nudes, which by huge close up and careful composition render naked
limbs into Henry Moore-like abstraction come as a relief, as perhaps they
did for Brandt, after so many years serving the demands of his career as a
photojournalist. For Brandt, always referred to as Britain's greatest
photgrapher of the modern era, was at heart a surrealist, drawn not so much
to the people his jobs required him to record but to the silent world of
objects, from whose random conjunctures he could hope for revelation.
His first photographs to be published, in the Surrealist journal Minotaure
in 1935, were of a group of ship's figureheads, and this interest continued
throughout his career, with his wartime work recording endangered buildings
and afterwards in series such as 'Odd corners of Museums' for Lilliput,
1944.
Brandt, born in Hamburg in 1904, came to England, his adopted home, in 1931.
It had been a fantasy land for him in childhood, a place imagined from the
colourful images of his beloved Beggarstaff brothers. And it is as a
recorder of British life that he is celebrated. But he created as much as he
observed, carefully staging scenes - stern Bobbies beneath streetlamps, boys
peeping into a pub interior - to make a London as romanticised as that of
Dickens. Only the glorious landscapes, of the Bronte country, Stonehenge, or
a journey to Skye, can stand alone, their wild beauty matching any dream.
Brandt's nudes trace the development of his work most clearly. 'Reflection'
published in Lilliput in 1949, includes that favourite surrealist device,
the open door, while a 1945 example shown barebreasted at the dining table,
embodies that other favourite surrealist theme, sexuality at the heart of
bourgeois respectability. Their development into near abstract studies,
published in 'Perspective of Nudes' in 1961, by emphasising composition so
determinedly, allowed him finally to transform flesh into form, taking it
into the realm of abstract contemplation which was his true home.
*****
The early work of one of Brandt's contemporaries at Lilliput and the first
it celebrated purely as a photographer, Erwin Blumenfeld, may be seen in an
intriging show at the Photographer's Gallery, celebrating his friendship
with the artist Paul Citroen.
While both worked as photographers, Citroen, who made an intriguing series
of portraits of the artists and intellectuals who had gathered in Amsterdam
by 1935, became chiefly celebrated for a series of collages begun in
Amsterdam and continued while studying at the Bauhaus. Much influenced by
the work of the Berlin Dada group of which both had been members, Citroen's
collages such as Metropolis, 1923, or the American Girl, 1919, create a
fantasy image of New York, the city he never visited but which became home
for his friend in 1941.
Citroen was first to try photography but it was Blumenfeld who made it his
career, becoming the highest paid photographer of his time. While the nude
studies and experiments with double images and gauzes of the 1930s shown
here demonstrate the influence of Man Ray, they also indicate that ability
to concentrate on the essence of the subject which was to make him such a
celebrated fashion and advertising photographer, dominating the New York
scene for nearly 20 years.

It is getting late in the Thatcherfest and the BBC is nearing the bottom of
the barrel. Admittedly, it was not such a bad idea to wheel on Sir Bernard
Ingham for What The Papers Said (BBC2, 7.45). He analyses the five syndromes
which afflicted the press in its coverage of the Thatcher government,
including 'Columnar Pox' - wilful refusal to check facts.
However, it seems daft to make a programme about people's recollections of
what they were doing when Mrs Thatcher resigned? The Day She Went (BBC2,
9.30) hits the barrel base with a thump.
Thus far Plant Life (C4, 9.00) hovers around GCSE level in its explication
of plant physiology. Many viewers will be disappointed that it was not more
intellectually ambitious.
Demob (ITV, 9.00) is a comedy drama as limply wet as pondweed. It stars
Griff Rhys Jones as a demobbed soldier who joins up with a spivvish friend
to become variety show entertainers.
Cellist Jacqueline Du Pre is remembered in The Marquesa's Memoirs (Radio 3,
9.55), the enjoyable musical recollections of the Marquesa de Cadaval.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Love's labour in Navarre on the Fens - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who would have thought that Love's Labour's Lost would be the RSC's
favourite play in the 1990s? Here is the company's second new production of
Shakespeare's early comedy within the last three years and there are still
new ways of doing it.
Ian Judge's direction switches the location from the park of the King of
Navarre to a Cambridge College somewhere around the 1920s. This is the best
opening interpretation of the play I have seen. For what else is the King of
Navarre doing but acting like a precocious undergraduate of an Oxbridge
college before the admission of women? He demands from his fellow students
three years of study and a ban on girls.
For a while, the interpretation works wonders. The golden young men,
otherwise the lords of the King of Navarre, stroll about in boating clothes,
happy enough in the boathouse with its display of oars and familiar
photographs of college eights. Anthony Dull, the constable, enters on a
bicycle like a policeman in an old Ealing comedy. Costard, whom he brings
with him under semi-arrest, behaves throughout like an old-fashioned college
servant, utterly loyal to the place but slightly lost when it comes to
four-syllable words.
The problem with trying to impose a single idea, however brilliant, on a
Shakespeare play is how to sustain it all the way through. Judge just about
pulls it off. He does so by changing some of the stranger characters in the
piece into college dons. That goes for Armado, the 'fantastical Spaniard' in
the original, his page Moth, the curate Sir Nathaniel and the pedant and
schoolmaster, Holofernes. They represent the over-academic side of the
college, swapping latinisms while watching cricket.
If the production flags, it is not entirely the fault of the RSC. Love's
Labour's Lost does have the odd, obscure longueur for a modern audience. The
answer is probably to apply the scissors.
Yet the mainstream is full of delights. The college quad in moonlight is a
marvellous site for the select band of students in the tryst to watch each
other composing sonnets to the ladies they are pledged to eschew. Jeremy
Northam as Berowne has the best part, but do not overlook the rest. This is
a team performance by the men, like rowing in a four.
Then Shakespeare and the women take over. It no longer matters where the
setting is, for parts of the play, especially the elegiac ending, are
powerful and some, like the performance of the Nine Worthies, are both
touching and funny. Never forget the final words of Holofernes as he is
pushed off the stage: 'this is not generous, not gentle, not humble'.
The female playing is magnificent, almost a superior intelligence
throughout. It is the reverse of Lysistrata. Here the men vow to be
celibate. The ladies of the French court know they will never stick to it,
but tease them throughout and finally tell them to hold off for another
year.
One special tribute should go to Paul Greenwood as Boyet, the lord who
accompanies the French ladies. Greenwood performs as if he is above the
whole lot of them: not a eunuch, not an academic, not an idealist, but just
genially detached. There should be a special medal for those who develop the
smaller parts in Shakespeare.
The sets are designed by John Gunter, the lighting by Alan Burrett. They are
absolutely right for Navarre on the Fens.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Pinter plays the memory game - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of what makes Harold Pinter's plays so striking, and so strange, is the
large degree to which they are poetic. His economy, his ambiguities, his
fragmentations all, it seems to me, come from a poetic impulse. And the
meanings that his plays so mysteriously lodge in your mind operate upon you
like meanings in poetry - modernist poetry in particular. The prose his
characters speak, though never fancy, feels much closer to true poetry than
most of the verse drama written this century.
In Old Times (1971), three characters begin by recollecting the past that
first brought them together. But Kate and Deeley (who may or may not be
married) and Anna (who once lived with Kate) never all shared the same past.
They are three sides who only now become aware that they form a triangle.
Deeley and Anna use memories as if competing for Kate, staking rival claims
in her past; whereas Kate, more gradually, comes to recall the past by way
of declaring her independence from them. Sometimes the 'present' time seems
to jump forward an hour or so, or 20 years back. Simple words, like 'gaze'
and 'float', keep gathering in force. Old songs, too.
Meanwhile the meanings of the play multiply and multiply. Not only are
Deeley and Anna competing for Kate, but Anna is the past, competing against
Deeley the present. Female bonding competes with male-female bonding. There
is also a sense not only that Anna will always know sides of Kate unknown to
Deeley, but also that Deeley's most sincere original feeling was for a man
he never knew - his now absurd obsession / identification with the actor
Robert Newton.
A wonderful play: funny, poignant, troubling. This Birmingham Rep revival
shows that its meanings have also increased in the light of Pinter's later
work. Bill Alexander does marvels in making the play's intimacies project
into the lengths and depths of this tricky theatre. Ruari Murchison's large,
sparse, circular set solves the problems of scale with elegance and
amplitude.
As in so many roles, Tim Pigott-Smith comes across as a naturally
insensitive type, out of his depth, with an interestingly loutish potential
for helpless violence. As usual, he slightly overdoes every inflection,
while nonetheless getting the general plan of the character vividly right.
Carol Royle's Kate however, is too preoccupied with her own lovely exterior,
while too drab in utterance. As Anna, Estelle Kohler is beautifully alert to
every nuance in the script. Even the more actressy features of her style all
serve to reveal the play.
Kohler also sings very well. Deeley and Anna quote several old songs;
Alexander is surely wrong here in omitting the specified chunks of 'Smoke
gets in your eyes' - the most telling of them all ('Something deep inside/
Cannot be denied'). But the way they sing the last stanza of 'They Can't
Take That Away from Me' - just as Pinter directs, - is superb. They are
still in competition, and yet Kate, the object of their competition, eludes
them. When Pigott-Smith hurriedly half-speaks ' - No, no, they can't take
that away from me', his words have new intimations of feeble despair.

FT  29 OCT 93 / People: RTZ's Australian swap shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of whether RTZ Corporation, the UK-based biggest mining company
in the world, controls CRA, one of Australia's leading natural resources
groups in which it has a 49 per cent stake, is a touchy subject,
particularly in Australia. Nevertheless, there is an increasing movement of
senior executives between the two.
The latest involves Leigh Clifford who will join RTZ on secondment from CRA
as an executive director in May next year. At CRA, Clifford, a 46-year-old
mining engineer, is responsible for the group's investments in energy,
including the coal operations and the most recent acquisition, Coal and
Allied.
RTZ has so far this year spent a net Dollars 480m on buying coal assets in
the US and says it has ambitions to acquire more; with Clifford on the board
it is likely that this strategy would be vigorously pursued.
Clifford is a graduate of Melbourne University and has been with CRA since
1970. Until his 1988 appointment as a group executive, he worked principally
in the lead/zinc operations.
His arrival at RTZ coincides with the return to CRA of Leon Davis who has
been on secondment to the UK company's board. His main task was to
reorganise the combined worldwide exploration activities after RTZ bought
most of British Petroleum's mining and metals assets for Dollars 3.7bn in
1989. Davis returns next May as CRA's managing director and chief executive
designate.

FT  29 OCT 93 / People: Skipper to leave Booker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barry Skipper, chief executive of Booker's food distribution division and a
member of the main board since 1982, is leaving the food distribution and
agribusiness group at the end of the year.
Skipper, who joined the group 11 years ago, had been a rising management
star until fairly recently and was viewed as a candidate for the chief
executive's job which Jonathan Taylor vacated for the chairman's suite in
June.
In the event Charles Bowen, a former Hillsdown director, was appointed chief
executive.
Skipper's ambitions suffered a serious setback in March when Booker
announced its first fall in profits since 1980 which it mainly blamed on
problems at Booker Fitch, the catering food service business, part of
Skipper's empire.
Announcing the move yesterday Taylor said Skipper had made 'an enormous
contribution' to the development of the group's food wholesaling and
distribution operations.
However, he said that with the food distribution business accounting for
such a large proportion of the group's sales and profits, 'it is now
appropriate that it reports direct to Charles Bowen, the new chief
executive, who has wide experience of the food industry'.
Yesterday Booker declined to discuss the terms of Skipper's departure.
However, it confirmed that 'there is obviously a settlement, but we would
not wish to give details', while Skipper said: 'I now look forward to
whatever challenges are ahead for me'.
He is the second senior executive to leave recently. Booker's finance
director David Turner, who was also considered a possible candidate for the
chief executive's job, last month joined GKN.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of James Hogarth as head of the capital markets group at
Yamaichi International (Europe), the London-based European arm of the
Japanese securities house, is further evidence that Japanese financial
institutions are committed to their policy of appointing more non-Japanese
employees to senior management positions.
More than half of the upper echelons at Yamaichi is now non-Japanese. The
same ratio is also evident at Nomura International, the leading Japanese
securities house and one of the first to adopt this policy of
'localisation'.
Hogarth, who joined Yamaichi as a graduate, has worked in the corporate
finance department for over seven years and at the ripe old age of 29, is
one of Yamaichi's youngest executive directors.
He takes over from Masaaki Fujimoto who recently returned to Tokyo to become
head of the European section of Yamaichi Securities' international finance
department.

FT  29 OCT 93 / People: Sotheby's - Lord Gowrie departs, Lord Camoys arrives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After months of speculation about his future, Lord Gowrie, chairman of
Sotheby's Europe, is to give up his post on January 1, but will remain on
the board of Sotheby's Holdings and will continue to seek new business.
Lord Gowrie has been chairman for seven years during which time the power
base in the American-owned company has moved remorselessly from London to
New York. A former cabinet minister and minister for the arts, Lord Gowrie
leaves at a time when some important appointments in the arts and heritage
world are about to be made, most notably chairman of the Arts Council and
chief executive of the Millennium Fund.
He is replaced by two men. Simon de Pury moves up from deputy chairman to
chairman of Sotheby's Europe while Henry Wyndham, 40, comes in as chairman
of Sotheby's UK. His is a surprise appointment. He spent most of his working
life at arch rival Christie's where he was a paintings specialist, but since
1987 has been a partner in the Mayfair picture dealers, the St James's
Group.
Lord Gowrie was instrumental in appointing Wyndham, and another newcomer to
Sotheby's, Lord Camoys (right), who arrives to take up the newly created
post of deputy chairman of Sotheby's Holdings. For 32 years Lord Camoys, 53,
has been a banker. He joins Sotheby's on April 1 next year from Barclays de
Zoete Wedd; he is to leave the Barclays group and Barclays Bank boards and
his executive role at BZW, but will remain non-executive deputy chairman of
BZW.
In a final move, Roger Faxon, who came over from the US as managing director
to mastermind a cost-cutting re-organisation at Sotheby's Europe, returns to
New York. He will be replaced by George Bailey, who was responsible for
business development.
Announcing the changes yesterday Diana Brooks, president and chief executive
officer of Sotheby's, said that Europe, and especially the UK, was helping
to lead the company out of the recession in the art market. In the first
nine months of the year Sotheby's turnover in the UK was up by 34 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology: Rewards for the scientists - ICL's career
structure for technical staff which keeps pace with managerial posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CREATIVE scientist's cartoon image has wild, flying hair, dishevelled
clothing and a manic stare - in short, a 'boffin' who ignores company
protocol, overrides management decisions and cannot comprehend the word
consensus. Try to promote him (never her) to manager and the chances are
that it will end in tears.
A caricature it may be, but there is a growing recognition in some European
high-technology companies that scientists and engineers are a prime resource
and that the management structure should be altered so that such employees
can be rewarded for the quality of their research, rather than how many
staff they control, or their skill at managing a budget.
Such is the case at ICL, the London-headquartered computer company owned by
Fujitsu of Japan. 'In some cases quite good people were trying to turn
themselves into managers so that they could advance their careers,' says
Andrew Boswell, technical director of ICL. 'But the main benefit they
brought to the business was technical.'
In 1990, after 10 years of informal arrangements, ICL introduced its
technical career structure, a 'road map', as Boswell calls it, to show
junior staff how they can develop their technical skills.
'When I talk to new recruits it is one of the things they mention. They can
decide quite specifically what will determine their advancement within the
company.'
Paul Watson, for example, joined ICL's West Gorton, Manchester, development
team three-and-a-half years ago after conducting joint research with ICL
while a lecturer at Manchester University. The research on parallel
processing computers (where numerous streams of information are processed
simultaneously) culminated in last week's launch of the Goldrush computer.
Improved salary aside, ICL's technical career structure was the big
attraction for Watson.
'I could see there were people very high up in the company who were doing
purely research. They had no line management responsibilities.'
The complexities of introducing such technical development schemes in large
and unwieldy organisations has meant that other companies are only just
beginning to follow ICL's lead.
Telecommunicaions company BT began to roll out its professional career paths
scheme this July. 'The aim is to support the career development needs for
technical and specialist staff,' explains Penelope Johnson, management
development manager.
Johnson believes the scheme will prove useful in maintaining specialists'
enthusiasm and innovative thinking within the growing demand for 'flatter'
organisations, where sideways rather than upwards moves become commonplace.
At ICL the structure, which applies to 3,000 development staff in the UK and
some of the 2,000 who work for the company overseas, outlines job levels
from technicians to the most senior engineers.
Each grade has a range of salary levels allocated to it which are equivalent
to management salary levels. Every job has a specific job description mapped
into the career structure and salary scales are published.
For the more senior engineers, promotion takes the form of review panels,
with emphasis being placed on a technical audit of a person's work.
Promotion can mean a move to another job or can involve continued
development in a project.
Those progressing up the promotional ladder are expected to take more
responsibility for the design on which their team is working, or might have
to demonstrate their ability to work with, for example, the marketing
department. 'The difference between senior levels and junior levels is that
senior-level jobs call for a higher degree of technical strategic
contribution,' says Boswell.
For those who reach the top, ICL is generous with its titular rewards. Ten
employees have been dubbed ICL fellows, the technical elite of the company.
Another 25 have been given the title of 'distinguished engineers', a scheme
introduced in April. A further 15 will be appointed shortly and eventually
there will 100 employees with the title.
The title is all the honour boasts - there is no cash reward. But says David
Brain, manager for human resources development at ICL, the title is what the
distinguished engineers want. 'At that level most engineers, in my
experience, appreciate the recognition of their engineering skills rather
than an extra Pounds 2,000 or Pounds 3,000.'
The distinguished engineer scheme has had a two-fold purpose: as well as
rewarding staff it has helped ICL bind together its engineering community as
the various divisions in the company become autonomous. Distinguished
engineers are expected to meet regularly to discuss developments and
exchange ideas.
'Our whole business success depends on our engineering and our ability to
innovate,' says Boswell. 'Unless we find ways of sharing information we will
have difficulty staying ahead.'
Peter Wharton, chief engineer and an ICL fellow, believes the technical
career scheme has been successful in acknowledging the value of the
technical staff. 'There are a lot of clever people around and we have made
them realise that they are of value. Very good programmers can stay as very
good programmers. The structure enables that.'
Wharton also believes that the structure has helped to retain skilled staff.
'We've kept together and developed some very good and strong design teams.
We've protected them from the pressures of a big company. They might
otherwise have gone into a small company where they are able to be more
innovative.'
Promoting the culture of a small, innovative company in a multinational
organisation is an extraordinarily difficult task, says Bill Baxter,
consultant in the product development division at Cambridge Consultants
(CCL), where the bread-and-butter work is product development and
consultancy for outside customers.
Baxter has done consultancy work with the consumer electronics arm of
Philips, the Dutch group, in Leuven, Belgium and the Singapore government to
help them change the culture in which research is carried out and so
increase enthusiasm and productivity.
'People come to us and say, essentially: 'Why can't our developers behave a
bit more like your developers?',' says Baxter. He believes that because most
R&amp;D work is project-based, that should form the basis of the promotion
structure.
'It makes sense to organise people so that their interests and loyalties are
centred around their project, not their boss. If an employee thinks that
licking up to his boss will get him a pay rise, that is what he'll do.'
CCL has implemented its own project-centred structure which means that when
an employee's work is assessed, it is done so by his or her managers, peers
and juniors, as well as by the project's customer. It is these responses
which influence a person's career progression, says Baxter. 'And they know
it.'
Baxter believes that altering structures can have positive effects. 'One of
the things I learnt in Singapore is that you can influence the culture by
changing the structure.'

Speed bumps, or sleeping policemen, can cause a nasty jolt to anyone driving
too fast. That is their purpose, but even those going at the correct speed
can sometimes receive an uncomfortable shock.
Inventions, a UK company, has developed a new system in which the car's
speed is evaluated by a mechanical trigger mechanism, with the ramp only
snapping up if the vehicle is going too fast. If the speed limit is adhered
to, the ramps stay flat.
Britain's Department of Transport is now looking at the system, designed to
meet the objections of those operating emergency vehicles - such as
ambulances - to conventional speed bumps.

Thieves just cannot keep their hands off computers, with ready export
markets in eastern Europe and the Middle East. Now, a British company called
Circle Security has developed an anti-theft device for computers, whether in
offices or showrooms, called Minder.
It locks the computer to the desk-top with screws extending through the work
surface to a special plate; further protection is provided by extra-strong
adhesive. Thus the computer can only be stolen with the desk. The metal
device, costing Pounds 59.50, has a seven-lever, anti-pick safe lock.

<TEXT>
To combat the growing trend of car theft, a new French device renders a
vehicle unable to be driven by disengaging the steering wheel from the
steering column, writes Anna Kochan. Anyone breaking into the car and
starting the engine finds the steering wheel turning without steering the
wheels.
The device, produced by Malvy Technology, can be fitted during assembly or
later at a cost of Ffr4,800 (Pounds 560). It consists of a sealed box
containing a series of mechanical locks which fit between the steering
column and the wheel. The key provides more than 100m combinations.
Malvy's system will become available in January. Insurance companies have
indicated they will lower premiums on cars equipped with the product. Malvy

In what no doubt made a pleasant change from poring over economic data, two
UK Treasury officials flew to Scotland earlier this year for a day's tour of
whisky distilleries. The visit was part of an orchestrated campaign by the
Scotch Whisky Association to maintain contacts with the UK's economic
policymaking department ahead of next month's Budget.
Lobbying for the Budget is - as this anecdote illustrates - an
around-the-year affair. None the less the next few weeks will see a
particular flurry of contacts between the Treasury and the outside world as
a range of groups attempt to bend the ear of Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
before he delivers his Budget strategy on November 30.
Anyone hovering outside the department's London headquarters overlooking
parliament next Tuesday will see people from an array of organisations
trooping in to argue their case. On that day, for example, officials from
the Brewers' Society (a trade group representing the beer industry), the
Trades Union Congress and the Chamber of Shipping (which represents
shipowners) are having sessions with Clarke.
Ahead of the Budget - the first to cover tax policy and public spending -
about 10 organisations have won a personal audience with the chancellor. On
these occasions he sees people with a small group of important officials.
Other groups pencilled into his diary include the Confederation of British
Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Housebuilders Federation.
At all these gatherings, the main aim of lobbyists is to convey the
importance to the UK economy of a particular sector - with reasons why it
should either be helped out by a particular dollop of special support (such
as capital allowances for investment) or should be treated favourably in the
area of tax policy.
The importance of such meetings - a traditional feature of all UK Budgets -
is questioned by some of the most experienced people in the lobbying
businesses. Mark Boleat, who recently took over as director general of the
Association of British Insurers after seven years as head of the Building
Societies Association, says the importance of the sessions is 'over-rated'.
He believes a prolonged period of contacts with the Treasury over a course
of months or years is more likely to bear fruit.
Among lobbying groups highly regarded within government circles - though
this November they have not been given a date in Clarke's diary - are the
British Film Institute, the Country Landowners Association and the British
Road Federation. These organisations - and senior managers in companies
tempted to act independently - should consider the following guidelines:
Maintain contacts. Send in literature about your sector - and the policies
you are advocating - to Treasury officials throughout the year. If you have
a special reason to invite civil servants to your factories or offices -
perhaps basing your case around the Treasury's new-found interest in sending
its civil servants out of the office more to talk to industrialists - then
follow the lead of the Scotch Whisky Association. If you have someone famous
in your circle - the film institute in the past has been adept at
introducing people at the Treasury to well-known actors - this might help
your case.
Understand the Treasury mind. One person who knows the department well says:
'I think of Treasury officials as stamp collectors. They are keen on
collecting pieces of knowledge and arranging them in nice piles and feel
fairly passionless about the result.' Bear this maxim in mind when producing
the literature, which should be concise and not contain too many jazzy
illustrations.
Do not overdo the hospitality. Most Treasury officials are difficult to
corrupt. On their visit to Scotland the two Treasury employees - with one
Customs and Excise official - paid their own airfares and were given a far
from lavish lunch. 'We wanted to illustrate the effect of whisky on the
economy, not on the palate,' says Tony Tucker, the association's public
relations manager.
Use economic models. Hire outside economic consultants to work out what
impact the tax or policy changes you are advocating will have on demand and
supply. Even if Treasury officials do not agree with your reasoning, they
will at least follow your arguments better on the grounds that many are
comfortable with models. The Centre for Economics and Business Research, a
London consultancy, has been used by the Chamber of Shipping to work out the
likely effects of changes in the tax regime on the shipping industry.
Try not to hypothesise a big drain of tax revenue from the Treasury. If
there is one thing that will dissuade Treasury officials from a particular
policy it is a large net negative stream of tax revenue - even if the policy
actions you are advocating have the potential to deliver an overall economic
boost. Therefore, always try in your economic reasoning to introduce some
extra tax revenues for the government. This could, for instance, be in five
years' time when the impact of a specific policy action - say a tax break
for a specific sector which over a longer period will lift economic activity
and so boost tax intake - has worked through.
Target others apart from the Treasury. It is important to maintain contacts
with MPs who can put pressure on ministers for policy changes and also
cultivate journalists who might write stories with a favourable 'spin' which
can help your cause.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Property: Rise in capital values offsets fall in rentals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The total return on the Investment Property Databank all-property index in
September was 1.5 per cent, thanks to a strong rise in capital values which
more than offset a cont-inued decline in rental values.
The total return on all properties for the third quarter was 3.9 per cent,
significantly higher than the first quarter figure of 0.8 per cent and the
second quarter's 2.5 per cent.
The year to date figure is 7.4 per cent, equivalent to an annualised return
of 9.7 per cent, raising the possibility that, if the most recent levels of
return continue for the remaining quarter, the figure for the year as a
whole will be back in double figures.
The strongest sectors in the month were again offices and industrial
properties.
Yields on offices fell to 9.8 per cent; and on industrial property to 11.1
per cent. For all properties, the yield was 9.6 per cent.
For the year to date, the total return on retail properties has been 9.2 per
cent; on offices 4.9 per cent; and on industrial properties 7.9 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Property: Break with the past - Planning rules on historic
buildings in the UK must be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many relics from the past should be preserved and how long should they
be retained before seeking more contemporary replacements?
This dilemma is particularly acute in relation to historic buildings in the
UK. Tough choices are inevitable; and lack of resources limits the number of
conversions of buildings that do not fit with current lifestyles or economic
needs.
Yet there is a danger that the approach to the listing of buildings could
backfire. The whole process is threatened by the increasing practice of
listing buildings which cannot be viably used.
Earlier this year Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the City of London
Corporation's policy and resources committee, warned that planning controls
on listed premises were deterring potential occupants.
He has asked English Heritage, which advises the government on these
matters, to support a code drawn up by the corporation designed to fill as
many historic buildings as possible. Behind the code are the City's twin
aims: that important buildings are places where people should be encouraged
to live and work; and that planning regulations should not, in effect, lead
to unused and empty premises.
A check must be placed on the listing process by:
inviting experts on the occupation of buildings to advise on whether a
listing should be imposed;
ensuring that candidates for listing status pass a test on whether
conserving the building is viable;
encouraging schemes which might alter existing listed buildings.
About one in every 40 buildings in England and Wales enjoys statutory
protection through listing. Although rarely enforced, the accompanying
legislation makes it an offence to demolish or even damage a listed
building.
A 1992 report by the National Audit Office, the government watchdog, on
England's heritage property found that 14 per cent of protected buildings
are vulnerable to neglect and in need of repair, with a further 7 per cent
in a poor or bad state of repair. In total, some 100,000 listed buildings,
or more than one in five, are not being maintained in the manner envisaged
by the legislation.
Yet the number of listed buildings is growing rapidly. In 1970 there were
12,000 listed premises in England and Wales; today there are 500,000.
Architectural groups such as the Twentieth Century Society are lobbying the
Heritage Department to widen the scope of listed buildings. English Heritage
has launched an initiative to list more buildings, especially modern
buildings.
The Royal Fine Arts Commission, which assesses the aesthetic merit of
proposals for listings, has suggested that it too should be authorised,
alongside the heritage secretary, to accord a listing status and to acquire
listed buildings.
Critics argue that placing more authority in the hands of unaccountable
bodies such as the RFAC is a retrograde step, as it loads the dice still
further in the favour of preservation rather than realism.
Yet amid the public debate, one question remains unanswered: who is going to
pay for the maintainance and refurbishment of such premises.
The National Audit Office indicated in its report that the UK is already
struggling to maintain its existing listed buildings. If the number of
listed buildings is to be increased then it must be accompanied by a rise in
the level of aid (currently Pounds 120m a year) to heritage groups; other
fiscal incentives should also be introduced, such as raising the level of
rating relief which is available to listed buildings.
The Department of the Environment recently took the unprecedented step of
compulsorily acquiring a grade one listed building, a former spa hotel in
Buxton, because of the failure of its owner to do anything about its
neglect. If this is a precedent, then the DoE's budget will have to be
increased to meet the needs of similar cases of neglect.
There have been 16 acts of parliament designed to conserve important
buildings. Mr David Curry, UK local government minister for England, says
that 'the planning system must balance the need for economic growth with the
need to protect our historic buildings'.
This statement, however, made in the context of a draft policy guidance on
listed buildings, does not signal any 'bonfire of legislation', as a prelude
to a new approach.
The alternative is to try and inject some confidence into the architectural
profession by inviting it to exercise a freer role in the development
process. One encouraging move was the victory by Lord Palumbo to redevelop
One Poultry in the City. The project would mean the demolition of several
listed Victorian buildings and the creation, according to the government
official's recommendation, of what 'might just be a masterpiece'.
We must be conscious of our duty to keep important relics. But rather than
the prevailing scholarly approach to listed buildings, what is required is
an injection of a more creative force. This could be just the encouragement
for architects and developers to improve or replace ageing buildings with
developments more suited to contemporary needs.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Management: Berlin connection - Efforts to alter staff
attitudes at a German cable group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rainer Hemmann has set himself two goals. As manager of KWO Kabel, the east
German cable maker bought by Britain's BICC last February, he naturally
wants his enterprise to become competitive on the world market. But he also
wants the 2,200 employees to ask questions.
'The company will only succeed if everybody takes the initiative,' says
Hemmann, who moved to east Berlin last March after BICC poached him from
Siemens. He had been running one of the German company's subsidiaries in the
Slovak Republic.
'In the old days of centralised planning, employees were penalised for
asking questions. They were not allowed to have a personal opinion,' he
explains. 'By contrast, we want to know what our staff thinks, so that
management here in Berlin can understand the local culture and what
motivates people. After all, BICC's philosophy is based on delegating
responsibility to local management.'
Last month KWO demonstrated its commitment to employee involvement by
inaugurating a DM6m (Pounds 2.5m) training programme. Spread over 30 months,
courses will include computer, management, leadership and language training.
But it is the first - 'Understanding the Business: The Enterprise in the
Market Economy' - which attempts to create a corporate identity based on
espousing the principles of the market economy.
'Over the next year, every single member of the workforce, divided into
groups of 20, will attend this two-day programme. It will focus on
understanding the BICC group, why it has bought KWO and what KWO Kabel wants
to achieve,' says John Woodthorpe, director of strategic planning.
The big challenge, though, is how to shift attitudes away from the
centralised planning structure to the needs of the market economy.
Hemmann readily concedes that this is a long process which requires a lot of
patience. 'For example, when we took over KWO, we inherited excellent
technicians and fine engineers. But nobody asked, indeed, nobody was
concerned, about the quality of the product. The staff at KWO were told to
produce a certain number of kilos of cable, which they did. But the
enterprise was producing about 20 per cent of scrap. Yet this was recorded
as production of cable.'
To cut waste, the management realised it had to link the level of wastage
with explaining the principles of the market economy. 'At first, we set out
a few clear guidelines,' says Hemmann. 'Under the centralised economy, we
tried to show how the producer was boss, but in the market economy the
customer is king; how shortages of materials were part of a planned economy,
but in a market economy, orders have to be won through quality and
competitiveness,' he added.
On a practical and often basic level, the management has had to show that
everything has a price. 'There was so much wastage. Heating was regulated by
opening or closing the window - typical of any country in eastern Europe.
Nobody thought about turning the knob on the radiator, or introducing a
thermostat system,' says Hemmann.
To help achieve a shift in values, the company has introduced two structures
of communication: a vertical system, which entails more than simply issuing
ideas from the top down - it seeks to generate discussion about them from
the bottom upwards; and a horizontal system designed to foster communication
across all departments within KWO.
The first system, the widely used cascade model, was recently introduced at
KWO. It is aimed at encouraging employees to become involved in
decision-making. 'That means asking questions,' says Woodthorpe. 'When the
management has a suggestion and we want to get feedback, we brief the team
leaders of each department. They in turn brief their own members to whom
they distribute the sheets of suggestions and invite questions or comments
about them.'
When the system was first introduced in May, there was little response from
the employees. By last month fear and deference were giving way to more open
attitudes. The management was receiving remarks and answers to 70 questions.
This method is having a positive effect on productivity. When BICC took over
KWO, average productivity was about 60 per cent below those in the cable
industry elsewhere in Europe.
To monitor the improvement, the management introduced a system of assessment
on a monthly basis. Productivity is now about 70 per cent of world levels.
The scrap ratio has fallen to 2 per cent. The target is 0.8 per cent by
1995.
The horizontal, or second method of communication, cuts across all
departments in KWO and is regarded as equally important for changing old
habits and reflexes. 'When BICC took over KWO, a strong fief mentality
existed in the enterprise. People were penalised for trying to do more than
what their job description spelt out. There was no concept of the internal
customer,' says Hemmann.
'For instance, if we want to design a new cable, it cannot be done in a
vacuum. The employees must know the nature of the product, the costs, the
availability of equipment, the marketing and the needs of our customers.
'In other words, to get a product off the ground we need a horizontal system
of communication. KWO is an integrated structure, each department depending
on each other for success and winning customers. This helps forge a much
stronger understanding and corporate identity with the company because
everyone is involved.'
Strengthening the employees' identification with the company may also help
the staff overcome any suspicion that KWO is just another foreign-owned
company in eastern Germany managed by wessies, or west Germans, who will
look down on the ossies, or easterners. This is a prevailing view, although
diminishing, among east Germans.
'I do not make any distinction about where anybody comes from,' Hemmann
insists. 'Everybody is a KWO employee. If you start creating different
categories (between westerners and easterners) you will never achieve the
corporative objective of making one company.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / Glass ceiling 'shows no cracks'
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 8 per cent of top executives in Britain are women, and the higher up
the corporate hierarchy, the fewer women there are, a survey of 29,000
executives in 533 companies shows.
Mr Paul Gregg and Mr Stephen Machin from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research and the London School of Economics say that women are
paid less than men even if working in the same job.
'There does appear to be a glass ceiling blocking the promotion of women to
the highest jobs and it does not appear to be cracking,' they conclude.
BBC Television has reached its equality target for women in senior
positions, three years ahead of schedule, delegates at the Institute of
Personnel Management in Harrogate were told yesterday.

FT  29 OCT 93 / New attack on credit advert rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL of Mortgage Lenders has backed calls for simpler and more
streamlined regulations on advertising consumer credit.
The council, which represents building societies and centralised lenders
such as banks, told an Office of Fair Trading inquiry on the working and
enforcement of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 that the rules were not
justified on consumer protection grounds.
Mr Michael Coogan, head of legal services for the council, said that the
regulations were too prescriptive and that simplifying them would make them
more effective.
Both the council and the British Bankers' Association criticised the
obligation on lenders to provide written quotations on request.
Mr Coogan told the OFT that while in theory written quotations benefited the
consumer, in practice very few people asked for them.
Even the association, which was much more cautious about deregulation,
argued that a full advertisement would meet most consumers' requirements.
Both organisations also strongly opposed the implementation of the
'tying-in' provisions of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.
These would specify what information banks and building societies should
provide when offering a house insurance and residential mortgage package.
The council and association argued that consumers could be better protected
in other ways.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Banks make a charge for small businesses: Competition is
growing in the search for new clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A delegation from the Federation of Small Businesses tells Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, this morning what it wants to see in the Budget the
long-term financing of small businesses will be high on the agenda.
Traditionally, the banks have been cast as the villains, and the
federation's pre-Budget submission to the Treasury still describes some
banks as 'fair-weather friends'.
But the signs are that the high street banks are intensifying their
competition to woo small business clients.
Banks say competition has been intense for small-business clients even in
the recession, but the arrival of a fragile recovery has clearly
concentrated minds.
One bank official said: 'Now is the time for investing for the long term, to
take on new small businesses.'
On Monday Lloyds cut charges for about 350,000 small businesses and
announced that from January small-business customers would get a breakdown
of transaction charges and debit interest before they were debited from
accounts.
At the same time, Midland's new advertising campaign - highlighting that it
has Pounds 1bn to lend to viable businesses - is the most obvious sign of
its aggressive lending policy for small businesses.
NatWest's rather sadly timed statement, also this week, of slight increases
in its charges to about 1m small-business customers was accompanied by heavy
emphasis on a new option of paying charges on a monthly rather than a
quarterly basis, in order to help with cashflows.
Mr John Harris, federation chairman, who will lead the delegation to the
Treasury, welcomed the Lloyds move as 'a gesture in the right direction'. He
added: 'We condemn NatWest's move.'
However, he agreed to some extent with the banks' argument that the charging
structure is not the sole basis on which small businesses should judge them.
Ms Jane Bradford, head of NatWest's small business services, said: 'It's
important to recognise that less than 50 per cent of all small businesses
actually borrow from banks, so we must be competitive in other ways.'
Mr Harris's main concern is that increased competition will be focused on
winning new business rather than adopting a more helpful attitude towards
existing clients. Although it costs banks more to attract new customers than
to retain existing ones, once a small business has chosen a bank it tends
not to move.
Mr Harris highlighted the position of businesses that had survived the
recession but now had cashflow problems as orders started to come in. Some
were finding it hard to convince bank managers that they were good risks.
He said: 'It might be easier for someone with a new idea and a business plan
to borrow money. The aggressive competition is to find the 'sure thing'. We
would ask banks to look hard at their loyalties.'
One bank official said: 'We're obviously going to try to continue to support
existing business, but new businesses are starting under more realistic
conditions and are more hard-nosed.'
While existing customers will benefit from reduced charges, other banks see
an emphasis on new customers in the Lloyds price cut.
Mr Mike Shaw, head of business banking at Lloyds, said the cut in charges
was a 'reward' for existing customers, but Lloyds' rivals saw it as an
attempt to win a greater market share.
Even if small businesses are not satisfied, fiercer competition is likely to
have greater impact on their relationship with banks than either Mr Clarke's
inquiry into the availability of funding or the meetings between Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, and senior figures in the
clearing banks.
Mr David Lavarack, head of small business services at Barclays, is clear
that it is competition that is driving the changes.
'It's the marketplace. At the end of the day no discussion with the
governor, or Treasury inquiry, is going to affect banks' long-term policy.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / US group cuts 200 jobs in Ayrshire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 200 workers in Ayrshire will lose their jobs at the end of the year
when Conner Peripherals, the US disk-drive maker, stops production at its
assembly plant in Irvine. The plant has been operating for only 3 1/2 years.
Another 100 employees will stay on to run the site as a distribution and
service centre.
The California-based company blamed competition from non-European countries,
which it said enjoyed lower costs and duty-free access to the European
market. Recently it reported a loss for the third quarter of this year.
The company said it would review its manufacturing requirements annually.
Conner once claimed to be the fastest growing company in US history. When it
started operations in Scotland it spoke of investing Pounds 50m and of
creating 1,500 jobs. Employment at Irvine peaked at 415 in 1991.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Benefits mistakes hit record Pounds 716m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISTAKES IN the amount of social security paid to millions of unemployed
people, single parents and low-income pensioners have reached a record
level, the National Audit Office says today.
The public expenditure watchdog says that errors in the payment of income
support, the basic safety-net benefit, were Pounds 716m in 1992-93, 4.8 per
cent of the Pounds 15bn total.
Sir John Bourn, head of the watchdog, says that the Benefits Agency paid
claimants Pounds 575m more in income support than they were entitled to.
Much of this cannot be recovered because it is due to errors in calculating
and paying benefits, which are written off. Underpayments of Pounds 141m
will normally be paid when they are discovered.
Sir John, who is responsible for auditing the accounts of government
departments, has qualified the agency's accounts because of the errors.
More than Pounds 134m of the overpayments were due to problems in paying
claimants' mortgage interest direct to lenders, introduced last year as part
of measures to help reduce mortgage repossessions.
The value of errors has more than doubled in the past five years in spite of
efforts by the Benefits Agency to bring it down to 2 per cent of the value
of the benefit.
Mr Michael Bichard, the agency's chief executive, said that he had
introduced a series of measures to deal with the errors. These included
management reviews of the worst-performing offices, more automatic
processing of payments and additional checks on complex cases.
Sir John has also qualified the accounts over uncertainties about whether
correct payments have been made on housing benefit, where Pounds 82m has
been repaid to 89 local authorities for 1990-91 and 1991-92 on claims which
the auditors have been unable to verify.
There are also uncertainties about the amounts refunded to employers for
statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. The office has raised doubts
about the accuracy and completeness of employers' annual returns setting out
the amounts deducted from national insurance payments.

<TEXT>
Skiers returning to London's City airport need not look far if they want to
invest in their skills. A dry ski slope is for sale in east London, less
than a mile from the end of the runway. The site, initially owned by the
London Docklands Development Corporation, has had a chequered history. The
original developers spent about Pounds 900,000 on it but the receiver to its
present owner is seeking offers of about Pounds 350,000. Mr Robert
Matusiewicz of BDO Binder Hamlyn believes it could generate revenue of about
Pounds 300,000 a year and says there has already been interest in the
development, built on reclaimed land.

FT  29 OCT 93 / National Audit Office qualifies Department of Health
accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Audit Office has qualified the accounts of the Department of
Health over payments to health authorities. The main reason is the failure
of the National Health Service management executive to staunch losses at the
troubled South Birmingham health authority, John Willman writes.
The authority inherited losses of Pounds 10.5m when it was created in 1991
but there will be an accumulated deficit of Pounds 25m by April next year.
The authority's finances have continued to deteriorate, according to the
watchdog, in spite of a Pounds 16m package of support and close monitoring
by the West Midlands regional health authority.
In addition, the watchdog has qualified the accounts over an unauthorised
payment of Pounds 78,000 made by Wessex regional health authority to a
former director of information on leaving office.
The health authority is considering whether it can recover part or all of
the money.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Official optimism on unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S chief employment adviser revealed yesterday that economic
strategies were being planned in the belief that unemployment had peaked.
In a break with normal practice Mr Nick Monck, permanent secretary at the
Department of Employment, disclosed at the Institute of Personnel Management
conference in Harrogate that the government was optimistic the jobless
figures would fall to the end of the century. He said: 'Unemployment seems
to have passed its peak and employment rose between 1.25m and 1.5m over the
last cycle.'
Mr Monck cited a list of factors for optimism, including a competitive
exchange rate, falling labour costs and spare capacity. 'Employers also seem
to be taking on labour earlier than in past recoveries,' he said. 'Provided
we do things right there is an exceptional opportunity for economic success
between 1993 and the end of the century.'
The unemployment rate - a key factor in economic planning - has fluctuated
throughout the year, falling by 13,600 last month to 2.91m after two months
of increases.
Mr Michael Osbaldeston, chief executive of Ashridge Management College, did
not share the optimism and said it was 'very dangerous' to assume that the
recent fall heralded a period of low unemployment. He said: 'Unemployment
reductions always lag behind a recovery. It took three years before UK
unemployment started to fall after the last recession in the early 1980s.'
Full employment would be a 'fiction' for the rest of the century. He
predicted that the acceptable unemployment rate of 3 per cent to 4 per cent
would not be seen in the UK for the foreseeable future.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, warned against introducing flexible
working practices simply because they were a modern idea. He said
flexibility was trundled out to support government employment policies -
such as the abolition of working councils, the end of employment protection
for nearly a third of the workforce, and the growth of 'poverty pay'.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Pounds 200m funding shortage may delay Channel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 200m funding shortage could delay further work on preparing the
high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel, the government
will be told today.
Union Railways, the company set up to develop the link, will today present
the results of a six-month public consultation exercise to the Department of
Transport. It held hundreds of meetings with residents' groups and others to
hear views on the government's proposed route into a north London terminus
at King's Cross or St Pancras.
The report includes requests from residents for a doubling of the length of
tunnels on the line to reduce the environmental impact. Such a move would
add Pounds 350m to the Pounds 2.6bn cost.
The report also contains an evaluation of an overground terminus at St
Pancras compared with the original proposal for an underground station at
King's Cross, and proposals for three extra intermediate stations. It says
that a terminus at St Pancras would be several hundred million pounds
cheaper than one at King's Cross. The approach to St Pancras would be
overground along existing track and fewer alterations to the existing
station would be needed.
Union Railways calculates that it will need Pounds 200m to finance the
passage of legislation through parliament, complete detailed design work and
buy land over the next two years. Private contractors and banks are thought
unlikely to want to commit themselves before the legislation has been
passed.
Union Railways has made detailed forecasts of the likely costs of the
project but has little firm information on likely revenues. It is unclear to
what extent the tunnel will create new traffic or take it from airlines or
ferry companies. More information on revenues will be available when trains
start running from Waterloo Station on existing British Rail track from next
May.
The government is expected to announce a decision on the route by the end of
the year and the project is due for completion by 2001.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Exports approved 'on eve of Gulf war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET approved defence-related machine-tool exports to Iraq two weeks
before the invasion of Kuwait and a week after its main intelligence arm
warned of a significant Iraqi military build-up, it emerged yesterday.
Documents made available to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry show that Lady
Thatcher, then prime minister, personally approved, following a cabinet
meeting on July 19 1990, the issuing of the export licences for the last
batch of machine tools made by Matrix Churchill.
A report prepared by the Joint Intelligence Committee dated July 12 1990
warned that Iraq was well advanced in developing chemical and nuclear
capabilities and in its conventional weapons programme using western
components. The report highlighted Matrix Churchill as an important supplier
to Iraq and involved in a weapons system programme code-named K1000.
Mr Ian McDonald, an MoD official responsible for vetting defence exports to
Iraq, told the inquiry the report was 'highly relevant' and should have
influenced subsequent decisions on the granting of licences for the machine
tools.
He said he should have seen the report at the time, but did not. Instead it
went directly to his minister, Mr Alan Clark, who was among ministers who
later approved the licences.
Mr McDonald told the inquiry that by 1990 the perception shared by ministers
was that the time had come to 'cut the cackle' and accept that guidelines
restricting defence exports to Iraq were no longer relevant.
'It was a situation in which we were losing control of reality,' Mr McDonald
said.
The hearing continues on Monday.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Tory rail rebels back compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night appeared to have headed off a Tory backbench
revolt over rail privatisation after Sir Keith Speed, leader of the
potential rebel MPs, backed a compromise allowing British Rail to bid for
some franchises.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has tabled an amendment to a Lords
amendment to the privatisation bill preventing BR bidding for any franchise
for which there is a 'credible' alternative, either a management buy-out or
a private-sector bidder.
In practice the franchising director is unlikely to allow BR to bid for more
than a few of the 25 franchise areas. But Mr MacGregor conceded last night
that BR would now certainly continue to operate some services.
Government officials said potential Tory dissidents who threatened to rebel
over the original plans, under which BR would not have had the right to bid,
had said they would support this latest move.
Asked whether the partial retreat was simply aimed at preventing another
backbench rebellion Mr MacGregor said: 'This is not a sleight of hand. It
will still be possible for BR to bid (for franchises).'
The Lords' amendment gave BR the right to bid for franchises. This was
opposed by the government because it would give BR the ability to undercut
competitors by cross-subsiding its bid with revenues from other services.
Mr MacGregor is understood to believe his proposals will encourage buy-outs
and prevent BR, which will not be able to cross-subsidise bids, from winning
more than a small minority of the franchises.
During an exchange at prime minister's questions Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, accused the government of 'blatant and discreditable' manoeuvres by
introducing amendments to allow BR to bid for franchises, but under strict
conditions. Mr Smith claimed the government was indulging in a 'cynical
trick'.
Mr John Major replied: 'You accuse us of shams while a Labour transport
spokesman had accused the government of a U-turn - it can't be both.'
Later Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, wrote to the prime
minister taking issue with him over his comments and saying no Labour
frontbench spokesman had accused the government of such a U-turn.
The franchises will be established gradually over the next few years. Mr
MacGregor is understood to expect only one or two to be set up next year
after BR has created 25 'shadow' franchises.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Plans to deregister architects scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHITECTS were claiming victory last night after the government climbed
down over plans to end more than 60 years of statutory registration for the
profession.
The plan to deregister architects had caused deep resentment. Ending
registration would have allowed anyone in the European Community to use the
title.
But following a campaign by the Royal Institute of British Architects,
supported by the Royal Society and the National Consumers Council, the
government has decided not to repeal the Architects (Registration) Act. The
move was to be part of the government's deregulation bill.
Baroness Denton, junior environment minister, said in a parliamentary answer
that the government understood the strength of feeling against the removal
of statutory protection of title.
It now plans to examine measures which could simplify the profession's
system of self-regulation.
Dr Francis Duffy, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects,
said: 'It is now important that we seize the opportunity to reshape the
profession in a form that is more able to deal with current and future
challenges.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / Judge's ruling deepens controversy over RSI: What effect the
decision will have on future cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOES IT exist? The question will occupy the courts in a series of claims
that repetitive strain injury (RSI) should be a recognised industrial
injury.
RSI is the umbrella term for disorders with various symptoms, which include
swelling and chronic pain in the hands, arms and shoulders. The Health and
Safety Executive, the government watchdog, avoids the term as it implies
problems are only caused by repetition, and talks instead of upper limb
disorders.
Yesterday the existence of RSI was thrown into question when Judge John
Prosser dismissed a damages claim by Mr Rafiq Mughal, a former journalist
with the Reuters news agency, that his work conditions using computer
keyboards were responsible for injuries to his upper limbs.
In previous High Court rulings judges have accepted the existence of RSI. Mr
John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said yesterday that his union
had recovered more than Pounds 1m in compensation for RSI suffers since
1987. He said: 'Does the judge think that companies like Slazenger, Birds
Eye, Findus and KP Foods have paid compensation to our members because of a
figment of their imagination?'
Resolution of the conundrum is of some significance to employers, many of
which have already paid significant sums in compensation. Among cases
awaiting consideration by the courts are 23 brought by employees and former
employees of the Financial Times Group, mainly newspaper journalists.
Doctors and RSI specialists are divided. The British Medical Journal
described RSI as 'often misdiagnosed and often not work-related'.
Mr Peter Wells, a specialist in upper limb disorders, said some doctors did
not believe in RSI - many said it was 'all in the mind'.
His 29 years of clinical experience was contrary to that, he said. But he
added: 'The only way we will convince people of its existence is to extend
the research. The fact that it has not been proven is not evidence that it
does not exist.'
Diagnosis can be difficult because there are many patterns of symptoms and
signs.
Dr Paul Davies, a senior policy official at the Health and Safety Executive,
said: 'Upper limb disorders can be caused in a number of ways - for example
sport injuries like tennis elbow - but there is good medical evidence that
relates them in some cases to the work people do.' There were a number of
causes from bad posture to repetitive movements over a long period.
The executive has published guidance for employers on how work-related
problems can be avoided.
Dr Davies said it was up to the individual to provide medical evidence to
satisfy the courts that the injury was a result of negligence on the part of
the employer and that there were no other causes.
He is supported by lawyers who argue that yesterday's judgment does not mean
future RSI claims are bound to fail. Mr Peter Woods, solicitor for the
National Union of Journalists, which backed yesterday's action, said all
claims would turn on proving a causal link between the injury and working
conditions. Whether RSI was a meaningless term in itself was a side issue,
he said.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Discount clubs face strict tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAREHOUSE shopping clubs should still be assessed as retailers in spite of
Wednesday's ruling in the High Court that a local authority had been right
to treat the UK's first proposed discount club as a wholesaler, the
government said yesterday.
The UK's three biggest supermarket chains, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway,
had attempted to block the development, by US club operator Costco, at
Thurrock, Essex. They said that the warehouse should have been considered a
retailer, not a wholesaler, and been subjected to tougher planning criteria.
But Mr Justice Schiemann ruled on Wednesday that Thurrock was entitled to
assess the project as a wholesaler.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday it expected local
authorities to abide by its planning policy guidance note PPG6, issued in
July, which advised that 'planning decisions should regard (warehouse clubs)
as retail uses'.
The joint planning consultant for the three supermarket chains said
yesterday that Wednesday's judgment had not ended the debate over warehouse
clubs.
Mr John Littman of Rapleys, the commercial property agents, said: 'This
might be regarded as the first skirmish, but there are still many issues to
be decided.
Both Mr Littman and the DoE stressed yesterday that the judgment referred to
one case, where planning permission had been granted before the publication
of PPG6.
The department said its note did not seek to define warehouse clubs as
retailers or suggest that they should only be granted retail planning
consent. But it did advise that authorities should apply the same strict
tests to warehouse club applications as they did to retailers, regardless of
the type of planning permission sought.
Warehouse clubs sell a range of products from computers to cat food in huge,
spartan sheds at discount prices to fee-paying members.
Mr Littman said the three supermarket chains had not decided whether to
continue their battle to establish a legal definition of warehouse clubs as
retailers. They are debating whether to proceed with similar legal action
already initiated against UK cash and carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which
plans to open a warehouse club at Wednesbury, West Midlands.
Retailers' shares continued to fall amid market rumours that Sainsbury was
to launch a pre-Christmas price war.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Jobless figures 'not absolute'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN measure of UK unemployment, the monthly claimant count, is a useful
indicator of changes in labour market pressures but not an accurate measure
of absolute levels of unemployment, according to Mr Peter Stibbard, director
of statistics at the Employment Department.
Mr Stibbard's comments, made at a meeting of the Labour Market Statistics
Users' Group yesterday, will be exploited by opposition parties and
unemployment campaigners who have long criticised the claimant count for
underestimating real unemployment.
The unemployment measure has been changed several times since the start of
the 1980s and unemployment campaigners say it would be nearly 1m higher if
it was calculated as it was before 1982. To qualify for the current count an
individual must be claiming unemployment benefit or income support and be
available for work. That excludes nearly 1m people who are included in the
broader International Labour Organisation definition.
Those excluded are about 100,000 young people who are not on Youth Training
schemes but are not eligible for benefit, 250,000 married women and several
thousand other people - including many single mothers - who are on other
benefits such as sickness and disability benefit.
The UK's claimant count includes nearly 1m who are excluded by the ILO
definition - mainly people who are signing on but are not actively seeking
work and people who are working, but only for a few hours each week.
Although the divergence between the two measures did have the effect of
reducing unemployment by as much as 250,000 in the late 1980s they have been
at about the same level for the past three years.
Mr Stibbard's broader comments on the accuracy of the claimant count are
politically sensitive but have long been accepted by labour market
statisticians.
Some statisticians welcomed the fact that Mr Stibbard had made his comments
in public as evidence of a new 'glasnost' over employment statistics.
The meeting yesterday heard calls for a broader base of measures to be
issued each month, as in the US. Mr Stibbard did not rule out establishing a
group to advise on whether that would be practical but he warned that the
costs might be prohibitive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of top personnel managers say their companies' productivity is
growing and expect further increases in the next 12 months. A MORI poll of
181 delegates at the Institute of Personnel Management Conference found that
80 per cent reported productivity increases in the past year. Nearly half
said the improvement had been better than 3 per cent.
Some 60 per cent said their workforce had fallen in the past year: 15 per
cent of those by more than a tenth.
Most managers said their companies had improved cost-effectiveness,
profitability and business success, but at a price. Some 81 per cent of them
reported increased stress levels among staff and 61 per cent believed
employee morale had deteriorated.

Mr Paul Gregg and Mr Stephen Machin from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research and the London School of Economics take issue with the
claim that women are increasing their share of the top executive jobs -
defined as ranging from chief executive level to senior middle management.
They also find that women are paid less than men even if working in the same
job.
'There does appear to be a glass ceiling blocking the promotion of women to
the highest jobs and it does not appear to be cracking,' they conclude.
The BBC Television network has reached its equality target for women in
senior positions, three years ahead of schedule, it announced yesterday,
Richard Donkin writes.
Ms Joanne Serpliss, deputy head of the BBC Television equal opportunities
department, told delegates at the Institute of Personnel Management
conference in Harrogate yesterday that the target had been reached earlier
in the year.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Miners dig themselves into a corner: James Buxton explains
how an experiment in going-it-alone came to grief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE'S a great deal of raw emotion among the lads today,' said Mr Jackie
Aitchison. 'They are extremely disappointed'.
Mr Aitchison was speaking about the reaction of the 167 miners who each
invested Pounds 10,000 in Monktonhall Mineworkers - the consortium of which
he is chairman - to the takeover offer by RJB Mining. This values their
stakes at Pounds 1,000 each, but they are being told there is no
alternative.
Raw emotion, sometimes bordering on paranoia, has been a recurring theme in
this sad story of the attempt by a consortium of miners to reopen a pit and
prove that they can make a profit where British Coal failed.
They are not alone in asking why financial support from government and local
authorities should be available now, when it was denied to the consortium
after it was formed in 1991.
The consortium's bid to take over Monktonhall was opposed by Labour members
of Lothian regional council. The National Union of Mineworkers was also
opposed to the project.
But the miners were supported by Conservative and other politicians, and in
December 1991 British Coal offered them the lease of the pit, rejecting a
bid by Caledonian Mining, a private mining company from Nottingham.
The miners met Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, then a junior energy minister, and
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Office industry minister. They received
encouragement but no financial assistance.
Price Waterhouse, the miners' financial advisers, failed to persuade any
financial institution to put money into Monktonhall, although Bank of
Scotland made a bridging loan which turned into a longer-term relationship,
now likely to end in a Pounds 1.8m write-off.
Instead the first 110 miners put in an astonishing Pounds 10,000 each,
mostly by borrowing, to raise Pounds 1.1m, thus guaranteeing themselves a
job. Mr Jim Parker, a former British Coal manager who was Monktonhall's
managing director, said that no one was deceived about the risks. He also
said: 'Men here in their 30s are going to make a lot of money at
Monktonhall'.
The company had the barest minimum of capital when it took over the mine in
June last year. But all would have been well, Mr Aitchison said yesterday,
if the miners had been able to start production that September and start
earning revenue.
Unfortunately much of the secondhand mining equipment which they had bought
failed, and they encountered adverse geological conditions in reopening the
first face. Mr Parker left the company in December. By the time full
production started in January the company was heavily in debt.
In late February Monktonhall announced that it was seeking an outside
investor, but when Caledonian Mining responded it was publicly brushed off.
In March, with the miners, now numbering 180, having worked for two weeks
without pay, Lothian region appointed the merchant bank Quayle Munro to
assess the situation. Quayle Munro reported that Monktonhall would be viable
only if new coal faces were opened up, costing Pounds 3m.
The bank then started looking for another investor.
RTZ and Hanson declined. On September 1 RJB Mining signed a letter of intent
and started guaranteeing the miners' wages.
The day before Quayle Munro had publicly criticised the consortium after it
sent a delegation to seek money from the Libyan government.
The miners face the loss of most of their investment but not of their jobs.
Recriminations over who is to blame are just starting.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Ford expects sharp fall in output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD OF Britain has warned that it expects a sharp fall in vehicle
production in the UK. The warning came yesterday as it offered a two-year
pay deal - a 1.8 per cent rise from next month and 2.5 per cent next year.
The company, which has lost more than Pounds 1m a day since 1990, is seeing
a small upturn in UK demand but that is more than cancelled out by a decline
from continental Europe.
Ford told unions that vehicle production in the UK was expected to fall to
392,000 this year from 447,000 last year, with the percentage for export
falling from 34 per cent last year to 19 per cent this year.
Ford management rejected the unions' claim for a 'substantial' pay rise and
a formal job security package, and hinted that the company's practice of
avoiding compulsory redundancy might have to be abandoned.
It also said that it wanted to reduce lay-off pay by 20 per cent. At present
workers laid off receive full basic pay, which cost the company Pounds 35m
in 1991 and last year.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, motor industry negotiator for the AEEU craft union, said:
'We're bitterly disappointed that they could not respond to our proposals on
job security. If it's good enough for Toyota, Nissan and Rover then it
should be good enough for Ford.'
The unions said they expect an improved offer when they meet again on
November 11. But the company will be reluctant to move further especially as
it now feels it paid too much in the two-year deal to next month. Union
officials took some consolation from the company's offer of greater employee
participation in the company pension fund.
Ford estimates that the overcapacity in the European car industry by the
late 1990s will reach 7m units. Ford itself is now using only about 70 per
cent of its European capacity and market share in the UK is continuing to
fall to about 21.7 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 93 / BAe may build train body shells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace, Britain's biggest aircraft maker, is considering a return
to its roots in the locomotive business.
Executives at the company's Chadderton site at Oldham, Lancashire, are
considering bidding for the contract to build train body shells for the
extension to London's Jubilee line.
The go-ahead for the extension is expected to be announced today.
The company, confirming a report in Modern Railways magazine, said
yesterday: 'We have had some exploratory work into the rolling stock
business.'
A rail contract would take BAe back to an industry it forsook more than 50
years ago to build military air-craft for Britain's war effort. The move
would be logical for the company, which has seen markets eroded by cuts in
defence spending, heavy competition in civil aircraft and the recession.
The Chadderton site specialises in machining aluminium components for Airbus
aircraft. This technology would be applied to lightweight train wagons.
GEC-Alsthom is leading the race to win the main Pounds 300m contract to
build 59 six-wagon trains for the Jubilee line. If BAe is successful in its
bid, it will build body shells for the winner of the main contract.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Treason charges on Hurd dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHARGE OF treason against Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has been
dismissed as 'misconceived and totally without foundation' by the Crown
Prosecution Service.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, made the disclosure last night in
a parliamentary written answer. He told Sir Teddy Taylor, the Euro-sceptic
Tory MP for Southend East, that the CPS had written to the clerk to the
justices at Hexham, Northumberland to inform them of the decision last week.
Yesterday's developments came about six weeks after a last-ditch attempt to
throttle the Maastricht treaty was made by laying seven charges of treason
against the ministers who signed it - Mr Hurd and the former Treasury
minister Mr Francis Maude. Treason still carries the death penalty.
The men behind the move were businessman and Conservative political
economist Mr Rodney Atkinson - brother of comic Rowan Atkinson - and Mr
Norris McWhirter, chairman of the Freedom Association. Mr McWhirter
threatened a judicial review if the CPS did not act.
Meanwhile, the government last night named the 24 local authority members
who will serve on the EC's Council of the Regions. The move implements a
requirement forced on ministers by a defeat during the tortuous passage of
the Maastricht Act.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Takeover will leave workers out of pocket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB MINING, the private Nottinghamshire mining company, yesterday made a
formal offer to take over Monktonhall Mineworkers, the miners' consortium
which operates a pit near Edinburgh, for Pounds 167,000.
The 167 members of the consortium, who each paid Pounds 10,000 for their
share, are being offered Pounds 1,000 per share.
The board of Monktonhall is recommending the miners to accept the offer. It
is telling them that if they do not do so the company will go into
liquidation. It lost Pounds 3.7m in the year ended May 31 and has net
liabilities of Pounds 2m.
The offer from RJB Mining, which was floated on the stock exchange in June,
is likely to end the shortlived coal miners' consortium which leased
Monktonhall from British Coal last year. It was undercapitalised and
suffered initial production difficulties in spite of having contracts to
sell its output.
The takeover would avert liquidation but would mean Bank of Scotland, the
secured creditor, writing off Pounds 1.8m. RJB would invest Pounds 3m in
developing Monktonhall and expect to receive a subsidy from the Department
of Trade and Industry.
Lothian regional council, which refused to help Monktonhall Mineworkers when
it was formed, would provide a subsidy. Scottish Power would remain
Monktonhall's main customer.
The directors of Monktonhall Mineworkers will resign if the offer is
accepted and Mr Bert Brown, the managing director, will leave.
RJB would offer shareholders who took voluntary severance the sum of Pounds
3,000. Those who remained employees would have a production-related bonus
scheme which, if targets were met, would mean payments of up to Pounds 3,000
for next year and a further Pounds 1,000 for 1995. RJB expects to retain
almost all the current workforce 182 men.
The miners have until November 18 to decide on the offer. RJB is insisting
on a 90 per cent level of acceptance to make the offer valid.
Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of Monktonhall, said it was disappointing that
Monktonhall had not been able to go it alone.
He refused to say whether anyone had let the consortium down, or comment on
the fact that the DTI and Lothian region, which were now offering finance,
had previously refused it.
For RJB the purchase of Monktonhall, which has current capacity of 300,000
tonnes a year, is a chance to expand its deep-mined output.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Ministers deadlocked on public spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT remained deadlocked on public spending cuts yesterday after
ministers failed to reach agreement at a marathon three-hour cabinet
meeting.
Downing Street said 'substantial progress' had been made on a package of
spending cuts presented to the cabinet by the EDX expenditure committee. But
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was forced to refer the issue to a
special cabinet meeting on Tuesday after several spending ministers objected
to the EDX proposals.
Ministers said much of yesterday's cabinet was taken up with discussions on
Ulster, rail privatisation, the Sheehy report on reforms to the police
service and today's European Community summit.
The most trenchant opposition to the EDX package came from Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, defence secretary, who has fought against proposed cuts of up to
Pounds 1bn. Mr Rifkind is understood to have headed off a significant
proportion of the threatened cuts, partly by threatening to call for a
full-scale defence review. He warned, however, that any attempt to make more
than token cuts in the Pounds 23bn defence budget risked provoking a
substantial backbench rebellion.
Fourteen Conservative MPs have written to Mr Major threatening to oppose
substantial defence cuts. Several other Tories are thought to sympathise
with the rebels.
Other ministers objected to the EDX package, including Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
Most other ministers are understood to be happy with the EDX
recommendations, which are intended to implement the cabinet's earlier
decision to limit next year's public spending total to Pounds 253.6bn.
There was a degree of optimism that the critical ministers would fall into
line on Tuesday, removing the need to reopen negotiations.
Mr Major has made clear to the spending ministers, however, that he will not
hesitate to refer the whole package to EDX if necessary. This has increased
pressure on ministers to settle on Tuesday or risk seeing their budgets
further reduced in a fresh round of argument in EDX.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is keen to reach early agreement on
spending so that he can finalise the revenue side of the first unified
Budget, to be delivered on November 30. But he faces deep divisions among
Tory backbenchers over the balance to be struck between spending cuts and
tax increases.

THE Church of England's General Synod did not exceed its powers when it
asked parliament to approve a legislative measure for the ordination of
women, the High Court said yesterday.
It ruled against the Church Society, which had argued that an act of
parliament was needed to sanction the move as it amounted to a 'funda mental
change' in Church doctrine. The Church Society said it would not appeal.

THE GOVERNMENT has decided not to blow the froth off a pint of beer, Philip
Rawstorne writes.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, yesterday announced that
pubs would be allowed to continue serving a pint that included 'a reasonable
head'.
The costs of the proposed change to the law, due next April, would have been
out of proportion to the benefits to consumers, he said in a Commons written
reply. Larger glasses and new bar equipment would have added an estimated 7p
to the price of a pint.
The Brewers' Society has advised pubs that the frothy head should not exceed
5 per cent of the pint.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Salvation Army given right to recover Dollars 1.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge yesterday ordered that the Salvation Army had the right
to recover up to Dollars 1.25m in payments, which may have been channelled
to a Birmingham businessman and one of his companies as part of an alleged
fraud.
Sir Peter Pain approved the declaration relating to Mr Stuart Ford and Tilen
Securities, one of his companies. Both are named in a writ issued by the
Salvation Army earlier this year in an attempt to recover up to Dollars 8.8m
that was intended for letters of credit.
The order came at the end of two days of oral examination of Mr Ford on his
assets by lawyers at Slaughter &amp; May on behalf of the Salvation Army. The
hearing was held in public at the request of Mr Ford.
Ms Claire Reffin, acting for Slaughter &amp; May, alleged that Mr Ford had
'salted away' money in bank accounts and bought jewellery that had not been
disclosed in statements of his assets.
Mr Ford denied those charges and said that more than Pounds 250,000 traced
to his accounts had been spent on house and office repairs and extensions,
on living and travel expenses and on repaying debts.
He admitted that he had sold two cars and an expensive wrist-watch since his
assets were frozen. That was in addition to a Pounds 300 a week allowance
permitted by the injunction.
After the examination Mr Ford issued a statement. 'I have made it clear
today and all along that I did not in any way defraud the Salvation Army,'
he said.

FT  29 OCT 93 / BAe may build train body shells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace, Britain's biggest aircraft maker, is considering a return
to its roots in the locomotive business.
Executives at the company's Chadderton site at Oldham, Lancashire, are
considering bidding for the contract to build train body shells for the
extension to London's Jubilee line.
The go-ahead for the extension is scheduled to be announced today.
The company, confirming a report in Modern Railways magazine, said
yesterday: 'We have had some exploratory work into the rolling stock
business. We are at an early stage and no decisions have been made.'
A rail contract would see BAe re-enter an industry it forsook more than 50
years ago to build military aircraft for Britain's war effort. The move
would be logical for the company, which has seen markets eroded by cuts in
defence spending, heavy competition in civil aircraft, and recession.
The Chadderton site specialises in machining aluminium components for Airbus
aircraft. This technology would be applied to lightweight train wagons.
GEC-Alsthom is leading the race to win the main Pounds 300m contract to
build 59 six-wagon trains for the Jubilee line. It expects to hear more
about the allocation of the contract in today's announcement.
If BAe were successful in its bid, it would build body shells for the winner
of the main contract. BAe's forebears, which include many of the grand old
names of British aviation such as English Electric and AV Roe, had been
working in rail since Victorian days.
In 1875 a Kilmarnock company called Dick Kerr made its name in railway
electrification. In 1917 it bought the United Electric Car Company, a maker
of tram and railway wagons based in Preston, Lancashire. Two years and
several mergers later it emerged as English Electric. The aircraft side
became part of British Aircraft Corporation in the 1960s.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Banham warns council reform could cost Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, has told Mr
John Gummer, environment secretary, that the transition costs of local
government reform in England 'could well exceed Pounds 1bn'.
In a letter to Mr Gummer, which has also been sent to local authority
associations, Sir John also said the review could cause political trouble
for the government.
He said: 'A number of Conservative backbenchers have made it plain to us
that they would like to see no change in the present arrangements.'
Last month Mr Gummer changed his policy guidance to the commission and said
it should recommend replacing counties with all-purpose unitary authorities,
even if this involved marginal extra cost.
He also accelerated the review, so that the commission should complete its
recommendations for all English counties by the end of next year instead of
1997.
Sir John's estimate of costs echoed a previous estimate of Pounds 1.1bn by
the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, which says the case
for change has not been made. According to Sir John the costs could exceed
Pounds 1bn 'once full information technology implications are taken into
account'.
But the cross-party Association of District Councils attacked the counties
for 'scaremongering', and said high cost estimates had failed to take into
account the possible gains from selling surplus buildings after
reorganisation.
Sir John sought to assert his independence and repeated complaints that
civil servants had interfered with the review.
The commission announces its final recommendations for restructuring
Cleveland, Derbyshire and Durham on November 8.
Local authorities are divided over Mr Gummer's new policy. The ADC has
welcomed it but counties described Mr Gummer as 'presumptuous' for
'prejudging the wishes of local people and the outcome of the review'.

FT  29 OCT 93 / SmithKline to move 1,000 in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the second-biggest drug company in Britain, is to spend
more than Pounds 200m consolidating its research and development centres.
The company said yesterday that no jobs would be lost but 1,000 people would
be asked to relocate.
SmithKline is buying the 40-acre site of BP's maritime centre in Harlow,
Essex, which is next to one of its existing research centres. This will
enable it to stop research at four of its seven centres, at Brockham Park,
Great Burgh and Reigate, Surrey, and at Worthing, Sussex. The re-search
headquarters will move from Great Burgh to Harlow.
The company said: 'There will be significant cost savings through reduction
in operating costs by maintaining fewer sites.'
It said that more people on a single site would 'improve interactions and
efficiency'.
The acquisition also 'provides enough land to eventually consolidate all UK
pharmaceutical R&amp;D in one location, if desired'.
The Pounds 200m capital cost of the scheme, and the costs of relocation,
have already been accounted for by the company in provisions for the
restructuring of its research side.
Staff will be offered relocation assistance. The company conceded that some
might be offered redundancy, but that 'the object is not to reduce numbers'.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Howard cuts Sheehy police plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS yesterday announced that they had decided against many of the most
radical proposals of the government-appointed Sheehy inquiry into police
rewards and responsibilities.
But they still propose to cut about 2,000 middle-ranking police jobs and
introduce performance-related pay as part of fundamental police reforms.
The proposals, outlined in the Commons, will also result in police pay being
linked to an unspecified private-sector benchmark.
Yesterday's carefully measured response to Sheehy was widely interpreted as
an attempt to head off a damaging confrontation with the police at a time of
widespread public concern over law and order.
The government hopes to secure Royal assent for a bill implementing the
changes by next summer.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the 'very far-reaching' reforms
would help bring about more effective policing, while recognising the
'unique nature' of a police officer's job.
In its response to Sheehy the government:
Accepted that the ranks of deputy chief constable, chief superintendent and
chief inspector should be abolished. This process is to be completed by
April 1995. Ministers will take powers to enable a structural severance
package to be implemented but hope that natural wastage in the ranks
concerned means they will not have to use them.
Rejected the introduction of fixed-term appointments for ranks below
superintendent. Fixed-term contracts will apply to chief officer
appointments from two months after the bill becomes law. Ministers will
consider extending this to superintendents at a later date.
Accepted the principle of performance-related pay while rejecting the
formula proposed by the inquiry. Arrangements depending on an 'overall
appraisal' of performance will be introduced. Under one possible scheme
constables may be offered a Pounds 750 rise for commendable performance and
Pounds 1,500 for outstanding work.
Rejected lifting the police retirement age to 60.
Accepted the linkage of pay rises to non-manual private-sector pay
settlements and of pay levels to an unspecified private sector benchmark.
Accepted the abolition of housing allowance for officers recruited after
September 1994.
Rejected a reduction in starting pay levels.
Undertook to review police pension arrangements.
Police leaders welcomed the package as 'a triumph of common sense'.
Mr Howard said the money saved by cutting jobs would enable chief constables
to put up to 3,000 more police constables on the beat or to improve support
services.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Rail rebels back Tory compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night appeared to have headed off a backbench revolt
over rail privatisation after Sir Keith Speed, leader of the potential rebel
MPs, backed a compromise allowing British Rail to bid for some franchises.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has tabled an amendment to the Lords
amendment to the privatisation bill preventing BR bidding for any franchise
for which there is a 'credible' alternative, either a management buy-out or
a private-sector bidder.
In practice under the compromise, the franchising director is unlikely to
allow BR to bid for responsibility for running rail services in more than a
few of the 25 franchise areas.
Government officials said potential Tory dissidents who had threatened to
rebel over the original proposals, under which BR would not have had the
right to bid at all, had made clear they would support this latest move.
Asked whether the partial retreat was simply aimed at preventing another
backbench rebellion Mr MacGregor said: 'This is not a sleight of hand. It
will still be possible for BR to bid (for franchises).'
The Lords' amendment gave BR the right to bid for franchises. This was
opposed by the government on the grounds that it would give BR the ability
to undercut competitors by cross-subsiding its bid with revenues from other
services.
Mr MacGregor's amendment to the railways bill, which returns to the Commons
next week, will provide that the franchise director can allow BR to bid only
if the director is not convinced that any other bidders comply with basic
standards.
The minister is understood to believe that his proposals will encourage
buy-outs and prevent BR, which will not be able to cross-subsidise bids,
from winning more than a small minority of the franchises.
Earlier in the day Mr John Major said it would not be right to treat BR on
the same basis as private bidders.
During an exchange at prime minister's questions, Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, accused the government of 'blatant and discreditable' manoeuvres by
introducing amendments to allow BR to bid for franchises, but under strict
conditions. Mr Smith claimed the government was indulging in a 'cynical
trick'.
Mr Major replied: 'You accuse us of shams while a Labour transport spokesman
had accused the government of a U-turn - it can't be both.'
The franchises will be established gradually over the next few years. Mr
MacGregor is understood to expect only one or two to be set up next year
after BR has created 25 'shadow' franchises. About five more should be
established the following year.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Sony 'killed' album, singer says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGER George Michael yesterday accused Sony, the Japanese electronics
and entertainment company, of attempting to 'kill' his last album as a
punishment for his refusal to appear in a promotional video.
He told the High Court in London that Sony executives in the US had resisted
his attempts to aim his music towards an older market and reduce his appeal
to a younger, female audience.
He is asking the court to declare his contract with Sony unenforceable
because it represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and is in
contravention of European Community competition law.
The singer agreed with Mr Gordon Pollock QC, Sony's counsel, that the
company had never tried to dictate what image he should have. He agreed that
he had portrayed himself as a sex symbol in the early part of his career.
He said that Mr Pollock had overstated the case when he described one of his
early videos as 'soft-core porn' but said the first version had failed to
make it past the censors.
In a written statement he said he had decided to change his musical
direction after the success of his album 'Faith'.
He added: 'Although I had worked specifically to achieve the status of an
American 'superstar', I found the results slightly overwhelming and felt I
was losing control. More frightening to me than anything else was the
feeling that I had become distant from people around me, even my closest
friends.'
He said he decided to appeal to a smaller, older audience in his next album,
'Listen Without Prejudice - Volume I'. He said he told Sony executives in
the US that he would not appear in videos made to promote the album. He said
the company failed to promote the album adequately in the US. He added: 'I
gained the very strong impression that the album had been 'killed' in order
to teach me a lesson.'
Mr Pollock asked him why he could not appear in the video in such a way as
to promote his new image. George Michael said his younger, female audience
would view him in the old way, regardless of what he did in the video.
He agreed with Mr Pollock that his contract had made him 'extraordinarily
wealthy'. Mr Pollock said: 'You have got more money than you know what to do
with. True?' George Michael answered: 'True.' Mr Pollock asked what his net
worth was. With the agreement of the judge, Mr Justice Parker, George
Michael wrote down a figure rather than stating the amount in court.

FT  29 OCT 93 / DTI urged to delay British Gas split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAS Consumers Council has asked the government to delay decisions on the
future of British Gas until an inquiry has examined the impact on consumers
of proposals to break up the company and possibly abolish its monopoly.
Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council, yesterday said the proposed
inquiry should focus on whether the abolition of British Gas' monopoly of
supply to small-scale, mostly residential customers, would result in a
'measureable benefit to the majority'. He added that if the inquiry also
said there would be no substantial price rise for a minority of low-income
customers and no threat to supplies, then 'the monopoly should be abolished
without delay'.
In a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry the council said it
could not support many of the recent recommendations of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission for introducing greater competition into the gas market.
The council was particularly concerned that the MMC wanted the cost of
breaking up British Gas to be paid for by consumers.
Mr Cooper also criticised the recommendation that British Gas' monopoly
threshold should fall from 2,500 therms a year to 1,500 therms in 1997.
Below the threshold British Gas is the monopoly supplier. The change would
benefit only 400,000 households, he said.

SMITHKLINE Beecham, the second-biggest drug company in Britain, is to spend
more than Pounds 200m consolidating its research and development centres.

It said that staff now travelled 1.5m miles a year between sites and that
more people on a single site would 'improve interactions and efficiency'.
The acquisition also 'provides enough land to eventually consolidate all UK

The Pounds 200m capital cost of the scheme, and the costs of relocation,
have already been accounted for by the company in provisions for the
restructuring of its research side.
SmithKline's plan comes when the drug sector is under increasing pressure to
cut prices from governments anxious to reduce health spending.
All staff will be offered relocation assistance. The company conceded that
some might be offered redundancy, but that 'the object is not to reduce
numbers'.
The Reigate centre will close next year when the lease runs out. Most
non-research staff will have moved by the third quarter of next year.
Remaining employees will be transferred by 1997.
R&amp;D will by then be concentrated at just three sites: Harlow, Tonbridge in
Kent, and Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US may curtail C-17 programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Defence Department is threatening to cut short the troubled McDonnell
Douglas C-17 transport aircraft programme at just 40 aircraft, one third of
the planned fleet, writes George Graham in Washington.
Pentagon officials told members of Congress in closed sessions they could
economically cancel the programme after 40 aircraft; unless substantial
improvements were achieved, they would seek to meet the rest of their
airlift needs with alternatives such as the C-5 or converted wide-bodied
airliners.
At the same time, in a 'carrot and stick' approach, they said they were
considering making a Dollars 400m payment to McDonnell Douglas to forestall
an estimated Dollars 1.6bn of claims the company could seek against the
government.
The C-17 was intended to replace much of the US military airlift fleet, with
the capacity to carry heavy payloads over long ranges and land them on short
runways. The original plan to buy 210 aircraft was already scaled back to
120 in 1990, a fleet which would have cost around Dollars 40bn. The
programme has suffered, however, from delays and cost overruns. McDonnell
Douglas has signed an agreement with Malaysia allowing Malaysian
participation in the manufacture of equipment for McDonnell Douglas
aircraft, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur.
The agreement, said to be worth more than Dollars 200m to Malaysia over a
10-year period, is part of an offset programme resulting from Malaysia's
decision earlier this year to buy eight F/A-18D McDonnell Douglas fighter
aircraft.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, said the offset programme
would give the Royal Malaysian Air Force and local defence industry
companies access to the lastest aerospace industry technology.

HOFFMANN La Roche, the Swiss drugs group, is pulling out of its Indian
subsidiary in a move which will not help the country's campaign to attract
foreign investment, writes R C Murthy in Bombay and Stefan Wagstyl in New
Delhi.
Hoffmann is selling its controlling stake in Roche Products to Mr Ajay
Piramal, head of Nicholas Laboratories, a successful local pharmaceuticals
maker, because of delays in promised revisions of price controls on drugs.
Indian drugs prices are among the lowest in world because of
government-imposed limits. They are periodically revised upwards but have
generally failed to keep pace with inflation.
The impact of Hoffmann's move on India's efforts to attract other foreign
companies may be limited, as the problems faced by drugs companies are
specific to their industry.
Mr Piramal is paying Rs320m (Pounds 6.6m) for a 74 per cent stake in Roche
Products, which in the year to last March had sales of Rs711m.

INDIA'S largest software company is filing a suit in the US in protest at
claims that it broke American law governing the conditions under which its
Indian engineers were sent to work in the US, writes Stefan Wagstyl from New
Delhi.
Tata Consultancy Services, a member of Tata, India's biggest industrial
grouping, is reacting to a suit filed in California this month by
Californians for Population Stabilisation, an anti-immigration lobby group,
which alleges that Tata Consultancy and Hewlett Packard, the US computer
maker, infringed American labour laws.
In a suit filed in the Superior Court of California, CAPS alleged that Tata,
which had sent employees to work on contract at Hewlett Packard, had ignored
US provisions on pay, holidays and payroll taxes. Tata Consultancy denies
the claims and plans to file a counter-suit denouncing the CAPS action as
malicious.
The suit comes amid growing concern among US software engineers that
software engineers from India, the former Soviet Union and other countries
are taking their jobs by working at a fraction of American rates.
Their cause was taken up by CBS, the television network, which this month
broadcast a documentary alleging that Indian and other software companies
were supplying low-cost staff to US companies.
The arguments are important for the international software industry because
software engineers from poor countries are ready to work at lower rates than
Americans.

defence equipment valued at Dollars 100m for the country's armed forces.
The deal is the largest of its kind for Poland with an equipment supplier
from outside the former Warsaw Pact country.
The mobile radio relay equipment is to be delivered to the Polish army over
the next six years and Ericsson hopes to expand sales from Unimor to other
east European countries.
Unimor which makes TV sets, would control two thirds of the equity in the
joint venture, which would involve a Dollars 25m investment in technology by
the Swedish company.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: S Korea to open its procurement market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA has agreed to open its government procurement market to
international competition during intensive negotiations in Geneva aimed at
completing the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. This
includes the sensitive construction sector.
Offers are now awaited from just four of the 12 countries engaged in
negotiations on opening government procurement contracts to international
competition: Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and Israel.
As negotiators yesterday completed the latest round of procurement
negotiations, they talked with increasing confidence of resolving
differences ahead of the December 15 deadline for agreement on the Round.
A new draft of a procurement text is due to be circulated at the end of next
week, with a report due in two weeks on the outstanding obstacles. A final
week of negotiation will start on November 15.
Over the past week, improved offers have also been tabled by Japan, the US,
and the European Free Trade Association countries of Norway, Sweden, Finland
and Austria. South Korea has agreed to open all government procurement
contracts in goods and services, all construction contracts, and all
contracts for goods from para-statal organisations.
This follows agreement early this week by Japan to open its scandal-ridden
construction sector to international competition. Japan has apparently
increased the list of services contracts it is willing to open to
international tender, and has added 47 para-statal entities to the list of
organisations to be bound by the agreement.
Differences still exist about the threshold above which contracts must be
open to competition, but there appears to be convergence on the issue. The
US, which initially pressed for extremely low thresholds, has raised its
proposal to SDR355,000 (Pounds 335,000) for contracts for goods and
services, and SDR4.5m in construction contracts. It has raised its proposed
threshold for contracts from central government entities to SDR100,000, in
line with other offers on the table.
Japan remains out of line on this issue, but has agreed in principle to
lower its proposed SDR15m threshold for construction contracts.
Apart from the thresholds issue, differences remain on how companies might
challenge a government if it reneges on its commitment to give foreign
companies fair access to procurement contracts, and how they might win
compensation. Differences have to be resolved on rules that would bind
non-government organisations to the new procurement regime.

FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Israel seeks a better deal from EC -
Improved terms wanted for farm and high-tech products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the European Community are negotiating a comprehensive agreement
which will reduce Israel's Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) trade deficit with the
EC and give the Jewish state substantially improved access to the EC market
and Community programmes in research and development.
Israel, however, has voiced strong criticism about the slow progress and the
unfavourable EC response to Israel's request for improvement in the access
of agricultural and high-technology exports to the European market.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, accused the Community this week of
'dragging its feet' in improving economic ties with Israel in the wake of
the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
For several years Israel has been pushing the EC, its main trading partner,
to update and improve their 1975 free trade agreement.
Israeli officials say new EC agreements with other countries and changes in
Israel's production have eroded the concessions of the 1975 agreement and in
some cases made it obsolete.
Israel is also concerned about the growing trade deficit with EC countries.
Last year Israel exported goods worth Dollars 4.5bn to the EC and imported
Dollars 9.5bn. The trade deficit with the EC, which is expected to widen
this year, accounted for 86 per cent of Israel's total trade deficit in
1992.
Israeli officials say the EC had been holding back from revising the
agreement until Israel made substantial progress on Middle East peace talks.
Last month's peace agreement paved the way for the preparation of a
Commission mandate, which lays the framework for negotiations. The mandate
is before the Council of Ministers which is expected to approve it in its
meeting in December. Bilateral negotiations will then begin, leading to a
final agreement late next year.
Under the mandate the new 'association' agreement, similar to EC agreements
with eastern European and Maghreb countries, will significantly update and
improve Israel's ties with the EC.
Among the new provisions will be Israeli full associate membership of EC
research and development programmes, the inclusion of trade in services and
bidding for public procurement contracts, an institutionalised political
dialogue, and co-operation in customs, environmental policy and the fight
against drug trafficking.
Israel has welcomed the prospect of a new agreement, and has praised the EC
role in responding with a quick Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m) aid budget for
the occupied territories. It is, however, disappointed the EC has not
responded positively to its call for revision in the conditions that
determine the access of Israeli high-tech products, agricultural goods and
textiles into the EC market.
For high-tech products Israel was hoping the EC would revise the rules of
origin and agree to a mutual recognition of standards, tests and
certificates which currently act to bar Israeli products.
In agriculture it wants an improvement in the trade of fresh and processed
products to increase tariff quotas, shift existing quotas to new products,
provide for the export of new products not covered by the 1975 agreement -
such as exotic fruits - and let cut flowers enter the market on the same
terms as those from countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe.
Israel, which last year sent Dollars 470m in agricultural exports to the EC,
also wants the EC to include more products that use water-efficient
technology. On textiles Israel is calling for equal terms to those enjoyed
currently by east European and Maghreb states.
'We are asking for quick and bold decisions and not arguments over every
percentage point,' an official said. 'Sometimes it seems to us that Europe
wants to give birth without having any pains.'

Qatar strongly denied yesterday that it was close to signing a gas supply
agreement with Israel or that it had even held talks with the Jewish state
on such a deal, despite recent statements from the Israeli government to the
contrary, write Mark Nicholson in Cairo and Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
Israeli officials, including Mr Moshe Shahal, energy minister, continued to
insist, however, that a deal with an unnamed Gulf Emirate would be signed
within weeks and would focus on the shipment of gas to the Israeli port of
Eilat and the construction of a gas pipeline between Eilat and the Israeli
port of Ashkelon for export to Europe. Unofficially Israeli officials have
named Qatar as the country involved but they have refused to name it
publicly.
Mr Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's minister of energy and industry,
said: 'We stick with the Arab boycott.'

successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Stefan Wagstyl
writes from New Delhi.
Indian ministers said they accepted the assurances, during a visit by Mr

of farmers, trade unionists and others, who staged angry demonstrations in
the streets of Delhi, vowed to fight for changes in the draft agreement
prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Mr Sutherland's predecessor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas has opposed renegotiating the proposed North
American Free Trade Agreement with the new Canadian government, saying that
'from our part we have stated that the negotiation is concluded', writes
Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
'If you open one single line of the two thousand page text, you open
everthing else up for renegotiation . . . It's a good agreement for Mexico.
Its a good agreement for the US, and we do believe it's also a good
agreement for Canada,' the Mexican president said in an interview with Sir
David Frost.
The new Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien said on Wednesday he may not
implement Nafta without changes to protect Canada's energy reserves, and
rules on dumping and unfair subsidies. It is not clear whether his demand
would require a re-opening of the original treaty, or whether supplemental
agreements to build on those that regulate labour and environment in the
region would suffice.

MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, has signed an agreement
with Malaysia allowing Malaysian participation in the manufacture of
equipment for McDonnell Douglas aircraft, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala

The agreement, said to be worth more than Dollars 200m to Malaysia over a
10-year period, is part of an offset programme resulting from Malaysia's
decision earlier this year to buy eight F/A-18D McDonnell Douglas fighter
aircraft. Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, said the offset
programme would give the Royal Malaysian Air Force and local defence
industry companies access to the lastest aerospace industry technology.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Tensions throughout IADB: A study of the bank's internal
conflicts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REPORT presented this month to the board of the Inter-American Development
Bank found the bank obsessed with a culture of control and subject to
tension and conflict at all levels of the organisation.
The report on Latin America's Washington-based regional development bank was
commissioned this year by its president, Mr Enrique Iglesias, as part of
discussions among government shareholders about increasing the bank's
capital.
The report was produced by a six-man 'task force' headed by Mr Moeen
Qureshi, a former World Bank official who has just stepped down as caretaker
prime minister in Pakistan.
Mr Qureshi said yesterday that the group found the bank had an impressive
loan portfolio given Latin America's economic difficulties during the 1980s.
The bank was probably closer to its borrowers than any other development
institution, 'which opens possibilities as well as creates problems for the
institution', he said.
The report said however that the bank's emphasis on control had 'given a
high degree of confidence that funds are being used for intended purposes
(which is important) but it places concern for results in a distant second
place.'
This emphasis had slowed decision-making - the process of loan development
and approval takes 18 to 24 months - and created an aversion to taking
risks. It meant insufficient use had been made of the bank's country offices
because most decisions were made at head office. The bank's board was also
'excessively involved in operational matters, not enough in policy'.
According to the report, the control mentality has meant that 'tensions and
conflicts which are more intense than in other development institutions are
found at all levels of the bank's organisation'. This mentality stemmed from
the bank's ownership structure and history.
Latin American borrowing members own a majority of the bank - 53.8 per cent
 -while the US stake is 34.61 per cent. However, only the guarantees of the
non-borrowing members are used when the bank raises money in international
markets. This means that every dollar raised by the IADB is almost 75 per
cent guaranteed by the US government.
Meanwhile, borrowing countries have unduly influenced the allocation of
resources, selection of projects, and senior appointments at the bank, the
report said.
This had led to a mistrust of management among non-borrowing members. 'The
bank's shareholders should consider how they can, collectively, reduce the
politicisation of the bank.' In future, borrowing shareholders should
recognise they are not entitled to bank resources but have to earn them
through good performance. Management also needed a freer hand in day-to-day
operations with the board focusing on policy, but had to be held more
accountable for its mistakes.
The importance of change at the bank was heightened by the likely future
emphasis on lending for social programmes such as health, education and
poverty alleviation. Such loans were inherently more difficult to administer
than traditional project or balance of payments lending, in part because of
the weakness of government agencies dealing with these sectors and the
difficulty in measuring the results.
The report makes 21 recommendations for change at the bank, which last year
approved a record Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) in loans and mobilised Dollars
827m in co-financings, mainly with the Japanese government.
It advises that more power be delegated to country offices and procurement
procedures be modified.
The report was presented to the board last week. Discussions about a capital
increase will continue in a working group, expected to put proposals to a
board meeting in Washington in mid-December.
Last year, the US administration aired the idea of a once-and-for-all
capital increase for the bank. This now seems unlikely, although the idea of
automatic capital increases every few years, as in the past, is losing
favour.
However, there is growing confidence that calls from some non-regional
shareholders - in particular Germany and Japan - for a greater stake in the
bank can be accommodated by cuts in the stake held by regional members. This
would mean the US accepting a reduction in its shareholding, though not
losing its veto and delaying rights as the largest single shareholder.
In another development, the future as a separate entity of the bank's
private-sector loans and equity investment arm, the Inter-American
Investment Corporation, appears in jeopardy. It has not secured US backing
for a capital increase. This is likely to require the bank itself, which has
not lent directly to the private sector, to play a bigger role in helping
private-sector development.
Mr Iglesias said in April that a capital increase of Dollars 30bn-Dollars
40bn would let the bank go on lending at the current rate. Bank management
hopes that an increase can be agreed to allow for a formal accord at the
bank's annual meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, in April. The last capital
increase of Dollars 26.4bn was agreed in 1989, allowing the bank to expand
its lending by Dollars 22.5bn in the four-year period ending this year.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S financial authorities yesterday began investigating the bank
accounts of nearly 40 Congress members allegedly involved in the corruption
scheme unearthed in the government's budget.
Eight of the country's biggest construction companies will also have their
bank accounts and phone records opened to scrutiny as the parliamentary
inquiry into the allegations gathers pace.
The inquiry is into allegations made 10 days ago by Mr Jose Carlos Alves dos
Santos, a former budget official. He claimed Congress members and other
politicians received fees for arranging the inclusion of construction
projects in the government's budget, and diverted budget funds to personal
schemes.
So far 37 politicians have been implicated, including several senior figures
and five former and serving government ministers. But the inquiry is having
difficulty finding documentary proof that payments were made and hopes for a
breakthrough from the bank accounts.
The 44 congressmen sitting on the inquiry voted to open their own bank
accounts to scrutiny, to avoid allegations of involvement in the scheme.

FT  29 OCT 93 / US growth of 2.8% pushes Dow to high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy expanded at a real annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the third
quarter, the best performance this year, thanks to steady growth in consumer
spending and industrial production, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
Inflation fell to its lowest level in seven years.
Evidence of a non-inflationary and stronger recovery, together with some
better than expected corporate profits, pushed the Dow Jones industrial
average up 23.20 points to close at a new high of 3,687.86, beating Monday's
record of 3,673.61. The index traded briefly above 3,700 before investors
stepped in to take profits.
The gross domestic product improvement would have been even better but for
the impact of this summer's Midwest flooding, which cut 0.6 per cent off the
quarterly return. In the first two quarters, GDP rose by 0.8 per cent and
1.9 per cent respectively.
Growth was widespread across the economy, according to the department's
initial estimates for the quarter, apart from the farm and defence sectors.
Consumer spending rose by 4.2 per cent in the quarter, up from 3.4 per cent
in the previous three months, a clear response to continued low interest
rates.
This was also reflected in a lower personal savings rate, down to 3.7 per
cent from 4.4 per cent.
Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, noted that interest-sensitive sectors
appeared to be leading the recovery. He pointed to the expansion of consumer
durable equipment (up 9 per cent), residential construction (up 10.1 per
cent) and durable goods (up 7.5 per cent).
Inflation pressures also abated in the third quarter, down to an annual rate
of 1.8 per cent from the 2.9 per cent of the previous three months,
according to the Commerce Department's fixed-weight price index for gross
domestic purchases. This is the lowest quarterly increase in the index since
1986.
President Bill Clinton, pre-empting a report due out later in the day, also
announced that the budget deficit in the fiscal year ending last month had
fallen to Dollars 255bn (Pounds 169bn), 12 per cent lower than the Dollars
290.2bn of fiscal 1992. He claimed this was evidence his economic policies
were working.
A fistful of private economic forecasts foresaw even higher growth in GDP in
the final three months. The Conference Board predicted a real 3.4 per cent,
while Merrill Lynch was more bullish with its 4-5 per cent estimate.
There remains some concern that the current growth cycle may resemble that
of last year, when an anaemic first half was transformed into a 5.7 per cent
expansion in the final quarter.
This came too late to help President George Bush's re-election campaign and
was succeeded by minimal growth in the first half of this year.
The main negative non-farm elements in the third quarter were found in a
widening trade deficit, with exports down 1.1 per cent and imports up 1.9
per cent, although this was a more modest increase than previously, and in
reduced government purchases, down 6.1 per cent on lower defence orders.

FT  29 OCT 93 / New wave of US mayors about to break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the US's largest cities will wake up next week with new mayors after
elections on Tuesday that could mark a changing of the guard among urban
politicians.
In the largest city holding an election this year, New York, Mr David
Dinkins, the incumbent mayor, faces the same challenger he defeated four
years ago, Mr Rudolph Giuliani.
But in a dozen other big cities, incumbent mayors are retiring, bringing
forward a new line-up of urban lead-ers.
'There is definitely a changing of the guard. Some of it is attitudinal,
reflecting a pervasive desire for change in American politics, and some of
it is generational,' says Mr David Bositis of the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, a Washington think-tank.
A particularly notable shift is the departure of the first generation of
black mayors in cities such as Detroit, where Mayor Coleman Young is
standing down after 20 years in office, and Atlanta, where Mr Maynard
Jackson first served as mayor in 1974 and returned four years ago for a
final term.
Younger black leaders, such as Mayor Freeman Bosley in St Louis or Mayor
Mike White in Cleveland - who is up for re-election on Tuesday - have
philosophies less deeply rooted in the experience of the civil rights
movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Mr Bositis says, and may be more open to
proposals such as bussing school pupils to ensure racially integrated
schools.
There is also an evident tendency for black candidates to come to the fore
in cities where blacks do not make up the majority of the population; they
are running not on the basis of race but on a mostly liberal policy
platform.
Following in the footsteps of Mr Bosley in St Louis or Mr Norm Rice, who is
up for re-election in Seattle, Ms Sharon Sayles Belton, the current
Minneapolis city council president, appears to be the leading candidate to
succeed Mayor Donald Fraser, who is retiring after 14 years.
If younger candidates are benefiting from a general desire to throw out the
old politicians, similar to the wave ridden by Mr Ross Perot in last year's
presidential elections, they will also find it difficult to do any better
than their predecessors.
A mayor's ability to deal with many of the dominant problems raised in this
year's campaign, such as crime, is severely limited in the best of times,
but particularly today, when virtually all cities face severe budget
constraints.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Aristide calls for blockade of Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president of Haiti, called yesterday
for a total blockade of the country, insisting it was essential to force the
military to give up power.
But in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he also sounded a
conciliatory note, sending what he termed 'a message of peace to the
officers and men of the army of Haiti' who ousted him from power two years
ago.
Mr Aristide, who was to return to Port-au-Prince tomorrow under the
UN-brokered agreement signed on July 3, promised the Haitian people his
eventual return to office would be followed by sweeping change to end
'institutionalised violence', restore democracy, revamp the economy and
provide jobs for an estimated 70 to 80 per cent of the country's employed
people.
Calling on Haitians rich and poor to 'march hand in hand', he said they
should reject vengeance and 'say yes to reconciliation, yes to justice'.
His proposal of a total blockade is in line with a French plan already
circulating in the UN Security Council that would prevent virtually all
trade with Haiti - regarded as the poorest country in the western
hemisphere, but according to MrAristide, potentially one of the richest.
US, Canadian and French warships began a blockade on October 18 to enforce
an oil and arms embargo after Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military
leader, refused to relinquish power as he had agreed to do in the New York
accords.
George Graham adds from Washington: President Bill Clinton declined to say
what options his administration was considering on Haiti, but warned
military leaders they would be making a 'grave mistake' if they went on
'thwarting democracy's return'.
'If (Port-au-Prince police chief Michel) Francois and the others in Haiti
believe that all they have to do is to wait out Aristide and everything will
somehow be all right, and that the international community will put up with
the re-establishment of a Duvalier-like regime there in plain violation of
the overwhelming majority of the people of Haiti, I think they are just
wrong,' Mr Clinton said.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Fujimori set to secure his hold: Peruvians likely to vote
Yes in constitutional referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A country still widely perceived abroad as deficient in democracy, Peru
has put its citizens through quite a number of electoral procedures in
recent months.
On Sunday, across the nation, Peruvians will go to the polling booths for
the third time in less than a year, this time to vote on a new constitution
drawn up by the congress they elected last November.
It is the country's first ever referendum. The topic is so complex that,
according to polling organisations, only one Peruvian in 10 has any real
idea of what he is voting on. The government, while spending substantial
sums on advertising, has done little to inform voters - the campaign was
reduced to a catchy jingle with the slogan: 'Say Yes to the Peru you love'.
If its 1979 predecessor was statist and idealistic, the 1993 constitution is
being officially sold as the gateway to modernity. Mr Jaime Yoshiyama,
President Alberto Fujimori's vice-president, says it offers 'confidence,
security and tranquillity'. A Yes vote, he says, is a vote for 'the clear
path towards prosperity'.
In the event, the new constitution, backed by Mr Fujimori's ruling alliance
and a handful of small opposition parties, seems on course for approval,
although by a smaller margin than at first thought. Last minute opinion
polls - which by law cannot be published inside Peru in the two weeks prior
to voting - were predicting that more than 40 per cent of all voters would
reject it.
The No vote seems to have been gathering ground in the past 10 days, in
particular in small provincial towns and remote rural areas, precisely the
parts which pollsters cannot reliably reach.
'Despite Mr Fujimori's attempts to turn this into a plebiscite rather than a
referendum, Peruvians are not seeing it that way,' says Mr Alfredo Torres,
of the Lima-based research and polling organisation Apoyo. 'Many people who
broadly support Mr Fujimori are going to vote No, especially at the lower
income levels.'
The No campaign has been a makeshift affair. Bereft of financing and a key
figure to lead it, the campaign has nevertheless managed to focus attention
on certain specific constitutional articles. The issues which have aroused
most popular opposition are the elimination of 'labour stability' - a
long-cherished article of faith with the Peruvian workforce - and the threat
to free education for all (though proposed changes will affect only the
better-off and those at university level).
In fact, the bulk of the 'new' constitution remains identical to its
predecessor. Constitutional expert Mr Domingo Garcia Belaunde calculates
that 60 per cent is unchanged, 30 per cent has been 'fine-tuned' and only 10
per cent is genuinely new.
Several of these innovations enjoy wide popular backing: the introduction of
the death penalty for convicted high-ranking terrorists commands the support
of most Peruvians, as does the modification which allows a serving president
to run for an immediate second term.
Less popular, but also less emotionally charged, are changes in the
mechanisms of governance. If the new constitution is approved, Peruvians
will in future elect a single chamber congress of 120 members instead of the
traditional two-house, 240-member parliament. And, at local level, the 12
large and semi-autonomous regions formed at the end of the Alan Garcia
government will be eliminated.
The upshot is that post-referendum Peru will be even more centralist than
before. And this despite Mr Fujimori's pledge in May 1992 to the
Organisation of American States (OAS) that he would instal a 'genuine'
democracy in Peru in place of the 'partidocracy' that has traditionally
governed.
In a series of advertisements in local papers this week, the Lima-based
Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), headed by former presidential
adviser Mr Hernando de Soto, has criticised Mr Fujimori for going back on
his pledge.
'This constitution . . . has been drawn up without any popular
participation, by congressmen chosen by their party machines and who ran in
single, closed lists,' the ILD says. 'This is not a real referendum . . .
(but) a plebiscite.'
Peru's new constitution will also enhance the already sweeping powers of the
executive. The president will be able to dissolve congress in the face of
'grave conflict' between executive and legislature. And he will no longer
have to secure congressional ratification for the ambassadors and senior
military officers he appoints.
Mr Fujimori argues these constitutional modifications actually redress the
balance of power, which had previously been weighted in favour of the
legislative branch. He says he expects a 'resounding' success in Sunday's
poll - resounding, in his view being a 70-30 vote in favour.
In the run-up to the poll on Sunday, some resilient bands of Sendero
Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas were doing their best to put a damper on
official optimism, with bombings and selective killings in Lima and the
provinces. But all the indications were that Mr Fujimori would safely clear
the last hurdle on his long road back to legitimacy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US this week firmly rebuffed speculation that there would be a thawing
of relations with Cuba, despite speculation that President Bill Clinton
might relax the decades-old embargo.
Mr Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for Inter-American
affairs, pledged total support for last year's controversial Cuban Democracy
Act, which tightened many areas of the embargo, including extending it to
foreign subsidiaries of US companies.
Speaking at a conference sponsored by the conservative Cuban-American
National Foundation this week, Mr Watson addressed directly 'a misconception
that has emerged from time to time in the press and elsewhere. . . that the
Clinton administration intends to soften its policy towards the Cuban
regime. That is false. We can neither trade nor negotiate away the human and
political rights of the Cuban people.'
Mr Watson's speech, however, was not laced with the traditional
squeeze-Castro-into-submission rhetoric favored by many of the most
conservative Cuban-Americans. Instead he focused on the need to increase the
flow of information into Cuba and said the Cuban Democracy Act had allowed
substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to go to private organisations in
Cuba.
Members of more moderate groups who favour negotiations with the communist
state said they were not surprised by the administration's tough talk
especially given crucial support the powerful foundation gave Mr Clinton in
last year's elections.
'He is sacrificing a rational policy for a campaign pledge,' said Mr Kevin
Harris of the Cuban-American Research and Education Fund. But there were
promising signs in the actions if not the words of the administration, he
said.
Last month, for example, Cuba turned over to the US two suspected cocaine
traffickers who had fled to the island. In another sign of co-operation, the
US in September agreed to repatriate Cubans who came to the US in the 1980
Mariel boatlifts and have been convicted of felonies in the US.
Congressman Robert Torricelli, one of the loudest advocates of maintaining
the stringent embargo on Cuba, said he had asked Ms Janet Reno, the attorney
general, to prosecute a group of US citizens who he said violated the
embargo by traveling to Cuba as tourists.

CHILE is unlikely to meet its 1993 inflation rate target of 12 per cent
after indications of a sharp rise in prices in October. The central bank
predicts a monthly rise of around 2.5 per cent, bringing the accumulated
rate for the first 10 months of the year to 11 per cent.
Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, budget director, attributed October's rise to the
seasonal bias of the consumer price index, especially in its measurement of
food prices.
Control of inflation has been a key plank of Chile's macro-economic policy.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Californian counties declared disaster areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday declared five counties in southern
California major disaster areas in response to the brush fires that have so
far destroyed at least 500 homes in the region.
Mr Clinton also sent Mr Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary, and Mr James
Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to California
to help co-ordinate government action.
'It's a huge fire out there and we are going to do whatever it takes to help
the people,' Mr Clinton said.
Fifteen major wildfires continued burning out of control yesterday across
88,000 acres stretching from the Mexican border to Los Angeles' northern
suburbs, giving rise to unofficial damage estimates running into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
At least 30,000 people were forced to flee their homes, while 24
firefighters were hurt, three critically, and at least 12 civilians were
reported injured in the blazes.
Hardest hit was the affluent suburb of Laguna Beach, where a 7-mile wall of
fire marched toward the sea, devouring more than 300 homes, some of them
million-dollar mansions. The town's entire population of 24,000 was ordered
to evacuate.
Even Malibu, the up-market coastal enclave of movie stars and millionaires,
was feeling the heat. Up to 15 homes sitting atop steep canyons were
reported to have gone up in smoke.
'It is a little too early to make any estimates,' said Ms Loretta Waters of
the Insurance Information Institute.
State Farm Fire and Casualty holds the largest market share of homeowner
insurance in California, with about 22 per cent, according to the institute.
Allstate is next with 16.8 per cent and Farmers Group is third with 13.6 per
cent.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Seoul tries to break up big business groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South Korean government is to offer financial incentives to
conglomerates that streamline their operations and specialise in a few
industries.
The Industry Ministry proposal is likely to be the centrepiece of President
Kim Young-sam's policy toward the chaebol, the big business groups that
dominate the Korean economy.
Korean governments for the past decade have tried to reduce the size of the
chaebol, but with little success.
Officials have long argued that the chaebol have diversified into too many
unrelated industries, which is harming their efficiency and global
competitiveness.
Korea's leading chaebol, on average, operate in nine different industries,
while Japanese business groups normally concentrate on one to three
industries, says the ministry.
Under the proposed guidelines, the 10 biggest chaebol, which include
Hyundai, Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo, would select three core
industrial sectors and the next 20 largest would pick two sectors to
develop. The chaebol must select their core industries by the end of the
year.
In return, the government would lift restrictions on bank loans and possibly
foreign borrowing for these core companies, while providing research and
development support.
Chaebol that dispose of other non-core subsidiaries would be allowed to
select an additional one or two core industries.
The plan bears some similarity to the last chaebol policy, introduced in
1991, which stipulated that the 30 leading conglomerates had to select three
core industries, which would then receive unrestricted bank loans.
But this programme failed to reduce the size of the chaebol or fulfil the
government's hope that the chaebol would select their most advanced
industries. Instead, the designated core companies were often those needing
the most capital investments, such as the troubled petrochemical industry,
or ones with the heaviest debts.
The government this time is proposing that core companies must meet certain
conditions to qualify. Selected companies, for example, must already account
for at least 10 per cent of group sales, which would indicate that they are
already competitive.
South Korea will free most interest rates on November 1 in a key step toward
financial liberalisation, the finance ministry announced yesterday.
The action, long anticipated, will deregulate all lending rates offered by
financial institutions, except for rates connected with low-interest
state-controlled policy loans to strategic industries.
Interest rates on long-term deposits of more than two years will also be
freed.
The government has promised to deregulate all interest rates by 1997.
The ministry said that most lending and deposit rates would be liberalised
as a result of the current measure. However, non-bank financial institutions
will enjoy more freedom in setting interest rates than banks, which have
traditionally been under tighter government regulation.
All lending rates offered by non-bank financial institutions will be
liberalised and most deposit rates.
Banks say they are seeking an accelerated liberalisation of deposit rates,
now scheduled to be completed by 1996, in order to compete more efficiently
against rival institutions in attracting funds.
But the government has adopted a cautious approach in liberalising deposit
rates because it is concerned that it would force financial institutions to
raise deposit rates, with a corresponding increase in lending rates to
maintain interest rate margins, as they compete for funds.
The new measure is expected, at least temporarily, to increase loan rates,
which could further slow economic growth, at 4 per cent a year already at
its lowest level in 13 years.
The government has indicated that it may increase the money supply to keep
loan rates from rising sharply.

ISRAELI and Palestinian peace negotiators wound up their third round of
talks yesterday after having made steady progress throughout the week on
security issues.
The Palestinian team yesterday said they wanted a police force of
25,000-30,000 equipped with machine guns, helicopters and armoured vehicles.
Palestinian officials said there was broad agreement on the police force,
but Israel wanted a smaller one equipped with less heavy weaponry.
The police force would be divided into a general force for crime, and
special forces for security, intelligence and anti-riot measures. The
Palestinians have proposed a police training camp set up in Gaza in the
coming weeks.
'By and large I think there is not a big problem on the question of a police
force,' Mr Ahmed Khalidi, Palestinian delegate, said.
Both sides have had preliminary talks on possible joint control or a joint
presence at border crossings, especially at the Rafah crossing from Gaza to
Egypt. If agreed, this would mark a considerable Israeli concession.
Deeper splits have emerged about the jurisdiction of the Palestinian police
force over Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip, the right of Israeli police to
pursue Palestinians, and the release of political prisoners.
Some Palestinians have accused Israel of reneging on an agreement gradually
to free most of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails, numbering up to
14,000. But Israeli officials said 'no more free gestures' would be made.
They were expecting reciprocal gestures from the Palestinians, said to
include a Palestinian call to suspend the Arab economic boycott against
Israel and assurances that Palestinians who have allegedly collaborated with
Israel would not be harmed once the Israeli army starts leaving Gaza and
Jericho on December 13.
Israelis and Palestinians at the talks, being held at the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Taba, have said that despite the differences there is a momentum,
and both sides have praised each other's willingness to seek compromises.
Next week, issues such as the transfer of power from the Israeli-run civil
administration to Palestinian hands and the territorial definition of the
Jericho area will be tackled. The first visit by a joint Israeli-Palestinian
security team to Jericho and Gaza is due next week.

Captain Tony Makpo speaks to reporters after special forces of the Niger

Airways plane at the Niger capital Niamey, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
Israeli security forces were at the scene on behalf of the Nigerian
government. The troops captured the four hijackers, two of whom were
negotiating with officials on the runway, and rescued all 20 hostages except
the co-pilot, who was killed. The hijackers had threatened to blow up the
aircraft unless Nigeria's interim government handed over power. The
hijackers belong to the Movement for the Advancement of Democracy, which
says it has 'decided to make life uncomfortable for the few Nigerians who
terrorise the nation economically and politically'. The group calls the
government 'authorised armed robbers' and quoted a US congressman as saying
that 'roughly 3,000 officials now have Swiss bank accounts totalling Dollars
33bn' - more than Nigeria's foreign debt.

CHINA is formally resuming trade and economic ties with South Africa after a
break of more than 30 years, Beijing announced yesterday.
China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) said it
was responding positively to calls by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the
African National Congress, for a lifting of economic sanctions.
Beijing, which opened a visa-issuing representative office in Pretoria last
year, has been trading discreetly with South Africa for years.
In April, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade mounted
an exhibition in Johannesburg at which 80 Chinese companies were
represented.
Bilateral trade in the first seven months of this year was put at Dollars
294m (Pounds 194.7m), an increase of 285.7 per cent over the same period in
1992,
Formal resumption of trade and economic ties, suspended in July, 1960, is a
further step towards the establishment of full diplomatic relations between
Beijing and Pretoria.
South Africa has continued to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
China's gross national product is expected to grow by 10 per cent in 1994,
according to an economic model developed by the State Statistical Bureau.
This compares with an expected 13 per cent growth this year.
Capital investment was projected to grow 20 per cent in 1994, retail sales
20 per cent, and consumer prices about 10 per cent.

Presbyterian pastors in Kenya yesterday accused the government of President

displaced thousands in the Rift Valley, writes Leslie Crawford in Nairobi.
The victims are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and
wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by Mr Moi, a Kalenjin,
and his coalition of minority tribes.
The pastors accused troops, disguised in traditional attire and using clubs
and spears, of carrying out the killings.
The worsening violence in the Rift Valley and the government's apparent
indifference to the Kikuyus' plight are causing alarm among Kenya's donors,
who meet next month to discuss resuming aid.

THE African National Congress and the South African government have agreed
to devolve more power to regions in post-apartheid South Africa, in an
attempt to persuade right wing parties to accept a new constitution, writes
Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The move follows nearly a year of negotiations on power-sharing between
regional and central government. They must obtain agreement on this issue
from the so-called Freedom Alliance grouping Inkatha and white right-wing
parties if the new constitution is to have broad legitimacy.
The proposals, which would deny regions the right to levy their own taxes,
and which would guarantee central government a veto over matters such as
regional policing and education, may not satisfy the Freedom Alliance whose
members demand either a federal or a confederal constitution.
The proposals emerge at a crucial phase of the negotiations, with
participants aiming to finalise a new constitution within a fortnight.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Industrial outlook still sluggish
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE industry continues to drift in the doldrums, according to the
latest production figures.
Industrial output fell by 5 per cent last month from September 1992, and
registered a 1.5 per cent rise from the August level, said the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry yesterday.
That was better than the market expected, but Miti warned that the month on
month improvement is shaky.
Companies expect a sharp drop in production next month, followed by a rise
in November. The general outlook is sluggish, Miti said.
Companies appear to have difficulty in getting rid of excess stocks, down a
mere 0.6 per cent from August to December, while the prospects for demand
are unclear.
Any hopes that overseas markets will help to lift Japan out of recession
were further disappointed yesterday when car producers reported that exports
fell by 11.7 per cent in the six months to September, compared with the same
period last year. That was the sharpest six monthly drop for nearly 15
years, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
A 31.9 per cent rise in exports to other Asian countries over the six months
was not enough to compensate for declines in exports to the US and the
European Community, Japan's two main foreign markets, where local production
by Japanese manufacturers has been increased.
The association expects sales to Asian countries to decline, partly due to
China's attempts to cool its economy.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Japanese construction groups named in bribery case
</HEADLINE>

THE FIRST trial in Japan's spate of construction industry scandals opened
yesterday, as prosecutors arrested two more executives from a leading
contractor.
Mr Toru Ishii, former mayor of the northern town of Sendai, admitted
receiving Y100m (Pounds 625,000) from four leading construction companies -
Shimizu (Japan's largest), Mitsui Construction, Hazama and and Nishimatsu
Construction. However, Mr Ishii refused to answer charges of accepting a
bribe.
He is one of nearly 30 people charged in the widening scandal, in which
local government politicians are suspected of accepting large amounts of
cash in return for helping construction companies obtain contracts.
Earlier, Mr Kozo Igarashi, the construction minister, said his ministry
would 'assume responsibility' for officials' failure to prevent the bribery
cases. 'Top officials cannot be exempt from responsibility,' he said. This
is believed to be the first time a ministry has made such an offer.
The latest to be detained are two accountants from Kajima, the second
largest and most politically influential construction group. They were
suspected of destroying evidence of illicit payment to politicians after the
arrest last March of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former political godfather of the
then ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Those charged to date include two mayors and two prefectural governors, plus
executives from six construction companies, including Japan's top three.
So far, no national politicians - apart from Mr Kanemaru - or central
government officials have been charged in the bribery cases, despite the
huge amount of information prosecutors are expected to have collected from
those arrested.
The likelihood that national politicians or officials could be implicated
increased with the recent arrest of Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, vice president of
Kajima, which counts many former bureaucrats on its staff. As in previous
scandals, the final decision depends on how far prosecutors feel it
necessary to go to assuage public opinion.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Power cuts 'crippling India's prospects'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA was warned yesterday that worsening power shortages are threatening
its economic reforms and its ability to attract foreign investment.
Mr S Rajgopal, who recently retired as chief cabinet secretary, said the
growing shortage of electricity was holding back industrial development.
The position was so serious that if all the planned foreign investment
actually materialised, India would not be able to provide the basic
infrastructure these companies would require. Also consumers were angry. 'We
saw power riots in Delhi this summer and it's going to increase,' warned Mr
Rajgopal.
Mr Rajgopal was speaking at an industrialists' conference in Delhi at which
many of the participants echoed his gloomy views of the future of the Indian
economy and the inadequate impact of the reforms carried out since 1991 by
the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao.
Mr Rajgopal said the government had originally planned to add 48,000
megawatts of generating capacity in the five years 1991-1996, but this had
been cut because of financial constraints to a target of 30,558MW.
However, a recent government review showed that the public sector, which
dominates the electricity industry, would probably build 13,000MW to
14,000MW of capacity.
India's efforts to attract private investment into the industry had won
great attention. But none of this would come on stream before 1996; at best
private companies would have started work on installing stations with an
output of 3,000MW.
Mr Rajgopal said later the answer was to revive public sector investment in
electricity generation. Most other countries, including developed nations,
did not rely on private companies.
But he said other changes were also needed including reform of the rules
governing electricity distribution and sale to tackle transmission losses,
theft and the supply of free or subsidised electricity to many farmers and
others.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, told the conference he was
concerned the economy was growing more slowly than expected. Compared with
an annual target rate of 5.2 per cent, economic growth in the year to the
end of March 1994 may only be 4.5 per cent.
He admitted that the pace of reform had slowed. Heading a minority
government, ministers had no choice but to take political factors into
account. He called for a national consensus to support further reform. So
far, the government had often taken soft options in reforms - such as
cutting government borrowing by reducing capital investment in
infrastructure and other needs instead of cutting current spending.
Mr S L Rao, director general of the National Centre for Applied Economic
Research, also warned that growth was slower than had been expected and
there was a danger of resurgent inflation.

FT  29 OCT 93 / NZ voters offered six by one, half dozen by the other: An
election in which the main parties differ little both in what they've done
and what they promise to do
</HEADLINE>

WHILE world markets look on admiringly at the pace and nature of New
Zealand's economic reforms and push its currency higher, the country's
population appears battered and confused by the changes.
So much so that, if the opinion polls are any guide, voters look more
inclined unenthusiastically to back the known policies of Mr Jim Bolger's
ruling National Party than risk further upheaval with Mr Mike Moore and
Labour on November 6.
'It's a question of Tweedledum and Tweedledum-ber,' says one well-heeled
Wellington resident. An unemployed Maori youth in Christchurch, after
spending a morning listening to Mr Moore's plans to alleviate youth
unemployment, is blunter. 'I don't have much time for National', he says,
'but what if he (Moore) is wrong? It'll be a bloodbath.'
The one economic statistic in everyone's mind is the unemployment rate of
9.9 per cent. It is down from a high of 11.2 per cent last year, but it
feels as bad because of the benefit cuts that were enacted in 1991 as part
of the country's debt reduction package.
Newspapers run stories of a ten-fold increase in demand for Salvation Army
food parcels over the past three years. Mr Moore challenges Ms Ruth
Richardson, finance minister, to visit the food queues.
In political terms, both the main parties are tainted with responsibility
for the pain. It was the Labour Party, under former prime minister David
Lange, that began the economic revolution, doing away with decades of heavy
protectionism, initiating widespread privatisations and advocating monetary
prudence. Mr Moore was a part of that regime.
After six years, New Zealanders decided they had had enough. But, with the
world economy slipping into recession, the new Bolger government simply went
further down the free-market reform track. It attacked welfare benefits and
replaced the country's 'cradle-to-grave' welfare system with a more
targetted one. And it produced labour market legislation - the Employment
Contracts Act - which did away with the traditional system of national
occupation awards in favour of workplace bargaining with or without unions.
If voters think that both sides are to blame for the more unpalatable
aspects of the economic shake-up, of the past, they also see relatively
little to distinguish their policies for the future. The low inflation
target - zero to 2 per cent - is locked in by the Reserve Bank Act, although
both Labour and National also offer a public commitment to price stability.
National talks of reaching and maintaining economic growth of 3.5 to 5 per
cent; Labour wants 4 per cent. It is reckoned to be about 3 per cent now.
Both parties, moreover, pledge to reduce the country's debt burden by
keeping a tight rein on government expenditure and eventually achieving
budget surpluses.
Mr Moore's social policy agenda is the more generous - focused on a halt to
commercialisation of the health service, increased help for the jobless, and
no more privatisations. However, Labour would not re-instate the benefit
cuts made so painfully by National, and some of its headline proposals -
such as a repeal of the Employment Contracts Act and community work for the
young unemployed - do not have an immediate cost.
That said, even Labour party members admit that the country would need to
see their 4 per cent annual growth by 1996 if everything promised in the
manifesto is to be implemented.
That, in turn, has allowed National to suggest that the Labour strategy
could run the risk of higher taxes - something which Labour has never
emphatically denied. For its part, National says that it has ruled out new
taxes, although Ms Richardson admits that she has not rejected 'closing
loopholes'.
Fudge, retorts her opponents.
The big card that Mr Bolger has been able to play is timing. Although the
jobless figures may be in the forefront of many people's minds - and Mr
Moore is using every opportunity to ensure that they stay there - there is
evidence that the economy is picking up. Mr Bolger is plainly hoping that
the scent of this will deter the electorate from changing course.
Expert performance has been strong despite the appreciating currency. This
week the September trade figures showed a 4.3 per cent increase in exports,
year on year, bringing the total for the last 12 months to a record
NZDollars 9.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn).
The September trade deficit was significantly reduced from the same month in
1992 and the trade surplus for the year was NZDollars 1.7bn.
There are signs, too, that this exported turnaround is at last beginning to
filter through to the domestic economy. Home loan rates, for instance, fell
to below 8 per cent just after the election was announced and house sales in
the three months to September were 22 per cent higher than the previous
year.
Business leaders, who claim to have relatively little interest in which
party wins, given the similarity of their basic economic strategies, also
say the outlook has brightened considerably. 'It's generally very positive,'
commented Mr Ray Harding, head of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce.
'Everyone's margins were squeezed to hell, and that's reflected in the
unemployment levels. But balance sheets are now a little easier, and there
are signs of domestic recovery, although that's a relatively recent change.'

SIR ROBIN McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator in talks with China over Hong
Kong, yesterday cast doubt on whether agreement would ever be possible. The
vexed negotiations have dragged on inconclusively for 15 rounds since last
April.
'I am still uncertain as to whether we can achieve an agreement,' Mr McLaren
said after two days of talks in Beijing. The two sides have agreed to meet
again on November 19 and 20. There still existed 'quite a gap' between the
parties. He called on the Chinese to be more flexible, but China has shown
almost no willingness to compromise in the marathon negotiations.
Beijing has denounced proposals by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten for an
extension of the franchise for municipal elections due next year, and a
Legislative Council (Legco) poll in 1995.
China claims that Mr Patten's plans contradict prior agreements on the
smooth transition of power to Chinese rule in 1997. They have threatened to
dismiss representatives elected under the proposed Patten formula.
The Hong Kong issue will be discussed at a cabinet committee meeting in
London on November 10. The session, presided over by Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, will be briefed by Mr Patten.
Hong Kong's governor said earlier this month that he would be obliged
'within weeks' to present to Legco legislation detailing an extension of the
franchise for elections. Such a move would be likely to bring negotiations
in Beijing over Hong Kong's future to a shuddering halt.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Brussels Summit: Belgium tries for show of EC unity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Belgian presidency of the EC was last night straining to prevent today's
special summit of the 12 heads of government degenerating into a row over
the balance of power between big and small Community member states.
The summit was called to revive Europe's spirits following the traumatic
process of ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
France and Germany presented a new initiative this week to give momentum to
the EC through a new decision-making body made up of European affairs
ministers. But officials from the Commission, the Belgian presidency and a
host of smaller member states feared that this could disguise a power-grab
by the big member states, by shifting EC business from the Community to
national governments.
Additional complications could come if the UK, Germany, France and Spain
insist on raising the very sensitive issue of how to share out votes between
the big and small countries, including Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway,
now negotiating EC entry by 1995.
The Belgian presidency is relying on the strong will of the Twelve to avoid
a public show of division after the disarray of the past 18 months. But much
depends on an agreement on the locations of a range of new EC institutions,
chief among them the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the precursor of a
future European central bank.
It is widely accepted that Germany has an almost undeniable claim to the
EMI, because of the predominance of the D-Mark among European currencies.
However, a decision depends on consensus being reached on homes being found
for other coveted bodies, such as the European environment agency or
medicines evaluation agency, which the UK wants.
UK officials said they would not use the summit to accuse France of
jeopardising a Gatt world trade deal by the December 15 deadline agreed with
the US because of Paris's opposition to the Blair House accord limiting
subsidised farm exports. Other EC states, led by Germany, are wary of
isolating France.
EC leaders will also try to identify 'joint actions' in the Maastricht
common foreign and security policy. Likely areas for close co-operation
include dispatching observers to monitor elections in Russia and South
Africa, and the Middle East peace process. But diplomats stressed yesterday
it would be much more difficult to reach agreement on any new initiative on
the former Yugoslavia; efforts would be confined to enhancing the
humanitarian aid effort before the winter breaks in Bosnia.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is also set to
present the latest ideas in his White Paper on competitiveness, employment
and growth, which will be the centrepiece of the regular EC summit in
December.
But he is thought unlikely to push for an initiative now to tackle
unemployment or to boost growth, having been rebuffed at a meeting of
finance ministers this week in Luxembourg. A proposal by President Francois
Mitterrand for an Ecu100bn (Pounds 77.6bn) loan to fund public works and so
create jobs is also likely to be given short shrift.

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors will not be drinking champagne today. He expects little
from the special EC mini-summit, and accepts that the battle for faster
European political and economic integration has been lost, at least for now.
Recent visitors to Mr Delors' office report that the president of the
European Commission seems less moody, more at ease with himself, almost
philosophical as he heads towards the end of a 10-year career.
He has been praised as the architect of the single market, but condemned as
the engineer of a self-destructing timetable for European monetary union.
However, one reason for the president's apparent serenity is that his magnum
opus - the White Book on employment, competitiveness and growth - is in its
final stages. It will be Mr Delors' Last Hurrah at the EC summit in
December.
Friends say he is close to resolving the challenge of reconciling his
support for the European model of the welfare state and the need to reform
Europe's labour markets. With just over a year more in office, Mr Delors
sees the White Book as providing the framework for European countries to
take the difficult measures needed to restore competitiveness, create jobs,
and catch up with the US and Asia. Friends say that Mr Delors has no regrets
about his drive to force the pace of political and monetary integration on
the back of the single market. But he realises that the battle has been
lost, for now. An Anglo-French alliance buried federalist-minded plans for a
common Europe security and foreign policy at the Maastricht conference
table; and the Bundesbank put paid to Emu, at least in the short-term.
Above all, the recession has encouraged the president to re-examine some of
his assumptions about the pace of European integration and his place in
contemporary history. Some of his conclusions are unexpected.
Mr Delors now believes, for example, that a Gatt world trade agreement by
December 15 is in France's interests. Naturally, there are caveats about
fair deals for French farmers.
But he recently warned his fellow Frenchmen to snap out of their 'national
psychodrama' and to avoid retreating behind a modern-day Maginot Line, the
ineffective defence system built between the world wars to keep out the
Germans.
On a personal note, Mr Delors has realised how much authority he lost within
the Commission as a result of his feud with Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish
commissioner responsible for agriculture. His support for Sir Leon Brittan,
the EC's chief trade negotiator, has been more clear-cut.
If Mr Delors has a regret, it is how his views on Europe have been
caricatured in Britain, most recently at the Conservative party conference
where he was once again cast as the demon socialist/centralist. This week,
he was roughed up by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, at a
meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg.
Aides predict that Mr Delors will launch a campaign of TV and press
appearances in the UK, in the hope of setting the record straight.
Friends say that Mr Delors detects an intellectual vacuum within the British
government led by Mr John Major. This is what most disappointed him about
the prime minister's recent article in the Economist on Europe. Mr Delors
cannot resist a debate among equals.
You guessed it: he really does miss Lady Thatcher.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin is seeking to place unfettered powers in the
presidency with a series of constitutional amendments rendering the office
invulnerable to challenge from a future parliament.
A series of amendments to the new constitution, now being thrashed out by a
constitutional assembly, point to a greatly strengthened presidency and an
end to previous efforts to compromise with the growing power of the regions.
A set of decrees issued by the president yesterday also point to the biggest
push yet to bring Russia's rebellious regions under a renewed central
command, with the president at its apex.
Mr Yeltsin has demanded that all regions and republics immediately pay all
taxes due to the central government - on pain of having all credits and
centrally distributed supplies suspended from November 1.
A number of republics and regions have withheld taxes, while arguing with
the federal authorities over their respective rights to spend them; other
regions have claimed republican status; and a group of regions in the Urals
have proclaimed a new Urals Republic.
Under the constitutional amendments, the president gains the right to
appoint the prime minister, rather than just suggesting a candidate to be
confirmed by the lower house of the new parliament. He can also sack the
government without the parliament's agreement and ultimately disband it, if
it consistently opposes his choice.
The president can no longer be impeached for breaking the constitution - the
issue on which the previous parliament sought to remove him. Treachery
against the state or other serious crimes are now the only grounds for
impeachment - which must itself be confirmed by a higher court, and the
impeachment process be completed within three months.
The president can suspend any executive body of power in Russia for breaking
federal law, and the post of vice-president has been abolished, leaving the
prime minister as the next in line in case of death or incapacity.
Amendments to the previous draft also include a cancelling of separate
citizenship rights and all foreign trade links must now be 'organised' by
the centre, while the form of government adopted by regions and republics
must be approved by the federal authorities.
The draft, which must be completed within the next two weeks, will then go
to a referendum before being adopted.

Brussels is to examine the possibility that illegal state aid has kept Daf,
the Dutch truck maker, in business for the last three years, writes Andrew
Hill from Brussels. Daf went into receivership in February, putting 13,300
jobs in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK at risk. Its Belgian and Dutch
operations were transformed into a new company in March with the help of
equity capital and loans from the Dutch state and the Flemish region of
Belgium.
The Commission opened an inquiry on Wednesday. If the aid is found to be
illegal, the company's liquidators may have to repay the subsidies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE daily Izvestiya yesterday heralded its announcement of President Boris
Yeltsin's decree giving Russian citizens the right to buy, sell, rent and
bequeath land by reprinting its own front page of exactly 76 years ago. That
contained the decree 'On Land' by the new Bolshevik government which
proclaimed that land would be returned to the peasants.
The reality, said Izvestiya yesterday, soon became one of state ownership
and dispossession of peasant proprietors in favour of collectivisation.
The present decree sets out, for the first time in Russian history, to
create a class of farmer-proprietors with fully guaranteed rights. The state
will guarantee and protect the right to buy, sell, rent, transfer and divide
land freely, reserving only the right to claim land for strategic state use
after paying the market price for it.
Foreigners and foreign companies can participate in the process of buying
and selling land, but apparently only (the decree is vague on the point) in
association with Russian companies. Land can be used for agricultural
purposes, or for development of any kind.
In a move analagous to the rights given to workers in state enterprises,
workers on state and collective farms will have the right to buy plots of
land at discounted prices. Land can be sold off in auctions or offered for
sale privately to competitive bids.
A new state body, with offices in all regions, will be charged with ensuring
that land sales go through.

June in the EC country where they live.
The right to vote in local and European parliament elections in the country
of residence is one of the principles of EC 'citizenship' contained in the
Maastricht treaty, which comes into force on Monday.
But to sidestep accusations that the new 'European Union' wants to harmonise
long-established national rules on who can vote or stand for election, the
Commission yesterday tabled complex legislation which respects existing
regulations.
For example, member states like Britain which impose a minimum residence
requirement on their electorate, will retain that limit, but will have to
take into account the time voters have spent living in other EC member
states.
Further rules will prevent candidates disqualified from standing in one
member state from joining the party lists in another EC country, and
information exchanges should help catch fraudsters voting or standing in two
countries at once. The EC will try to ensure the measures are adopted by the
end of the year.
In most member states the proportion of expatriates is comparatively low -
ranging from less than 1 per cent to 6 per cent. However, some 29 per cent
of the Luxembourg population are foreigners - mainly Portuguese immigrants -
and the Grand Duchy was worried that some of its constituencies would be
dominated by foreign candidates. The draft directive gets round that problem
by allowing Luxembourg to prevent all but long-term residents voting or
standing for election.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Mass march in Bonn opposes benefit cuts

MORE THAN 100,000 building workers converged on Bonn yesterday in a mass
protest against the social spending cuts ordered by the German government.
In the biggest demonstration of union discontent yet organised in a 'hot
autumn' of protest, the builders denounced government plans to cancel their
'bad weather money', which is paid as an alternative to unemployment benefit
in the winter months.
Mr Bruno Kobele, leader of the building workers' union, accused the Bonn
coalition of 'running socially amok' with its savings plans, which will cut
unemployment benefit by three percentage points, limit its duration to two
years, and abolish the workers' special deal.
The 'bad weather' money has existed since 1959 to prevent mass winter
lay-offs in the industry.
The size of the turnout surprised even the organisers, and confirms a
gathering mood of discontent in the German workforce at the combined squeeze
of increasing unemployment, reduced social spending, and rising tax and
social security deductions.
At the same time, there was confirmation yesterday of growing support for
short-time working to be introduced as an alternative to outright job cuts.
The Volkswagen plan to bring in a four-day week as an alternative to mass
redundancies was formally proposed by a workers' leader at Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa), the troubled Daimler-Benz subsidiary which has announced
cuts of up to 16,000 jobs.
Mr Horst Kowalczyk, works council chairman in the Deutsche Aerospace Airbus
division, called on the management to negotiate alternatives such as the
four-day week to its planned programme of plant closures, which will shut
two large plants in Munich and Lemwerder in Lower Saxony.
He was speaking at a mass meeting at the threatened Munich-Neuaubing plant,
where more than 1,000 workers whistled and heckled Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, head
of the Airbus division, and Mr Georg von Waldenfels, the Bavarian finance
minister.

FT  29 OCT 93 / State to take up Treuhand task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government will take control of about 100 enterprises which the
Treuhand privatisation agency will be unable to sell by the end of 1994 when
its mandate expires, officials confirmed yesterday.
At the same time, a new bill will be presented to the Bundestag to extend
the life of the Treuhand, whose main task after 1994 will be to complete the
privatisation of land, monitor sales contracts, and manage real estate.
The plan for the enterprises, which was announced by Mr Theo Waigel, finance
minister, represents a radical shift in policy away from rapid privatisation
to a much slower process based on restructuring and better management. The
plan, which will be debated by the Bundestag over coming weeks, coincides
with growing criticism from the governments of the five eastern states that
the Treuhand could have done more to prevent closure and protect jobs.
The agency has sold all but 1,392 of its 13,200 enterprises since it was set
up in July 1990. Sales have generated more than DM180bn (Pounds 73bn) of
committed investment and guaranteed 1.45m jobs. But nearly 3,000 enterprises
have been closed at the cost of 313,000 jobs, and a further 2m jobs have
been lost through privatisation.
Finance officials yesterday would not say which enterprises would come under
government control.  However, the giant railway carriage and locomotive
maker Deutsche Waggon Bau, machine tool manufacturer Sket, and the Buna
chemical works could be on the list.
Denying that efforts to find solutions to enterprises employing more than
200,000 people had been influenced by next year's federal and state
elections, a finance ministry official said: 'We just need more time to
restructure them, prepare them for privatisation, and then find a buyer.'
The restructuring phase, which will start in 1995 and end in 2000, will cost
DM45bn. Part of the cost will be financed by the federal budget.

FT  29 OCT 93 / State telecoms executive arrested: Anti-corruption inquiry
widens to involve more public-sector figures

<TEXT>
MR VITO Gamberale, a divisional head at Sip, Italy's main state-controlled
telephone utility, was arrested yesterday for alleged attempted extortion
concerning a telecommunications contract in the Naples region.
This the first time a Sip executive has been linked to anti-corruption
investigations.
The arrest coincided with that of another prominent public-sector figure, Mr
Marcello Inghilese, head of the foreign trade institute (ICE), on charges of
fraud concerning the opening of a trade office in Orlando, Florida.
Mr Gamberale, head of the cellar telephones division, has previously worked
with ENI, the state oil concern, and is considered close to the Socialist
Party.
He was arrested along with three others, including a local Socialist
politician.
Naples magistrates alleged Mr Gamberale attempted to threaten the owner of a
local telephone equipment company with the loss of a contract unless he
employed a specific number of people 'recommended' to him by local political
bosses.
The Naples magistrates' investigations are part of a broadening inquiry into
alleged vote-buying by the most prominent politicians in the Naples region.
Their inquiries into telecommunications contracts are separate from those of
Milan magistrates. In May and June, Milan magistrates detained a number of
senior executives in the state-run telecommunications companies.
These included Mr Francisco Silvano, then managing director of Stet, the
umbrella telecoms group, and the heads of Sirti (its engineering subsidiary)
and Italel, responsible for equipment manufacture.
In Milan yesterday, the trial opened of Mr Sergio Cusani, who is suspected
of being a key financial intermediary in alleged pay-offs to politicians by
Montedison, the industrial arm of the Ferruzzi conglomerate.
As the trial opened, Montedison announced it had become a civil party to the
case.
This appeared to be part of a strategy by the administrators of the
collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group to recover the large amounts believed to
have been paid over to politicians, as well as money allegedly siphoned off
for personal use by the Ferruzzi family.
The Italian Senate yesterday approved a law removing parliamentarians'
immunity from interrogation by the judiciary, but preserving their right to
resist arrest unless due cause is presented to parliament in written
documents.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Italian industry hit by protest strike
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S public services, banks and much of industry was paralysed yesterday
by a four-hour general strike called by the unions in protest at the 1994
austerity budget.
Demonstrations were held in all the country's main cities. Union leaders
attacked the government's economic policy despite a last-minute decision by
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to increase funds for creating
new jobs from L800bn (Pounds 332m) to L1,300bn (Pounds 540m).
As with the previous four general strikes in April, the union leaders were
doubtful that the protest would produce concrete improvements for the
rank-and-file or alter the basic austerity measures in next year's budget.
Instead, the strike action reflected the general sense of frustration in the
labour movement about pay falling behind inflation and the rise in the
unemployment rate to nearly 11 per cent.
The lack of real focus in the general strike provoked a tough response from
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. It issued a statement
saying the unions were deluding themselves if they believed the state could
continue to be guarantor of jobs or that hand-outs could be the motor of
recovery.
The strike had been preceded by a week of labour unrest in the transport
sector. Significantly, the sole sector to observe a full day's stoppage was
the chemicals industry. Here Enichem, the state chemicals group, is about to
implement a restructuring plan which could see a 20 per cent reduction in
the workforce. In September, Enichem workers at Crotone in southern Italy
carried out a violent occupation of the plant and nearby town which
signalled the begining of a more radical labour climate nationwide.
Apart from employment, yesterday's strike was intended to highlight the
inequalities in the tax system, with salaried workers bearing the brunt of
contributions while the self-employed evade taxes on a huge scale. The
government is currently battling to retain a 'minimum tax' to impose on the
estimated earnings of the self-employed and this week decided to call a vote
of confidence in parliament on this issue.
The unions are also complaining that strong lobbying on has persuaded the
government to to divert more money in the 1994 budget to top up pensions at
the expense of public sector pay increases. The budget, due to be approved
by mid-December, is attempting to reduce the public sector deficit to 8.7
per cent of gross domestic product and find an extra L32,000bn mainly
through spending cuts.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Balladur seeks new Air France package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE damaging nine-day strike at Air France continued to ease yesterday,
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said a recovery plan for the
state-run airline was 'indispensable' despite his government's climbdown on
an earlier austerity package.
In an interview in the French daily Le Figaro, Mr Balladur said the state
and taxpayers could not continue to support losses of FFr5bn (Pounds 580m) a
year at Air France, the amount the airline is forecast to lose this year.
But he said a new recovery plan could avoid involuntary redundancies and
share equally the burden of cost-cutting across the company.
Mr Balladur's comments came as the strike by ground staff, which has brought
Air France to a virtual standstill, appeared to be petering out. Many
baggage handlers, maintenance workers and technicians returned to work,
although the airline's freight services remained paralysed at both Orly and
Charles de Gaulle airports.
A spokesman for Force Ouvriere, representing about 35 per cent of ground
staff and which has been at the forefront of the dispute, said the union was
awaiting the outcome of negotiations next week before deciding whether to
relaunch industrial action.
Mr Christian Blanc, who has taken over as Air France's chairman following
the resignation on Sunday of Mr Bernard Attali, will meet union leaders at
the beginning of next week in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Mr Attali's
plan included 4,000 job cuts and a reduction in overtime pay and bonuses. Mr
Blanc has said he will not impose any cost-cutting measures before
discussions with union representatives.
Air France services, which had been brought to a complete standstill for
much of the dispute, showed some improvement yesterday. Thirty-six flights,
including 24 from Paris's two main airports, operated yesterday and the
airline said it hoped to double the number of departures today.
But the number of flights remains far short of the 450 normally operated and
a resumption of usual service is expected to be a slow process.

PLANS to expand Berlin's airport capacity are expected to be financed by the

borrowing for infrastructure projects.
Investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been appointed to advise Berlin
Brandenburg Flughafen Holding (BBF) how the existing structure, and the
construction of a new airport, can be financed privately.
BBF, a holding company whose shareholders include the German government,
which has a 26 per cent stake, the state of Brandenburg (37 per cent) and
the city of Berlin (37 per cent), runs the city's three airports: Tegel,
Templehof, and Schonefeld. All three are operating at close to capacity;
nearly 10m passengers used them last year. Also, Templehof may be closed by
1996 because it is virtually in the city centre.
Mr Michael McGhee, a director of BZW in London, said: This is the first time
an airport authority in Germany had considered approaching the private
sector for financing a major infrastructure project.' In the past, the money
to build airports has been raised by debt through the banks.
An official from the Senate, Berlin's government, said yesterday the city
was aiming to become the hub for for central and eastern Europe.
The shift to the private sector coincides with attempts by the states of
Brandeburg and Berlin to contain their budget deficits. Berlin this year
overshot its budget by DM5.8bn.

A HIGH-LEVEL court ruling in Germany has confirmed the right of petrol
stations to sell a range of goods after normal shopping hours.
The ruling by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin increases pressure
for a wider lifting of Germany's restrictive and rigidly enforced laws on
shop opening hours.
Petrol stations will now be allowed to sell 'goods for journeys', an
expression which is defined as including non-alcoholic drinks, sweets,
newspapers and 'other goods'.
The ruling seems certain to accelerate a revived political debate on the
whole issue of shop opening hours, which are normally until 18.30 every
evening, and 14.00 on a Saturday. There is late opening on Thursday
evenings, and on the first Saturday each month.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French champagne industry yesterday won the first round in an
acrimonious legal battle against Yves Saint-Laurent, the Paris fashion
house, when it won a court order preventing YSL using the name Champagne for
its latest fragrance.
YSL is appealing against the ban, which applies only in France, but which
will force it to change the name of Champagne within a month. If the appeal
fails it faces substantial losses, given that it has already spent large
sums publicising the perfume, which was introduced in France and other
European countries last month.
The typical cost of launching such a fragrance worldwide is Dollars 50m,
with Europe absorbing Dollars 15m of the total.
Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company that last year took over YSL
in a highly controversial FFr3.6bn (Pounds 410m) acquisition, saw its shares
fall from FFr1,022 to FFr988 after the court's decision. The affair has
erupted at a time when YSL and Elf-Sanofi already face the threat of a legal
investigation over suspected insider trading in YSL shares.
The champagne lobby has claimed that the existence of a perfume called
Champagne could confuse consumers and imperil the prestige of their product.
If YSL loses the appeal, it will also face an unenviable strategic dilemma.
Such large fragrance companies operate on an international basis and
co-ordinate the marketing of their products so they are positioned in
exactly the same way in every country.
If YSL were forced to change the name of Champagne in France, it would
torpedo its hopes of creating a coherent international image for the brand.
Alternatively it might decide to change the name everywhere - an expensive
option.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Future of German energy industry in doubt: Cross-party talks
fail to decide on the country's nuclear power industry and its subsidised
coal mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of nuclear power in Germany and the fate of its highly subsidised
coal mines are both in doubt after the collapse of a year-long effort to
negotiate a cross-party compromise on energy.
The governing conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn failed to reach
agreement with the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) on Wednesday
night, primarily because they were unable to agree on whether nuclear power
has a future in the German economy.
The ramifications are considerable. It means that the hotly-debated issue of
how to dispose of Germany's nuclear waste is undecided. That leaves
question-marks hanging over Britain's multi-billion pound project for
nuclear waste reprocessing at British Nuclear Fuel's Thorp plant at
Sellafield, and over similar reprocessing contracts with France's Cogema.
It means Germany's power generators - led by RWE in the Ruhr, Veba's
PreussenElektra in Hanover, and Bayernwerk in Munich - still have no secure
planning framework in which to decide on their next generation of power
stations. They may be fuelled with domestic coal, imported coal, brown of
soft coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, or renewable energy sources: all
that is certain is that all is uncertain.
The nuclear power station manufacturers, led by Siemens KWU, do not know if
they should go ahead with developing a new generation of extra-safe nuclear
reactors, or abandon the project because they will never have a domestic
market. They believe there is a huge future export market, but fear that the
loss of a domestic nuclear industry will cause many of their top nuclear
engineers to leave the country.
It means that two politically-explosive plans for nuclear waste disposal -
at the Gorleben salt mines and the Schacht Konrad disused coal mine in the
state of Lower Saxony - are left half open.
And it puts the whole future financing plans for the embattled German coal
mining industry, already suffering a severe squeeze because of the downturn
in steelmaking, in doubt. The industry requires massive subsidies to the end
of the century to maintain a production of 35m tonnes a year for power
stations.
The German government, the coal mining industry and the power generators,
all link a viable future for coal with the maintenance of nuclear energy:
they say that only by cross-subsidising the high cost of burning German coal
(its price is currently about DM280 (Pounds 114) a tonne, compared with DM80
for imported coal) with low-cost nuclear power can they afford to buy the
domestic product.
The whole subject of energy supply in Germany is fraught with political
pitfalls. It concerns not simply ideological differences between left and
right, and between environmentalists and the industrial lobby. It also
concerns acute regional rivalries, between the federal states and the Bonn
government, between north Germany and the south, and within industry as much
as within the political establishment. South Germany is pro-nuclear. The
Ruhr is pro-coal. And north Germany could happily survive with imported coal
and gas.
Control of the nuclear power industry is shared between the states and the
federal government in Germany's decentralised system. They share
responsibilities for licensing nuclear power stations. That means that even
if the central government wants to maintain nuclear power in the national
energy balance, it has to co-operate with SPD state governments, several of
which rule in coalitions with fiercely anti-nuclear Greens.
The attempt to forge a cross-party, cross-industry consensus was launched a
year ago by the unlikely alliance of Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier of
Lower Saxony, who heads a red-green coalition there, and the bosses of the
two largest energy utilities, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive of RWE,
and the late Mr Klaus Piltz, chief executive of Veba.
They came from opposite directions. Mr Schroder, who faces state elections
next March, wants to lift the threat of high-level nuclear waste disposal at
the Gorleben salt mines. He also wants a clear commitment to the abandonment
of nuclear energy in Germany, so that he knows precisely how much low-level
waste may be dumped in Schacht Konrad.
The energy utilities need planning certainty for the next generation of
power stations. And they also need a plan to dispose of their
steadily-accumulating nuclear waste.
They are locked into contracts for waste reprocessing with both BNFL and
Cogema, which will produce 40m tonnes of plutonium. That in turn has to be
reconverted into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel elements back in Germany, which can
then be burned in their power stations.
That process is now blocked by the red-green coalition in the state of
Hesse, where the environment minister, Mr Joschka Fischer, is the Green
party's most articulate anti-nuclear advocate. He has simply prevented the
MOX element plant at Hanau being completed.
The utilities may be forced to ask Cogema and BNFL to convert their
plutonium into MOX elements in France and Britain. That solution is
certainly under debate. But in the long run, both the utilities and the
German political parties are looking actively at the alternative option to
reprocessing - direct disposal of nuclear waste.
Last week, after months of painful negotiation, Mr Schroder and Mr Klaus
Topfer, the Bonn environment minister, thought they had managed to negotiate
a successful compromise.
It included amending the German nuclear law to allow direct disposal of
nuclear waste as an alternative to reprocessing; it would give the present
generation of nuclear power stations a confirmed working life of 35 to 40
years; it would launch a search for alternative waste disposal sites to
Gorleben, while allowing Schacht Konrad to be used for low-level waste; it
would allow a prototype nuclear reactor of a new 'extra-safe' generation to
be licensed in Germany; and it would guarantee long-term subsidies to the
coal mining industry of DM7bn a year from 1997-2000.
On Monday night, the deal was vetoed by the national executive of the SPD.
On the one hand, it failed to give adequate guarantees for the coal mines.
On the other, it clearly left open the 'nuclear option' which the SPD has
rejected.
Now the governing coalition has promised to attempt to force the necessary
decisions through the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two houses of parliament,
without cross-party support. It means that the chances of success are
considerably reduced. It could leave the nuclear industry in doubt until
1995, along with the coal mines, and the French and British reprocessing
industries.
'We know we do not make the situation easy for our neighbours,' Mr Topfer
admitted yesterday after the collapse of the talks. 'We cannot decide these
things in national isolation.'
Mr Topfer believes that in the long run, Germany must switch from
reprocessing its nuclear fuel to direct disposal: it is much cheaper, he
believes, and it will not produce plutonium. But the collapse of the talks
makes that switch more remote, not less.
'It is rather less probable that we will get a change in the nuclear law (to
allow direct disposal),' he said. 'It is more likely that it will remain as
it is. That will not be in the interests of the SPD. But then, that is
life.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / Major to support fresh N Ireland peace initiative: London
and Dublin hope to sideline Hume-Adams talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR and Mr Albert Reynolds will back a new political initiative
today to bring peace in Northern Ireland based on secret talks between the
London and Dublin governments.
The two leaders will consider joint proposals for a new constitutional
settlement which includes fundamental changes to the Irish constitution and
the creation of a number of powerful executive boards to increase
cross-border co-operation.
They are determined to regain the initiative at the end of a week of
escalating violence, which started last Saturday with an IRA bomb which
killed 10 people in the mainly Protestant Shankill Road.
The bloodshed continued last night with the shooting dead of two Catholic
brothers, aged 18 and 20, in the living room of their home at Bleary, near
Warringstown, Co Down. Loyalists were blamed for the murders.
The proposals, drafted in outline over recent weeks by a working party of
civil servants from London and Dublin, would provide an 'umbrella' for the
restart of negotiations between political parties in the province.
The move is also designed to sideline the parallel talks between Mr John
Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, and persuade the parties to talk again. Dublin,
however, wants some of the Hume-Adams proposals included in a broader
settlement.
The outcome of today's meeting, at the margins of the European summit in
Brussels, may not be spelled out in detail given the political sensitivity
of the peace process. But they will form the basis for more talks next week
between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew,
the Northern Ireland secretary.
The 'guiding principles' for any agreement, set out this week in the Dublin
parliament by Mr Spring, received a strong positive response from London
yesterday.
Officials stress that the provisions of this fresh joint Irish-UK initiative
would only come into effect as part of an overall settlement. That in turn
would depend on agreement between the SDLP and the Unionist parties on the
shape of internal political arrangements in the province to replace
government from Westminster. Both sides acknowledge that considerable
obstacles remain. But at the heart of any intergovernmental settlement would
be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland with an aspiration to achieve a united
Ireland.
It return Britain would formally acknowledge the legitimacy of that
aspiration and would agree to the establishment of a number of cross-border
executive boards in such areas as transport, dealings with the European
Community's social funds and tourism.
Mr Spring's clear declaration that the consent of the people of Northern
Ireland was essential for any change in the status of the province was
warmly welcomed in Downing Street. Mr Major told MPs he looked forward to
discussing the 'positive' proposals with Mr Reynolds.
There was acknowledgment in Whitehall that the peace process drawn up by Mr
Hume and Mr Adams still presents political hazards for any intergovernmental
settlement.
Mr Reynolds, who is expected to outline the Hume-Adams plan in today's
meeting, believes some elements could be incorporated into an agreement
between the two governments. Dublin also believes it must take seriously the
prospect of an IRA ceasefire.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Queens Moat wins approval from bankers on refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group which has been in crisis
talks since its shares were suspended in March, yesterday gave their backing
in principle to a long-awaited reconstruction plan which paves the way for a
refinancing of the group's Pounds 1bn debt.
The reconstruction plan is due to be announced today with details of Queens
Moat's results, expected to show the second-largest loss in UK corporate
history, with an estimated pre-tax deficit of just over Pounds 1bn for the
year to December 31.
It is believed Queens Moat will reveal a significant downward revision of
the group's 1991 profits, as a result of new management adopting more
conservative accounting policies.
The banks are understood to have extended their standstill agreement, due to
expire at the end of this month, until January 31 1994, by which time a
refinancing will have to be concluded. It is understood this will involve a
large debt for equity swap, significantly diluting existing shareholders. A
statement yesterday from Barclays Bank, which with NatWest led the steering
committee representing creditors, said Queens Moat had 'a viable future,
despite the group's results for the year to December 31 and six months to
July 2'.
Queens Moat's losses for 1992 will be almost entirely due to a Pounds 1.2bn
writedown on the group's hotels portfolio, taken through both the profit and
loss account and the balance sheet. It is understood the value of its hotels
has been cut to about Pounds 850m.
The record for pre-tax losses by a UK company was set in February by British
Aerospace, with a deficit of Pounds 1.2bn after Pounds 1bn in exceptional
charges.
Some of Queens Moat's recent difficulties appear to have stemmed from an
incentive scheme for individual hotel managers, which related their
remuneration to sales. It is thought about 40 per cent of the group's 191
hotels in the UK and continental Europe use the scheme. However, by the end
of 1994 it is understood that incentives will have been eliminated.
While the reconstruction plan sets out some disposals, it is understood to
be more closely focused on management controls. It is believed to have
provided for the 'creation' of a financial department. The figures for the
half year to July, for example, are not expected to have any comparable
results, partly due to the lack of working papers.
Queens Moat has changed its auditors, financial advisers and property
valuers. It is understood there have been several breaches of the Companies
Act and the Department of Trade and Industry is thought to have been kept
informed of developments.
The company is understood to be considering legal action against previous
management.
A Queens Moat spokesman welcomed the banks' announcement as recognition that
'new management has control of this business . . . I believe that with the
banks' support there is very definitely potential within Queens Moat'.
As part of its restructuring strategy, Queens Moat has agreed to sell the
share capital of Queens Moat Leisure for about Pounds 6.7m.

FT  29 OCT 93 / Bock says he regrets 'illogical' attack by Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DIETER BOCK, the German financier who has been the victim of a strident
attack from his joint Lonrho chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, yesterday
declared that he had no intention of entering a war of words.
He then promptly referred to his rival as 'my dear disjointed chief
executive'. For good measure he added: 'I have to act like I'm running a
company - not a kindergarten.'
Explaining his reticence about commenting on Lonrho's elder statesman, in
his first remarks since Mr Rowland's attack last weekend, he said: 'It would
be damaging for the company. I regret what Tiny did and that's all I have to
say'.
He added: 'I was so surprised by Mr Rowland's attack. It was so illogical. I
do not intend to comment and correct all the statements.'
However he could not resist disclosing that when he saw Mr Rowland, who had
accused him of contributing almost nothing to Lonrho, he said: 'My dear
Tiny, you bought the most expensive fish ever sold at Harrods. I hope you
are paying for it.'
Mr Bock was referring to the shark in Harrods food hall, nicknamed 'Tiny',
which the Fayed brothers have symbolically given to Mr Rowland after his
decision last week to call off the long-standing legal dispute over their
1985 purchase of House of Fraser.
Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho at the beginning of the year,
said he would not be deflected from his task of turning it into a more
conventional company.
On Wednesday night, he had dinner with the two new non-executives he
nominated to the Lonrho board, Mr Peter Harper of Hanson, and Mr Stephen
Walls of Albert Fisher. They made plain their determination to make Lonrho a
more transparent company by establishing an audit committee to review the
company's finances when the board meets next month and by joining the
remuneration committee, to assess pay rates in the company.
Mr Rowland is concerned that Mr Bock is preparing to dismiss the older
directors, such as the joint deputy chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert
Dunlop, who are his staunch supporters.
In an attempt to pacify Mr Rowland, Mr Bock said: 'I do not intend to
proceed with a hammer. I want to try and calm the situation and see if
everyone can act in a more reasonable way.'

FT  29 OCT 93 / VW seeks savings equal to 30% cut in jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WOLFSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN will have to shed 30 per cent of its employees in Germany if
management plans for pay cuts and a four-day week are not accepted, the
workforce was warned yesterday.
VW, mainstay marque of the loss-making automotive group, which will have
103,000 workers by the end of this year, will need only 72,000 in 1995, Mr
Peter Hartz, labour director, told a press conference. Limits on state aid
for short-time working, and the high cost of early retirement schemes, meant
that Germany's traditional 'painless' workforce reduction methods were no
longer practicable or affordable.
Mr Klaus Volkert, chairman of the works council and the employees' leading
representative, said: 'Because of this the board is working on plans which
will involve mass redundancies if we do not find other solutions.'
The possibility of 18,000 job cuts next year and a further 12,000 in 1995
was far worse than had been expected, he claimed.
While Mr Volkert appeared surprised, the VDA automotive industry association
warned only recently that the sector would have to shed a further 200,000
jobs in the next few years. In common with the rest of German industry,
vehicle makers are striving to regain competitiveness mainly by reducing
labour costs.
While other manufacturers are cutting workforce numbers they are also
applying new methods, including widespread cuts in bonuses and benefits.
VW has been forced to seek new solutions to its overmanning by an agreement
with its largest shareholder, the government of Lower Saxony, to maintain
the workforce at 100,000.
It is also ill-equipped to bear the costs of redundancies.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, who confidently forecast a break-even
result earlier this year, is now facing a group loss of some DM1.7bn (Pounds
690m) according to recent independent estimates.
Provisions for 18,000 redundancies in 1994 would take the 1993 deficit to
more than DM3bn, observers suggest. If applied across the board, Mr Hartz's
plan could reduce VW's annual labour bill by more than DM2.5bn.
Although Mr Volkert accepted that 'burden sharing' in the interests of
workforce solidarity was preferable to sackings, he warned that the
negotiations would not be easy. Formal talks are due to start shortly and
the management hopes to introduce the new working practices at the start of
next year.
Mr Volkert said management's hopes for a 20 per cent pay cut in line with
the planned reduction in the working week from 36 to 28.8 hours would not be
possible for all employee groups.
He also indicated that the German workforce would demand sacrifices and
capacity cuts elsewhere in the group, which includes Audi, the quality car
division, Skoda in the Czech Republic and Seat in Spain.
Seat has recently been told that one of its three factories is to be closed
and 40 per cent of the 23,000 workforce is to go.
Mr Volkert said the unions will also demand details on the effects of
changes introduced by production director Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua. These include switching parts manufacture to cheaper outside
suppliers.
Mr Lopez is also mainly responsible for an efficiency drive, which VW
expects will improve productivity in German factories by between 11 per cent
and 15 per cent next year, further increasing the pressure for job cuts.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Finnish pulp and
paper group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, swung to a FM186m (Dollars
32.6m) profit after financial items in the first eight months from a FM283m
deficit in the same 1992 period.
Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, attributed the turnround to the weaker
markka, greater internal efficiency and lower raw material costs.
He said conditions remained difficult as European recession and overcapacity
drove prices down for pulp, fine papers and board. Prices for other products
were generally stable. The exceptions were newsprint and sawn products,
where demand and supply were more balanced because of reduced North American
exports.
Sales rose to FM8.89bn, a 39 per cent increase which partly reflected the
group's purchase of Tampella's forest products and packaging operations in
May. It benefited from increased sales from the new Enocell pulp mill and
higher capacity utilisation.
The operating margin improved to FM1.97bn, or 22.2 per cent of net sales,
from FM917m, or 14.4 per cent of sales. Interest expenses amounted to
FM1.23bn, reflecting the group's heavy investment programme. Capital
investments totalled FM2.19bn in the first eight months, due to the Tampella
purchase, the Enocell project and work on a new paper plant in Germany.
Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, recorded a FM65m loss after
financial items in the first eight months, a sharp improvement on the FM317m
deficit it recorded a year earlier.
The group has undergone restructuring since it was rescued by the Bank of
Finland in late 1991, culminating in the sale of its forest and packaging
operations to Enso-Gutzeit earlier this year. The company's improved
prospects encouraged the state to sell a big chunk of its shares in August,
leaving it with a 50.6 per cent stake.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Neste sinks deeper into the red
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HEAVY financing costs more than offset a better operating performance to
produce a deeper loss at Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and
petrochemicals group, in the first eight months.
The group's deficit before reserves and taxes amounted to FM1.32bn (Dollars
231m), exceeding last year's loss by FM330m.
Although market conditions in the group's core areas remained tough, the
group blamed the deterioration on increased capital costs and foreign
exchange losses.
Currency losses alone amounted to FM650m, following the weakening of the
Finnish markka over the last year.
This pushed up the group's overall financial costs to FM1.82bn from FM686m.
The increased costs overshadowed the improved operating result, which moved
to a FM413m profit from a FM253m deficit as a result of cost-cutting.
Sales rose to FM42.8bn from FM36.4bn.
Oil sales rose to FM33.6bn from FM29.7bn while chemicals sales improved to
FM8.0bn from FM6.0bn.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bildt sees 'urgent need' for
privatisation of Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish Prime Minister, said yesterday there was an
urgent need to privatise Renault, the French automotive group which is to be
the dominant partner in a proposed merger with Volvo's car and truck
operations.
Mr Bildt, responding to mounting criticism in Sweden that the merger amounts
to a French state takeover of Volvo, noted there were no guarantees about
Renault's privatisation. But he did not doubt the intention of the French to
sell off Renault. He has no intention of intervening in the merger, which
his government supported.
The privatisation of Renault should proceed as quickly as possible, he said.
'Had privatisation not been contemplated, there would have been a reason to
question the merger. But the French government says that it intends to
privatise by the end of next year or at the start of 1995 and I do not doubt
their intentions.'
Volvo shareholders will vote on the merger at a special shareholders meeting
on November 9.
The Swedish company said yesterday it had reached agreement with the French
government which eases the pressure on it to reduce its shareholding in the
merged company to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in the event of a breakdown
of the merger agreement.
However, the French government will retain the right after privatisation to
use a golden share to vet any holding over 20 per cent of the votes in
Renault-Volvo, an issue which has been portrayed in Sweden as potentially
forcing Volvo to reduce its holding.
Most analysts expect the merger to be approved at the shareholders meeting.
But a state pension fund - the second largest shareholder after Renault with
7.5 per cent of the voting capital - which previously said it would support
Volvo, said yesterday it would not make a final decision until next week.
Volvo's shares, meanwhile, rose on the Stockholm stock exchange, closing up
SKr13 on the day at SKr436, and up SKr19 since the company issued a defence
of the merger on Tuesday saying it would lead to improved dividends and
better profit margins.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: STC takeover referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bid by French telecommunications equipment supplier Alcatel to buy STC
Submarine Systems, the UK-based submarine cable business of Canadian
telecoms manufacturer Northern Telecom, is to face an investigation by the
UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, has
referred the Pounds 600m (Dollars 906m) deal to the MMC following a
recommendation by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Analysts were surprised by the MMC referral, given the international nature
of the undersea cable business and Northern Telecom's determination to sell
STC. More than 90 per cent of STC's cable systems are exported.
The European Commission's competition directorate cleared the takeover last
month.
Under the Fair Trading Act, the UK government has the power to refer mergers
to the MMC if they create or intensify a market share of more than 25 per
cent or involve the takeover of assets worth more than Pounds 30m.
STC is a principal supplier of long-distance undersea fibre-optic systems to
British Telecommunications. However, BT made no formal objection to the
Department of Trade of Industry, although it is known to have had serious
reservations about the takeover.
The submarine cable division was acquired by Northern Telecom as part of its
Pounds 1.9bn takeover of STC in 1990. But the company has no submarine
business in North America, and it sits uneasily with its core businesses of
transmission, switching, radio/microwave and integrated networks.
If the Alcatel deal is not agreed, the future of STC looks highly uncertain.
It currently has 1,200 employees, mostly in Greenwich, London.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Prominent Italians form queue for their day in court:
Today's opening of the first corruption trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus of Italy's corruption scandals shifts from investigation to
prosecution today when the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, alleged to have been a
key middleman, opens in Milan.
Mr Cusani is the first of the well known financial figures implicated in the
corruption scandals to come before the courts. The evidence is his trial
should provide a clearer picture of the political corruption and the links
between politicians, businessmen, pliant judges and friendly bankers that
have marked the scandals.
So far countrywide investigations have involved more than 1,300 politicians,
local party officials, civil servants and businessmen, plus at least 20
judges and magistrates and at least 15 members of the security services.
Until now considerable information on the corruption scandals has been
deliberately allowed to leak out by the investigating magistrates to
discredit the politicians and frighten others into talking. But this is the
first time that evidence will be heard in open court on matters relating to
one of the biggest scandals of the past decade, the Enimont affair.
Milan magistrates need an exemplary case study such as this to demonstrate
how the old political system worked. Only after they have been able to do
this will it be publicly acceptable to draw a line on their inquiries. For
they themselves admit the investigations cannot be completely open-ended
since corruption permeated every aspect of Italian society.
Mr Cusani, who was arrested on July 23, also has the distinction of being
the only person to refuse to co-operate with investigating magistrates and
demand an early trial to ensure his point of view is fully aired.
He faces a string of charges, including falsifying accounts, that relate to
the affairs of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire. In Milan business
circles, he was a well known deal maker with close links to the Socialist
party.
The magistrates allege among other things that Mr Cusani was entrusted with
overseeing a phoney property deal on behalf of the late Mr Raul Gardini,
then head of Ferruzzi-Montedison. They allege the deal provided the cover to
use Montedison funds for pay-offs worth some L150bn (Dollars 94m) to the
politicians. This was in return for letting Ferruzzi-Montedison pull out at
a huge profit in 1990 from Enimont, the joint chemicals venture with Eni,
the state oil concern. Mr Cusani is also alleged to have handled at least
part of the political pay-offs. Among the 60 odd people being called by the
prosecution and defence in a trial expected to last into December are the
leading political figures of the time - Mr Bettino Craxi, the then Socialist
leader who is alleged to have received L75bn from the Enimont affair, and Mr
Arnaldo Forlani, then head of the Christian Democrats, also alleged to have
been given a pay-off.
The corruption inquiries that began in Milan in February 1992 with the
arrest of Mr Mario Chiesa, the socialist-appointed head of the city's
largest old people's home, have moved extremely fast. This is partly because
the magistrates have been successful in extracting confessions on a
plea-bargaining basis. Extensive use of computers in cross-checking and data
compilation has also helped.
Elsewhere in Italy, the process has been slower. This has led the more
zealous Milan magistrates to try to encroach on the turf of their colleagues
in Naples, Rome and Turin, often resulting in procedural disputes.
As time goes by, the united front of the Milan magistrates, increasingly
exhausted by the sheer volume of work, has begun to crack. This has come
into the open over whether to go ahead with the prosecution of senior
figures in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) for
receiving illicit funds. The bulk of the investigative magistrates claim
there is no case to answer, while the judge of first instance is refusing to
bury the case.
A big new development is likely to come from the series of secret
conversations that Mr Craxi has been holding with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the
leading Milan investigative magistrate. The former Socialist leader earlier
this month dropped his previous hostility to Mr Di Pietro and now seems
willing to cut some sort of deal to head off prosecution.
Mr Craxi is the first of the big political figures involved in the scandals
who has volunteered testimony. He is alleged by the magistrates to be a
central character in the system of corruption that evolved in the mid-1980s
under his premiership. The press has already begun to speculate he has
explosive information on Eni, Ferruzzi-Montediso, Fiat, Berlusconi's
Fininvest media empire, and Olivetti as well as his old enemies, the
communists.
Developments surrounding Mr Craxi are likely to determine the speed at which
the politicians agree to co-operate. Until now the majority have battled
hard to preserve their parliamentary immunity.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Bosnia mini-state proposal alive, says mediator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENEVA proposal to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states is still
alive, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN mediator, said yesterday.
However, he added that a new London peace conference on the Balkans was
unlikely to get under way this year.
Such a conference was premature in the absence of a western vision for the
Balkans, on the one hand, and continuing clashes in Bosnia on the other.
Mr Stoltenberg's pessimism was echoed yesterday at the United Nations. Mr
Joe Sills, spokesman for Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general,
said there had to be careful preparation as well as the backing of both the
European Community and the Security Council.
There would also have to be considerable advance towards agreement 'because
you don't go in with everything still pending, hoping it will be solved at
the conference', Mr Sills said.
Struggling to inject new momentum into the peace process, Mr Stoltenberg and
Lord Owen, his EC counterpart, appear to have opted for back-room
discussions between the warring parties.
In the absence of formal peace talks, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, has sought to legitimise Serbia's dominant military position in
Bosnia.
Mr Milosevic appears convinced that a peace agreement, made before any new
conference, would formalise his 'victory' and hasten the lifting of United
Nations sanctions against Serbia. The sanctions, imposed 17 months ago,
coupled with two years of war, have devastated Serbia's economy.
Yesterday, a government official in Belgrade revealed that the monthly
inflation rate for October for the rump Yugoslavia totalled a record high of
1,896 per cent.
'This means that the inflation rate for the last 12 months totalled 20m per
cent,' the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Ms Mirjana Rankovic, assistant
director general of the federal bureau of statistics, as saying. She said
the daily inflation rate for October totalled 10.5 per cent and was the
worst in the world since the second world war.
Ms Rankovic said the inflation rate was boosted mainly by the soaring costs
of services which increased by 2,896 per cent over September.
The head of the bureau of statistics, Mr Dragutin Grupkovic, said last week
all other economic trends in Yugoslavia would deteriorate dramatically by
the end of the year. Statistical data showed that the country's gross
domestic product would not exceed Dollars 12bn, less than one third of last
year's figure, he said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Visa head quits after coup by big US banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Charles Russell, head of the Visa International payments organisation for
nearly a decade, was dethroned yesterday after a quiet coup by some of the
world's biggest card issuers.
Mr Russell, 63, helped cement Visa's position as the world's biggest
payment-card brand name, taking the number of Visa cards around the world to
318m by the end of June. More than Dollars 500bn was billed on Visa cards in
the 12 months to June, compared with Dollars 4bn in 1984, when Mr Russell
took over.
But against a background of intensified competition in the credit card
industry and inroads made in the US market by Visa's smaller rival,
Mastercard, some of the biggest US banks had become impatient for new
leadership at the payment group.
'It's a big bureaucracy: they don't manage with an eye on the bottom line,'
said one US bank which issues Visa cards yesterday - while paying tribute to
Mr Russell's success.
Mr Russell will be replaced as president and chief executive at the start of
next year by an out sider. The appointment of Mr Edmund Jensen, 56,
vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Oregon-based US Bancorp,
represents a move to bring in new blood to the senior management, one bank
said.
In an apparent concession to his stature in the industry, though, the Visa
board has agreed that Mr Russell will continue to work on strategic issues
until the company's annual general meeting next June.
Mr Russell's departure is the latest in a series of high-level changes at
the San Francisco-based payment group, which is owned by more than 18,000
banks around the world.
In August, Mr Carl Pascarella - a protege of Mr Russell - was brought in to
head the US card business in preference to Mr Robert Heller.
The US has experienced the most intense competition in the credit card
business, leading to lower fees and lending margins for card issuers.
A Visa spokesman, meanwhile, denied the decision over the timing of Mr
Russell's retirement had been taken out of his hands. 'Chuck has had an
extremely good relationship with the board,' he said.
At a press conference Mr Edmund Jensen, his successor, praised Mr Russell's
contribution in building up the world's biggest payment services group. A
press release quoted Mr Russell as saying earlier this year that no chief
executive should stay in the job for more than 10 years.
Mr Jensen said Mr Russell's legacy was such that he did not envisage making
any major organisational changes.

FT  28 OCT 93 / BCCI creditors face long delay after court ruling: Appeal
against liquidators' plans upheld in Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International may face
a delay of several more years before receiving any compensation for the
millions they lost when the bank collapsed.
This follows a surprise decision by the Luxembourg courts yesterday
upholding an appeal against plans by the liquidators for an agreement with
Abu Dhabi which could have led to a payout next year.
The decision represented a victory for three individual creditors who have
persistently argued in the English and Luxembourg courts against the
liquidators' agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in the bank. It jeopardises the agreement by which Abu Dhabi
would have contributed more than Dollars 1.7bn to the liquidators for
distribution to creditors, in exchange for a waiver of all legal claims
against it.
Mr Brian Smouha, one of threeliquidators to BCCI appointed by the Luxembourg
courts and the man who negotiated the agreement with Abu Dhabi, warned that
the decision might trigger legal actions and delay payments for as much as
10 years.
'We were disappointed,' said Mr Smouha, a partner with accountants Touche
Ross. 'This has caused there to be no money in the hands of the creditors.
Now they can face only uncertainties.'
Mr Keith Vaz, the opposition Labour MP who has championed the cause of BCCI
creditors, called for the UK government to intervene in bringing about a
settlement. But Downing Street said last night that the government was not a
party to the Luxembourg hearing, and would not be involved in further legal
action. It said compensation was a matter for Touche Ross, the liquidator,
'if they want to take it further'.
Judge Raul Gretsch told the Luxembourg court of appeal yesterday morning:
'The appeal is justified and the liquidators have no right to sign an
agreement.'
The ruling has destroyed the prospect of a ballot by the liquidators of
BCCI's estimated 530,000 worldwide creditors on their plans, which could
have led to a payment of 15p in the pound to creditors next August.
The Luxembourg liquidators are due to meet today to discuss their options in
advance of a meeting of BCCI liquidators around the world on Wednesday and
Thursday next week.
They will consider appealing the judgment, attempting to renegotiate with
Abu Dhabi, or suing it to gain more money. But Mr Julien Roden, one of the
Luxembourg liquidators, yesterday appeared to rule out an appeal. 'The court
has decided. We are court-appointed liquidators and we will follow what the
court has decided - that's my first reaction,' he said.
Mr Adil Elias, one of the three creditors who brought the appeal, said: 'We
had confidence that the Luxembourg courts would listen.'
He said his action was brought on behalf of 1,000 creditors from 24
countries in the Depositors' Protection Association who are owed Dollars
500m. He said they had supported him 'financially and emotionally' during
the case, which had cost 'a few million'.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (12): New focus of
attention - Emerging markets / Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in the world's emerging equity markets has, like the markets
themselves, been booming in recent months.
One of the driving forces behind the rally has been a realisation that
economies in those countries designated as having emerging markets - Latin
America, China, India and many countries on the Pacific Rim - are forecast
to grow faster than the developed world.
Interest has also been aided by the increasing number of emerging market
funds available to investors, as well as by the growth in privatisation
issues from emerging markets and, in some cases, the liberalisation of
controls on direct investment. Mr Lee Chautin, of Baring Securities emerging
markets team, notes that in the past month or so the performance of emerging
markets has been phenomenal.
As a result, record highs have recently been attained in a number of the
markets, including Turkey, Manila and Jakarta.
Among Latin America's emerging markets Brazil has shown the strongest gains
so far this year - according to data compiled by the IFC, the private sector
arm of the World Bank - and equities there have registered a rise of more
than 90 per cent in dollar terms since January 1.
Mr Chautin says that a significant factor behind the rally in the world's
emerging markets has been US investors focusing their attention on this
area.
'We have been seeing US institutional money coming in for the first time,
rather than just specialist funds, with mainstream pension funds beginning
to allocate assets,' he says.
This change of investment attitude is reiterated by Mr Dan Smaller of Lehman
Brothers.
'A lot of US money has been directed into Europe, and from there to the
smaller European markets. There has been good buying in Greece and Portugal,
particularly on falling interest rates'.
The Greek equity market has remained positive in spite of dipping after the
general election was called. The victory by the socialist's, and the
subsequent return to power of Mr Andreas Papandreou, has not altered
investment prospects.
Mr Smaller said that the market still remained one of the cheaper emerging
markets and that the smooth transition of power underlined support for the
market.
While one of the new government's actions was to cancel the planned
privatisation of OTE, the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation, which
had been estimated to raise some Dollars 1.2bn, analysts expect an
alternative privatisation programme to be put in place.
Turkey has had a phenomenal run so far this year with the market having
advanced by more than 140 per cent in dollar terms in the year to September,
according to the latest emerging markets index issued by Baring Securities.
Further gains are forecast for Turkish equities as domestic interest rates
are reduced and the government reins in the budget deficit. The growth in
privatisation issues, including the sale of the government's stake in Tofas,
the car assembly division of Fiat of Italy, will inevitably arouse overseas
interest.
The Tofas sale, which is expected to raise around Dollars 500m, will be the
largest international offering by a Turkish company.
The favourite method for investment in Latin American markets, especially
among US investors, has been, and to a large extent, continues to be through
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which are freely traded on the US stock
exchanges. There are some 34 Latin American companies listed on Wall Street
and Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications group, is due to join
the list this year.
Trading in ADRs by foreign investors can exert a tremendous influence on the
domestic markets: for example, it is estimated that around 50 per cent of
Mexico's daily volume is conducted by foreign investors in New York trading,
particularly in Telmex, the telephone group.
However, Mr Chautin of Baring Securities believes that ADRs do not offer
enough diversification to enable the construction of a proper portfolio. He
comments that while ADRs are a simple way for US institutions to get
involved in emerging markets, there are not enough of them to get a spread
of the market.
On the other hand, says Mr Smaller of Lehman Brothers, ADRs do offer
investors the pick of the best companies, backed up by first-rate research
by analysts. 'Nevertheless, it is true to say that while the investor will
get a good idea of a market, the small gems nestling there may not be dug
out,' he adds.
Direct investment in an emerging market is an alternative, if a much more
risky approach. India has seen some direct investment, comments Mr Peter
Bristowe of HG Asia, but funds remain the most popular method, with a number
of new ones having been launched this year.
The Indian authorities liberalised foreign portfolio investment late last
year; but it was not until this August that foreign money was seen coming
into the equity market in a serious fashion, and triggering a market rally.
Indonesia has also been enjoying a good rally and is completely dominated by
foreign investors, says Mr Bristowe. Investment opportunities here are
relative easy, with few restrictions on the repatriation of capital gains or
dividends. Activity from overseas has also been encouraged by reports that
the government may increase the limit on foreign ownership of listed shares,
at present at 49 per cent.
The satisfactory economic background has provided an incentive while the
relative currency stability has seen interest rates fall from around 23 per
cent to 12 per cent. Inflation has fallen, while less dependence on oil
exports and development of manufacturing exports has provided a strong
backdrop, says Mr Bristowe.
China's fledgling equity markets, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, have excited
enormous interest this year, with foreign capital being directed into China
plays quoted in Hong Kong and other Pacific Rim markets. A large number of
China funds have been launched, with a target of up to Dollars 1bn; but,
comments Mr Bristowe, most of the cash remains locked up with institutions
reluctant as yet to enter the B share markets, particularly given that these
shares are trading at a discount to those available to local investors.
However, most analysts consider that any investment in China must be taken
on a long-term view, forecasting that within five years the country's equity
markets will be the dominant force in the region.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (11): Latin
America's success story - Emerging markets / Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW INTEREST rates have left investors starved of high-yielding investments,
and forced them to look at new ways of enhancing their returns.
With bond yields falling to historically low levels, emerging bond markets
are an attractive option for two reasons: they offer higher margins over
treasuries, because of their weaker credit ratings; but they also offer the
possibility of capital gains, as developing economies advance rapidly and
investor perception evolves.
The great success story of the decade so far has been Latin American bonds.
Yearly issuance in Latin American Eurobonds has risen from just over Dollars
1bn in 1990 to Dollars 8.6bn in 1992 and is already around Dollars 11bn for
the first eight months of 1993.
'On the supply side, the continuing absence of well-developed local capital
markets forced issuers to look abroad for medium- to long-term funds.
On the demand side, yields on long-term bonds of G7 countries were falling
on the order of 100 to 200 basis points a year from 1991, prompting private
and institutional investors to search elsewhere to enhance returns on global
diversified portfolios,' according to Mr Edward Bartholomew, of J P Morgan's
emerging markets research group.
In the wake of the debt crisis in the 1980s, when many Latin American
countries defaulted on their commercial bank loans, the secondary market in
their debt grew as a result of trading by banks, largely creditor banks
trying to lay off or manage their risk.
When Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers returned to the
Eurobond market a few years ago, these high-yielding bonds were initially
bought mainly by retail investors in Europe or by Latin American nationals,
with so-called flight capital outside the region.
But the market's strong performance attracted new investors, first in the
form of specialist country funds and then a broader range of institutional
investors.
The surge of international interest in Latin America helped the market in
secondary debt and the bond market to mature rapidly. The market in
secondary bank loans has now been virtually replaced by a market in Brady
bonds, the restructured bank debt created under the Brady debt reduction
plan. Venezuela, Mexico and Argentina have already implemented their Brady
plans, and Brazil is poised to do so.
A range of government-backed institutions, companies and banks from these
countries are now viewed as acceptable credits and have seen their spreads
tighten.
Mexico has for some time been trading at a 200-250 basis point margin over
US Treasuries in the Eurobond market. The potential for large gains on the
back of credit improvement in the more developed Latin American countries
has therefore been reduced, and the adventurous fund manager is veering off
the beaten track.
'Everyone is looking for the next big opportunity,' said one trader. Smaller
Latin American countries, eastern Europe and Asia are the key areas of
interest.
'The LDC debt market relies on the improvement in economic management,' said
Mr Mark Evans of ING Bank, 'and that process is clearly under way in eastern
Europe.' Trading volume in eastern European debt has surged this year as the
market rallied. Poland's commercial bank debt has been actively traded for a
number of years, but Russia and Bulgaria defaulted on their debt more
recently.
Continental Bank estimates that trading volume in Russian debt will have
grown from around Dollars 800m in 1992 to between Dollars 3bn and Dollars
4bn in 1993, while annual volume in Polish debt is around USDollars 15bn.
The scope of the market's investor base is also growing rapidly. 'The market
has broadened from hedge funds and specialist LDC boutiques to portfolio
managers, and, particularly in the last six months, to investors in North
and Central America,' said Mr Igor Sitnin of Continental Bank.
Investors are also turning their attention to south-east Asian countries,
although spreads in this region are moderate, comparable with the more
developed Latin American markets, as a result of their generally strong
economic growth.
The Philippines returned to the international capital markets early this
year, having completed the restructuring of its commercial bank debt under
the Brady plan last December.
It was followed by a number of Filipino borrowers, including Philippine
Airlines (PAL) and the Philippine National Oil Company.
China also returned to the market this year with a Y30bn Eurobond, its first
since 1987. Other Chinese borrowers, such as Citic, had already tapped the
market. However, China has a relatively strong credit rating and so does not
offer the high yields available in other markets (although many investors
believe that it does offer potentially strong spread performance).
Meanwhile, in the more mature markets, such as Mexico, a broader range of
companies are now able to tap the market.
Those lower down the credit spectrum prepared to pay higher spreads have
become more attractive. For example, Swiss Bank Corporation recently
completed a Dollars 75m five-year issue for Mexico's Axa, a privately-held
cable and power transmission company, which was priced to yield 375 basis
points above the comparable US Treasury.
'Mid-market companies are now able to tap the market,' said Mr Miles
Protter, an SBC director.
The emerging markets are evolving swiftly, and parts of them are already
institutional markets. The Latin American retail investors who helped get
the market going have in many cases moved their money - and their profits -
elsewhere, often to their domestic stock markets.
Meanwhile, banks and fund managers are rushing to create their own
specialist emerging market funds. Many of them will be too late to catch the
first few waves of the rally, but with government bond yields at low levels,
they may now be willing to settle for enhancing yields.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (9): Pace may slow
down - United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE third consecutive year, Wall Street is asking itself: how long can
the good times last? Two years ago, investment banks and securities houses
were enjoying buoyant markets and surging profits, but doubting whether the
momentum could be sustained for another 12 months.
In 1992, business got even better, and again Wall Street was unsure whether
it could last. But it did. Now, two thirds of the way through a
record-breaking 1993, much the same question is back on people's lips. Is
1994 going to be the year when profits come down from the stratosphere?
While no one is predicting that the financial markets or Wall Street's
earnings will fall into a serious slump next year, a slowdown from a
record-breaking pace of growth is expected, if only for the reason that it
is hard to imagine that the pace of earnings growth in the securities
industry can be maintained for another year.
Whatever happens, matching the performance of 1991-1993 will be difficult.
Since 1990, when New York Stock Exchange member firms posted a loss of
Dollars 106m, the industry's after-tax profits have improved in leaps and
bounds. In 1991, profits jumped to Dollars 3.8bn. In 1992, they climbed to
Dollars 4.1bn.
So far this year, many of the biggest US investment banks and securities
houses have announced record quarterly earnings. In the first half of the
year, NYSE member firms profits reached Dollars 3.08bn. Barring a market
crash or a big surge in domestic interest rates in the final months of this
year, industry profits for 1993 should break last year's record comfortably.
Although a variety of factors have fuelled Wall Street's earnings
juggernaut, including heavy demand for securities from individual investors
and strong growth in the asset management business, the key to firms'
successes in the domestic capital markets has been the very low level of US
interest rates.
Nowhere have low interest rates had more of an effect than in proprietary
trading and investment banking. Traditionally, Wall Street firms make a lot
of their profits by borrowing heavily against their securities holdings and
investing or trading that money in the markets. Over the past three years,
low interest rates have made this leveraged business even more profitable
than usual.
By borrowing cheaply on the short-term markets, and using that capital to
speculate on rapid swings in securities, interest rates or currencies, or to
invest in higher-yielding long-term assets, securities houses and
investments have earned billions of dollars in profits. On Wall Street over
the past few years, trading revenues (especially in the fixed-income
markets) have been growing at a faster rate than any other form of revenues.
In 1992, they totalled Dollars 16.3bn, up from Dollars 9.9bn four years
earlier.
The success of proprietary trading has led to one particularly interesting
development - the rise of the trader as manager. Over the past year
executives who made their reputation on the trading floors of Wall Street
have been appointed to key management positions at a number of leading
firms, including Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. In many
cases, the traders have earned promotion at the expense of the investment
bankers and dealmakers, who for more than a decade have ruled the roost on
Wall Street.
This trend has led some observers to claim that the industry is undergoing a
fundamental shift in the balance of its business, away from corporate
finance and advisory work and towards a greater emphasis on proprietary
trading. Yet the changes appear more cyclical than structural in nature.
Trading revenues are strong primarily because interest rates are so low.
Once rates pick up again, trading revenues will probably suffer, and traders
will eventually lose their spot at the top of Wall Street's food chain.
Although traders may be grabbing more of the limelight these days, their
counterparts in investment banking have been no slouches either. Revenues
from stock and bond underwriting have been extremely buoyant over the past
18months. Again, low interest rates are the key. Eager to raise money to
refinance old, expensive debt, to pay for much-needed restructurings, or to
fund expansion, companies have been rushing to the public markets to take
advantage of the lowest borrowing rates in 30 years.
Last year, companies raised a record Dollars 851.7bn through debt and equity
offerings, shattering the previous record, set in 1991, of Dollars 589.6bn.
So far this year, volume has been even heavier, with Dollars 532bn raised in
the first six months. At the end of June, many observers felt that the
market may have peaked because it looked as if interest rates had bottomed.
Since then, however, fresh declines in long-term rates have kept the
momentum going, and could push public securities offerings through the
Dollars 1,000bn barrier this year.
And it is not just US companies that have been issuing record amounts of
debt and equity. Foreign companies have been coming to the US capital
markets in increasing numbers, not just because raising funds in the US has
been so inexpensive, but because US investors, traditionally so reluctant to
invest outside their country, have been buying more foreign stock and bond
issues in their search for big returns.
Low interest rates have also helped boost the equity underwriting business,
because investors, looking for something better than the 3 per cent they get
on short-term assets, have been snapping up new share issues in record
amounts. This, combined with the steady rise in stock prices, has sustained
a long and profitable boom in equity issuance.
As for what happens to the capital markets next year, much hinges on the
movement of interest rates. Analysts have been surprised that interest rates
have fallen so far (the yield on the long bond fell below 6 per cent this
summer for the first time in 16 years, and short-term yields have been
trading at 30-year lows), so they have become wary about predicting where
rates are headed next.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (10): Welcome boost
for companies - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies, facing the need for financing more than ever before
because of the depressed cash flow from falling profits and rising costs,
have welcomed the rise in the Tokyo stock market since August.
Thanks to the ministry of finance propping up the stock market by pumping in
public pension funds, the Nikkei average has recovered 41 per cent from its
six-year low, and companies have piled in to raise funds through
equity-linked issues.
A survey taken by the Nikkei Newsletter on Bond and Money, indicated that
during the first six months of the business year to September, manufacturers
saw a 4.9 per cent fall in cash flow from the previous year, while
non-manufacturers faced a 9.7 per cent decline. A rise in redemption of
equity-linked bonds issued during the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s is
also still squeezing cashflow at companies.
Domestic issuance of convertible bonds rose 2.2 times to Y722bn during the
first six months to June. On the overseas markets, Japanese companies issued
USDollars 7.3bn in warrant bonds, 47 per cent higher than the previous year,
and USDollars 2.2bn in convertible bonds, an 11 per cent decline.
On the overseas markets, companies shifted from the Eurodollar market to the
Swiss market, due to lower costs and an easing in underwriting regulations.
Eurodollar equity-linked issues fell 55.9 per cent during the April-June
quarter to Y153.7bn from the previous quarter, but Swiss franc issues rose
2.1 times to Y244.1bn.
The securities industry is hoping the ministry of finance will lift its ban
on share offerings by listed companies, which has been in place since the
market plunged in 1990, after Tuesday's debut by East Japan Railway.
Meanwhile, corporate financiers point out that more Japanese companies,
facing deteriorating earnings and a stock market which has moved sideways
around the 20,000 level since mid-April, have been forced to turn to the
straight bond market rather than to equity-linked financing.
'You need a volatile market for investors to become interested in
equity-linked investments,' points out Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson in
Tokyo.
According to the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan, Japanese companies
raised a record Y59.5bn during September. Traders say that historically low
interest rates also prompted the sharp increase, but companies face higher
costs by raising capital through domestic corporate bonds rather than
through equity-linked paper overseas.
A growing awareness within the ministry of finance of the need for optional
fund-raising measures amid the sluggish stock market and increasing
reluctance among banks to lend, have prompted the gradual liberalisation of
the domestic bond market. Last April, the ministry eased restrictions on
companies eligible to finance on the corporate bond market.
The emergency economic package announced last month also included the
introduction of new products, such as bonds with shorter maturities and
floating rate notes.
However, the lack of a liquid secondary market, due to the 'buy and hold'
strategy of most Japanese institutional investors, where once a bond is
bought it is kept until maturity, has been a barrier to fully-fledged growth
of the bond market.
Foreign issuers are also concerned that the credit ratings are not properly
reflected on bond prices. The lack of price differentiation between issuers
with high credit ratings and low credit ratings is prompting an increasing
number of overseas issuers with triple-A credit ratings to move away from
the samurai market.
Mr Mikio Fujii at Nomura Securities' fixed income department, laments:
'Japan's Samurai market is turning into a junk bond market because issuers
with low credit ratings can issue at relatively cheap cost.'
Market participants point out that several factors are preventing the
domestic bond market from becoming more sophisticated. One reason is that
many Japanese fund managers still do not evaluate options according to
investment returns, making them oblivious of credit risk and pricing of the
bonds. Financing costs are higher due to the trustee fees paid to banks,
which act as guarantors in the case of a bankruptcy. The lack of a central
clearing system for corporate bonds and the complicated registration
procedure for transferring bonds from one investor to another, are also
hampering growth of the secondary market.
The ministry of finance and brokers have finally started to work on solving
some of the structural problems. The ministry has called on a group of
academics and members of the financial industry to study reforms for the
secondary market.
Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, says
that attitudes of Japanese institutional investors towards credit risk, are
gradually changing.
Mr Masaru Kakutani, representative director of Moody's Japan, says investors
are becoming more aware of credit risks at companies. This is because banks
have become more reluctant to take on risks as trustees, and deregulation
has allowed less creditworthy companies to raise funds.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): Flexible friend
for lenders - Securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKS and companies have been reaping the benefits of securitisation for
years, but their European counterparts are much more recent converts to this
flexible form of balance sheet management.
Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks or companies to take
loans off their balance sheets, thereby removing the risk of default and
freeing capital which can be used to make new loans.
'The main objective of securitisation is to achieve capital efficiency and
to maximise returns on shareholders' funds,' says Mr Guy Fletcher, director
of BZW Asset Securitisation Group, part of Barclays Bank.
In October, Barclays became the first UK bank to securitise personal loans
when it raised Pounds 280m through an issue of floating rate notes backed by
loans made to the bank's credit card customers.
Securitisation works in this way: the originator of the loans (that is, the
bank or company) places the loans in a special-purpose vehicle which then
raises money by selling debt securities, backed by these assets, to
investors. Interest payments on the so-called mortgage-backed or
asset-backed securities are funded as the borrowers make repayments on their
loans.
Most of the loans which are securitised tend to be residential mortgages or
consumer loans from banks, credit card companies, car manufacturers or
leasing companies.
Securitisation of commercial property loans is also increasing in the US,
reflecting an unwillingness among banks to expose themselves too heavily to
the commercial property developers after the property crash of the late
1980s.
Although the banks or companies do not rid themselves entirely of the risk
of default, their exposure is reduced considerably. Securitisation experts
say they sometimes end up being responsible for the first losses on as
little as 1 per cent of the total volume of securitised loans.
Securitisation is firmly established in the US, where about half of the
Dollars 2,500bn worth of residential mortgages are estimated to have been
securitised. In addition, asset-backed securities make up about Dollars 75bn
of the Dollars 600bn corporate commercial paper market in the US.
Current volume of securities backed by commercial property loans in the US
is around Dollars 12bn but this market is expected to grow rapidly in the
next three years when Dollars 300bn worth of commercial property loans will
need to be re-financed.
By comparison, securitisation in Europe is still at an early stage. Most of
Europe's securitised deals have originated in the UK though there has been
activity in Spain, France and Scandinavia.
In the UK, the most active issuers in the mortgage-backed market have been
centralised mortgage lenders looking for funding to match the long maturity
of their portfolios.
Securitised deals were launched in the Eurobond market in 1985. Volume rose
rapidly from Dollars 200m that year to Dollars 12.8bn in 1990 but then
nearly halved to Dollars 7.2bn in 1992 as the economic recession and high
interest rates in the UK cut demand for new loans. However, there has been a
revival this year (Dollars 5.5bn has been raised) as lenders seek to expand
their business without having to raise fresh capital.
Mr Malcolm Veale, head of asset securitisation of National Westminster Bank,
the UK's high street bank which raised Pounds 300m from its first
mortgage-backed issue in September, gives several reasons why securitisation
has been slow to get off the ground in Europe.
First, European companies have not the same access to information technology
(IT) as their US counterparts to enable them to build up data on the
performance of their loans or leases.
International credit-rating agencies are only willing to give a rating to a
mortgage-backed or asset-backed issue if they have several years' worth of
data on the assets backing the securities.
Mr Veale says that European companies are becoming more conscious of the
importance of ratings and have started to compile the necessary information
on their loans. However, they are still several years away from being able
to securitise these assets.
He also notes that the actual volumes of credit card receivables which could
be securitised in Europe are not as vast as in the US. For example, credit
cards have taken off in Germany only in the past few years.
The lack of a domestic market means that any European company or bank
wanting to securitise assets would have to tap the market in the US or the
UK. But the cost of hedging their currency positions could make the
transaction uneconomic.
Another drawback to the growth of securitisation in Europe is the lack of
regulation on off-balance-sheet financing. In many countries in Europe,
virtually no guidelines have been laid down.
In the UK, the Accounting Standards Board's financial reporting exposure
draft on off-balance-sheet financing is expected to become an accounting
standard by the end of the year.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): Nightmare for
harmonisers - Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international capital markets are a regulator's nightmare:
responsibility is split not only between different geographical
jurisdictions, but also between banks and securities houses.
However, the spread of EC-wide regulation is forcing greater standardisation
of Europe's financial markets.
'Regulators are not targeting the Euromarkets but are targeting certain
activities,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Wellens, chairman of the International
Primary Market Association. 'EC regulators are trying to set a standard for
financial transactions in the EC, and international regulators like the Bank
for International Settlements also impact on the market.'
Recently, the European Community's directives on Capital Adequacy (CAD) and
Investment Services (ISD) - the cornerstones of EC law on the investment
markets - have been the centre of attention. The revised regulatory
framework is seen as opening the prospect of a single capital market
throughout the EC, providing financial institutions with a single EC
passport to exploit opportunities.
The ISD is designed to harmonise regulation of financial services across
Europe, and the CAD is designed to provide a common basis for determining
the capital banks have to put aside to support certain activities; the goal
is a level playing field. Both directives have been adopted and member
states need to translate them into local law, by January 1, 1996.
Unfortunately, the revised framework is also seen as possibly putting
EC-based banks and securities houses at a disadvantage with non-EC
competitors who do not have to adhere to international standards; the
pressure for the level playing field is less in the US and Japan than in
Europe.
The debate might be over but that does not mean an end to uncertainty and
anxiety. The focus has shifted from the contents of the two directives to
the possibility of misinterpretation, deliberate or otherwise, by member
states clinging to cherished protectionist ways. The main concerns of the
International Primary Market Association (IPMA) are that artificial and
inappropriate obstacles could be erected that would reduce the
cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the 'immensely successful' markets. It
is vital, it says, that institutions are not artificially put at a cost
disadvantage to competitors in other markets. On the other hand, the
increasing scale of government borrowing means it is obviously in the
interests of European governments to be able to raise funds locally on
competitive terms.
Success in winning mandates from outside the European time zone also makes
the markets an important source of foreign earnings for Europe. 'European
regulators understand that this is a market which lives by competition, and
that it is of vital strategic importance to the European economy,' says Mr
Dirk Hazell, secretary-general of IPMA.
Other concerns are that regulators will be unable to resist the temptation
to impose regulations over and above the CAD/ISD requirements. 'Regulators'
objectives, one of which must be to permit the markets to work efficiently,
are more likely to be achieved if regulators work with the grain of the
market and having consulted leading practitioners, than if rules are
suddenly imposed from an ivory tower; in this case their practical
application may well prove uncertain,' says Mr Hazell.
Deliberate misinterpretation is thought unlikely, if politicians have
learned anything, that is, from the ERM experience. 'Market forces cannot be
resisted indefinitely,' says Mr John Langton, chief executive of the
International Secondary Market Association (ISMA). 'Markets smell
unsustainable financial policies pretty quickly.'
Mr Christopher Cruickshank, principal administrator at the European
Commission's DGXV, the directorate-general responsible for internal market
and financial services, puts less emphasis on the possibility of
misinterpretation. 'We would like to organise continuing discussions aimed
at ensuring harmonised implementation,' he says. National supervisors, for
their part, will be watching each other like hawks.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (4): Bookbuilding
reduces the guesswork - International Equity Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT bankers are tackling Europe's forthcoming privatisations with the
precision of a military campaign to get the best possible price for the
state assets and to ensure a good reception with investors.
The weapon which is increasingly being used to strike the right balance
between these two objectives is a process called 'bookbuilding', which, like
most financial techniques, has been adopted from the United States.
Broadly speaking, bookbuilding involves collecting investors' bids for the
shares thus helping to establish the most appropriate selling price.
By matching the demand for and the supply of the shares on offer, bankers
hope to avoid excessive volatility in the shares when they start trading in
the secondary market.
'Bookbuilding is the best way to set the price of an offering with the
complete knowledge of what investors are prepared to pay, rather than just
guessing,' says one investment banker who has been involved in recent
issues.
Another benefit of bookbuilding is that it meets a growing demand among
companies to know who their shareholders are. 'Many companies are now
seeking long-term investors of a high quality,' says one banker.
Bookbuilding provides this so-called 'investor transparency' because banks
participating in an equity offering using this structure need to disclose
the identity of their clients to the global co-ordinator to be allocated the
shares.
Apart from reducing errors such as multiple applications or inflated orders,
bookbuilding enables the global co-ordinator to sell the shares directly to
the investors rather than to traders or speculators.
This framework has been used for decades in the US and is gaining in
popularity with issuers of equity in Europe. The use of bookbuilding in the
well-publicised sales of Wellcome Trust's stake in Wellcome plc, the
pharmaceuticals company, and the British government's remaining stake in
British Telecommunications (BT3) has served to raise its profile in the UK.
The Spanish government chose the bookbuilding process this year when it sold
off its stake in Repsol. The French and Italian governments are also said to
be in favour of this framework for their forthcoming privatisation
programmes.
The French government had its first experience of bookbuilding in February
when it partially privatised Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group.
However, the politics of privatisation can often conflict with the
bookbuilding process's aim of achieving the best possible price for the
shares on offer. In the past, governments have tended to underprice the
sales of state-owned companies to win favour with the public and guarantee
success.
For example, the Spanish government gave domestic retail investors
preferential treatment in the partial privatisation of Argentaria, the
banking corporation. The offering was oversubscribed and the shares rose 11
per cent on their first day of trading on the Madrid Stock Exchange.
By contrast, the Spanish government was not so generous in its sale of a
further tranche in Repsol since that offering was aimed at international
investors.
By using the bookbuilding process, which reportedly indicated demand for
nearly double the amount of shares on offer, Repsol was able to waive a
discount on the new shares and set a current market price for them.
Consequently, the shares rose by only a small amount when they started
trading in the secondary market.
Recent international equity offerings in Europe have also used another US
technique called the 'green shoe', which, according to market lore, took its
name from the first US company to use it back in the 1930s.
This mechanism allows the bank arranging the deal to increase or reduce the
size of the offering retrospectively to stabilise the price of the shares in
the days following the placement.
This is achieved by allocating a proportion of shares - the green shoe  - in
addition to the main offering which the bank can buy back, on behalf of the
issuer, if the shares fall in the days after the placing. The green shoe can
often represent between 10 and 15 per cent of the whole deal.
Issuers are known to put considerable pressure on the bank leading the
offering to exercise the green shoe - that is, allocate the extra shares -
so that they get the full amount from the deal.
Bankers say that while the benefits of bookbuilding and the green shoe have
been recognised in Europe, many companies will not be able to use them when
they raise equity finance because of the existence of pre-emption rights in
many European countries.
As a result, the use of these methods is likely to be confined to
privatisations, initial public offerings and the sale of one shareholder's
stake in another company.
Shareholders jealously guard their pre-emption rights, which oblige
companies wanting to issue new shares to raise cash to offer these new
shares first to the existing shareholders at a discount to the market price.
In Germany, fewer companies are able to raise cash through bonds which are
convertible into shares because of growing shareholder opposition to what
they see as an infringement of their pre-emption rights.
Some bankers say that pre-emption rights increase the cost of equity finance
because the new shares will virtually always be offered at a discount to the
current market price. The company performing the rights issue also has to
pay for underwriting and sub-underwriting fees, which some bankers say would
not be needed to the same extent if bookbuilding were used instead.
The past year has also seen a wider use of the 'bought deal' for disposing
of large chunks of shares in one transaction rather than selling them
piecemeal into the stock market.
This technique, which has been in use for many years in various forms,
involves a company selling its equity stake in another company to a bank
which then places the shares with its clients. Bankers say this method is
effective if it entails placing no more than 20 per cent of a company.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (5): Market regains
momentum - Banks have created more sophisticated forms of swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURMOIL within the European exchange rate mechanism has been good news for
financial markets throughout the world. It has been especially beneficial to
derivatives markets which allow investors to shift large amounts of money
easily. The increased volatility, particularly in the currency markets, has
encouraged greater use of swaps and options for hedging exposure.
In addition, banks are creating ever more sophisticated types of swaps. The
most commonly used swaps are currency swaps and interest rate swaps, which
consist of an exchange of liabilities between two counterparties.
Just over a year ago, when the UK and Italy suspended their currencies from
the European Monetary System and slashed rates to regenerate their
economies, investors and speculators were already looking at the next weak
links in the chain. Interest rates in Europe were far higher than in the US
but a Europe-wide recession meant that rates in most countries had to come
down thus weakening the currency. In the past 12 months, US hedge funds - of
which Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund is best known - have been the most
active sellers of devaluation-prone currencies, such as sterling, the peseta
and the punt. One motive behind hedge fund activity has been to prompt
devaluation of a currency and then buy it back at the cheaper rate.
Devaluations are not everyday events, however, and more significant is the
interplay between nominal interest rates, reflected by government bond
prices and foreign exchange values.
This is where swaps come in. For example, a German company might be able to
raise funds easily in D-Marks at a floating rate linked to Fibor, the
Frankfurt Interbank Offered Rate, but it can get money at a much lower rate
in dollars. Meanwhile, US investors are convinced that German rates are
coming down and US rates are likely to rise. If interest rates are 9 per
cent in Germany and 3 per cent in the US the spread is six percentage
points. Three years out the consensus might be that the spread will narrow
to two points. The US side offers to take on the German loan over three
years at the cost of the two-point spread. If the spread narrows to nothing
the US investor will pocket the two-point spread. If the spread widens the
German borrower will have saved.
The value is in the spread and the value to the investor who arranges the
deal is the disparity of views on what that spread will be. In earlier
years, companies could issue fixed-rate bonds and swap the proceeds into
floating-rate funds at a level below interbank offered rates. However,
increasing participation by sophisticated institutional investors led to a
narrowing of swap spreads. In addition, the growing sophistication of swap
dealers meant that opportunities were swiftly arbitraged.
Nevertheless, the changes in Europe have sent volumes up by almost 20 per
cent according to the most recent data. A survey by Arthur Andersen for the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) found that the
notional principal value of foreign currency and interest rate swaps
outstanding at the end of 1992 reached Dollars 4,600bn, an increase of 19
per cent over the previous year. Most of that rise was in the second half of
last year and dealers say the trend has continued.
Shifts in the ERM have led to increased volatility which has prompted more
sophisticated forms of swaps. In classic marketing tradition, the
redefinition of a product from commodity to specialised gives it a new lease
of life.
In the case of swaps, an investor taking a view that French interest rates
are about to fall will buy French bonds because bond prices will rise.
However, the bonds will have to be bought in French francs and if bond
prices gain that will reflect a weaker economy which will in turn result in
a weaker currency. What is gained in the bond market could be lost on the
currency.
Many investors would hedge their currency risks separately but some banks
are offering correlation hedging which removes the currency risk. This
applies not only to straightforward interest rate swaps but also to equity
swaps. Chase Manhattan suggests the example of a UK pension fund which has
seen the FT-SE 100 Index reach an historic high while the French CAC-40
index continues to languish around 2,100, creating a spread of 900 points.
If a UK investor believes the spread should be around 600 points he can sell
a one-year Footsie contract and buy a one year CAC contract plus a 900-point
spread. If the 'correlation' is zero after a year the profit will be 900
points. The French contract would normally be paid for in francs thus giving
the UK investor an exposure to the French franc. However, with a correlated
hedge the CAC contract could be paid for in the client's home currency. This
would remove the implicit foreign exchange exposure.
Such is the sophistication that Chase says brokers are trying to trade the
correlation or spread on a separate index. Implicit in the contract price is
an estimation of some correlation level and if issuers are seen to have that
wrong there is an arbitrage possibility. Second, there is a need for book
balancing between banks involved principally with issuers and those which
are skewed towards investment.
Growing sophistication increases the appeal for dealers and issuers and
offers greater variety for corporate borrowers who need to adjust their
debts. But for some institutions it is perhaps a disadvantage. Many pension
funds are already constrained from making derivative-based deals unless they
can provide underlying stock.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): Signs of a
healthy revival - Syndicated Loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE signs of a healthy revival in the syndicated loans market after
several years in the doldrums, as borrowers take advantage of a renewed
willingness among banks to start lending once more.
Activity in this area of the international capital market slowed in the late
1980s as banks shied away from making new loans while they were still
preoccupied with the financial difficulties besetting some of their
borrowers.
However, now that the banks have resolved these credit issues, they are
looking to rebuild their loan books with high-quality assets.
The most active lenders in recent months have been Anglo-Saxon banks which
are responding to an increased demand for credit as the US and UK economies
come out of recession. Some Japanese banks are also seen to be seeking to
participate in international loans to compensate for a poor climate for
lending at home.
Banks have been queueing up to participate in loans to good-quality names.
As a result, some loans which have been syndicated in recent months have
been substantially oversubscribed.
For instance, a three-year credit facility arranged for Spain in July was
over-subscribed by Ecu2bn (Dollars 1.8bn). As a result, the borrower was
able to increase its facility to Ecu5bn from an original Ecu4bn and the
additional Ecu1bn was used to reduce the commitments of other banks involved
in the loan.
The high interest in the deal meant that Spain was able to get very
favourable terms for its multi-currency, revolving facility. It will be
paying a margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor) in addition to an annual facility fee of 5 basis points.
The loan arranged for Spain was the largest financing to be put together by
a European government this year.
They note that the syndicated loans market is now attracting a much wider
range of borrowers than 10 years ago, from sovereigns and corporates to
local authorities and even housing associations.
There are several reasons why many borrowers prefer to raise funds in the
syndicated loans market than in the bond market or in the stock market.
Bankers say the syndicated loans market can provide very large loans very
quickly and the loan can be as flexible as possible to suit the borrower.
Furthermore, the syndicated loans market practically guarantees
confidentiality to the borrower, an important factor if a company is seeking
to raise financing for an acquisition or a merger.
The present climate of low interest rates and the banks' much more positive
stance towards lending are working to the advantage of the borrowers. Many
are enjoying a substantial reduction in the margin they have to pay over
Libor. For instance, bankers say blue-chip corporate borrowers can expect to
pay a margin of around 35 basis points over Libor for a straightforward
five-year loan, compared with 50 basis points two years ago.
So far this downward spiral in pricing has applied only to borrowers with a
good or improving credit rating. It remains a struggle to interest banks in
loans to borrowers they perceive to be too risky.
For example, banks are still reluctant to lend to many Italian borrowers,
since their memories of the Efim debacle are still fresh.
When Efim, the Italian state industrial holding group, went into liquidation
in July 1992, it owed Italian and foreign banks L9,500bn (Dollars 6.3bn).
Initially, the treasury had proposed to repay the Efim loans by using bonds
with below-market interest rates. This idea was fiercely resisted by the
banks and the treasury backed down and agreed to repayment in full.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (3): Winning streak
continues - Government bonds have enjoyed a phenomenal run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a phenomenal 18-month run, the rally in global government bonds has
already exeeded most observers' expectations.
But the end of the bull run is proving very difficult to call. Institutional
investors are scared that if they take profits now they could miss a further
leg of the rally - as happened to some US Treasury investors during the
summer - and have to buy back in at a more expensive level.
Company treasurers are also getting twitchy. They want to raise long-term
debt at the lowest possible interest rates, but every time they feel ready
to lock in fixed-rate funding, long-term bond yields fall further.
And, as with Las Vegas gamblers on an unprecedented winning streak, each
favourable turn of the roulette wheel increases the tension for the next
time. Now the questions are: where and when is the rally finally going to
end?
The first question breaks up into four possible areas: the UK, the European
high-yielding countries, the mainstream EC markets and the US. And it
prompts the subsidiary question of why the winning streak is going to end,
ie which investment power, Japan the US or Europe, is going to pull the
plug?
These questions have prompted fevered debate in the UK where nominal
long-term interest rates, reflected by 15-year government bonds, have fallen
from 8.4 per cent in June to just over 7 per cent last week, the lowest
level since the sixties. For the past few months many UK fund managers
steeped in the tradition of boom-bust economics have believed that it cannot
continue and while they have not gone so far as to take their money out of
the gilts market they have not been putting any more in. The rise in prices
and subsequent fall in yields has been led by overseas investors. They have
looked at the fundamental economic position rather than the historical
perspective and are more prepared than their UK counterparts to believe in a
sustained period of slow growth and flat inflation.
In fact, some economists believe the UK's traditional enthusiasm for
inflating itself out of trouble may have changed at a fundamental level. Mr
Simon Briscoe, economist with SG Warburg Securities, argues that 'a low
inflation psychology is developing in the UK'. Also, the trend towards
mortgages at rates fixed for several years will make it harder to tinker
with the economy via short-term interest rates and more dependent on low
interest long-term borrowing.
Amazement surrounding the UK market is almost matched by the surprise at the
performance of the southern European countries generally referred to as the
high yielders - Spain, Italy and Portugal. These three countries,
traditionally dogged by rocketing inflation, have seen 10-year rates plunge
since last autumn. Spain's benchmark yield, the standard by which other
forms of public and corporate borrowing are set, has tumbled from above 14
per cent last October to below 8.5 per cent recently. The return on
equivalent Italian bond yields which take into consideration a 12.5 per cent
tax charge for overseas residents has slipped to around 8.8 per cent from
14.7 per cent in October. In Portugal, short-term rates fell by 6.75 points
to 10.25 per cent between May and July.
These high-yielding markets have been heavily supported because they have so
much further to fall than their more stolid European neighbours. France and
Germany, which form the hard core of the exchange rate mechanism, have also
fallen significantly. At the moment they are in limbo as Germany struggles
to maintain high rates to combat the inflationary by-product of its
unification programme and France refuses to cut rates because it is
determined to attach itself to its neighbour's monetary coat tails.
But just when European investors began to wonder if there were more exciting
opportunities elsewhere, Japanese buyers moved in, determined to make the
most of a very expensive yen. Also, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank
which recently advised its clients to shift equity holdings from the UK to
mainland Europe, says continental bond markets remain popular. 'We are
positive on all the major European markets and US investors are still
pouring in money,' says one Goldmans trader.
The US interest is a reflection of the astounding performance of the US
Treasury market. At the beginning of September the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond had fallen below 6 per cent, the lowest return in its 16-year
life. At the same time, several brokerage houses were warning that the
market was close to overheating, arguing that investors had underestimated
the strength of the economy.
It may be one of the classic cliches that when things happen they happen
first in the US, but that could be the case with the end of the global rally
in government bonds. When the economy picks up inflation will turn round and
send yields bouncing upwards.
As to timing it largely depends whether investors start to panic and the
signs are that most US institutional fund mangers are sanguine to the point
of being phlegmatic. Economists are also divided in spite of the historic
lows achieved by 30-year US bonds.
Yamaichi, the Japanese bank, believes the US outlook is improving and
long-term debt prices are out of touch with the inflationary pressure that
any pick-up will impose. On the other hand Goldman Sachs say growth remains
low, inflation is being skewed by high prices in some commodities and bond
yields should 'continue to drift lower as time passes'. Its US rival,
Salomon Brothers, also believes that the prospect of a US rate rise has
receded and advises its clients to remain overweight in US Treasuries.
Perhaps the best that can be said is that when the spectre of inflation
returns it is more likely to be roaming the streets of Manhattan than the
boulevards of Paris.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Record surge in
new issues - International Bond Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE downward spiral in interest rates this year has helped to boost the
volume of new issues in the international bond markets above the record
level reached in 1992, and the upward trend is showing no signs of running
out of steam.
New volume stood at Dollars 301.25bn at the end of September, easily
surpassing 1992's record total of Dollars 267.7bn, according to data from
IFR Securities Data.
The fall in interest rates has had a dual effect on the international bond
markets, encouraging both borrowers and investors to participate actively.
On the one hand, the lower interest rates have encouraged borrowers to lock
in long-term financing at what many of them regard to be the bottom of the
interest rate cycle. On the other, the erosion of returns on cash deposits
has prompted investors to seek higher yields by investing in the bond
market.
Politics has also played its part in the surge of new issues. Several bouts
of turmoil in the financial markets in 1992 and this year, due to
uncertainty over the future of the European exchange rate mechanism, have
forced some central banks in Europe and the Nordic region to intervene
heavily to restore stability to their respective currencies.
As a result, they have had to replenish their depleted foreign exchange
reserves by borrowing in the international bond markets where they can raise
large amounts very quickly.
The Nordic countries have also had to increase their funding requirements to
finance their yawning budget deficits. Their heavy borrowing programmes
placed corporate borrowers from those countries at a severe disadvantage
earlier in the year because they were forced to pay significant premiums
over the spreads paid by sovereign issuers.
However, now that a large part of the sovereign borrowing programmes has
been completed, the spreads - that is, the premium over the yield on
government bonds - paid by Nordic corporate borrowers have come down
sharply.
Corporate yield spreads have also tightened because demand for long-dated,
non-government paper has far outstripped supply, particularly in the
Eurosterling sector. According to SG Warburg Securities corporate unsecured
index, the spread over UK government bonds for maturities of 10 years or
more has fallen from 153 basis points at the end of 1992 to around 95 basis
points.
Long-dated paper is in demand because investors are having to look further
along the yield curve to secure high yields, since they are no longer
available at the short end. In the dollar sector, where yields have fallen
to a 25-year low, supply of long-dated paper has fallen dramatically due to
tha decision by the US Treasury to auction fewer 30-year bonds.
In view of this demand, Italy gave a greater weighting to the 30-year than
to the 10-year tranche of its first global bond offering, which was launched
in September.
Italy's global offering, which raised Dollars 5.5bn, set a record for this
type of international bond deal, which permits issuers to tap the large US
domestic bond market. The previous record of Dollars 3bn was held by the
province of Ontario.
The World Bank, which pioneered the global bond concept, has also been an
active issuer of global bonds this year. In September, it issued its ninth
dollar global bond offering which was priced to yield 10 basis points over
the yield on underlying US Treasuries, the tightest spread the World Bank
has achieved on its 10-year dollar global bonds.
This partly reflected the general tightening of spreads in the market as
well as the fact that the offering was significantly over-subscribed.
However, the tight spread and the balanced distribution worldwide also show
that the World Bank has achieved the main aims of its global bond programme
which was launched four years ago. They were to achieve a truly global
distribution and a single world price for its bonds.
The World Bank has also issued global bonds in yen and expects to launch its
first D-Mark global bond in the fourth quarter of this year.
This year has also seen a large increase in the issuance of floating rate
notes (FRNs) as issuers tap demand from investors for high-yielding
instruments at a time of falling interest rates.
According to IFR Securities Data, Dollars 45bn worth of floating rate notes
were issued from January to mid-September, compared with Dollars 38bn for
the whole of 1992.
Most floating rate notes offer investors a way to achieve a higher income
than they would receive from a fixed-rate bond because the notes tend to pay
a premium over the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
This year has also seen variations on the floating rate note. One
instrument, the 'collared' FRN, has a minimum interest rate and a maximum
interest rate. Under this structure, the holder receives a higher return
than current money market rates but will not benefit if rates rise above the
maximum interest rate set by the issuer.
The 'reverse' FRN pays a higher return as interest rates fall. This is
achieved by fixing the coupon at a certain interest rate minus Libor,
therefore when Libor falls the coupon gets bigger.
The activity in the international bond market has overshadowed efforts by
individual countries to encourage more foreign borrowers to issue in their
domestic markets. However, this process is continuing, principally in Spain
and Japan.
For example, the European Investment Bank recently gave a significant boost
to the Matador market, Spain's domestic bond market for foreign borrowers,
by launching a Pta40bn (Dollars 315m), three-year offering, the largest
Matador to date.
In the Far East, the Asian Development Bank has pioneered efforts to
establish the 'dragon' bond market, in a bid to develop the capital markets
in Asia and stimulate participation by the region's investment community.
The ADB has launched two US-dollar dragon bonds since 1991 and earlier this
year General Electric became the first corporate borrower to tap the market,
which is targeted at non-Japanese investors in Asia.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): The good times
roll on - The economic slowdown has helped create favourable conditions for
international capital markets by encouraging governments to lower interest
rates. But the main worry is what will happen when the market turns round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FINANCIAL institutions active in the international capital markets have
never had it so good. The fixed income businesses of many banks and
securities houses reported record first-half profits, and are on course to
post record gains for the full year.
The bull run in the world's bond markets has persisted beyond everyone's
expectations and financial markets have remained sufficiently volatile,
thanks in large part to continued machinations over the exchange rate
mechanism, to fuel derivatives business.
The economic slowdown has helped create favourable market conditions by
encouraging governments to lower interest rates. At the same time,
governments have needed to borrow more money to bridge their widening
deficits, ensuring lucrative underwriting business for financial
institutions. Underwriting revenues have also been boosted by a spate of
refinancings by companies keen to lock in the lower interest rates that have
become available.
As a result, in the US and Eurobond markets, new issue volume in the first
nine months of the year has already exceeded last year's total. In the
Eurobond market, more than Dollars 300bn of debt was issued in the first
nine months of the year, compared with Dollars 269bn last year, according to
IFR Securities Data. (These figures include an increasing number of global
bond offerings.) In the US corporate bond market, the nine-month total is
Dollars 330bn, compared with Dollars 302bn last year.
It would be hard to paint a rosier picture for investment bankers. But there
is one worry: what happens when the market turns round? The industry is
notoriously cyclical, and there are fears that on the other side of the coin
is a particularly prolonged bear market. As a result, there have been
efforts by the firms involved in the market to build up more consistent
revenue-earners such as asset management.
Still, there could be difficult times ahead. The capital markets are already
highly competitive. The new opportunities offered by the growth of
derivative markets requires substantial investment in technology and
manpower. The business requires a strong capital base at a time when capital
is in short supply.
A turnaround in the bull market could cause a shake-out of smaller players,
which have been sustained by easy trading profits during the good times. As
is the case with a growing number of industries, it is increasingly
necessary to have a global strategy to compete at the top level in the
1990s. A chasm is opening up between banks and securities houses with a
global reach and those which are effectively niche players, based in their
own domestic market, even though they may have operations overseas, or with
a single area of specialisation.
In the international capital markets, the large US houses have become
increasingly dominant. At the heart of their success has been their ability
to keep up with the rapid pace of development. The Japanese have lost ground
since the 1980s, distracted by problems in their domestic market. The
weakness of the Japanese stock market also undermined their profitable
business in Japanese equity-linked bonds, which had provided the securities
houses with a base from which to launch other businesses.
Among European houses, the big three Swiss banks have shown themselves to be
among the most internationally minded participants, and a few other European
powerhouses, such as Deutsche Bank, have also made a strong showing in the
Eurobond market. But European financial institutions have had little success
in the highly competitive US market, and a relatively small number have made
inroads into the Japanese market.
The need for a strong derivatives capacity to establish a leading position
in the international capital markets is becoming widely recognised as the
most important trend of the decade. In stock and bond markets, prices are
frequently driven by futures trading rather than by dealing in the cash
market. If financial institutions are to make markets and trade effectively
on their own accounts, they must have command of the futures markets.
Most have already reached this level of sophistication, as futures exchanges
have been on the scene, and growing in importance, for the past 20 years. A
more difficult market to enter is the highly complex and innovative
over-the-counter market in swaps and options. These products now represent a
vital service to clients, and can be highly profitable.
However, they not only require a high degree of expertise in design and
execution, they also create new risk management problems for the financial
institution concerned. The rapid growth of the market in the past five years
 -the notional amount outstanding in the market has reached Dollars 4,600bn,
according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association - has
created concern among regulators about the potential for systemic risk to
the banking system.
The more immediate worry for some financial institutions is that they may
have left it rather late to enter the market. These days it is hard to find
any financial institution with international ambitions which does not claim
to have embraced derivatives. Yet, in practice the market is dominated by
relatively few participants.
In the battle to reach the top tier, banks and securities houses rated less
than double-A are at a competitive disadvantage, since some counterparties
refuse to deal with them. In an effort to regain this ground, several
institutions, led by Merrill Lynch, have set up separately capitalised
derivatives units, with double-A or triple-A ratings. The most recent
addition to the field is Goldman Sachs, which set up a joint venture with
Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance earlier this month. 'The world may be
moving so that we need this to stay competitive,' said Mr Jacob Goldfield, a
Goldman partner and president of the joint venture. More financial
institutions are expected to follow suit, though some have decided to focus
on improving their own credit ratings instead.
While the steady decline in interest rates worldwide has favoured companies
and financial intermediaries, it has left investors hungry for yield, and
has created a strong impetus for investors to diversify their asset base. In
particular, US investment institutions, which have tended in the past to
concentrate on the wide range of domestic instruments available, have become
much more adventurous. According to research by management consultants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, large US institutional investors have increased their
appetite for non-dollar products by a factor of three in the past five
years.
The appetite for yield has created strong demand for emerging market debt, a
category which covers the domestic bond markets of emerging countries and
bond offerings by borrowers from these countries in the Eurobond or other
foreign bond markets, such as the Yankee bond market. Such borrowers
generally pay a high premium, and also offer investors the possibility of
capital gains, since these borrowers are often perceived as improving
credits, so that spreads tighten, or yields fall, over time.
A similar phenomenon has occurred in the stock markets. While economic
growth in OECD countries has been sluggish, economic expansion has been
maintained in the emerging markets, which consequently offer potentially
higher gains. Again, there has been a surge of investment in domestic stock
markets and in offerings by emerging market companies in the international
market.
One area of keen interest is the developing economies of Asia, where stock
markets in Thailand and Hong Kong have been the star performers this year.
The strong economic growth in the region has also led to a rapid increase in
the amount of funds under management in the region, as well as in the need
for financing among expanding companies.
This has led to the creation of the Dragon bond market, or regional Asian
bond market, to provide a local capital market for Asian borrowers and
investors. Although it is not yet clear whether the concept will take off,
many international banks and securities houses have already built up their
trading and sales forces in Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree in Singapore.
Some have transferred certain activities from Tokyo, which remains a very
expensive business centre, to Hong Kong. Even if Asia does not become a
'fourth time zone', its financial markets are set to become increasingly
important in the next few years, particularly given the expected opening of
China to foreign investment.
While a turnaround in the bull run for bond markets could prove a setback,
there are a number of areas of expansion which will help fill the void. As
well as the continuing growth of the derivatives market and the emerging
markets, a turnaround in the bond market prompted by stronger economic
growth could also spell good news for equity markets.

FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in Burmah Castrol expanded as the recent BZW auction of shares from
the scrip dividend filtered through the market. The stock also benefited
from a buy note from Hoare Govett which stressed improved quality of
earnings on the stock and dividend progression. The price put on 3 at 775p
in turnover of 1.9m.
Another auction of scrip dividend stock was announced - by SG Warburg and
James Capel - on Enterprise Oil. The brokers are to sell shares valued at
Pounds 25m. The stock eased 4 to 472p.
Strong turnover in Premier Consolidated Oilfields was one of the features of
the sector, with the stock continuing its recent run of attracting investor
interest. Volume was a hefty 6.4m but the price lost a penny to 26 1/2 p.
The two camps of investor interest in Lasmo reinforced the two-way pull in
the stock after the previous day's announcement that the company's finance
chief was to quit.
Some bullish sentiment remained, while others were disappointed by the
spirit of Lasmo's statement on its boardroom change, complaining that the
move had been made reluctantly. A couple of brokerages pushed negative
stances following the news, while one shifted its position from sell to
hold, believing that it was too early to tell which sentiment would win out.
The shares slipped 3 to 142p in moderate turnover.
An institutional sale of 1.3m shares was behind above average turnover in
Pearson. The stock receded 4 to 565p in a volume of 3.5m.
A chill wind blew through the life insurance sector after a press report
said that Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry,
is considering charges of widespread mis-selling against at least three of
the best known life insurance companies.
Although no companies were named, the report led to nervous trading,
bringing a sharp retreat for some of the biggest stocks in the sector,
although general profit-taking was also said to have played a part in the
decline. The day's falls included Prudential Corporation, which gave up 8 to
363p in trade of 5.1m, and Legal &amp; General, 9 down at 528p. Lloyds Abbey
shed 7 to 456p.
President Clinton's presentation of his health care proposals to Congress
yesterday kept drugs stocks in a nervous mood. Glaxo lost 9 to 682p;
SmithKline Beecham 'A' gave up 7 to 422; Wellcome, which reports results
today, receded 9 to 803p; and Zeneca weakened 15 to 775p.
A stock overhang in Delta left the shares 17 lighter at 491p, following a
large trade in the closing minutes of Tuesday's session. Smith New Court was
reported to have bought a block of around 1.1m shares at 500p, below the
ruling market price, and is believed to have sold around 850,000 at 501p,
leaving the overhang. NatWest Securities was said to have called the stock
lower early yesterday.
Old talk that French group BSN might be eyeing one of the market's favourite
bid targets, United Biscuits, produced a flurry of buying interest early on.
The shares faded to close 3 ahead at 370p. Milk price war worries undermined
Unigate, the shares declining 8 to 378p. Strauss Turnbull was said to be
renewing its positive stance on Northern Foods, which firmed 3 1/2 to 242
1/2 p.
A rise of 13 was achieved by Courtaulds Textiles, taking the price up to
568p. But with turnover small, one analyst put the rise largely down to the
illiquidity of the stock, although it may also still be enjoying positive
sentiment from its recent acquisitions.
Hefty turnover in building materials group MB Caradon, 5 off at 332p, was
put partly down to a large agency cross. Volume in the stock was 9.6m
shares, with 4m of that attributed by market sources to an agency cross by
Cazenove.
News that British Airways is to reduce its package holidays to Euro Disney
knocked the theme park operator, the shares tumbling 30 to 568p. BA slipped
a penny to 374p.
The annnouncement that the managing and finance directors of Eurocamp had
been buying the company's shares saw the stock climb 17 to 219p.
Smith New Court was said to have reiterated its positive stance on Thorn
EMI, the shares advancing 12 to 938p.
International conglomerate BTR rose 5 to 374p after NatWest Securities
issued a 'buy' recommendation. Talk that the extension of the Jubilee tube
line will be announced at the end of this week boosted BICC, finally 9 ahead
at 403p.
Plans by P&amp;O for a US flotation of more than 6,000 US apartments owned by
Laing Properties, its joint venture with Chelsfield, the private property
group, cheered the market. The shares gained 8 at 570p in turnover of 3.2m.

FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ferranti fervour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation that a bid for troubled defence electronics group Ferranti
International may develop into a two-horse race swept through the market,
producing a rally in the shares and record volume of nearly 9 per cent of
the company's share capital.
The group said on Tuesday that it was in talks that might lead to a bid at a
penny a share. Market watchers pointed to defence electronics group GEC as
the most likely suitor, with a few suggesting French group Thomson CSF as a
possible candidate.
However, early yesterday, talk that there could be an alternative offer did
the rounds, although with no name attached to the latest speculation.
Tuesday's dramatic slump in the shares was quickly reversed and they closed
1 1/2 up at 4p, after hectic trading which saw 82m shares dealt.
Most of the selling was said to have come from the large institutions, with
short-term speculators reported to be doing the buying. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management said it had sold 9m shares on Tuesday, reducing its holding to
13.71 per cent from 14.6 per cent. GEC, which has made no comment on the
rumours, rose 3 to 343p on 3.3m turnover.

FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Costco news hits retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that Costco, the US food and retail discount group, had won its court
battle with the leading British supermarket companies to open its first
warehouse site in the UK impacted across several retail sectors yesterday.
Worst hit were the supermarket groups, which had argued in the High Court
that the US company should be treated as a retailer and not a wholesaler,
and therefore have the same regulations applied to it as other food
retailers.
After an initial strong opening, supermarket stocks tumbled as the mid-day
news came into the market. Of the groups challenging Costco in the courts,
J. Sainsbury fell 8 to 416p and Argyll 5 to 304p, while heavy trading in
Tesco saw 18m shares change hands, the price finally closing 4 1/2 down at
216p.
However, food retailing analysts said that the reaction was a symptom of
sentiment rather than a belief that the sector was under serious threat from
the new discounters. 'The food retail stocks have had a good run and some
investors are using Costco as an excuse to take profits,' was the view from
one leading salesman.
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which intends to open its own warehouse operation under
the 'Cargo' logo, advanced strongly, although analysts pointed out that its
substantial cash and carry operations might suffer from any subsequent
expansion of companies similar to Costco. The shares added 7 at 191p.
Although many of yesterday's share falls were described as 'knee-jerk'
reactions by analysts, it was admitted that the continuing focus on
discounting in the food sector was likely to drag down sentiment in food
retailing and manufacturing. 'It underlines that margin pressure is here to
stay in both sectors,' said one food specialist.
Other sectors were also hit. Argos and Dixons weakened on fears that their
electrical appliance sales might be affected. Around half of Costco's sales
in the US are in household goods, with electrical products featuring
strongly. Argos slipped 7 to 349p and Dixons 3 to 274p.
DIY groups were also said to be affected. Ladbroke, owner of Texas Home
Care, shed 2 1/2 to 176 1/2 p. Boots fell 8 to 507p, but WH Smith, joint
owner with Boots of Do It All, firmed 2 to 492p, while Kingfisher, owner of
B&amp;Q, added 6 at 650p.

FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak gilts trigger slide in equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE build-up of downside pressure on the UK equity market continued
yesterday as the gilts market came under fire following the biggest ever
auction of gilt-edged stock.
But many market traders said there had been very little in the way of
determined selling pressure in equities. The view of one head of trading
yesterday was: 'The Budget, and the probability of a UK interest rate cut,
is another day nearer and we have seen no huge weight of selling; if
anything I was impressed with the market's stability in the face of a
tumbling gilts market.' He also noted that the Footsie future was indicating
a firmer opening in the cash market this morning.
The FT-SE 100 Index, which has come under increasing pressure since the end
of last week, fell another 11 points to 3,154.3, to post a three-day decline
of 44.7, or 1.4 per cent since last Friday's record closing level of 3,199.
Second-line stocks, on the other hand, were much more resilient, with the
FT-SE Mid 250 index down 7.9 at 3,537.1 and continued to outperform the
senior index. Since last Friday, when the Mid 250 also reached an all-time
peak, the index has come under only marginal downside pressure, easing only
0.2 per cent.
And many market observers continued to adopt a bullish stance on the UK
equity market. In a pre-Budget seminar, James Capel, regarded as one of the
most powerful agency brokers in the City of London, forecast a 3 per cent
rise in the UK's gross domestic product next year as well as a series of
small tax cuts in the November Budget, with bigger cuts to come. And Capel's
equity market strategist, Mr Paul Walton put forward a figure of 4,000 for
the FT-SE 100 on a 12 to 18-month view. The broker is looking for a
half-percentrage point cut in UK interest rates at the time of the Budget, a
half-point more by the end of the year and a further half-point fall next
year.
There was very little selling pressure in equities as the session got
underway, when the FT-SE 100 rallied from a modest opening fall of around
points to move confidently in positive territory by mid-morning. At its best
the 100 index was almost six points ahead.
However, reported remarks made by the new President of the Bundesbank,
dampening market hopes of more German interest rate cuts, plus the
disturbing news on the UK economy included in the recent Confederation of
British Industry survey and the slide in the gilts market took the steam out
of the market.
A poor opening by Wall Street did little to improve sentiment in London and
the FT-SE 100 dropped to a low of 3,152.2 prior to regaining a measure of
composure just before the close.
Turnover accelerated sharply to 712.2m shares, leaving Monday's 482m and
Tuesday's 589m well behind, although the frantic activity in bid target
Ferranti, now a mere penny stock, accounted for over 82m shares. The level
of customer business transacted on Tuesday also showed a good increase on
the previous day, reaching Pounds 1.29bn.
From today, the London Share Service pages of the FT show dividends
calculated in a slightly different way. The changes, which also affect the
dividend yield calculations, bring the figures into line with those used for
the FT-Actuaries All-Share index and other FT-SE Actuaries indices. Details,

FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTSIE futures yesterday faced round two of the pounding from US sellers
that left them on the ropes the previous day, writes Christine Buckley.
The December contract had a promising start, along with the cash market, but
this proved too weak to sustain the battering of selling. December opened at
3,183 and climbed to a high for the day of 3,198 by mid-morning, with
independent traders seen as the keenest to tick up the level. UK
institutions largely kept their distance.
US selling, which came against a background of generally downbeat sentiment
and a weak Wall Street, steadily wiped away the value gained in the morning.
A poor gilts market added to the gloom.
The contract fell to a day's low of 3,167, although 3,175 proved a
reasonably strong support level. Some market watchers suggested that the
contract had had a good run in recent sessions and would benefit from some
consolidation.
At its close December was at 3,172, which marked a 5-point lead over its
fair value premium to the cash market that is taken at about 15 points.
Volume was average at 8,560 contracts.
Traded options saw healthy activity, with 49,589 lots dealt. Top of the
stock options, which have suffered some sluggish dealing recently, was
British Steel at 12,128 contracts. Much of that activity was done by one
move from October to January.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in car sector fails
to support Dow

Wall Street
US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range either side of opening values
throughout the day yesterday in the wake of a mixed batch of corporate
earnings and some positive economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 7.83 down at 3,664.66. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 gained 0.31 at 464.61 and the American SE composite firmed 1.42
to 475.06. The best performance came from the Nasdaq composite, which
rallied after days of heavy profit-taking to close 6.42 ahead at 771.88.
NYSE volume was 279.8m shares.
With share prices at or near record highs, investors continue to trade
cautiously, fearful of pushing stocks into previously unexplored territory
without strong backing from healthy economic or earnings fundamentals. On
the economic front, there was some good news yesterday in the form of the
September durable goods orders report.
The Commerce Department reported that orders rose 0.7 per cent last month.
Although broadly in line with economists' expectations, the figures showed
that excluding the depressed transportation component, orders actually rose
1.5 per cent in September. The data are in line with a series of recent
figures which have pointed to a gradual improvement in the pace of domestic
economic activity.
Corporate earnings news, however, was mixed, with a handful of the biggest
industrial groups in the country reporting varied performances for the third
quarter. The best showing of the day came from Ford, which announced
third-quarter net income of 79 cents a share, a sharp turnround from the
year ago 66 cents a share loss. Ford put on Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 60 1/4 in
volume of 5.1m shares, and the buying spread to other car stocks, General
Motors rising Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 and Chrysler Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 55 3/8 .
While Ford prospered, other blue chip companies reported poor earnings.
Eastman Kodak posted a third-quarter loss and warned investors not to expect
record profits for 1994. The stock initially fell on the news, but rebounded
to end a net Dollars  7/8 up at Dollars 58 3/4 .
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 after
revealing net income of Dollars 1.47 a share, against Dollars 1.48 earned in
the same quarter a year ago. Other big cyclical stocks were also weaker.
Canada
TORONTO set a record high in fairly busy trading as the market continued its
post-election rally. The TSE 300 index added 10.3 to close at 4,197.5. Rises
led falls by 474 to 295 after volume of 61.6m shares.

MEXICAN equities rose to another intraday record high following good
third-quarter results from Telmex, the telecommunications group, but later
fell on profit-taking, leaving the IPC index 18.64 off at 2,010.42, after
2,039.29. An analyst said the market had already been discounting the
figures from Telmex: the 'L' shares lost 1.8 per cent.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich again defies bourse
downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER day of profit-taking left most bourses lower yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
ZURICH moved against the trend for a second day, the SMI index closing 15.7
higher at 2,715.9 on its relatively high context of dollar earners, and the
prospect of more liquidity entering the equity market with interest rates on
the decline.
In banks, Union Bank saw good business on its talk, strong for Swiss
bankers, said Mr Jim Hyde at Williams de Broe, of favourable conditions and
a substantial increase in profits in prospect. UBS bearers rose SFr11 to
SFr1,297 while SBC put on SFr9 at SFr507. Among cyclicals rising on the
dollar theme, Schindler rose SFr140 to SFr6,650. In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy
climbed SFr12 to SFr782.
FRANKFURT continued its consolidation, the DAX index falling 15.64 to
2,043.08 and turnover from DM8.8bn to DM7.3bn.
There were some economic consolations. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, said that last week's surprise key interest cuts reflected
prospects for existing trends in money supply and inflation; and Mr Julian
Callow, an economist with Kleinwort Bension, that headline inflation in
October would have been 3.1 per cent (0.8 points lower than the actual
figure) were it not for tax increases this year.
However, at corporate level, Volkswagen slid DM6.50 on plans for a four day
working week, and steady earnings at RWE, the engineering and energy group,
left the shares DM5 lower at DM473.50.
AMSTERDAM saw fresh pressure in the options exchange lead the cash market
lower and the CBS Tendency index lost 2.0 or 1.5 per cent to 133.8. Turnover
remained strong at around Fl 1bn.
Ahold, the retailer, lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 93.10 after Lehman Brothers
downgraded the stock to a 'trading sell'. Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones, retailing
analyst at Lehman, explained that it appeared that trading conditions in the
US, which accounted for some 48 per cent of Ahold's profits, had not
stabilised following an aggressive price war with competitors. Consequently,
he had reduced his eps forecast for 1993 to Fl 6.00 from Fl 6.20.
PARIS was forced lower by weakness in the bond market and a general round of
profit-taking triggered by the government's decision to withdraw its
controversial cost-cutting package at Air France.
The CAC-40 index skidded through the 2,200 support level to close off 18.35
at 2,192.02. Turnover was FFr3.8bn.
EuroDisney was among the day's biggest losers, down FFr3.45 or 6.5 per cent
at FFr49.15, on fears that the strike at Air France may furtherreduce
attendance figures.
MADRID reflected a number of corporate stories as profit-taking left the
general index 3.32 lower at 303.81 in turnover of Pta23bn.
In foods and tobaccos, Tabacalera fell Pta40 to Pta3,660 on expectations of
poor 1993 profits. In retailing, Pryca dropped 3.8 per cent, taking its fall
to 7 per cent this year against a rise of over 40 per cent in the market.
Anti-Sunday opening legislation passed in Catalonia was put forward as one
reason for yesterday's weakness.
However, James Capel put out a buy note on Cepsa, the refiner and marketer
of oil products, saying that strong third quarter 1993 results should mark
the end to its recent underperformance. The shares rose Pta35 to Pta2,400.
MILAN remained uncertain as political worries relating to both the passage
of the 1994 budget and privatisation plans continued to develop. The Comit
index lost 9.39 to 576.14.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Indonesian equities make a return to
favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockbrokers in Jakarta are worried about their security. Earlier this
month, riot police were called to protect the offices of Wardley James Capel
from an angry mob.
Although violent, brokers can take comfort that the incident arose from the
fact that Indonesian investors again want to own shares, and will sometimes
resort to extreme means to get them.
The market crash in 1990/91, which sent the composite index from a high of
682 points to 225, gave many Indonesians a jaundiced view of equities. Since
the start of this year, however, the index has risen by 70 per cent and,
among the IFC's emerging markets, Indonesia rates as the third best
performer in the year to date in dollar terms. Warily at first, and now with
excessive enthusiasm, local investors are returning.
Their interest has been heightened by a spate of flotations which have gone
to an instant premium to their listing price. On October 1, shares in Barito
Pacific Timber, the largest single issue this year and raising Dollars 290m,
rose 60 per cent on the first day of trading.
A few days later, more than 4,000 people turned up at the offices of Wardley
James Capel to apply for shares in Kedaung Indah Can, an enamel ware
manufacturer. Brokers expect it to open at a 50 per cent premium to its
flotation price.
Given the adage that when the public buy, a market correction is imminent,
brokers are now asking how long the good times will last.
The market looks fully valued at 23 times forecast 1993 earnings and 17
times 1994 earnings. An unwritten rule that companies coming to the market
should float at about 14 times earnings has allowed investors to make quick
gains on new issues. There are signs, however, that the rule is about to be
broken.
Ciputra Development, a leading property company, is to list next month,
raising Dollars 120m. Brokers report strong local interest, but note that
its anticipated listing price would value the company at 19 times next
year's earnings.
If other companies follow Ciputra's example and decide against listing at a
discount, the upside potential for equity investors will be limited.
Lower interest rates may improve corporate earnings, but brokers are already
assuming 20 per cent earnings growth next year. Speculation that the
government will lift the shareholding limit of 49 per cent that foreigners
may own in listed companies has also died away. The raising of the limit
would dramatically improve liquidity for foreign investors and almost
certainly drive the index higher.
The flow of foreign funds into the market, particularly from the US, should
help to sustain share prices, but Indonesia is only one of several emerging
markets in the region. With Jakarta equities looking increasingly expensive,
interest has turned to Thailand and Hong Kong.
Nevertheless, brokers say the days are gone when the market, with a
capitalisation of over Dollars 30bn, could be ignored by fund managers.
Unless there is an upset, such as the failure of a large issue or a major
corporate scandal, the market is unlikely to return to its 1992 trough.
Trading volume has doubled to above Dollars 30m a day this year and, with a
raft of new companies expected to float next year, volumes should continue
to rise.
Some investors still eye Indonesia suspiciously, recalling the scandals that
rocked the market three years ago, but many believe this year's recovery
will be sustainable.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
20,000 after JR East suspension

THE Nikkei average fell below the 20,000 level for the first time in three
months as pessimism spread following the suspension of trading in East Japan
Railway shares in the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 184.82 lower at 19,838.78, having opened at the
day's high of 20,012.80. However, the mid-morning announcement of JR East's
suspension prompted selling, depressing the index to the day's low of
19,686.97 in the afternoon.
Stock exchange officials suspended JR East for the rest of the session as a
rush of orders blocked the computer system, preventing trading of other
shares on the TSE.
Traders said the confusion which resulted prompted investors to turn to the
over-the-counter market. The OTC average rose 17.46 to 1,612.36.
Investors wanting to trade JR East shares rushed to the Osaka and Nagoya
exchanges, forcing officials to halt trading there briefly.
Volume totalled 279.6m shares, against 257m. Declines led advances by 685 to
303, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
lost 13.36 to 1,631.95, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.06 at
1,288.96.
Railway stocks were weak, with Tobu Railway falling Y45 to Y742 and Tokyu
Y35 to Y785.
Game makers fell back on prospects of lower earnings, with Nintendo losing
Y270 to Y7,670 and Sega Enterprises declining Y100 to Y9,200.
Large-capital issues continued to lose ground, with Nippon Steel, the day's
most active stock, off Y2 at Y333 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dipping Y6
to Y677.
High-technology shares retreated on profit-taking: Matsushita Electric
Industrial slipped Y40 to Y1,460 and Sony Y50 to Y4,850.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 300.78 to 21,681.24 in volume of 11.8m
shares. JR East closed at an offered price of Y598,400.
Roundup
THE REGION produced three new highs and significant gains in senior markets.
HONG KONG talked of renewed demand from the US and Japan as the Hang Seng
index rose 112.30, or 1.3 per cent, to 8,903.20, and turnover moved up from
HKDollars 5.2bn to an estimated HKDollars 6.3bn.
The advance was broadly based but the new listing, Yaohan, was the day's
most active stock with HKDollars 453m worth of shares changing hands. It
closed at HKDollars 3.325, up 24 per cent from the issue price of HKDollars
2.68.
AUSTRALIA saw a strong performance by BHP, up a net 25 cents at ADollars
17.20, and an inflation figure within expectations as the All Ordinaries
index gained 12.6 at 2,068.3.
Turnover more than doubled from ADollars 306.8m to ADollars 645.3m. Brokers
said BHP was supported by news that the Dai Hung 4 appraisal well off the
coast of Vietnam had produced good results.
The new highs came in NEW ZEALAND, BANGKOK and KARACHI. New Zealand nudged
to another four-year closing peak, although Fletcher Challenge's run higher
was checked by profit-taking. FCL ended 7 cents down at NZDollars 4.03 as
the NZSE-40 capital index closed 5.22 up at 2,118.23.
BANGKOK's SET index shot up by 34.90, or 3 per cent, to 1,193.18 in active
turnover of Bt15.19bn as new funds from Japan drew local investors back to
the market in force. KARACHI took its winning streak to the 13th straight
session as the KSE index rose 19.77 to 1,542.40.
SINGAPORE's blue chips led the uptrend ahead of the trading of Singapore
Telecom shares next week, and the Malaysian budget tomorrow, the Straits
Times Industrial index finishing 13.35 higher at 2,107.41.
Malaysian speculative stocks provided the bulk of activity. In KUALA LUMPUR
itself, the KLSE composite index fell on profit taking from an intraday
record high of 941.47 to close at 934.53, still up 4.68.
TAIWAN ended off its highs after gains in speculative shares failed to boost
the overall market.
The weighted index was finally 12.46 up at 4,103.63, after reaching 4,134,
and turnover swelled to TDollars 32.46bn.
Among the speculative counters, Hong Yi Fibre was the day's limit up at
TDollars 111.50 and Tera limit up at TDollars 28.70.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Investors lock in their profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING international currencies reacted to end of the month pressures
rather than fundamental economic signals, and trading volumes were light
yesterday. But the dollar was helped by encouraging US economic data, while
the D-Mark responded to signs that German interest rates might not fall as
fast as thought, writes Peter John.
Fund managers generally record their performance on a monthly basis and,
after a volatile four weeks during which the Belgian franc has swung sharply
against the D-Mark and the dollar has risen around seven pfennigs against
the German currency, some will have made big profits.
Yesterday was the last possible day for ensuring that those currency profits
were attributable to October. Consequently, the US dollar was sold down to
DM1.6725 during the day as fund managers shored up their profits. Then, news
that US durable goods orders rose by 0.7 per cent in September was well
received and the dollar recovered some of its momentum to end at DM1.6805 in
Europe, only marginally lower than the previous day's close of DM1.6810. It
finished New York trading with little further change at DM1.6800.
The D-Mark, which had been weaker since the Bundesbank's surprise rate cut a
week ago, recovered against most European currencies as investors adjusted
their positions. It was given a further lift from a tight Bundesbank repo
which drained money from the market and dampened the belief that German
rates are poised to fall quickly. That signal was strengthened by comments
from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, who said he saw no reason for
a further rate cut for the time being.
The German currency improved against the pound, Italian lira, Spanish peseta
and French franc. However, the French currency was unsettled by the strike
at Air France and the possibility that the industrial action might spill
over into other areas of the public sector. The franc also traded nervously
ahead of jobless figures tomorrow, which could show a rise from the present
11.7 per cent. France has one of the highest rates of unemployment among
OECD countries.
The Belgian franc headed back towards BFr21.60 to the D-Mark at one point,
although this was more a technical correction than a belief that the
fundamental problems of high wage costs and high public debt have been
resolved.
The country's central bank said its foreign exchange reserves fell by
BFr8.62bn to BFr214.93bn in the week to October 25, mainly because of
intervention in the exchange markets. By the close the currency was slightly
weaker at BFr21.69 per D-Mark, compared with BFr21.64 previously.
The Taiwan dollar ended slightly lower against the US dollar as investors
were reluctant to test the currency's downside aggressively after Tuesday's
active intervention to support it.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Overnight rate hits 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERNIGHT interest rates were squeezed up to 8 per cent in the UK as an
unusually high daily liquidity shortage overhung the money markets, writes
Peter John.
Meanwhile, short-term interest rate futures were sold down on worries that
some European central banks might be becoming more wary of making further
interest rate cuts.
The UK liquidity shortage coincided with a record sized gilts auction, and
forward rates for the rest of the week suggested that tight monetary
conditions could continue today. The Bank of England initially forecast a
liquidity shortage of around Pounds 2.4bn and the estimate was later raised
to Pounds 2.5bn.
The Bank provided Pounds 785m of early assistance, followed by Pounds 278m
of assistance in the late morning and a further Pounds 698m in the
afternoon.
However, that only took Bank operations to Pounds 1.761bn and the Bank
needed to provide a further Pounds 560m of late assistance at the usual
unspecified rate, taking total help to Pounds 2.321bn.
The difficult nature of the day's trading pushed the forward rate for
today's and tomorrow's overnight money to 6.5 per cent. Dealers suggested
that banks who had the collateral necessary to take out the shortage might
have been holding their fire power for today when half of yesterday's Pounds
3.5bn gilts auction becomes payable. The problem could be compounded by
large amounts of maturing assis-tance likely to result in another high
shortage.
Meanwhile, comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the head of the Bundesbank,
contributed to weakness in short-term interest rate contracts. Mr Tietmeyer
sought to damp down speculation that the recent rash of interest rate cuts
was the beginning of a trend. Euromark futures for December fell 7 basis
points to 93.81 and the equivalent French contract closed weaker at 93.63.
The short sterling December contract declined 6 basis points to 94.53.
Some dealers said the December contract was well supported at 94.50 but
others were concerned that the move reflected a fundamental change of
sentiment.
German call money was pushed up to about 6.57 per cent from about 6.5 per
cent as the Bundesbank allocated only DM66.7bn at its securities repurchase
operations and drained DM7.4bn from the system.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (6): The carrot and the
stick - Investment in Canada is patchy. Bernard Simon explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S investment climate these days has all the extremes - and the
in-betweens - of its weather.
At one end of the spectrum, a prolonged recession has meant that governments
at all levels are willing to pull out the stops to attract businesses which
hold out hope of creating jobs.
The slack economy has also made Canada a more attractive location for
long-term investors. Inflation and interest rates are at their lowest level
in decades. Real estate prices in most parts of the country are still in the
doldrums.
The 1989 free trade agreement with the US has reinforced pressures on
management and workers to become more competitive. Employees are willing to
do more for less, and trade unions have become more flexible.
However, these advantages do not mean that industrialists can look forward
to a warm, hassle-free welcome. Taxes are high. Non-tariff trade barriers
hamper trade between the 10 provinces, and red tape is pervasive in many
sectors, especially for any business requiring environmental clearances.
Mr Bob Brown, chairman of Price Waterhouse in Toronto, sums up the changes
in government attitudes and policies over the past year or two this way:
'The drunkard is off strong drink, but he's still into a dozen beers a day'.
The pros and cons of locating in Canada thus depend heavily on the needs and
priorities of a particular business.
Domestic and foreign investors have had little hesitation, about pouring
money into the entertainment and hospitality sectors, where the lure of
millions of well-heeled consumers is paramount.
The US National Basketball League recently received three competing bids to
set up a team in Toronto, as well as one from Vancouver. Mr David Peterson,
a former premier of Ontario, is confident that the CDollars 250m which his
group offered for the franchise will be more than recouped by sales of
tickets and souvenirs. 'The SkyDome,' Mr Peterson says, referring to
Toronto's bulbous sports stadium, 'is the one place where you find people
smiling these days.'
By contrast, the mining industry is gloomy. Tight environmental rules and
high-cost labour are causing foreign mining companies to shun Canada. Many
Canadian companies are paying more attention to exploration in Chile and
Mexico than to their own country.
Foreign investors in the politically-charged cultural industries, such as
publishing and broadcasting, also encounter strong resistance from Canadian
nationalists.
On balance, however, the climate for investment has improved rather than
deteriorated. Ms Maureen Farrow, chief economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
Toronto, says that 'over the last couple of years, it's become a less risky
place.' In particular, she notes, 'our cost structure is more in line with
where it should be.'
Even the social-democratic governments in Ontario and British Columbia,
whose interventionist policies have demoralised the business community, have
shown signs of changing direction. Ontario has ordered a three-year pay
freeze for provincial civil servants. A bottom line-oriented management has
been installed at Ontario Hydro, the provincial power utility. It has
promised not to raise electricity rates next year, and to hold future rises
within cost-of-living increases.
Mr William Macdonald, a business consultant, says Canada is four to five
years into a restructuring process that could take another seven to eight
years. In a few years, he predicts, Canada could have the best possible
combination of mutually reinforcing monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and
trade policies.
Much depends however, on the political climate. While the long-term economic
outlook has improved, this week's general election has created a new set of
uncertainties.
The business community is taking comfort from the landslide victory of the
Liberals, which ended nine years of Progressive Conservative rule. The
Conservatives were devastated in the election, winning only two out of 295
seats in the House of Commons.
Today's Liberals are a far different party from the interventionist one led
by Mr Pierre Trudeau which governed in the 1970s and early 1980s. They are
more pragmatic, and more aware of the needs of both domestic and foreign
business.
The Liberals raised some fears during the election campaign that their
fiscal and monetary policies would be less disciplined than the Tories. They
also pledged to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement, which
is due to come into force on January 1 1994.
In practice, however, the policies of a Liberal government are unlikely to
be radically different from those of the Conservatives. The Liberals are
unlikely to scupper Nafta. They have also promised to give high priority to
deficit reduction.
The 1993 election will be remembered for the strong performance of two
fledgling regional parties, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in Quebec and the
Reform Party, which is based in western Canada. Both parties are generally
pro-business and favour free trade.
But the BQ's aim to take Quebec out of Canada has increased the risk of
political instability in the years ahead. The key event will be a provincial
election in Quebec, which will probably be held in the second half of 1994.
The BQ's provincial cousin, the Parti Quebecois, has promised to hold an
independence referendum within a year if it wins that election.
Ms Farrow says that the level of political risk in Canada is 'no different
to any other country these days'. But she cautions that investors would do
well to monitor developments in Quebec closely.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (8): Smart move to
Atlanta - Case study, United Parcel Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY companies that relocate have at least a few regrets about how they
handled the move. But United Parcel Service, the world's largest parcel
delivery company, says the Dollars 100m shift of its headquarters two years
ago to Atlanta came off almost flawlessly.
A look at why the transfer was successful and at what the company believes
it could have done a bit better offer some useful lessons to others
contemplating a relocation.
UPS already had experience with relocations. Its move to Atlanta was the
third change of corporate home in its 85-year history. The company started
as American Messenger Service in Seattle, moved to New York in 1930 and in
1975 to Greenwich, Connecticut, a plush New York suburb. It also, as company
policy, made a practice of regularly moving its executives around to give
them experience in its various operations.
The main requirement for a successful relocation is to choose the right
site. That means knowing exactly what you want. For UPS, Atlanta was a
virtually perfect fit and it has won overwhelming employee approval.
The company had begun to feel uncomfortable with the contrast between the
luxurious Greenwich setting of its headquarters and its plain folks image.
By comparison, in Atlanta the cost of living and the cost of operating were
far lower. A survey of employees a year after the move, according to Ms
Susan Rosenberg of UPS, found that 'far and away' the majority of the
company's employees approved of the move.
'Everyone was able to meet or exceed their standard of living,' she
explains.
High on the list of factors contributing to employee satisfaction was more
reasonably priced housing. The cost of homes in Greenwich, where the average
family four-bedroom home sold for Dollars 569,000 two years ago, had made
managers shun transfers to headquarters and left many non-management
employees without a chance in the housing market. The average cost of a
comparable home in Atlanta was Dollars 138,500 in 1991, according to
Coldwell Banker.
The travel needs of UPS were also an important factor in selecting a site.
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, the world's fourth busiest,
offered easier access by car or public transport and a better network of
convenient flights than New York's airports. UPS executives flew 18,000
flight segments in 1990. This year, boosted by strong growth, particularly
in Europe, they will fly double that many.
Atlanta's physical characteristics were also appealing. Its tree-covered
rolling hills resembled New England and helped employees feel they were in
an environment to which they were accustomed.
But even with Atlanta's attractive amenities, officials at UPS say two other
decisions helped make the relocation a success.
First, all 900 employees, not just management, were offered transfers.
Although their relocation advisers, PHH Fantus, said that usually only 10
per cent of an hourly workforce accept agree to move, some 60 per cent of
UPS's non-management employees took the transfer. And 96 per cent of its
managers accepted the move.
These exceptionally high numbers are explained in part by the company's
egalitarian culture. Loyalty is strong at UPS, which is privately owned by a
management group composed of 26,000 of its own employees, 'People
development,' as Ms Rosenberg calls it, whereby managers work their way up
through the ranks, is company policy.
The management was advised by Fantus that, if it moved hourly employees,
that would provide enough savings in hiring and training to offset much of
the relocation costs.
Secondly, UPS top management helped employees make their transfer decisions
 -and perhaps enticed more of them to move - by providing ample information
and even familiarisation tours of Atlanta. After Mr Kent 'Oz' Nelson,
chairman of UPS, announced the site choice in May 1991, the company held
briefings not only for employees but also for their families. The Atlanta
tours were thorough, including neighbourhoods, schools and recreation and
cultural facilities. Information centres were set up in Greenwich as well as
in Atlanta.
Yet even what seemed a model relocation had a few flaws. There were several
complaints about the company's lack of assistance for job-seeking spouses.
Given that many American families now depend on two incomes, the importance
of this demand was underestimated by UPS. Mr Ken Sternad, chief of public
affairs, said: 'It was a stronger issue than we had calculated. We didn't do
as good a job as we should have done.'
Some employees also felt that a move in the middle of the school year was
disruptive for families. But the company did not want to wait too long after
announcing its decision to relocate. In such waiting periods the uncertainty
tends to result in a loss of productivity.
The biggest glitch was, however, on office property. UPS had wanted an
existing building and was negotiating for one just before announcing it
would move. But that deal fell through and the company ended up having to
rent space in three different office buildings, dividing its workforce.
That three-way split led the company to decide in September 1991 to build
its own headquarters building and, in effect, move again. However, UPS
regards the planned building, which is expected to cost Dollars 75m and to
be completed next year, as a happy ending to a sticky dilemma - and one that
company growth may eventually have demanded anyway.
The company's expansion has proceeded so rapidly that it has increased its
workforce to 1,400, a 55 per cent increase over the number who worked in
Greenwich. The new headquarters, a relatively modest pair of seven-storey
structures connected at the lower levels, will be built to house an eventual
2,000-strong staff. And, say satisfied UPS officials, it will be built to
meet all of the company's needs.

 -Site Selection

from strong telecommunications infrastructure to low wage rates - but there
is possibly nothing as alluring as feeling wanted.
A location's receptivity to new investors is the key in site shopping. While
human warmth can weigh in, this is commonly measured in the kind of
incentives offered to investors.
'The incentive issue has increased in importance,' says Mr Robert Farley,
partner at Chicago-based PHH Fantus, the largest US firm specialising in
relocation. 'There's a far higher number of companies that want to know at
the beginning what state and local incentives programmes are.'
Although a subject of debate, many companies will not even consider
locations that do not at a minimum offer tax abatements.
Companies are also more and more often seeking incentives that can solve a
particular problem, whether it be road building or money upfront for
research grants at local universities.
The US Sunbelt, already blessed with many desirable features, has been
singularly competitive on incentives - with stunning results. The
Greenville-Spartanburg area of western South Carolina, for example, has
attracted more foreign investment per capita than any other US metropolitan
area. And Atlanta, known for its ability to market itself effectively, has
consistently been ranked as the top choice of both US and foreign corporate
executives.
In its 1993 national real estate survey, Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting and
consultancy firm, found that of the top 10 markets, six were in the
south-east or south-west, with Washington-Baltimore, Seattle, Chicago and
Denver also making the list. Atlanta was ranked as the top relocation spot
by 1,700 US real estate executives who were polled.
Louis Harris, the US polling expert, also recently conducted a survey of
senior executives from 540 companies in seven countries, including the UK,
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. They also named six
Sunbelt sites as the best locations for new plants or offices, and again
their top choice was Atlanta.
Mr Wesley Devoto, an Atlanta-based 'finder', who identifies acquisitions for
UK companies (like an investment banker without the financial role), says:
'Almost all the British companies I've dealt with over the past 15 years
would like to have a headquarters in Atlanta.'
The Sunbelt's cheaper properties, lower wage rates, lack of unionisation and
more modest cost of living overall make these states some of the most
attractive places to locate a plant, distribution centre or corporate
headquarters.
The average manufacturing wages rates in the south-east, Dollars 9.85 an
hour, and the mid-south, Dollars 10.18 an hour, are still relative bargains
compared to the rest of the nation. The national average is Dollars 11.45.
Part of the explanation for the disparity is that unions have long been
anathema in the south. Many southern states have right-to-work laws which
have the effect of barring unionisation. While potential investors are
usually treated like princes, those that would bring unions with them can be
snubbed.
Management salaries in the south are often lower, too, because the cost of
living is lower. According to Runzheimer International, which tracks the US
cost of living, a family of four can live well in Memphis for about Dollars
55,800 a year, whereas the same family would have to pay almost Dollars
76,000 for the same amenities in Los Angeles.
But other cities and states have been eager to court business investment as
well. Some have chosen to target certain industries, while not excluding
others. Oklahoma City wants to be known as America's capital of 'back
office' operations. Boulder, Colorado, has been attracting biotechnology
firms. Columbus, Ohio, has been expanding its financial and insurance
sector.
US managerial talent and highly skilled labour are at present abundantly
available and often willing to go where the jobs are. According to real
estate consultants Cushman &amp; Wakefield, more than 640,000 white collar jobs
were lost in the United States during the 1990-1991 recession and the
continued consolidations and downsizings of major American firms promise
that the talent pool will remain large.
Most states also offer some type of worker training scheme.
With respect to the American property market, stability is beginning to set
in after rampant overbuilding in the late 1980s. Vacancy rates in many major
cities are dropping and this can mean that prices will firm up in many
locations as top quality space is absorbed.
Yet, the traditional 'hard' factors of site selection - wages, real estate
costs, taxes - are in many cases yielding to more 'soft' factors, such as
the quality of life offered by a certain location.
More and more, especially for corporate headquarters, companies are looking
at housing prices, quality of schools, cultural and recreational amenities,
and environmental appeal. The rolling green hills of central Alabama, for
example, felt inviting to Mercedes-Benz officials because they were reminded
of Stuttgart.
In addition, many foreign investors prefer an area where they will find
other compatriots. Atlanta, for instance, has the largest British-American
business group in the US.
Not only is there the comfort of numbers, says Mr Devoto, but they feel
'it's low risk to buy where others have bought before them and been
successful.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (4): Truce sought in
bidding wars - It is costing states more and more to lure investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE cost of incentives to lure new business investment has climbed to an
estimated Dollars 30bn a year, more and more US state and local officials
are wondering whether they are giving away the store.
The latest skirmish among states - for the Dollars 300m Mercedes-Benz plant
that went to Alabama - may prove to be a catalyst for a serious rethink of
these bidding wars. The size of Alabama's incentives package was regarded by
many as over the top. It included Dollars 253m upfront, plus tax breaks over
25 years that could be worth an additional Dollars 230m.
Criticism of competition for new business investment as an inefficient and
inequitable use of public resources has been building for years. As the
amount offered in incentives by US state and local governments has grown,
opposition has become louder.
One critic from a New York citizens' watchdog group has called corporate
site shopping 'polite extortion'. And Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois, a
Republican, has been insistently calling for a truce in the bidding wars by
all states.
At a National Governors' Association meeting in August, Mr Edgar made some
headway toward his goal. The organisation issued a policy statement to the
effect that competition among states for investment should not be ruled by
how much a state sweetens the deal for a single investor, but by how much
the deal can improve the state's general business climate.
The competition should be judged on education, transportation, tele-
communications, tax policies, business regulation and fiscal stability, the
governors said.
Notably, they also agreed that they had the right to consult whenever they
believed a company was trying to play them off against one another to win
bigger concessions. They warned, too, that governors should be prepared to
take the political heat that might result if they declined to engage in a
bidding war for a high-impact, high-profile project.
While all these seem noble goals, Mr Jay Kayne, policy studies director for
the National Governors' Association, says that the governors do not
realistically expect a quick halt to high-cost bidding. The competition for
Mercedes, for instance, had already reached a fever pitch. But they do hope
to spur some states to at least review their incentive policies. The NGA has
been trying to meet top corporate leaders to win their co-operation.
The slow growth of the US economy has been blamed for pushing up the cost of
incentives. With fewer big investment projects on offer, states that are in
desperate need of jobs feel compelled to bid up their hand-outs to
companies. 'It's market forces,' says Mr Kayne.
Moreover, in cases involving big, high-profile investors, Mr Kayne likens a
state's pursuit of a project to the development of a shopping mall. 'If you
get the Sears or the Macy's in there, then other stores will want to come
in.'
The consequences of reckless bidding are, however, becoming more punishing.
In 1991, for example, Indianapolis won the bidding for a United Airlines
maintenance facility by contributing a large chunk of the Dollars 1bn or so
that Indiana could give away. But in the process, the city put itself deeply
in the red.
The doubts about fat packages of incentives have been heightened by surveys
of company executives which show that these hand-outs often do not in
themselves sway corporate decisions on site locations. If contenders offer
approximately the same proximity to markets and materials, good
transportation and infrastructure and availability of labour, incentives
amount to little more than a thick layer of icing on the cake for some
companies.
As the mood on incentives has soured, a backlash has been rising against
companies that do not fulfil their promises, particularly on job creation.
States have increasingly placed 'clawback' provisions in their deals,
requiring that subsidies be returned if a company's promises are not
fulfilled.
However, PHH Fantus, the leading corporate relocation adviser, says that its
clients rarely accept such conditions and they are negotiated out of a deal.
Nonetheless, a number of law suits have been filed on the basis of a
company's failure to deliver on its promises. One of the better known ones
is that of the Ypsilanti Township, in Michigan, against General Motors.
GM's Willow Run assembly plant, located in Ypsilanti, was chosen to be
closed in early 1992, violating what the township said was the company's
promises of jobs and investment in return for tax abatements.
The township won its case in the first trial, but lost an appeal by GM in
the Michigan Court of Appeals. The state's Supreme Court then refused to
hear the case, but the township is still pursuing an aspect of its case
further.
While its previous action would have forced GM to fulfil promises on jobs
and keep the plant open, its current tack is to press a claim of 'unjust
enrichment' against GM and win back money that the company saved from
Ypsilanti's tax abatements.
Cases such as this have given pause to both sides in negotiations for site
locations. They also have contributed to a new sobriety among state and
local officials in their approaches to new investors.
Yet, while the need for job-creating investment is still pressing, the US is
unlikely to see the end of these bidding wars - as the scramble to secure
the Mercedes-Benz site clearly shows.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (5): The incentive that
passes the test - Worker training programmes have brought new investment to
states in the south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US STATES fishing for new investment are baiting their hooks with more than
tax breaks and cheap land. Worker training programmes have become the
hottest incentive to offer.
The reasons are simple. Those states with innovative worker training
programmes have been enjoying enviable success in attracting new
job-creating investments. South Carolina's worker training scheme was, for
example, a key reason for BMW's choice of that state last year for its US
assembly plant.
Moreover, as a recent survey by the US education department showed, skill
levels of the American workforce leave a lot to be desired. More than 26,000
Americans were tested and nearly half were not proficient enough in reading
and writing to function effectively in the workplace.
Ms Madeleine Kunin, US deputy secretary of education, called the results
'very sobering', particularly as demand for higher level skills had vastly
increased in the workplace.
With this backdrop, it is not surprising that training programmes of various
kinds and quality are offered now by all but four of America's 50 states,
according to a study by the Texas Jobs Fund Programme .
The programmes offer either to custom train employees for a company at
little or no cost or give cash grants to companies to train their local
workers.
Training, whether a custom programme or a cash grant, is one of the few
incentives that have no controversy attached. Generous tax abatements and
other such give-aways are sometimes viewed as virtually 'buying' a company's
investment. But tax dollars spent on training are considered well-spent. The
state gains more and better trained workers, who are an asset even if that
company moves away.
From a company's point of view, the programmes can reduce start-up costs by
millions of dollars, ensuring top quality work and higher productivity. The
companies can use the programmes to teach not just generic industrial
skills, but the specific ones needed for a particular plant or office. Many
programmes also screen workers and have them ready to go when the plant or
office building is completed.
While many states have such programmes, the US south-east has excelled in
this regard. The three states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia
offer innovative training programmes that have captured large amounts of US
and foreign investment.
The Carolinas have virtually written the book on worker training programmes.
Back in the 1960s, as the textile industry was either automating or moving
abroad in search of cheaper labour, these states realised sooner than most
that what they needed to offer was an upgraded, better educated workforce.
South Carolina designed an innovative programme to custom train workers,
using a network of 16 community colleges created in 1969. Then, they went
shopping for foreign investment, making Germany one of their first stops.
For instance, Robert Bosch, the automotive components maker, was lured to
South Carolina largely because of the state's worker training programme.
According to Bosch, the company now operates a German-style apprenticeship
programme in collaboration with the state for its two major plants there.
The same bait hooked others. South Carolina is now dotted with such
corporate logos as Michelin, BASF, Adidas and Hoechst Celanese. In total,
some 6 per cent of the state's workforce are employed by non-American firms,
not counting those who will eventually work for BMW.
In North Carolina, which narrowly missed being the site for the new Mercedes
assembly plant, its programme custom trains a workforce using 58 community
colleges. It also boasts a top notch research park, drawing on three
universities: Duke, North Carolina State and University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
These lures combined to make the state the first choice in the nation for
locating new manufacturing facilities in four of the five years between 1987
and 1992. Since 1963, the programme has trained over 250,000 workers for
some 3,000 companies. Among its foreign investors are Burroughs- Wellcome
and Daimler Benz.
Georgia, similar to its Carolinian neighbours, has also attracted investment
with its worker-training scheme. Known as Quick Start, this programme custom
trains a workforce using a network of 32 technical institutes and four
colleges.
Such international manufacturers as Coats &amp; Clark (the Coats Viyella
subsidiary), Lever Brothers, Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics and Yamaha
Motor have used Quick Start. And service companies including Holiday Inns
Worldwide have cited the training programme as a reason for choosing
Georgia.
The south-east's dedication to upgrading its workforce is widely seen as a
model of what the US needs to do to compete internationally. Mr Robert
Reich, US secretary of labour, argues that US success in the global economy
will depend on the quality, education and skill of the American workforce.
And, as competition for investment has grown, the lessons from the
south-east appear not to be lost on other states.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (3): The shift to the
south - Regional factors that come into play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT consideration when locating in North America is the relative
strengths of the various regional economies and their competitive
advantages.
For the US constitutes not a single economy but an agglomeration of regional
ones, each with differing attitudes towards business issues, industrial
mixes, cycles of growth and recession.
That said, two overall national trends have been particularly noticeable in
recent decades. First, the population of the country has increased since
1960 from about 180m to 250m. However, most of this growth has occurred in
the south and west of the country, rather than in the traditional northern
'rustbelt,' where population growth has slowed to a crawl.
There has been a similar shift in national output, especially in
manufacturing industry. Between 1963 and 1989 the middle Atlantic and
east-north central regions' combined share of manufacturing output declined
by nearly 30 per cent, while the south and west enjoyed a combined increase
of nearly 33 per cent, according to Mr Robert Crandall, a Fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington.
In his book Manufacturing on the Move, Mr Crandall argues that labour market
conditions, and in particular high wages and high levels of unionisation,
have been a primary factor behind the decline of the north and rise of the
south, with its lower labour costs and tradition of hostility to unions.
'As of 1993', he adds, 'there is no evidence that the shift in manufacturing
is slowing. Northern states may event- ually discover that it is in their
interest to reduce impediments in their own labour markets. These policies
may, in turn, slow the migration, but they seem unlikely to stop it.'
Few would dispute that labour issues have been a major factor in this trend,
but others would also cite such factors as the development of more
entrepreneurial attitudes in some parts of the south and the invention of
the air-conditioner.
A second trend, which has become discernible in the past year or so, is
rapid economic growth in the scenically beautiful and less developed states
of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific north-west.
'Employment in the moun- tain and plain states is growing at a 3.2 per cent
annual rate, or four times the national average,' says Mr David Hale, chief
economist at Kemper Financial Services. 'In the 1980s it was growing at half
the national rate.
'In fact, the top ranking states for employment growth this year are Utah
(up 4.1 per cent), Nevada (3.1 per cent), Idaho (3 per cent) and Colorado
(2.7 per cent.)'
The Rockies seem to be part- icularly attractive to white- collar
professionals who are able to live wherever they choose, thanks to the
wonders of computer networks and the fax machine, and plump for this area
because of its superb, outdoor lifestyle.
Time magazine said recently that 'on the strength of cur- rent migration
trends, some experts believe the region may even be on the way to becoming a
magnetic pole of a new West, replacing California as the ultimate,
myth-making destination, tantalising the daydreams of restless souls itching
to pick up and move.'
Certainly, a large number of migrants to the Rockies seem to be coming from
California, which is in the throes of a deep recession, due partly to the
shrinking defence industry, which remains an important part of its
industrial base, high wages and a collapse in its property market.
California is also suffering from more serious, and basic, structural
problems, including racial tensions (brought home by the Los Angeles riots),
heavy government regulation of industry and congested roads. All this has
meant a deterioration in the quality of life.
That said, the state seems to be starting to grapple with some of these
problems. Hughes Aircraft, the large aerospace manufacturer, announced
recently that it would stay in California because of the state's adoption of
tax breaks for businesses and a new 'atmosphere of co-operation'. It had put
its headquarters on the real estate market a year ago.
The north-eastern US is undergoing similar structural economic problems to
those in California, since it has been heavily reliant on the defence
industry and suffered a property market bubble in the 1980s from which the
region is only slowly recovering.
As Kemper's Mr Hale notes: 'While the US economy has long experienced
regional divergences in economic performance they have increased greatly
during this cycle.'
Other regions which are currently seeing reasonable, if somewhat sluggish,
growth include: Texas, the Pacific north-west and the south-east.
Texas suffered a severe slump in the mid-1980s when the price of oil tumbled
but it has since diversified away from the sector into such areas as high
technology and environmental services, and the economy should benefit
greatly from its proximity to Mexico if the North American free trade
agreement is signed into law.
The Pacific north-western states of Washington and Oregon, like the Rocky
Mountain states, have attracted considerable immigration from California and
have moved far beyond their traditional reliance on agro-businesses, with
thriving high technology sectors. That said, the downturn in the world
aviation market is hitting Boeing, based just outside Seattle, Washington,
and that is having a detrimental knock-on effect on the local economy.
In the south-east, a 1.8 per cent growth in employment this year has been
helped by a string of company relocations and start-ups, including
construction of a new BMW car plant in South Carolina.
The region also comes out well in a recent study by Cognetics Inc, an
economic consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, called 'Entrepreneurial
Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to Start and Grow a Company'.
Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas, four of the top five are in the
south-east: Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville,
Tennessee; and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Indianapolis, Indiana, is the
only one of the five to be outside the region.
Of the small metropolitan areas, the lead is held by Huntsville, Alabama;
followed by Honolulu, in the Hawaiian islands; Las Vegas, Nevada; Madison,
Wisconsin; and Tallahassee, Florida.
The study argues that America's entrepreneurial hubs are determined more by
world-class universities and good infrastructure than by cheap labour or low
tax rates.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (2): It is nice to feel
really wanted - Why Mercedes came to Alabama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALABAMA'S slogan is the 'state of surprises'. It certainly lived up to it in
late September when Mercedes-Benz, the German vehicle manufacturer,
announced it had chosen Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as the site of its first car
manufacturing plant outside Germany.
Although Alabama was known to be on Mercedes' shortlist of US states, it was
not thought to be among the front-runners. So how was Alabama selected?
When Mercedes announced last April that it planned to build a Dollars 300m
plant in the US to produce a new four-wheel drive sports utility vehicle, it
set up a site selection team - advised by Fluor Daniels, a California-based
engineering and construction firm - and was inundated with offers from more
than 30 states.
Members of the team first made incognito investigations of the various
states and their offerings. 'We wanted to begin the process with a more
factual evaluation, leaving out all emotional or political aspects,' says Mr
Dieter Zetsche, a senior Mercedes official.
Criteria such as transport costs, quality of the workforce and proposals
from government agencies narrowed the field down to 150 sites in 30 states.
Further criteria, such as distance to nearby residential areas or existing
automotive operations, reduced the tally to 64 sites in 21 states.
That was followed by studies on infrastructure, education and availability
of the workforce, as well as productivity, which brought the number down to
11 states and 20 sites.
Further analysis of such factors as distance to suppliers, training
programmes and quality to life left Mercedes with six sites in six states:
Tennessee, Nebraska, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.
'At this point,' says Mr Zetsche, 'we visited the remaining sites
repeatedly, toured the universities and colleges, visited companies,
evaluated the business climate, intensified our investigation of the
workforce, elaborated differences in operating costs and investment costs,
and ended up with three final sites.' These were in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Alabama.
It is not surprising that all three short-listed sites, and five of the
final six, should be in the south-eastern US. It has become a Mecca for
foreign companies over the past two decades, thanks to its relatively cheap
but skilled and abundant labour force, anti-union tradition, affordable
housing, attractive life-style, good transport links with Europe - and
governments willing to throw money at companies to locate in their states.
The Carolinas, in particular, have become a haven for German companies, and
BMW, the luxury carmaker, is in the process of building its first US plant
in South Carolina.
Alabama has in the past lagged other south-east rivals in attracting
high-profile capital investments like this, partly because the state showed
less entrepreneurial drive and partly because of its old, lingering image as
a haven for boorish 'rednecks' and its history of racism and police
brutality in the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s.
It was disappointed when two of the biggest new vehicle industry projects of
the 1980s - Nissan's US plant and General Motors' new Saturn works - were
won by its northern neighbour, Tennessee.
The state was lucky in that Mercedes' search for a plant, which began in
April, coincided with the appointment of a new governor, Mr Jim Folsom, who
replaced Mr Guy Hunt after he was forced from office in a theft scandal.
Mr Folsom, anxious to prove himself, poured immense energy into the Mercedes
project, and made a key appointment in putting Mr Billy Joe Camp, a state
government veteran, at the head of the state development office and in
charge of negotiations with Mercedes.
Mercedes restricted the state teams it was negotiating with to two people,
which threw a lot of pressure on Mr Camp and a colleague. The two spent long
hours refining the state's offer of incentives - right down to details of
how many four-wheel drive vehicles were in the Alabama government fleet, and
how many it could therefore be expected to buy from the Mercedes plant.
The states did not know precisely what the others were offering. Mercedes
was anxious not to conduct a bidding war between them. Mr Andreas Renschler,
who heads the sports utility project, says the company wanted to see what
each state believed it could bring to the partnership.
Alabama ended up offering a very generous package of incentives, totalling
Dollars 253m, including Dollars 17.4m to buy the plant site for Mercedes and
develop it, Dollars 42.6m for building construction and Dollars 30m for a
training centre. It will also pay Dollars 60m to train Mercedes workers and
Dollars 77m to develop the related infrastructure, such as roads and water
lines.
On top of all that, Mercedes qualifies for tax breaks related to its profits
and head count. These could total up to Dollars 9.2m a year for up to 25
years.
Unsuccessful states have grumbled that Alabama paid over the odds, but
Mercedes insists that the offerings from rival states were essentially the
same and these were not the most important factor in its decision.
Mr Renschler says that its US plant commitment is so important for Mercedes
that 'it is not a question of incentives. They are always a short-term
thing. We want to build cars here for the next 20 years.'
So what tipped the deal Alabama's way? The University of Alabama at
Tuscaloosa, which will play a big role in worker training, could have been
significant. The vehicle industry in neighbouring Tennessee was also a
factor.
The quality of the local infrastructure played a role, though Mercedes has
yet to decide whether it will export through the ports of Mobile (Alabama),
Jacksonville (Florida) or Charleston (South Carolina). The local quality of
life is also pleasant. Tuscaloosa is a small, rather sleepy city, while
Birmingham, 50 miles away, offers big city attractions and shopping malls.
Still, the other sites on the Mercedes shortlist had all these attractions
as well, and arguably better infrastructure links. In the end, what may have
swung it for Alabama was a 'gut feeling' on the part of Mercedes team that
this was the right location.
That, in turn, seems to have stemmed in part from the sheer zeal with which
Alabama pursued Mercedes. It is nice to feel really wanted, in a state so
desperate for a big project that you will be treated like royalty - as
befits the Mercedes image.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (1): Beat of the
heartlands - For those European and Japanese companies which want to
establish a global presence, North America still beckons. The lion's share
of recent investment has gone to the south-eastern US and the Rocky Mountain
region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
First: BMW. Now: Mercedes-Benz. Over the past 15 months each of these luxury
car manufacturers has decided to locate its first manufacturing plant
outside Germany in the US - underscoring the continued importance of North
America as a centre for European and Japanese companies aspiring to a global
presence.
From April, when Mercedes announced its intention to come to North America,
states across the US have become involved in a six-month tug of war to get
the company to choose them as the site of its plant.
In September, Alabama emerged as the surprise winner of the contest - a
choice which says much about the factors that companies weigh up when
deciding precisely where in North America they need to locate.
Alabama is in the south-eastern US, as are five of the six states which
appeared on Mercedes' shortlist. This region has attracted particularly
strong European investment - especially from Germany. So strong is the
German presence in North and South Carolina that parts of the main highway
through the region, Interstate 85, have been dubbed the 'autobahn'.
BMW, for its part, decided last year to site its US plant in South Carolina
 -one of the states on the Mercedes shortlist.
European and American companies like the region because it has low labour
costs compared with the traditional manufacturing 'rustbelt' states of the
north; a strong tradition of hostility to unions; a low cost of living; easy
access to ports for the export market; a large labour pool and good
universities; and state governments willing to lure companies with huge
incentives for site purchase and worker training. Alabama's package for
Mercedes is valued at over Dollars 250m.
However, the south-east is far from being the only US region profiting from
corporate location decisions. For example, the Rocky Mountain region has
become the fastest-growing area of America, apparently attracting jobs and
people from California, which is suffering from a severe recession, a
deteriorating quality of life and heavy state regulation of industry.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, points out
that, in terms of growth, 'many states in the heartland of America are now
performing significantly better than they did during the early 1980s, while
states in the north-east as well as California are underperforming'.
Foreign direct investment in the US grew remarkably in the 1980s. This was
partly through the start-up of greenfield plants, notably from Japanese car
manufacturers, but much more so through the takeover of existing US
companies. Direct foreign investment grew from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to
Dollars 403.7bn in 1990.
Since then, however, foreign spending on acquiring or establishing US
businesses has fallen sharply. In 1992 it totalled Dollars 13.5bn, down 47
per cent on the previous year and the fourth consecutive year of decline. It
was the lowest total since the Dollars 8.09bn recorded in 1983.
When disinvestment by foreign companies is added in, foreigners took out
Dollars 3.9bn of direct investment more than they put into the US in 1992 -
the first such outflow in decades.
Several factors appear to lie behind this. First, global recession
restrained investors' ability to pump capital into new foreign ventures
around the world - not just in the US.
The Commerce Department also speculates that investment funds may have been
diverted from the US by increased economic integration in the European
Community and the new business opportunities opening up in eastern Europe.
Other factors may have been rapid economic growth in parts of south-east
Asia and an improved investment climate in parts of Latin America.
And while the US seems this year to be once more in the throes of a takeover
boom, after four years of quiet, foreign companies are not yet particularly
prominent in this wave.
That is because many of the new bids involve industries which are either
distinctly domestic in nature, such as health care or regional banking, or
have limits on foreign participation. US regulations limit foreign companies
to owning 20 per cent of most large companies in telecommunications - a
sector at the start of a dramatic wave of consolidation.
However, foreign investment may also have been discouraged by a feeling that
the US has become less welcoming in recent years. For example, considerable
anti-foreign sentiment was stirred up during the takeover wave of the 1980s,
when jingoistic Americans complained that Japanese and European companies
were acquiring some of the nation's 'crown jewels'.
The edginess has been compounded by the ambiguous attitude towards foreign
investment of the Clinton administration. Mr Ian Martin, a leading executive
at the British food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan, called last summer
for a 'official US assurance that all members of the business community,
foreign and domestic, will have access to the so-called level playing field
 -that they can count on even-handed enforcement of laws pertaining to basic
business operation, investment and taxation'.
The foreign community has been particularly concerned by Mr Clinton's
approach to the long-running unitary taxation court case which pits
Britain's Barclays Bank against the state of California.
This involves California's policy of taxing subsidiaries of foreign-based
multinationals on a proportion of the worldwide income of the parent company
and affiliates. For years, the federal government said California's unusual
approach was unconstitutional and inconsistent with federal tax policy, but
during last year's presidential election campaign Mr Clinton pledged to take
the state's side.
Last month, California made it far easier for him to do that, without
abandoning the government's long-held position, when it passed a law which
addressed most of the foreign companies' complaints.
Nevertheless, Mr Clinton has now raised hackles by urging the Supreme Court
to deny an appeal from Barclays that challenges the original judgment made
against it by a California court. The White House argues that the recent
change in Californian law makes a hearing unnecessary.
However, as much as Dollars 900m in back taxes and interest is at stake for
California in this case and similar ones filed by other foreign companies.
Mr Clinton also provoked foreign corporate concern during the election
campaign with proposals to raise Dollars 45bn from multinationals in
additional taxes.
Still, tax experts reckon that the budget package finally approved by
Congress in August means the total will be only Dollars 800m, about half of
which will come from stricter enforcement of transfer pricing rules and half
from tightening of rules covering so-called 'earnings stripping', limiting
tax deductions for interest payments to a foreign party.
Despite these niggles, the US market is likely to re-emerge as extremely
attractive for foreign investment in the second half of this decade as the
global economy recovers.
Mercedes and BMW, for example, could have sited their plants anywhere in the
world. They chose the US for its combination of reasonable labour costs
(some 30 per cent below Germany), skilled labour force, and the largest and
most competitive vehicle market in the globe.
The potential will be even larger if the proposed North American Free Trade
Agreement, setting up a free trade area between the US, Canada and Mexico,
comes into being, creating a market of some 365m consumers.
However, the Nafta accord is in serious difficulties in the US Congress,
which will vote on the issue shortly, and is under fire from the influential
Mr Ross Perot, the Texan who stood last year as an independent presidential
candidate and warns of a 'giant sucking sound' of American jobs heading for
Mexico.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC to provide funds for CIS
metal industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission officials said yesterday the EC would be providing funds
to help the non-ferrous metals industries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, including the aluminium industry, to make market studies and for
retraining, writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent. They said the
community still hoped to reach agreement with the CIS aluminium industry
before the end of November, when the present import restrictions end.
The European Aluminium Association said it was poised to assist the CIS in
refurbishing and updating its 14 aluminium smelters, especially with
environmental technology. Its quarterly report yesterday pointed out that
'the emission of hazardous substances is eight to 10 times higher than
European regulations allow and sooner rather than later the CIS will be
forced to tackle the question of the environment'.
The European industry was also ready to help stimulate consumption of
aluminium in the CIS. If consumption improved from 5kg to 10kg per head of
population - 'a realistic scenario if the conversion to a market-oriented
economy is successful' - private consumption would double to 3m tonnes a
year, 500,000 tonnes more than the total amount of CIS aluminium estimated
to have arrived in the EC in 1992.
Meanwhile, the US Aluminium Association said yesterday the US government had
responded well to its calls for help and 'seems to understand the urgency of
resolving this issue'. At the invitation of Russia, last week the US, the EC
and four other aluminium-producing countries met in Moscow for the first
multilateral talks about the issue. The countries will meet again in
Washington in December. Mr David Parker, president of the association, said:
'This is a situation that traditional market forces alone cannot correct.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Furrowed brows greet E German
land reform - A traumatic transition from socialist command structure to
market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL 1990, Rudolf Voss worked on the giant 3,000-hectare collective farm
that cut through five small villages near Teterow in the eastern German
state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Today, he is on a government-financed job
creation scheme, helping to renovate a dairy in Gross Wustenwalde, a hamlet
set deep in what was, before the second world war, one of Germany's most
fertile lands.
'I'll never be able to work the land around here again,' says 50-year-old Mr
Voss, who spent a quarter of a century on the collective farm. 'There's no
work here now that the big farms have been broken up.'
Local unemployment is widespread. Of the 720 people in the five villages who
used to work on the collective farm, a fifth are officially unemployed.
Others, like Mr Voss, are on temporary job creation schemes.
Further along the cobble-stoned road, no wider than a country lane, Wilhelm
Etringer, 65, helps his son harvest sugar beet by hand. 'Our 16 hectares
used to be part of the collective farm until 1990. We were allowed to take
it out and farm it ourselves,' he explains. 'Its all very well farming
outside the old system, but we have no money for machinery. I don't know for
how much longer we can make a living on this patch of land.'
In a nearby village, Mrs Brigitta Schroder, 48, can hardly contain her anger
at the European Community. 'We have 450 hectares,' she says. 'We have
already set aside 15 per cent of the land. Now we are told we have to set
aside another 15 per cent next year. And we will not receive compensation.'
She is just as critical of the Treuhand, the agency responsible for
privatising 1.1m hectares of former state farm land through a system of
leasing.
Many farmers have the right to lease land for 12 years from the agency,
followed by an option to buy. But Mrs Schroder complains: 'We got a contract
for only four years. It expires next year. This is not fair. Rich west
Germans, who had land before 1949, can come back and get leases for 12
years, and then they snap up the land. Its very dispiriting. The bureaucrats
in Brussels haven't a clue about what is happening here.'
These voices of discontent show how difficult the transition from a
socialist command structure to a market economy is for eastern German
agriculture, as for every other sector in the region. They illustrate the
complexities of introducing radical land reform simultaneously with
adjustment to EC regulations on production levels.
In late 1990, the German government passed reforms aimed at dissolving the
state farms. Anyone who had 100 hectares expropriated between 1945 and 1949,
when eastern Germany was under Soviet control, was allowed to reclaim the
property. And any farmer whose small plot had been forcibly integrated into
the collective farms was allowed take it out or even merge with other plot
owners to make farming economically viable.
Mr Otto Bammell, a senior official at the federal ministry of agriculture,
admits the re-privatisation of land has thrown up many unforeseen problems.
'Many people have got their 100 hectares back. But then they soon discover
they have a giant silo stuck in the middle of their land, or huge barns
which once belonged to the collective farm, or a corner of land which is
recorded in the land registry,' he says. 'There are now disputes about who
owns these buildings and who should remove them. It's a mess.'
Apart from property disputes, the government is faced with very high
unemployment in states such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg, where
entire communities depended for their livelihood on the state, or collective
farms.
'Under the old system, there were 850,000 people working on the land, or
about 14 people per 100 hectares. That's at least three times the level in
western Germany,' says Mr Bammell. Since 1990, about 200,000 people have
lost their jobs as a result of land reform, he estimates.
'The reforms have been successful to the extent that farming is now more
efficient. But in some villages about 60 per cent of the population has no
work. There is no industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern into which people can
move. Politically, and socially, it is extremely dangerous.'
To compound these social problems, the government is locked in a dispute
with the European Community over the amount of land farmers must set aside
in order to cut cereal production.
'When we started the reform of agriculture, we also had to reconcile levels
of production with EC regulations, which meant putting aside 15 per cent of
arable land,' explains Mr Bammell. 'This meant limiting crop production here
in eastern Germany to 3.6m hectares. This is the base area which would make
us eligible for EC price support.'
In the process, German officials have discovered that
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's farmers have planted 17 per cent above permitted
levels, and those in the states of Saxony and Thuringia have overshot by 10
per cent. In total, eastern Germany has exceeded the base area by 350,000
hectares. The result is that Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will be asked to set
aside a total of one-third of its land, without compensation, as the penalty
for over-production.
Mr Bammell says the farmers themselves are not to blame for over-stepping
the base area. 'The original statistics which were used to calculate the
limit we could farm were wrong. Under the former system, acreage was kept
low so that production would be high in order to given the impression that
higher yields could be obtained from lower acreage. It was ideological - to
show how efficient they were,' he says. 'There was a margin of error of
between 4 and 5 per cent in the statistics.'
The German government now believes its original calculations of 3.6m ha
failed to include 180,000 ha of land devoted to maize. In short, German
officials say they may be prepared to accept penalties for only half of the
350,000 ha overshoot.
'Germany would accept the penalty that next year, and in 1995, we will have
to set aside 17 per cent of the acreage in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - in
addition to the current 15 per cent,' says Mr Bammell. 'But we cannot ask
our farmers to put aside one-third of their land without payment. It would
be catastrophic. We have enough problems without adding to the upheaval in
east German agriculture.'
The dispute between Bonn and Brussels is confusing and often upsetting for
the small farmers in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. 'I am fed up with the
bureaucrats in Brussels,' said Mrs Schroder. 'We just want to get on with
our farming. We want things to get better. But everywhere we turn, there is
a problem.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Future seen for steel
mini-mills in developing countries
</HEADLINE>

   LOW-COST, high technology mini-mills for making hot-rolled coil
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the basis for all sheet steel products - could make big inroads in
developing countries, but are much less likely to be competitive in Europe
and Japan.
This is the main conclusion of a study by CRU International, the
London-based metals and mining consultancy, which has spent the past 10
months trying to answer one of the most important long-term questions for
the steel industry - and indirectly for its raw material suppliers.
The success of Nucor, the US company that is making hot-rolled coil at
mini-mills in Indiana and Arkansas, has prompted integrated steel producers
elsewhere to question whether their large, labour-intensive plants can
survive against smaller, nimbler competitors.
New technology - in particular the development of continuous thin slab
casting as used at Nucor - has increased the pressure on integrated
producers.
But the CRU report vindicates the strategy of European producers such as
British Steel, which believes its best long-term strategy for flat products
is to be a low-cost integrated producer.
Mini-mills use a combination of scrap or direct-reduced iron - produced by
reducing iron ores to metallic iron without the normal coke-making step - as
raw materials. These are then turned into liquid steel in an electric arc
furnace.
But CRU says the high cost of energy and scrap reduce the potential
competitiveness of the mini-mill in Western Europe and Japan. Scrap costs in
western Europe are 5-10 per cent higher than in the US, while energy costs
are 50-60 per cent higher.
In addition, it says, structural overcapacity and political considerations
in these markets will slow the penetration of mini-mills significantly, so
that their share of the hot-rolled market will reach only 6.4 per cent by
2005 from less than 1 per cent today.
In contrast, the mini-mills' biggest opportunity for an increase in
production share is expected to be in the developing regions of Asia, the
Middle East and Latin America. The study says the new thin-slab mini-mills
are ideal for small, dispersed markets because of their smaller scale and
lower capital cost.
The study forecasts mini-mills will have increased their share of Asian
(excluding Japanese and Chinese) and Latin American markets from 9.7 per
cent to 29.7 per cent by 2005.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mystery disease hits Ecuadorian
shrimps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR'S SHRIMP exports have been severely reduced this year because a
mysterious disease has affected production. About 15,000 hectares of
cultivation pools have already been hit by the unexplained death of shrimp
larvae. Losses so far are estimated at Dollars 50m.
According to Mr Walter Valarezo, president of the Federation of Shrimp
Producers, the disease may be due to an imbalance of chemical or organic
substances in the pools. He said the quality of exported shrimp had not been
affected as the disease only attacks the larval stage.
The coastal area of Taura has been hit hardest, with several shrimp farms
having to close and about 7,000 tonnes of shrimp lost. As a result, the
export volume has dropped by 10 per cent. Fearing the spread of the disease,
the government has pledged support for scientific research efforts.
For some time, industry analysts have been urging new investment in
disease-control and studies to optimise pool sizes. But state funds for
research and development have recently been cut and credits for the private
sector have been scarce.
This latest crisis in Ecuador's shrimp industry, which boasts 120,000 ha of
cultivation and generated Dollars 526m in sales last year, comes on top of a
series of problems that pushed up costs and made Ecuadorian shrimp less
competitive in the world market.
Energy costs to operate the water basins' pumps have risen considerably,
while shipping costs from Ecuador remained above the regional average. As a
result, Ecuador's productivity per hectare is less than half that of its
Asian competitors.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia and EC agree outlines of
solution to aluminium export row
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS agreed with the European Commission the outline of a solution to
the row over Russian aluminium exports, although details of the agreement's
thorniest component, a ceiling for Russian exports, are yet to be decided.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, said after his return from talks in Brussels that the two sides
had agreed a limit on Russian exports, which, once exceeded, would trigger
consultations on how to proceed further.
But he said that Russia wanted a relatively high ceiling to 'reflect the
dynamic of Russian exports' and was opposed to any unilateral decision to
impose sanctions on the part of the commission, the European Community's
executive body, which temporarily restricted Russian aluminium imports in a
'safeguard' action last August. That action was temporary, to be extended or
discontinued until an EC ministerial meeting next month.
Russia is believed to have asked for an annual quota of 340,000 tonnes,
which would correspond to an almost unhindered level of licensed Russian
exports of aluminium destined for end users. Russia estimates another
150,000 tonnes leaves the country each year through other former Soviet
republics in illegal exports. The two sides hope to curb this with a new
system of double checking that they have already agreed to introduce.
Russian officials say the EC has already agreed not to challenge a further
182,000 tonnes destined for further processing at metallurgical plants
within the EC.
The talks about aluminium are being tied to wider trade negotiations for a
partnership agreement which Russia and the European Community hope to sign
next year.
Russia refused to initial a draft accord this summer on the grounds that its
terms sought to benefit EC producers and services in areas where it had a
competitive advantage over Russia while 'discriminating' against Russian
goods which could compete on EC markets.

Precious metals moved up again in steady business with the London GOLD price
recovering Tuesday's Dollars 4.50 fall to move back above the Dollars
370-a-troy-ounce level. The move, which followed the expiry of options
positions, was helped by a higher than expected 0.7 per cent rise in US
September durable goods orders. Silver also bounced, closing at Dollars 4.46
1/2 an ounce, up 10 cents. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices
recovered from early eight-year lows. Dealers noted, however, that though
the market was reasonably well supported on dips, buyers were reluctant to
chase the market higher, suggesting that a move down to the Dollars
1,050-a-tonne target for the three months delivery contract could not be far
away. The three months price closed yesterday Dollars 1,073.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 1.25. COPPER prices also flirted with recent six-year lows, although
news that the OK Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea was unable to ship
concentrates deterred serious selling interest. By the close the three
months position had recovered to Dollars 1,622.50 a tonne, up Dollars 3 on
the day.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for wool at rising prices built up further at Australian sales in
Newcastle, Geelong and Freemantle this week. There were full clearances,
with only between 1 per cent and 2 per cent passed in. The AWC market
indicator yesterday rose 17 cents to a seasonal peak of 485 cents a kg, a
level last recorded early in February when the market was falling towards
its April low point. It is now widely accepted that the market is past its
worst in the recession and that the stockpile itself may yet be liquidated
painlessly. In consuming markets business is better but buyers are reluctant
to follow the rise.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oversupply makes forest
thinning uneconomic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK DEMAND, oversupply and falling prices for pulpwood and other
small-sized wood have made forest thinning operations uneconomic in many
areas of Europe, with damaging social and environmental consequences,
according to two United Nations agencies.
In a joint statement, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation and
the Economic Commission for Europe, which has its headquarters in Geneva,
warn that in many countries there is a serious risk of a reduction in 'the
forest's stability, vitality, productivity and its contribution to the rural
economy and society'.
Paradoxically, the statement puts the blame for this situation largely on a
supposedly environment-friendly development, the big increase in the
recycling of used paper in Europe. The two organisations call for the
development of new outlets for small-sized wood, including its use as an
energy source, and the possible use of waste paper as fuel to free up the
paper market for pulpwood.
Reporting on market developments for forest products in 1993 and prospects
for 1994, the ECE notes that prices for pulp are at their lowest level for
many years and that many mills are running well below capacity. Apart from
more use of waste paper, this reflects overcapacity in the pulp sector and
production of higher grades leading to a higher proportion of coatings and
fillers, the ECE says.
At the same time, pulpwood is being imported into the European market,
mainly by Finland and Sweden. The report says markets for pulpwood are
increasingly being internationalised as large importers draw supplies from a
wide range of sources which compete against each other.
More generally, the ECE report shows that European markets for forest
products have remained marked by weak demand and strong competition on
increasingly global markets. In North America markets were stronger and
prices rose. For countries moving to market economy systems, 1993 saw steep
drops in demand for forest products combined with supply bottlenecks. The
outlook for eastern Europe remains sombre.
The ECE says almost no quantitative information is available for Russia 'due
to the complete breakdown of the state information system'. However, the
report expects Russian sawn softwood exports to fall by 25 per cent in 1993
and then to remain constant at around 5m cubic metres due to supply
constraints.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European prices tumble on heavy futures
selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond prices tumbled in hectic afternoon trading, following heavy
selling in the futures pits.
Traders reported large sell orders from US hedge funds, some of whom were
seen not only to liquidate their long positions but also to open short
positions in many European markets. This caused futures prices to breach key
technical support levels, triggering stop-loss selling. Weakness in the US
Treasuries market put further pressure on prices.
AFTER successfully absorbing a record bond auction, the UK gilt market fell
more than a point in sympathy with other European markets.
The auction of Pounds 3.5bn 6 per cent gilts due 1999 was well received.
According to Mr Ifty Islam, economist with Merrill Lynch, the bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.56 times on such a large issue indicated good overseas buying, in
addition to solid domestic demand.
The tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the average
accepted yield - was short at only one basis point.
Prices edged higher after the auction announcement, but tumbled across the
board when the December long gilt future broke key support at 114 5/8 to
close at 113 29/32 .
BUNDS also slid sharply, though outperforming many of their European
counterparts on switching into Germany. However, sentiment was damped by
comments from the Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, that there was no
need at present for lower rates, and the larger-than-expected liquidity
drain at the central bank's latest repo allocation.
The December bund contract fell 0.36 point on the day to 99.78. Traders now
are eyeing key support at 99.65.
FRENCH bonds were rattled by worries that the French government's
privatisation programme could come under threat, casting gloom over the
outlook for public finances. Switching into bunds caused the French 10-year
yield spread over bunds to widen to 12 basis points from two on Tuesday -
its highest since late July.
ECU bond prices fell  5/8 point, but some traders said the market could
rally if the European Community takes up a proposal by French president
Francois Mitterrand to launch an Ecu100bn bond programme to finance public
infrastructure in order to stimulate the European economy. Mr Mitterrand
said he would make the proposal at this week's EC summit in Brussels.
Such a programme could reawaken interest in the market, which has languished
since the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty last year.
EUROPE'S higher-yielding markets were especially badly hit by the sell-off.
The Italian BTP futures contract on Liffe plunged 1.23 point to 116.33. In
Spain, the December bond contract fell 0.68 point to 113.00.
JAPANESE bonds were cheered by the successful auction of Y1,000bn 3.9 per
cent government bonds and by switching into bonds from stocks as the Nikkei
index fell below the important 20,000 level. The JGB contract rose 0.22
point to 114.20.
US TREASURY prices eased slightly at both ends of the maturity spectrum
yesterday after a stronger-than-expected durable goods orders report.
In late afternoon trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
1/4 at 103 13/16 , yielding 5.998 per cent. At the short end of the market,
the two-year note was down  5/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 3.974 per cent.
Prices weakened during the morning in response to the durable goods figures.
Although orders rose only 0.7 per cent in September, in line with
expectations, the headline number masked a big rise in non-transportation
orders.
Other factors contributing to the declines were comments from Mr Robert
McTeer, a senior Federal Reserve official, who warned that the central bank
would tighten interest rates at the first sign of revived inflation, and
nervousness ahead of today's third-quarter gross domestic product figures.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: UBS optimistic after
'impressive' third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, said it continued to
show an 'impressive performance' in the third quarter, and added that the
outlook for the full year was still encouraging. No figures were given.
The bank said that while the third quarter was normally relatively quiet,
earnings at both group and parent company levels were only slightly lower
than the highs reported for the preceding quarter.
The bank earlier reported first-half consolidated net income of SFr1.29bn
(Dollars 871.6m), up 89 per cent.
Units outside Switzerland continued to contribute substantially in the third
quarter. In the first half, they accounted for 40 per cent of group net
income.
All divisions had a significant upturn in earnings in the nine months.
The improvement in trading income was 'particularly striking', while
credit-related business grew more slowly because of the recession.
General expenses grew moderately, personnel costs substantially, and
provisions for doubtful debts were still 'very high', especially in respect
of Swiss customers.
UBS said that the growth of cashflow in the second half was likely to be
lower than the very high rate reported in the first half, reflecting the
fact that cashflow in the second half of last year was significantly higher
than that in the first.
Parent company assets stood at SFr217.9bn at the end of September, 1 per
cent higher than at the end of June.
Securities holdings jumped 17 per cent to SFr23.4bn, while customer loans
were off 1 per cent to SFr138.8bn.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers take advantage of competitive
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL issuers took advantage of the traditional end-of-year rush by banks
to bolster their positions in the Eurobond league to raise cheap funding
yesterday.
Reports that a range of banks had made aggressive bids for a mandate to
arrange a Pounds 400m five-year Eurobond issue for the European Investment
Bank (EIB) indicated that this trend was likely to continue.
As a result of the increased competition, the EIB is likely to be able to
price its bonds to yield within five basis points over the when-issued UK
government bond due 1999, the new five-year benchmark in the sterling bond
market. The offering is expected to be launched today.
The Republic of Finland achieved a spread of 15 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) when it raised SFr300m through an offering of
10-year bonds. The spread was taken as further evidence that Finland's
standing with international investors was continuing to improve.
However, the offering itself, via Credit Suisse, was thought to be
aggressively priced relative to other 10-year deals in the secondary market.
One syndicate manager noted that the yield on the bonds was lower than the
yields on outstanding bonds issued by triple-A rated borrowers.
The bonds, which had an issue price of 102.75, were trading at less 2 3/8
per cent in the late afternoon, just outside fees.
The low interest rate environment in Switzerland and the Swiss franc's
strength against the D-Mark are expected to attract more issuers to the
Swiss bond market. SBC is likely to launch a SFr100m deal for a high-quality
European borrower and an Austrian utility is expected to raise a similar
amount later in the week.
The European Coal and Steel Community made a rare appearance in the Eurobond
market, raising FFr900m through an offering of eight-year Eurobonds. The
scarcity value of the borrower and the fact that the bonds were largely
pre-placed enabled the borrower to achieve a low spread of 12 basis points
over the French government's 9 1/2 per cent OAT due 2001.
Joint lead CCF said that French investment funds involved in the eight-year
tax-free savings plans were strong buyers of the bonds, but that demand from
Hong Kong and Singapore was also notable. When the bonds were freed to
trade, the spread remained unchanged.
Elsewhere, Halifax Building Society tapped the current demand for
Ecu-denominated paper with its Ecu150m issue of five-year Eurobonds. The
proceeds of the issue were thought to have been swapped into floating-rate
sterling.
Some syndicate managers said the yield spread on the bonds - 10 basis points
over underlying French government bonds - should have been at least five
basis points wider.
They added that the small size of the issue might not appeal to investors
who preferred to buy liquid issues, in view of the Ecu bond market's
turbulent past.
However, lead manager UBS said that the issue provided a fresh supply of
corporate paper in the Ecu bond market and that a substantial portion of the
bonds had been sold by the end of the day. The bonds were kept in syndicate
overnight and are expected to be freed to trade today.

TURKEY has invited two foreign banks into final negotiations on the sale of
the government-owned refineries and oil products distribution businesses, in
what will be the country's largest privatisation.
Bankers confirmed that Credit Suisse First Boston and Chase Manhattan have
been asked to present final proposals for the sale of Tupras, the state
refineries company, and Petrol Ofisi, the government-owned oil distribution
and retail concern.
Preparatory work could be completed within three months and a sale may take
place by mid-1994. The sale is expected to raise more than Dollars 1bn.
The Public Participation Administration, the government agency which handles
state sales to the public, earlier invited proposals from some 22 foreign
banks.
Only 19 banks responded to the offer, and a final group of eight were asked
to make verbal presentations in Ankara last month.
Chase is linked with its local subsidiary and Turkish brokers Global
Securities. If it is decided to use an international public offering, Chase
is expected to bring in bankers Kleinwort Benson of the UK and Salomon Bros
of the US.
CSFB has joined with Garanti Bankasi, a local family-owned bank, and Garanti
Securities, its broking arm.
The contract is to advise as well as implement the sale of both companies,
either separately or as integrated units. The sale would involve finding a
strategic buyer from within the industry or a local or global public
offering, or a combination of all three.

<TEXT>
THE DECLINE in base metals prices and inventory write-downs pushed Cominco,
the Canadian metals group, into losses for the third quarter and first nine
months of 1993.
The quarter's loss was CDollars 70.2m (USDollars 53.1m), or 89 cents a
share, against profit of CDollars 51.8m, or 64 cents, a year earlier on
sales down to CDollars 213m from CDollars 357m. The sales decline partly
reflected a reduced interest in Cominco Fertilisers. In addition the 1992
figures included a CDollars 39.1m special gain.
In the nine months, the loss was CDollars 123.3m, or CDollars 1.58, against
profit of CDollars 65m, or 79 cents, on revenues of CDollars 730m, compared
with CDollars 1.1bn.
Cominco said technical changes reduced zinc concentrate output at the Red
Dog mine in Alaska but mill throughput and recovery rates will soon improve.
Mr Patrick Mars, analyst with Bunting Warburg, Toronto, says some recovery
is expected in lead and zinc prices next year following production cuts in
Canada and elsewhere and in view of potential smelter shutdowns.
TransCanada PipeLines earned CDollars 87.8m, or 40 cents a share, in the
third quarter, up from CDollars 83.9m, or 39 cents a share, on revenues of
CDollars 1bn, against CDollars 853m.
Nine months' profit was CDollars 267m, or CDollars 1.22, up from CDollars
244.4m, or CDollars 1.17, on revenues of CDollars 3.1bn, against CDollars
2.6bn.

INTRACOM, the Greek telecoms equipment manufacturer in which Ericsson of
Sweden holds a minority stake, lifted after-tax profits for the first half
of 1993 to Dr6.7bn (Dollars 27.9m), from Dr3.5bn last year.
Turnover rose from Dr13.12bn to Dr30.95bn over the same period. The results
were consolidated to include the company's subsidiaries in software
production, electronic games and construction.
The company said completion of contracts for OTE, the Greek state
telecommunications company, together with improved sales for its electronic
lottery games, contributed to the sharp rise in earnings.
Intracom forecasts that earnings this year will be Dr12bn on turnover of
Dr70bn. Exports are projected at Dr8bn, led by sales of specialised software
packages.
The company is involved in a Dr40bn project, partly financed by the European
Community, to upgrade switching systems and transmission networks for the
Athens urban telephone network.
Intracom is expanding its operations in the former Soviet Union, where it
has joint ventures for electronic lottery games with Russia and Ukraine. It
has signed an Dollars 1.5m agreement to provide new switching systems for 12
cities in Tadjikistan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's largest private company, reported net
profits of 2.38bn new pesos (Dollars 765m) in the third quarter, a 15.3 per
cent increase in real terms over the same period last year.
Telmex benefited from a strong gain in local and long distance telephone
traffic in the third quarter, despite Mexico's sluggish economic growth.
Local revenues rose in real terms by 12.1 per cent compared with the third
quarter last year, long distance revenues by 9.3 per cent, and international
revenues by 5.1 per cent.
The monopoly telephone company installed 194,000 new lines in the quarter,
bringing the total in service to 7,276,528. New line installation is running
slightly ahead of the 12 per cent growth required under the government
concession.
Operating profits rose by a more modest 3.5 per cent in the quarter after a
37.8 per cent advance in operating and maintenance expenses. The increase in
costs pushed margins down to 42.8 per cent from 45.6 per cent in the third
quarter last year, according to Baring Securities.
Telmex said costs rose largely because of its programme of renovating
outside cables, replacing obsolete equipment and substituting analog with
digital lines. It said there were additional third-quarter costs from
training its workforce.
Telcel, the cellular subsidiary, which faces tougher competition after Bell
Atlantic took a stake in the rival company Iusacell, increased subscribers
to 193,851.
This was just 2,547 more subscribers than in the second quarter, suggesting
that the phenomenal growth of the company in past three years is coming to
an end.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Complex call for Dutch telecoms
 -The tough task presented by the KPN sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH tens of millions of 'customer contacts' per day, Koninklijke PTT
Nederland (KPN), the Dutch telecommunications and postal company, ought to
be the quintessential household name, auguring well for its partial
privatisation early next year.
The flotation is the biggest in the history of the Amsterdam bourse, and is
a formidable marketing challenge for all banks, brokers and advisers
involved.
The timing of KPN's initial flotation, however, gives it a lead over its
larger European rivals - like Deutsche Telekom (DT) - in the competition for
investors' funds. DT is likely to be two years behind.
But the inclusion of the Dutch postal services in the flotation sets KPN
apart from the string of privatisations awaiting the European
telecommunications sector.
International investors will have to be convinced that, contrary to the
situation in most other countries, the Netherlands' postal operations are
profitable and achieving roughly the same return on investment as KPN's
telecommunications side.
At home, marketing the shares will also be far from simple. Though every
potential Dutch investor is almost by definition a KPN customer, he or she
may not immediately recognise the company's name. It is KPN's two main
operating subsidiaries - PTT Post and PTT Telecom - which are household
names. KPN itself is a holding company, the name of which commands little
recognition.
A first tranche of shares in KPN, representing up to 30 per cent of the
company's 40m shares, is scheduled to be floated in the first six months of
1994. Estimates for the total value of KPN vary widely from Fl 16bn (Dollars
8.6bn) to as much as Fl 28bn, making the first tranche worth at least Fl
5bn. Additional tranches are expected to reduce the state's stake to around
one third later in the 1990s.
Oyens &amp; Van Eeghen, an Amsterdam-based subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais,
estimates that the shares of Fl 100 nominal will be floated at Fl 425 each,
valuing the company as a whole at Fl 17bn. It also believes KPN will carry
out a 10-for-one share split before the flotation to boost the marketability
of the shares.
In London, Robert Fleming Securities puts the probable range at between Fl
425 and Fl 600 per share and says the shares would be particularly
attractive towards the bottom end of this range.
Definitive forecasts are complicated by the fact that KPN has yet to comment
on its future dividend policy. As a utility stock, KPN is likely to be
regarded as an investment for income rather than for capital growth.
The Dutch government is setting the machinery in place for the
privatisation. Earlier this month it chose ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank, as
global co-ordinator for the share flotation, with ING and Rabobank as
co-lead managers of the syndicate in the Netherlands. The names of banks
leading foreign syndicates are expected to be disclosed later this autumn.
In the summer, the government made clear what kind of domestic competition
PTT Telecom can expect to face in its home market later this decade.
Starting in 1995, the country's railway, cable television operators and
electrical utilities will be encouraged to join forces and lease their lines
and cables to business customers. In turn, these corporate customers will be
able to use these lines for data communication and private networks between
their offices. In 1998, these lines can also be used for normal 'voice'
services.
Despite this looming increase in competition, KPN is expected to continue
its dominance of the Dutch telecom market.
Apart from the flotation price, one of the most intriguing unknowns is the
way the government will choose to pitch the shares to the public.
Unlike Britain, which under recent Conservative governments has consciously
tried to widen share ownership, the Netherlands has never sought to promote
share buying among the public. Nor does the country have a tradition of big
privatisations - because it never went in for mass nationalisation in the
first place.
In the late 1980s, during the sale of two tranches of shares in DSM, the
Dutch chemicals group, no special effort was made to attract private
investors.
This time, the sale of a company with far stronger roots in Dutch society
may spur the government into at least considering the use of special
promotions to sell the shares.
So far, there seems to be little support for the idea of offering
shareholders discounts on their telephone bills. But one idea is a scheme
under which small investors will pay reduced commission charges when buying
KPN shares.
This is the third in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state
telecommunications operators. Earlier articles appeared on October 11 and
26; the next appears on November 4.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Du Pont takes extra Dollars 920m
charge to cover overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT took a further Dollars 920m restructuring charge, lifting the total
announced in recent weeks to Dollars 1.3bn, as the US chemicals group
continued a wide-ranging overhaul of all its business units.
The latest charge was boosted by 'major printing and publishing write-offs,'
the company said. This covered write-offs of Dollars 448m of goodwill and
technology acquired through takeovers in the 1980s, as well as a reduction
of manufacturing capacity.
Du Pont recently announced the sale of its Remington Arms subsidiary and the
closure of nylon and other manufacturing plants in the US and Europe with
the loss of more than 5,600 jobs.
'As we stated previously, we expect to have all our businesses competitive
in 1994, and we are determined to take whatever steps are necessary to
achieve that goal,' said Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman.
He added that Du Pont's printing and publishing business had made
'noteworthy improvements' in the past year, but that conditions in the
industry had continued to deteriorate.
The Dollars 1.3bn charge, Dollars 375m of which had previously been
announced, pushed the company into a net loss of Dollars 680m for the third
quarter.
The loss would have topped Dollars 1bn, had it not been for a Dollars 265m
one-off gain after tax resulting from the changes in petroleum revenue tax
in the UK.
Du Pont's earnings were under pressure even without the restructuring
charges: earnings per share would have been 51 cents, down from 56 cents in
the same period the year before. The effects of a coal strike on the
company's Consol Energy subsidiary had cost the equivalent of 7 cents a
share in earnings, Du Pont said.
Earnings in the chemicals operations fell by 36 per cent, to Dollars 46m, as
sales declined by 6 per cent, due mainly to the effects of a stronger
dollar.
The fibres business saw a 22 per cent drop in net income, to Dollars 109m,
due to 'lower results for textile specialities and nylon in Europe'.
Earnings from polymers dipped by 31 per cent, to Dollars 81m, on lower sales
due to the strong dollar.
But the petroleum division recorded a Dollars 33m rise in net income, to
Dollars 181m, due to higher gas prices and crude oil volumes.
Du Pont's shares fell Dollars 1/2 to close on Wall Street yesterday at
Dollars 46 1/2.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: 3M slides on strength of dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
3M, the Minnesota-based adhesives manufacturer, yesterday blamed the
strength of the dollar and weak economies in Europe and Japan for its
disappointing third-quarter results.
For the three months to September 30, its earnings slid 2.4 per cent to
Dollars 316m, or Dollars 1.47, from Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.48, a year
ago. Most analysts had expected earnings of Dollars 1.50 a share in the
latest quarter.
On Wall Street, shares in 3M eased Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 at the
close.
3M said the strength of the dollar reduced its worldwide sales by about 5
per cent and net income by about 8 cents a share.
'This was the most negative currency translation in eight years,' the
company said. 3M's third quarter sales fell 2 per cent to Dollars 3.48bn
from Dollars 3.55bn.
Mr LD DeSimone, chairman, said currency could have a significant impact on
fourth quarter earnings. Provided the economic and currency situations do
not deteriorate, 3M expects to at least match last year's fourth quarter
performance.
For the nine months, net income was Dollars 977m, or Dollars 4.49, on sales
of Dollars 10.54bn. This compares with earnings of Dollars 944m, or Dollars
4.31, on sales of Dollars 10.51bn in the same period of 1992. Last year's
earnings were depleted by 2 cents a share for accounting changes.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak in Dollars 68m
deficit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, which yesterday named Mr George Fisher, chief executive of
Motorola, as its new chairman, also reported a third-quarter net loss of
Dollars 68m and warned that it was no longer expecting record earnings in
1994.
The third-quarter loss, which worked through at 21 cents a share, came after
Dollars 387m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, of after-tax restructuring charges to
cover its previously announced plan to cut employment worldwide by 10,000
and the costs of closing a West German plant making components for its ink
jet printer business.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 1992 were Dollars 189m, or 58 cents a
share, after a restructuring charge of Dollars 141m, or 43 cents a share.
Sales from continuing operations were Dollars 4.08bn, down 4 per cent.
The company's Eastman Chemicals business, which is being spun off, is
treated as a discontinued business and reported net earnings of Dollars 60m,
down from Dollars 68m.
In a separate announcement, later in the day, the company also named Mr
Fisher as the replacement for Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman since 1990, who
was forced to step down in August because of Kodak's inability to produce
strong earnings growth, despite endless restructurings and special charges
over the past decade.
Mr Whitmore, who has stayed on as caretaker chairman, said yesterday that
the company looked for 'essentially level earnings from operations' for 1993
as a whole, and he blamed this on economic weakness in each of our major
world markets and the continuing negative impact of currency fluctuations.
He also announced that the company was no longer predicting record earnings
for 1994 and would offer no earnings guide for the period.
For the third quarter, Mr Whitmore said productivity gains in parts of
Kodak's imaging division and cost controls had helped produce earnings gains
at the operating level, despite lower revenues in both the imaging and
information segments.
There had been a significant improvement in cash flow, due to improved
management of receivables and inventories and reduced capital spending. The
company was well on its way to its target of generating Dollars 700m in cash
flow for the year.
The imaging business reported earnings of Dollars 202m, down 35 per cent, on
sales which dipped 5 per cent to Dollars 1.88. Excluding restructuring
charges, earnings from operations were up 2 per cent at Dollars 404m.
The information business posted a loss of Dollars 250m, up from Dollars
113m, while sales dipped 8 per cent to Dollars 904m. Excluding restructuring
charges, earnings were Dollars 28m, up from Dollars 10m.
For the nine months, Kodak made Dollars 839m, or Dollars 2.56 a share,
compared to Dollars 836m, or Dollars 2.57 a share, in 1992, excluding
restructuring charges.

ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest brewing group in the US, yesterday reported a
net loss for the third quarter of Dollars 75m after a one-time pre-tax
charge of Dollars 565m to cover a restructuring aimed at cutting costs and
reviving sales of its Budweiser and other beer brands.
News of the losses had little impact upon the company's share price because
it had warned investors and analysts about the charge a month ago.
Excluding the restructuring charge and an additional Dollars 33m deferred
tax revaluation charge, Anheuser-Busch's net income for the quarter would
have been Dollars 311.1m, down slightly from the Dollars 318m reported a
year earlier.
The company said beer sales rose 3.3 per cent in the quarter, and its share
of the brewing industry sales in the US climbed from 44.5 per cent to 45.1
per cent.
It also reported record earnings from its entertainment and theme parks
business.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Union Carbide held back in
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Carbide's profit recovery remained stalled in the third quarter as the
weak international economy and overcapacity continued to hold down demand
for its main chemical products.
The company, which three months ago said it was stepping up the pace of a
three-year old cost-cutting programme, recorded net income of Dollars 36m,
or 23 cents a share.
Although an improvement on the Dollars 20m, or 14 cents a share, in the same
period in 1992, the figure was down from Dollars 41m, or 14 cents a share,
in the second three months of this year.
Union Carbide also announced an organisational shake-up yesterday, scrapping
its four operating divisions and creating nine new business units which will
each report directly to Mr William Joyce, president and chief operating
officer.
'Fewer layers of management and staff consolidation will help us reduce
costs and speed up strategic and operations decision-making in our
businesses,' said Mr Robert Kennedy, chairman and chief executive.
Sales volumes had fallen 5 per cent in the third quarter compared with the
previous three months, said Mr Kennedy.
'Prices for our most cyclical products - polyester glycol, antifreeze glycol
and polyethylene - remain at historic low levels,' he added. Sales in the
quarter, at Dollars 1.13bn, were down from Dollars 1.24bn previously.
A Dollars 30m after-tax gain from the sale of the company's organo-silicon
business was wiped out by a Dollars 30m after-tax charge from the shutdown
of a manufacturing plant in Canada.
Akzo, the Dutch group, and AlliedSignal of the US have agreed to set up a
joint European carpet fibre venture, Reuters reports. Under the previously
announced deal the two companies will bring their European interests
together in a new company which will be majority owned and managed by
AlliedSignal.

BETHLEHEM Steel, the US's second largest producer, recorded its first

year's steel price rises took effect.
At the same time Mr Hank Barnette, chairman, indicated a continuation of the
recovery, pointing to a 'moderate recovery' in the economy and most of the
company's markets.
'Orders for light flat rolled products remain at moderately strong levels,'
he added.
Bethlehem recorded net income of Dollars 31m, or 23 cents a share, in the
third quarter, compared with a Dollars 58m loss the year before, on sales up
5 per cent to nearly Dollars 1.1bn. Operating costs fell 10 per cent, to

The latest figures are flattered by a one-off tax benefit of Dollars 25m.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sara Lee earnings increase 9%

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday reported a
9 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter net income to Dollars 155m,
excluding the impact of accounting changes.
Including accounting charges of Dollars 35m, or 76 cents a share, Sara Lee
earned Dollars 120m in the quarter, or 23 cents, compared with Dollars 142m,
or 27 cents, a year earlier.
Sales advanced 6 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.58bn.
Sara Lee, whose brand names include Hanes, L'eggs and Dim, said operating
profits from its personal products division rose 2 per cent to Dollars 140m
on sales up 5 per cent to Dollars 1.61bn. The group said markets were
depressed in Europe and hosiery profits declined in the US. Acquisitions
helped support operating results.
Operating profits on the household and personal care side climbed 38 per
cent to Dollars 29m, although sales rose only 5 per cent to Dollars 352m.
Results were swollen by the acquisitions of SmithKline Beecham's personal
care operations and two brands - Endust and Behold - from SC Johnson Wax.
The group said it also benefited from stronger sales of higher margin 'core
items'.
On the food side, operating profits from the packaged meats and bakery
division rose 21 per cent to Dollars 62m on sales up 13 per cent at Dollars
1.34bn. Excluding acquisitions, unit volume for packaged meats rose 3 per
cent in the quarter.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Loss of Dollars 217m for Ford in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVE in continental Europe's new car market sent Ford's European
automotive operations tumbling back into a substantial loss in the third
quarter of this year.
The Dollars 217m loss was better than the Dollars 479m deficit in the same
quarter of 1992, but marked a deterioration on the first half of this year.
European operations managed a Dollars 19m profit in this year's first
quarter. However, a Dollars 75m loss was chalked up in the second quarter as
Europe's total new car market continued to slide to its current state - 16
per cent below the comparable 1992 period.
Ford's European automotive losses for the first nine months of the year now
stand at Dollars 264m, an improvement on the Dollars 371m loss for the same
period last year.
But Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of parent Ford Motor
Company of the US, declined yesterday to give any clear pointers as to when
the European operations might return to profitability. He said the financial
results 'should improve when European economies strengthen'.
Positive factors were the success of the new Mondeo, previously announced
restructuring actions and continuing cost-reduction efforts, which mean Ford
is well-positioned to participate in the eventual recovery of the European
markets.
'With more than 300,000 Mondeo orders we are obviously encouraged that the
car has done so well during such difficult economic times,' said Mr Poling.
Jaguar Cars, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, lost Dollars 108m
during the quarter, including a Dollars 65m charge to restructure its
stamping operations. Jaguar is pulling out of Venture Pressings, a joint
venture set up with UK components group GKN to supply Jaguar's body
pressings.
Jaguar's operating loss excludes some Dollars 47m in interest and goodwill
amortisation related to Ford's purchase of Jaguar for Pounds 1.56bn. Its
third-quarter loss last year was Dollars 135m.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: A game of not-so-happy families
 -A dispute at a top Indian tyre manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Indian businessman has turned to the courts in a long-running
battle with his son for control of his flagship company.
Mr Raunaq Singh, who is 71, is fighting his eldest son, Mr Onkar Kanwar, for
control of Apollo Tyres, a top tyre manufacturer, founded by Mr Singh.
Mr Singh, company chairman, this week filed a suit in the Delhi High Court
to block a recent bid by the Apollo board to transfer some of hisexecutive
powers to Mr Kanwar, who is managing director.
The dispute at Apollo is one of a spate of family rows which have recently
erupted at family-owned Indian groups. Such arguments are not unusual since
families generally hold wealth in common, creating many opportunities for
squabbles between fathers and their sons and heirs.
However, the onset of economic liberalisation has added a sense of urgency
to these quarrels because increasing competition is forcing companies to
make difficult decisions rapidly.
Mr Singh has taken his fight into the open and hired a high-profile lawyer -
Mr P. Chidambaram, a former commerce minister - to plead his case. Mr Singh
said yesterday: 'I'm a self-made man. My son has been misbehaving. I have to
deal with it.'
Mr Kanwar has limited his public comments to conciliatory remarks. His staff
said he was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The dispute dates back to the mid-1980s when Mr Singh became increasingly
active in business organisations. He served as president for the Federation
of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
Day-to-day control of Apollo passed to Mr Kanwar, who turned a poorly
performing company into the biggest profit-earner in the Indian tyre
industry.
Under his de facto leadership sales grew from Rs1.46bn (Dollars 46m) in 1987
to Rs5.1bn in the year to March 1993, while net profits jumped from almost
nothing to R210m. Mr Singh was not unhappy with his eldest son's performance
but, with four other sons' futures to consider, he tried to reassert his
authority. The dispute became so bitter that managers and directors
representing institutional shareholders became increasingly involved in
trying to keep the peace between father and son.
The family jointly holds about 19 per cent of the equity; the rest is held
by outside shareholders.
The institutions have quietly sided with Mr Kanwar, whom they respect for
his business skill and his strategy of focusing on tyres instead of
diversifying into other industries. Mr Singh favours diversification - the
traditional strategy of Indian business families.
Mr Singh has gone to great lengths to try and turn opinion in his favour.
This summer, he accused Mr Kanwar of infringing the Companies Act and
engaging in questionable financial dealings including making a Rs5m loan to
Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of last year's Bombay
securities market scandal. Mr Kanwar denied the claims.
Matters came to a head after a board meeting on September 10.
Although the meeting began with Mr Singh in the chair and Mr Kanwar present,
both men agreed to withdraw when the discussion moved to dividing
responsibilities between father and son.
The directors agreed to vest formally day-to-day control of the company in
Mr Kanwar's hands, including powers over all Apollo's bank dealings. Mr
Singh was given charge of 'diversification'.
When he saw the minutes, Mr Singh said responsibility for 'diversification'
was a 'mockery' in a company which his son was committed to not
diversifying.
In his suit, Mr Singh calls on the court to scrap the decisions the board
took in his absence and postpone the next board meeting, due on Friday,
until the matter is resolved.

SUCCESSFUL bad debt management and gains in market share helped First
National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third largest bank, lift pre-tax
earnings by 19.4 per cent to R906.3m (Dollars 269m) in the year to September
from R759.2m 12 months ago.
Favourable adjustments from a reduction in the corporate tax rate helped
boost attributable income by 43.7 per cent to R688.1m from R478.9m. Ignoring
this, earnings rose by 17.1 per cent to 716 cents per share from 611 cents,
and the dividend was raised 17.5 per cent to 235 cents from 200 cents.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, forecast another difficult year ahead,
but said earnings per share should show real growth. He said the economy
looked to be at the bottom of the cycle and predicted lower interest margins
and lower bad debts.
Mr Swart said the past year had been more difficult than anticipated, with
the economy in worse shape than predicted, industry advances growing by 8
per cent against a projected 13 per cent, and inflation also down. He said
FNB's response had been to take market share with domestic advances growing
by 16 per cent, double the rate of growth in the market.
Overall advances grew by 22.4 per cent to R40.7bn (R33.2bn). Mr Swart said
most of the growth had come in home loans, where FNB's book grew by 33 per
cent, and in instalment credit where advances grew by 21 per cent.
The group also profited from its early warning system on the credit risk
side. As a result provisions for bad debts actually fell by 1 per cent to
R344m (R347m).
Banks continue to benefit from generous interest margins and FNB's net
interest income rose by 16.6 per cent to R2.28bn from R1.95bn. Other
operating income rose by 18.5 per cent to R1.54bn from R1.30bn. Other
operating expenditure rose by 19.7 per cent to R2.6bn from R2.1bn.

Hong Kong's Mass Transit group

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) is having its local
credit rating reviewed by Moody's Investors Service as a result of concerns
over Hong Kong's rapid economic and political integration with China.
The announcement comes at a sensitive time for MTRC, which plans to raise
substantial external funding for the HKDollars 33bn (USDollars 4.2bn) rail
link between Hong Kong island and Chek Lap Kok airport, assuming it can
secure approval from China.
Moody's comments on the potential down-grading of MTRC's Aa2 rating for Hong
Kong dollar-denominated debt made no reference to the financial position of
the company. They referred only to the impact of 'Hong Kong's accelerated
pace of integration into China' on financial and monetary trends in the
colony.
Mr Roger Moss, finance director of MTRC, said he believed the announcement
would have little impact on the corporation's ability to raise capital.
MTRC - which is owned by the Hong Kong Government - has just returned from a
US roadshow. Mr Moss said it was apparent that the group could get ready
access to low-cost financing outside, regardless of the rating for its local
debt.
Of greater concern is the implication of the current political talks between
Britain and China on Hong Kong's political future; worsening relations
between the two sides have been primarily responsible for the lengthy
postponement of approval for the MTRC's newest rail project.
However, an adverse decision by Moody's would be expected to have an impact
on the ability of other Hong Kong companies to access cheap funding in the
overseas capital markets.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tokai Bank cuts pre-tax profit
forecast to Y12bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOKAI Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, yesterday halved its pre-tax
profit forecast to Y12bn (Dollars 113.2m) for the first half to the end of
September, saying that an expected increase in banking profits would be
undermined by write-offs of non-performing loans.
Along with other Japanese banks, Tokai has been able to increase core
earnings as falling interest rates have created a favourable spread. It is
taking the opportunity to write off and make provision for losses arising
from lending during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s.
Mr Shuichi Midorikawa, assistant general manager, said the bank had seen
'large profits' from arbitrage trading in London.
However, he said that these would 'have little effect' on first-half
results, which would be more determined by the 'profitability of our loan
portfolio'.
At the end of March, Nagoya-based Tokai reported that its non-performing
loans were Y828bn, and that figure is expected to have increased over the
first half. Mr Midorikawa said the write-off figure for the first half had
not been finalised.
'We hope to do as much as possible,' he said. Regardless of the write-offs
and provisions, the bank expects that net income will be 4.5 per cent above
the previously forecast Y11bn.
In the first half last year, Tokai reported a pre-tax profit of Y28.4bn, and
a net profit of Y13.5bn on total income of Y972.9bn, which the bank expects
will fall to Y902bn for the period just ended.
Japanese banks are expected to face a difficult second half. They have
already absorbed many of the benefits of falling interest rates, but are
still confronted by an increase in problem loans and weak demand from
corporate customers, who are lowering their capital spending targets.

<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian metals producer, has filed
a shelf registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission for an issue of up to USDollars 400m in notes.
A company statement said yesterday that proceeds from the proposed raising,
through WMC's wholly-owned subsidiary, WMC Finance (USA), would be used for
working capital and to retire debt.
The statement coincided with a warning from Standard and Poor's, the US
ratings agency, that WMC's credit rating could be lowered if expansion plans
did not improve the efficiency of the company's nickel operations.
Standard and Poor's assigned a preliminary A rating to the shelf
registration, but said WMC's general ratings outlook was negative.
Goldman Sachs has been appointed lead manager to the issue, with Merrill
Lynch and Morgan Stanley as co-managers.
Suncorp, the Australian financial services group, has announced a 3 per cent
lift in pre-tax profit from ADollars 129m to ADollars 132m (USDollars 85m)
for the year to June. Total assets grew from ADollars 6.5bn to ADollars
7.3bn in the year.

DUN &amp; Bradstreet, the financial information services group which withdrew
from South Africa in 1986, said its business units would be allowed to
restart operations there, Reuter reports.
The company said that its decision was affected by a number of factors,
including the lifting of US sanctions against South Africa.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ford beats forecasts in third
term

FORD Motor yesterday underscored its expanding share of the recovering US
car market with third-quarter earnings of Dollars 463m, compared to a loss
of Dollars 272m in the same period of last year.
The US operations had their best third-quarter results since 1988, before
the onset of North American recession, but this was partly offset by losses
in Europe, which is in the throes of recession.
The company's earnings worked through at 79 cents a share, compared to a
loss of 66 cents, and were struck on sales and revenues which rose Dollars
1.2bn to Dollars 24.5bn.
The results, which were flattered by a change in US tax legislation worth
Dollars 140m, or 28 cents a share, were ahead of expectations and Ford
shares closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 60 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
However, analysts noted that the group's profitability was still modest,
given that its US plants were operating near capacity.
It remains less profitable than the much smaller Chrysler, which reported
third-quarter net income of Dollars 423m earlier this month. General Motors,
the largest of Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers, will report a large
loss this morning.
Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 333m, compared to a loss of
Dollars 260m a year ago, which the company attributed to improving industry
sales, increased market share and continuing cost reduction.
Ford's share of the US car and light truck market rose to 25.4 per cent in
the model year to the end of September, up 1.1 points from the 1992 year and
2.2 points from the 1991 year, thanks to strong-selling vehicles such as the
four-wheel drive Explorer and Taurus family car.
Profits were helped by a drop in rebates to encourage sales, which averaged
Dollars 865 a vehicle, Dollars 200 less than a year ago. Retail sales rose
18 per cent, while much less profitable fleet sales dipped 14 per cent.
Outside the US, automotive operations lost Dollars 261m, compared to a loss
of Dollars 314m a year ago, with Dollars 217m of losses in Europe more than
offsetting earnings elsewhere. Worldwide automotive operations made Dollars
72m, a Dollars 646m improvement on the year before.
The bottom line was buoyed by strong earnings from Ford's financial services
operation, which made Dollars 391m, up from Dollars 302m, thanks to
increased volume and reduced credit losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Charles Russell, head of the Visa International payments organisation for
nearly a decade, was dethroned yesterday after a quiet coup by some of the
world's biggest card issuers.
Mr Russell, 63, helped cement Visa's position as the world's biggest
payment-card brand name, taking the number of Visa cards around the world to
318m by the end of June. More than Dollars 500bn was billed on Visa cards in
the 12 months to June, compared with Dollars 4bn in 1984, when Mr Russell
took the top job.
But some of the biggest US banks had become impatient for new leadership at
the payment group.
'It's a big bureaucracy: they don't manage with an eye on the bottom line,'
said one Visa issuer. Another added that Mr Russell had said many times in
recent months he intended to retire, but had shown little sign of actually
doing so.
Mr Russell will be replaced as president and chief executive at the start of
next year by Mr Edmund Jensen, chief operating officer of Oregon-based US
Bancorp.
The appointment of an outsider brings new blood to the senior management,
one bank said.
The Visa board has agreed Mr Russell will stay with the company to work on
strategic issues until the company's annual general meeting next June.
Mr Russell's departure is the latest high-level change at the San
Francisco-based payment group, which is owned by more than 18,000 banks. In
August, Mr Carl Pascarella - a protege of Mr Russell - was brought in to
head the US card business in preference to Mr Robert Heller.
Visa denied that the decision over the timing of Mr Russell's retirement had
been taken out of his hands. 'Chuck has had an extremely good relationship
with the board,' the company said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sell-off launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH Government yesterday launched its second big privatisation,
announcing that investors could start reserving shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the
chemicals group from today. The sale of the government's 43 per cent stake
should take place within the next few weeks.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the successful
privatisation of Banque National de Paris earlier this month augured well
for the sale of Rhone-Poulenc. The public offer for BNP was more than five
times subscribed and the institutional tranche was more than 12 times
subscribed.
The Rhone-Poulenc issue, which is expected to raise FFr15bn-FFr16bn (Dollars
2.7bn-Dollars 2.9bn), is aimed at individual investors. Of the 79.3m shares
that the government will sell, 47.6m will go to a public share offering for
French and EC citizens and there will be a placement of 31.7m shares for
French and international institutional investors.
The public share offering will last for six trading days after the price is
set. Private investors subscribing to the public offer will be given
priority for up to 60 shares each. If they pay for their shares through the
conversion of Balladur bonds, a government bond issue launched in the
summer, they will have priority for a further 60 shares.
Analysts predicted a smooth sale of the Rhone-Poulenc stake. It is a much
smaller operation than BNP, which raised FFr34bn, and the chemicals group
has been partially privatised through a series of share placings, the most
recent of which was in January.
'It is unlikely to be as much as a giveaway as BNP,' said an analyst, 'But
it it will probably be attractively priced.'

CEA Industrie, the industrial arm of France's atomic energy commission,

an increase of 12 per cent over the same period in 1992.
The increase was achieved on sales of FFr19.33bn, an increase of just under
10 per cent on the first half of last year. Operating profits increased to
FFr986m from FFr401m over the two periods.
CEA Industrie is a holding group for businesses which have grown out of CEA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish Prime Minister, said yesterday there was an
urgent need to privatise Renault, the French automotive group which is to be
the dominant partner in a proposed merger with Volvo's car and truck
operations.
Mr Bildt, responding to mounting criticism in Sweden that the merger amounts
to a French state takeover of Volvo, noted there were no guarantees about
Renault's privatisation. But he did not doubt the intention of the French to
sell off Renault. He has no intention of intervening in the merger, which
his government supported.
The privatisation of Renault should proceed as quickly as possible, he said.
'Had privatisation not been contemplated, there would have been a reason to
question the merger. But the French government says that it intends to
privatise by the end of next year or at the start of 1995 and I do not doubt
their intentions.'
Volvo shareholders will vote on the merger at a special shareholders meeting
on November 9.
The Swedish company said yesterday it had reached agreement with the French
government which eases the pressure on it to reduce its shareholding in the
merged company to 20 per cent from 35 per cent in the event of a breakdown
of the merger agreement.
However, the French government will retain the right after privatisation to
use a golden share to vet any holding over 20 per cent of the votes in
Renault-Volvo, an issue which has been portrayed in Sweden as potentially
forcing Volvo to reduce its holding.
Most analysts expect the merger to be approved at the shareholders meeting.

<TEXT>
A FALL in demand and DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) provisions for job cuts slashed
profits in the MAN group's commercial vehicles offshoot by 87 per cent in
the year to end-June.
Net earnings, which fell to DM32m from DM225m, may improve in the current
year in spite of an expected further fall in turnover and a continuing
decline in domestic demand, Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chairman, said yesterday.
He refused to make specific forecasts, but pointed to an expected rise next
year of almost 9 per cent in west European demand, excluding Germany, and
rapid progress on job cuts and other cost-saving measures. Incoming orders
in the first quarter of the new year were 6 per cent higher than a year
earlier, and Mr Rupprecht said he expected new orders for the full 12 months
to reach DM6.5bn compared with DM6.26bn last time.
After shedding about 600 employees in the whole of last year, the company
reduced its German and Austrian workforce by 1,700 people in the first
quarter of the current financial year. A further 650 employees are scheduled
to leave by the end of December and 1,000 more will go in the second half.
In spite of poor trading conditions, the company claimed it managed to avoid
the worst of the recession last year.
While total west European registrations of trucks above six tonnes fell 23
per cent to 213,000 in the year to the end of June, only 8 per cent fewer
MAN trucks entered service.
Meanwhile, the brand's market share in this segment rose 6 percentage points
to 26 per cent, Mr Rupprecht said.
The company, which specialises in trucks in this weight range, said it
expected modest growth in this sector for the remainder of the decade.
After falling from a peak of 300,000 registrations in the calendar year 1989
to less than 200,000 in 1993, the total west European market is expected to
grow only 1 per cent in 1994. Growth outside Germany was almost outweighed
by an 8.6 per cent fall inside.

JR East
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock exchange's computer system was on the verge of collapse
yesterday as investors crowded to get aboard the partial flotation of East
Japan Railway (JR East). Officials suspended trading in the company's shares
after the stock surged to value the company at Y2,400bn (Dollars 22.6bn).
The unprecedented move caused embarrassment for the exchange and Japan's
financial officials. TSE officials said its computer system, installed two
years ago, had been on the verge of crashing due to the rush of orders for
JR East along with other stock trading orders.
The listing of half of the 4m shares of JR East last Tuesday was the biggest
offering of a semi-privatised company since the Y18,673.2bn float of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone in 1986.
JR East jumped 57.8 per cent from its initial offered price to Y600,000
after remaining bid-only all day Tuesday.
In order to attract a large number of retail investors, who tend to be
faithful long-term holders of stock rather than active traders, the
state-owned Japan National Railway Settlement, had aimed to keep the initial
offering price relatively low. After an auction of 400,000 shares in August,
at an average price of Y379,806, the remaining 1.4m shares were offered at
Y380,000.
Investors are worried by the stock exchange's computers inability yesterday
to handle trading of the stock. 'It's a highly unusual case, and it really
shouldn't have happened,' said Mr Keith Donaldson at brokers Salomon
Brothers in Tokyo. There were complaints from brokers that orders for other
shares had been affected.
The Tokyo stock exchange said it would accept orders for JR East 30 minutes
earlier than usual in the morning and afternoon sessions today, when JR East
trading would have to be done manually on the floor to avoid disruption of
settlement procedures.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Commerzbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK yesterday became the first German private sector bank to have
its long-term credit rating downgraded, reflecting the impact of the
European recession.
Moody's Investors Service blamed a deterioration in the bank's asset quality
for its cut in debt ratings of the bank, one of the three big German
'Grossbanken'.
The downgrading prompted a sharp response from Commerzbank, which said its
operating profits after provisions for bad and doubtful debt rose by a good
50 per cent in the first nine months of the year.
'Commerzbank today is a bank with strong earnings, a modern organisational
structure, and internationally oriented,' it said.
It said the downgrading was temporary, stressing that its rating remained
higher than for other private sector international banks and that its top
Prime-1 rating for commercial paper remained unchanged.
Moody's reduced the long-term rating for the bank's senior debt to Aa2 from
Aa1, saying that despite the bank's strong operating income Commerzbank's
ability to 'cover high provisions with sustainable core earnings has
deteriorated somewhat' and that its capitalisation was at the low end of its
peer group. The senior debt rating of its Luxembourg subsidiary was lowered
to Aa3 from Aa2. The downgrading affects some Dollars 3.9bn of long-term
debt.
'We believe Commerzbank probably has been a little less conservative than
its immediate peers and may be hit a little harder by the recession,' said
Mr Gunther Stur, a senior analyst at Moody's in New York. Long-term debt
from Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank, Germany's
other leading private-sector banks, is rated triple-A by both Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's.
Commerzbank said that despite an increase in provisions to cover domestic
bad and doubtful debts, the total outlay for provisions this year was likely
to be lower than in previous years. This was because there were unlikely to
be an increase loan loss reserves to cover country risks, the bank said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: RWE lifted by turnover growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RWE, Germany's largest energy company, managed to increase net profits by
DM1m to DM1.05bn (Dollars 655m) in the year ending June 3 after a 2.6 per
cent rise in net sales to DM53.1bn.
Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chairman, said the growth in sales was largely due to
the inclusion of east German companies, including petrol stations run by
DEA, the petroleum products division, in the consolidated accounts. Without
them turnover growth would have been restrained to 0.4 per cent. The
dividend will remain at DM12.
Turnover in RWE's energy division was 0.6 per cent down on the previous
year, caused by a cyclical decline of the group's electricity sales volume
by 3 per cent, but there was a rise of 4.7 per cent in gas sales. Mr Gieske
said increases in labour and personnel costs 'are increasingly creating
problems for the energy division'.
He said that it was time to consider a change in the price structures for
its electricity customers, who, he said, 'were paying 23 per cent less for
energy than eight years ago'. RWE had kept electricity prices stable since
1986 and had lowered them by about 5 per cent in 1990, the chairman added.
Sales of Rheinbraun, the brown coal division, increased to DM2.32bn from
DM1.69bn. But Mr Gieske explained that the turnover of 37.6 per cent
included east German fuel trading companies. Otherwise, Rheinbraun's
turnover would have increased by 7.4 per cent on the previous year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Toye, the maker of civil and military regalia, reported pre-tax losses down
from Pounds 891,216 to Pounds 247,313 for the six months to June 30.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 5.52m - including
Pounds 85,408 from discontinued operations - to Pounds 5.8m. Losses per
share were cut from 29.35p to 11p.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 85,255 to Pounds 68,871.
Mr Bryan Toye, chairman, said the results were beginning to reflect some of
the benefits of work undertaken during the past 12 months.
The company's performance in the second half should continue to improve, he
said, but would be limited by ongoing losses in the corporate clothing area,
shortage of hard currency in export markets and low demand for some of the
group's products.

Net revenue improved to Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 2.64m) for earnings of 5.35p

from the 'judicious taking' of scrip dividends which accounted for Pounds

A recommended final dividend of 3p brings the total to 5p (4.75p).

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Murray Split beats benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Split Capital Trust yesterday announced net assets ahead 45 per cent
to Pounds 24.1m over the 12 months to August 31: the FT-A All-Share Index,
the trust's benchmark, rose 40 per cent over the same period.
The trust's total return of 53.7 per cent compared with a total return of 46
per cent for the All-Share.
Net asset value per capital share jumped from 94.6p to 214.9p over the year.
Available revenue amounted to Pounds 823,000, down from Pounds 1.03m in the
previous 65 week period, leaving earnings per income share at 10.29p
(12.83p).
A proposed final dividend of 2.65p brings the total, as forecast, to 10.6p
(11.6p for 65 weeks), necessitating a transfer of Pounds 98,000 from
reserves. Directors intend to maintain the total in the current year.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Profitable Regent buys housebuilder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regent Corporation, formerly Nouvelle Group, yesterday reported profits of
Pounds 32,000 pre-tax for the six months to September 30 against losses of
Pounds 110,000 last time.
The company also announced the purchase of all the issued share capital of
Renaissance Properties, a newly formed Sussex-based housebuilder, which,
like Regent, specialises in lower cost housing on small developments. Its
sole asset is housing in the course of construction.
The Pounds 150,000 consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 1.5m new
ordinary 1p shares in Regent, valued at 10p each.
Regent reported turnover of Pounds 142,000 (nil) for the period. Earnings
per share were 0.6p (0.41p losses) and the directors intend to resume
dividend payments 'as soon as is reasonably possible.'
They also intend to broaden the base of the company, as appropriate, into
other specialised property or property-related activities.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ethical Holdings Pounds 50,822 in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethical Holdings, the Huntingdon-based pharmaceuticals group which is quoted
on the Nasdaq market in the US, reported a net profit of Pounds 50,822 for
the year to August 31, against a deficit of Pounds 76,342 last time.
The improvement was achieved on revenues up from Pounds 7.16m to Pounds
9.49m. At the operating level income totalled Pounds 1.17m compared with a
deficit of Pounds 430,196.
During the fourth quarter the company signed seven new contracts for its
products and completed a licensing agreement for a new transdermal product
commissioned by a US company.
In addition, two contracts for the licensing of Ethical's estradiol and
combination norethisterone/estradiol transdermal patches in previously
unlicensed territories were signed with a new partner.
Mr Geoffrey Guy, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company had
no immediate plans to float on the UK market, but was closely monitoring the
performance of shares of its competitors that had taken this step.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lower costs help BMSS to Pounds 207,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced distribution costs and administrative expenses, together with lower
interest charges, helped BMSS, the USM-quoted timber and builders' merchant,
achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 207,000 for the half year to July 31.
There were losses of Pounds 16,000 last time.
Sir Stephen Hastings, chairman, said trading conditions had remained
depressed in the period, especially repairs, maintenance and improvements,
the sector which accounted for the bulk of its business.
The decline in turnover, from Pounds 8.28m to Pounds 7.52m, was entirely
accounted for, he said, by a fall in low margin direct sales business.
Looking ahead, Sir Stephen said the long-awaited recovery in the
construction industry remained at best fragile and patchy. Sales volumes for
the second half would be little better than those achieved in the latter
part of 1992, he added.
Operating profits improved to Pounds 304,000 (Pounds 157,000) after lower
distribution costs of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.91m) and administrative
expenses of Pounds 498,000 (Pounds 2.16m). The pre-tax result was after net
interest payable of Pounds 97,000 (Pounds 173,000).
Earnings per share were 1.7p (0.1p losses) and the interim dividend is 1.5p
(nil).

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Securities Trust assets rise 5.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES Trust of Scotland, the international income investment trust,
reported a 5.6 per cent rise in net assets per share to 89.2p over the six
months to September 30.
The Martin Currie-managed trust maintained its interim dividend at 1.08p,
payable from earnings per share of 1.7p (1.53p). Last year's total of 3.25p
was not fully covered by earnings.
At the end of September the geographic split of the trust's portfolio was UK
(71 per cent), Europe (10 per cent), US (10 per cent), Far East (7 per cent)
and smaller markets (2 per cent). The trust has reduced its US weighting
over the last six months and increased its holding in Europe.
The first half net asset value performance lagged slightly behind that of
the FT-A All-Share Index and Mr Tim Hall, the manager, said this was due to
the trust's weighting in unfashionable, but high-yielding areas such as food
and brewing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday said it would restructure its
Beazer building business in the east coast of the US.
Hanson, which acquired Beazer in 1991, is splitting its east coast
operations into two units.
The first, to be called Spectrum Construction Group and headquartered at
Virginia Beach, will take over most of its construction and paving
activities. The companies consolidated into Spectrum have aggregate annual
revenues of Dollars 500m.
The second unit, Benchmark Materials Company, will take in all aggregate
operations including some asphalt paving 'where fully integrated with
aggregates.'
Benchmark - to be based in Raleigh, North Carolina - will have revenues of
Dollars 325m. It will supply about 50m tons of aggregates, 3m tons of
asphalt and related services to construction, railroad and agricultural
industries.
Mr John Wimberly, chairman and chief executive of Beazer USA, said the move
'will focus management and streamline Beazer's business on the East Coat. It
will also align our operations to better fit the markets they serve.'

BERTAM HOLDINGS, which has interests in oil palm and rubber plantations as
well as property development in Malasia, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds
284,000, down from Pounds 354,000, for the six months ended June 30.
The company said, however, that the results were not comparable following
the sale of 810 hectares to Bertam Properties (40 per cent held) and the
purchase of three Malaysian estates in late 1992.
Turnover expanded from Pounds 598,000 to Pounds 708,000. Interest income
rose from Pounds 138,000 to Pounds 257,000. Earnings worked through at 0.74p
(1.07p).
Crops and sale prices for both oil palm and rubber were similar to a year
ago.

GROWTH IN its healthcare operations helped Shiloh report profits before tax
more than doubled, from Pounds 201,000 to Pounds 490,000, for the half year
to October 2.
Sales rose 84 per cent to Pounds 13.4m.
The Lancashire-based group has expanded from its original textile spinning

Textiles had shown a 'modest improvement' he said and the initial signs of
recovery in the sector were apparent.
Packaging, on the other hand, was flat although some improvement was
expected in the second half.
The interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.875p), payable from earnings of 5.75p

Tony O'Reilly, advanced from IPounds 298,000 to IPounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.59m)

lower following the disposal of the Keep Trust motor division.
Turnover fell from IPounds 233.7m to IPounds 180.3m of which discontinued

of continuing activities, including associates' contributions, surged from
IPounds 1m to IPounds 3.36m.
Interest accounted for IPounds 2.62m (IPounds 3.19m). Losses per share
emerged at 0.34p (earnings 0.08p) after extraordinary costs of IPounds
646,000 relating to the Keep sale.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. At the period end net debt stood

Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPMENT Securities, formerly Clayform Properties, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses down by Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 2.6m for the six months to June
30.
Turnover was Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 35.7m), of which Pounds 12.1m (Pounds
26.5m) came from discontinued operations. Losses per share were reduced to
7.8p (35.1p).
Mr Michael Wigley, chairman, said the results reflec-ted the successful
continua-tion of the debt-reduction policy.
In June the company appointed Mr Martin Landau - a property entrepreneur -
to the board, and the following month raised Pounds 27.1m through a placing
and open offer.
To reflect the new phase in the group's affairs, Mr Wigley said, the company
then changed its name to Development Securities.
In addition to the placing, in March the company raised Pounds 1m through
the sale of its 77 per cent stake in Dunloe House, and in April Stead &amp;
Simpson was sold for a nominal sum, resulting in a further reduction of
Pounds 3m in group borrowings.
Since the period end some further disposals had been completed and
opportunities were being sought to improve the quality of the portfolio, Mr
Wigley said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Changes to dividend calculations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM TODAY, the London Share Service pages show gross dividend yields
calculated in a slightly different way.
The changes, which also affect the net dividend reported in each Monday
edition, bring the figures into line with those used for the FT-Actuaries
All-Share Index and other FT-SE Actuaries indices.
Previously, the individual company share price listings on Mondays showed
the total of each company's dividends for the last full financial year. This
meant that the figures were only updated once a year, and did not reflect
the impact of dividend changes.
The new method is that the figure is updated after every dividend
announcement, whether interim or final. For most companies, this means that
the figure will be updated twice a year.
At the six month stage, therefore, the total gross dividend per share will
typically be the latest net interim dividend plus the net final dividend
paid in the second half of the company's previous financial accounting year,
plus the tax credit which currently stands at 20 per cent.
The same procedure, suitably modified, will apply to those few companies
that pay dividends more than twice a year.
Dividends declared by a company up to 5pm each weekday will be reflected in
its shares' gross dividend yield in the following day's tables. Dividends
declared later in the day are held over for 24 hours.
Where companies make explicit forecasts of end-year dividends, the yield
figures reported are modified to reflect these projections.
Details of the rules of thumb used in handling dividend announcements appear
in the accompanying table.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Guardian Group in talks to raise further
finance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Group, the USM-quoted building and environmental services company
formerly known as Associated Energy Services, is in discussions to raise
further finance, said Mr John Broad, the chairman.
Its potential could only be realised if it acquired adequate funds both for
future growth and to deal with 'the remaining difficulties of the past', he
added.
At the same time the company announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 420,103 for
the seven months to June 30 1992. For all of 1991 there were losses of
Pounds 840,098. Mr Broad said he would inform shareholders of the results
for the year to June 30 1993 'at the earliest possible date.'
The company continued to survive only because of the support given by its
main shareholder, Guardian Foundations, he said.
The shares lost 1 1/4 p to 7 3/4 p.
Attributable losses came through at Pounds 388,345 (Pounds 1.26m), a rise
from the unaudited accounts because of a further loss relevant to Clevedon
Homes, audit fees, redundancy and reorganisation costs and inter-company
write-offs.
Losses per share were 0.36p (0.89p for 12 months).

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW management team at Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group which was
plunged into crisis talks with its bankers in March, is close to finalising
its accounts for 1992 and expects to post them to shareholders by the end of
next week.
The accounts will call for the annual meeting to be reconvened on November
29. The meeting has been adjourned since August awaiting the final figures.
Although they are still being worked on, the accounts could show negative
net assets compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.3bn at the end of
1991. The group's debts exceed Pounds 1bn. The sharp reduction in asset
values reflects property write-downs, described by insiders as 'horrendous',
and retained losses.
The fall in asset values reaffirms speculation that the figures might have
been overstated in earlier balance sheets. The company's new directors have
already said they are considering taking action over the accounts.
As a result of the drop in asset value, the group has had to call an
extraordinary meeting because net assets total less than half the paid-up
share capital of Pounds 251.5m. The EGM will be held on November 22, but
will be adjourned and combined with the annual meeting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in losses, from Pounds 495,000 to Pounds 187,000 before and after
tax, was announced by Delaney Group, the building products and shopfitting
concern, for the half year to June 30.
Turnover of continuing operations advanced to Pounds 7.52m (Pounds 7.07m).
Mr Nathu Puri, chairman, said there appeared to be a slight improvement in
the commercial property market and one of the surplus investment properties
had been let on a short-term basis with a purchase/sale option.
Christies Panel Products had continued to increase sales and improve market
share. Current demand for its products remained strong and Mr Puri
reiterated his optimism for a positive outcome for the year.
Losses per share were reduced to 0.3p (0.9p).

<TEXT>
TWO US oil services com-panies - Camco International, owned by Pearson of
the UK, and Smith International - have been charged with price fixing over
the sale of drill bits in the US in 1989.
The two companies were formally indicted last week by a federal grand jury
in Houston, Texas.
In separate statements, both Camco and Smith said they had been charged with
a breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act over the sale of drill bits during
part of 1989. No individuals linked to either company had been named in the
action, they said.
Each company also said that it had settled a related civil class action last
month which had been brought by drill bit purchasers, and that they would
defend themselves 'vigorously' against the indictment.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, has indicated its intention to
spin off Camco as part of a move to focus on its media interests.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: On-site contractor behind AAF's fall to
Pounds 11m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAF INDUSTRIES, the mini-conglomerate which issued two profits warnings in
quick succession after a rights issue in April this year, yesterday reported
interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.98m compared with profits of Pounds
2.26m.
The losses stemmed directly from expansion of AAF's prefabricated building
manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site contractor.
This business had operating losses of Pounds 10.8m in the six months to June
30. The group will also incur an additional Pounds 7m cost in the second
half following the decision to close this business and transfer some of the
manufacturing activities to Brandesburton.
On April 1, AAF announced a 1-for-4 rights issue at 175p which was 97.6 per
cent subscribed. Three months later the group made its first profits
warning, followed by a second in September.
The sudden fall in the company's fortunes will embarrass Hambro Magan, its
merchant bankers, but also KPMG, the auditors.
AAF said yesterday that the task of establishing the financial position of
the Blackburn business was made more difficult partly because of 'incomplete
accounting records'.
Investors and the company will question whether any of the costing
procedures or management controls were already inadequate at the time KPMG
signed off on last year's accounts.
They will also be concerned that KPMG will have revisited AAF ahead of the
April rights and apparently found nothing amiss.
AAF said its debt at the half year had risen from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds
21.97m and had risen substantially since.
W&amp;A Investment Corp, the South African company that controls 43 per cent of
AAF, has guaranteed and provided funding of Pounds 9.1m.
Losses per share were 58.2p (11.3p earnings).

CONTINUING firmness in palm oil prices and the weakness of sterling against
the Indonesian rupiah helped Rowe Evans Investments achieve a 48 per cent
profits increase in the six months to end-June.
On turnover up from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 2.59m profits before tax improved
from Pounds 926,000 to Pounds 1.37m.
Comparatives, however, included turnover of Pounds 311,000 and profits of
Pounds 77,000 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share rose to 1.74p
(1.13p).
Sterling had, on average, been 15 per cent weaker against the rupiah during
the period, the directors said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Desperate for a white knight - The
prospects of a rescue for Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI, the troubled defence electronics group locked in discussions over
a possible rescue bid which would value the company at just Pounds 9.4m, is
the victim of a classic 'Catch-22' bind, City analysts said yesterday.
'Ferranti had been hoping for further orders but these haven't come through
because people are worried about their cash difficulties,' said one analyst.
As a result analysts speculate that cash is continuing to drain away at the
company, once one of the most distinguished names in British industry and a
world-renowned technology leader.
Although Ferranti has not identified its potential suitor, which might offer
1p a share, the City is convinced that Britain's GEC, which bought large
parts of Ferranti's defence business after the disastrous fraud at
International Signal and Control, the US company it bought in 1987, is the
only potential bidder. GEC has declined to comment.
However Thomson-CSF, the French defence group, would probably be interested
in securing the sonar joint venture it has with Ferranti, although this is
probably covered by a buy-out agreement in the event of a third party bid
for Ferranti.
If a bid were to emerge analysts speculate that it could lead to a virtuous
circle of new orders for the new owner as confidence returned.
Among the large orders which might be won is an early warning defence system
order from Bahrain called Delmon Eye, said to be worth about Pounds 100m.
'Other people looking to give Ferranti contracts would see them getting a
large contract and take confidence from that,' said one analyst. Yesterday,
analysts and City bankers were picking over the Ferranti assets and
liabilities in an attempt to put a realistic value on the group.
Ferranti's audited fixed assets consist of about Pounds 50m in land and
buildings and assets and Pounds 40m in plant and equipment. The company has
land in the UK - about 30 sites - and in the US.
The main assets are a 150,000 sq ft factory at Bracknell, Berkshire, and a
75,000 sq ft site in Cwmbran, Gwent. Both are used for manufac-turing.
The company also owns a site close to Manchester airport, but concedes it is
difficult to value, depending as it does on progress with a proposed second
runway for the airport as well as planning permission.
One prize that might attract a buyer is a property in southern California.
When Ferranti sold a subsidiary called Marquardt in December 1991, it kept
ownership of 20 acres of land near Van Nuys Air Force base.
It says that independent Californian valuers have put a figure of 'more than
Pounds 30m' on the value of the site.
Ferranti has a Dollars 25m loan secured on the land, so if a buyer of
Ferranti succeeded in selling it for the valuation figure it could realise a
net gain of about Dollars 20m.
However, there is no guarantee that such a sale could be made at that price
in the depressed California property market, especially since Ferranti has
been trying to dispose of the property itself.
The company's main manufacturing site, in Oldham, Lancashire, has much in
the way of plant and machinery, but the site itself is not owned by
Ferranti. Similarly, a business park at Manchester Airport is leased.
The company's accounts also show a number of other items which might be of
interest to a potential purchaser. Among these the group has unutilised
losses carried forward of about Pounds 375m, of which about Pounds 109m are
attributable to the UK and might be available to a bidder to offset against
future taxable profits.
In addition, based on the latest actuarial assessment, Ferranti's pension
fund showed a substantial surplus of about Pounds 100m, but it is not clear
to what extent, if at all, a buyer of Ferranti could utilise it.
Ferranti itself, which has a Pounds 15m loan from the fund, said at its
recent extraordinary general meeting that it could not further tap the
surplus because of Inland Revenue rules.
Set against this the company still has debts of some Pounds 100m, despite a
series of disposals which have slimmed the company down drastically and
reduced debt from nearly Pounds 700m since the ISC fraud was discovered
within the company in 1989. At the same time Ferranti's workforce has been
cut from 23,000 to about 4,000.
Ferranti chairman and chief executive, Eugene Anderson, warned earlier this
month that losses for the first half to end-September would be larger than
the deficit of Pounds 10.9m last year. It lost Pounds 24.5m in the year to
March 31.
He said liquidity continued to be tight, which made relationships with
suppliers difficult and added Ferranti was seeking an equity injection or
'strategic partnership.'
The City feels in the dark about the full extent of Ferranti's liabilities
or the full worth to a buyer of the financial engineering potential of a
deal.
In these circumstances, analysts are unable yet to challenge the credibility
of the 1p a share offer Ferranti said is being discussed. The fact that the
shares rose 1 1/2 p to 4p yesterday on heavy volume indicates some investors
are willing to take a punt.
If a bid does finally materialise, it will be the second time Ferranti has
been rescued. The group had to be rescued by the government and then
subsequently refloated in 1978.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MMC to investigate Alcatel's bid for STC
submarine division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the Pounds 600m
bid by Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment supplier, for STC
Submarine Systems, the UK-based submarine cable subsidiary of Northern
Telecom, of Canada.
Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, has
referred the deal to the MMC following a recommendation by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
Analysts were surprised by the reference, given the international nature of
the undersea cable business and Northern Telecom's determination to sell
STC. More than 90 per cent of STC's cable systems are exported.
The European Commission's competition directorate cleared the takeover last
month.
Under the Fair Trading Act, the UK government has the power to refer mergers
to the MMC if they create or intensify a market share of more than 25 per
cent or if they involve assets worth more than Pounds 30m.
STC is a principal supplier of long-distance undersea fibre-optic systems to
British Telecommunications. BT made no formal objection to the Department of
Trade of Industry, although it is known to have had serious reservations
about the takeover.
The submarine cable division was acquired by Northern Telecom as part of its
Pounds 1.9bn takeover of STC in 1990.
Although profitable, Northern has been looking to sell it for some time. The
company has no submarine business in North America, and it sits uneasily
with its core businesses of transmission, switching, radio/microwave and
integrated networks.
If the Alcatel deal is not agreed, the future of STC looks highly uncertain.
It currently has 1,200 employees, mostly in Greenwich, London.
Alcatel said yesterday it was 'not surprised' by the reference, given its
size.
'We nonetheless regret the delay caused, because we want to create a strong
European undersea cable business.'
STC estimated that since 1985 it had won about 23 per cent of the Pounds
6.8bn long-distance submarine cable market.
AT&amp;T, the US giant, was the market leader with about 37 per cent; Alcatel
had gained about 19 per cent; and NEC and Fujitsu of Japan had about 18 per
cent between them.
BT is concerned about the reduction of competition in the undersea cable
market, and the possibility that it could become reliant on AT&amp;T.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney's 110p share price values
company at Pounds 26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial
vehicle and passenger car dealer which is coming to market through a full
placing and public offer, were priced at 110p each yesterday valuing the
group at Pounds 26m.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is divesting
Charles Sidney as part of a strategy to refocus the group on its core
activities.
Albert Fisher is selling 20m shares as part of the placing and public offer
and will use the proceeds to reduce debt. The offer will also raise about
Pounds 3.6m, net of expenses, for Charles Sidney which plans to use the
funds to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.
Charles Sidney reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 1.7m) in the
year to August 31 on turnover of Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 41.3m). Earnings per
share increased to 7.9p (5.6p) and the notional dividend is 3.5p.
Although the group has not produced any profits forecasts for the current
year, the prospectus says that the directors believe Charles Sidney is 'well
placed to benefit from the recent increase in Mercedes-Benz's market share
in the commercial vehicle sector,' and that they expect a 'significant
improvement' in Mercedes-Benz car sales following the recent launch of its
new range of cars.
The placing and public offer is sponsored by Schroders and dealings in the
new shares are expected to begin on November 10.
COMMENT
Charles Sidney is coming to market at an opportune time. The recovery in the
luxury car sector appears to have arrived along with Mercedes-Benz's new
models. Meanwhile the group's long-term profitability is underpinned by its
solid commercial vehicle operations. At the offer price the stock would be
trading on a historic multiple of 14 - a reasonable discount to some of its
more established quoted counterparts.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock ahead to record Pounds 5.1m at
operating level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD OPERATING profits of Pounds 5.1m for the year to September 25 were
announced yesterday by Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer which is
coming to the market next month.
Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the results justified the group's
'belief that flotation is the right option for Hozelock.'
The profits, 34 per cent ahead of last time's Pounds 3.8m, were struck on
turnover of Pounds 32.3m, up 18 per cent. After net interest payable of
Pounds 1.3m, profits after tax were Pounds 2.45m, giving earnings per share
of 12.7p.
According to the pathfinder prospectus, the flotation will be 50 per cent
placed and 50 per cent offered through intermediaries. The group is expected
to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 50m, and net proceeds of Pounds
18m after expenses.
Mr Codling said Pounds 5.4m of the money would be used to redeem existing
preference shares, and Pounds 8.5m would repay bank and shareholder loans.
The remainder would be added to working capital.
Hozelock, founded in 1959, underwent a Pounds 24m management buy-out from
Ropner in 1990. It has more than 300 products, including watering and
spraying equipment, pond equipment, garden lighting and outdoor driers.
The group is now 14 per cent owned by just over 20 managers, and 86 per cent
owned by institutions.
Mr Codling said the institutions and management would be holding on to the
majority of their shares, and would hold about 50 per cent of the company
after the flotation.
Since the buy-out Hozelock has introduced 100 new products, and now claims
66 per cent of the UK garden watering market - five times ahead of its
nearest competitor.
Mr Codling said Hozelock, which has 40 per cent of the total UK market in
its sectors, saw opportunities for expansion in Europe, where it has a 2 per
cent market share. It is also investing Pounds 8.5m in a new Birmingham
factory which is due to open next autumn.
'We have shown we can grow both organically and geographically,' said Mr
Codling. 'This business has been managed for the future.'
The flotation is sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and James Capel are
brokers.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Premium for BSM on first day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BSM Group closed at 174p on their first day of trading yesterday -
4p above the flotation price.
The group, which owns the British School of Motoring, raised a net Pounds
32.1m from the issue of 19.83m ordinary shares. Half were placed, and half
offered through intermediaries.
Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said earlier this month that the flotation
would clear the debts incurred in the management buy-out of 1990 and leave
the company ungeared. The company wants to expand to take advantage of what
it perceives as pent up demand for driving lessons after three years of
recession.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Badgerline profits in the fast lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BADGERLINE Group, the Avon-based bus company which is coming to the market
next month, yesterday forecast that it would raise profits before interest
and tax by 36 per cent in the current year, to at least Pounds 12.6m.
Badgerline, which has grown into one of the UK's biggest providers of local
bus services, will raise Pounds 36m by way of a placing and offer for sale,
which will value the group at Pounds 100m.
The company, which began as a Pounds 3m buy-out from the National Bus
Company in 1986, now operates 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands, South
Wales and the south of England.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman, said this significant record of expansion
demonstrated the ability of Badgerline's management team to improve the
results of acquired businesses and outperform the market.
He said: 'There are numerous opportunities for further expansion through the
acquisition of both publicly and privately owned bus operators in the UK,
whose performance can be enhanced by the management team. A number of such
opportunities are currently under examination.'
Badgerline forecast the sharp increase in profits, even though it does not
expect much advance in turnover, which amounted to Pounds 127m last year.
Mr Smallwood said the group was able to ehance profitability by improved
marketing and productivity even in a stable market.
Although bus passenger growth had fallen by 21 per cent in areas outside
London in the last eight years, Badgerline's figures had increased by 3 per
cent.
The flotation will be sponsored by Lazard Brothers, and Cazenove will act as
brokers.
The prospectus will be published on November 10, with the offer closing on
November 19. Dealings are scheduled to begin on November 26.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Float for On Demand Information next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICE WORKERS should shake off the shackles of Gutenberg printing and
embrace high technology hieroglyphics.
This is the principle behind On Demand Information which is coming to the
market by way of a placing likely to value the electronic publishing company
at more than Pounds 50m when it floats next month.
The issue is expected to raise between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m in new
money. The board will hold more than 50 per cent of the equity and none of
the directors plans to sell shares.
Mr Graham Poulter, chairman, said: 'Since Gutenberg, we have always produced
multiple copies of information and distributed that. But in today's
environment this is totally inefficient and is often out of date before it
is published. If you go back 3,000 years to cave drawings or hieroglyphics
things were much more efficient - everyone had access to the right
information at the right time at a central point.'
ODI has been a division of the privately held Poulter Communications
marketing services company since 1988. Poulter, which Mr Poulter started in
1969, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 703,000 (Pounds 1.16m) on sales of
Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 22.8m) in the year to end-July 1992. Bank debt then
stood at Pounds 2.3m, some 78 per cent of shareholders' funds. That ratio
had since climbed with development costs.
ODI produces corporate databases for internal use by companies as well as
interactive information systems for specific industries.
Information is presented through a combination of computer, telephone and
video technology.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Cleveland Trust gets Pounds 12.6m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEVELAND TRUST, which dates back to 1891, has become the first new property
company to seek a listing since the bottom fell out of the market in 1989.
The company, which specialises in investing in modern industrial units, has
placed through UBS 10m ordinary shares at a price of 100p, raising Pounds
9.6m net of expenses. The issue is understood to have been well received.
After the placing there will be 12.56m shares in issue, giving the company a
market capitalisation of Pounds 12.6m. Net asset value per share will be
96.3p.
The directors intend to recommend a final dividend of 2.2p for the year
ending March 1994. This gives a notional net dividend of 5.28p. The notional
gross prospective yield at the placing price is 6.6 per cent.
Mr David Heynes, chairman, said yesterday that the company would use Pounds
1.5m of the cash to buy two further properties, at Aberdeen and Flint, North
Wales, with a gross yield of 13.3 per cent.
The remaining Pounds 8m would be spent in expanding the group 'as quickly as
we reasonably can.'
He said that throughout the recession net asset value per share had risen
from 72p in September 1990 to 97p at the end of September this year.
Cleveland Trust was primarily a residential landlord based in Middlesbrough
until Mr Heynes and his partner, Mr Nicholas Ridley, took a 26 per cent
holding in 1987. The two bought the entire company in 1991, and have turned
it into a purely industrial property company.
Trading is expected to begin on November 2.

FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Allders shares priced at 170p - Operating
profits of Pounds 23m forecast by department store
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE of 170p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Allders,
valuing the department store and tax and duty free retailer at Pounds
174.9m.
On forecast operating profits for the 53 weeks to end-September of Pounds
23m, before exceptional debits, the issue price gives a notional p/e of
12.4. This rises to 14 on a 52-week basis and applying a normal 33 per cent
tax charge.
The dividend of 6.1p directors would have recommended for the 1992-93 year
would give a gross yield of 4.5 per cent. Dividend cover would have been 2.3
times.
In future the group intends to pay interim and final dividends approximately
in the proportion of one-third:two-thirds.
Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, said that after a tough 4 1/2 years the
group could now look forward rather than back.
Prospects were better now than at any time since the management buy-out in
1989, the prospectus says.
Mr Tony Collyer, finance director, said the book-building process had gone
well. Of the 102.9m shares, 50.7m are being sold, raising Pounds 86.3m. Of
these, 65 per cent had been firmly placed with institutions and the rest had
been placed subject to clawback from the public offer.
Many existing shareholders decided to buy rather than sell in the offer,
through a 'mix and match' arrangement, so only 3.44m existing shares were
being sold.
Sun Life Investment Management will emerge as the largest shareholder with a
10.9 per cent stake.
The balance comprises new shares, raising Pounds 75m for the company and
cutting gearing to about 10 per cent.
Net assets per share after the float will be 81.2p a share.
More than 20,000 people had already called the registr-ation phone line for
a prospectus.
Applications close on November 3, with the basis of allocation expected to
be announced the next day and dealings due to start on November 10.
COMMENT
With nothing on the stock market comparable to Allders, and given the frothy
state of the equity market, the pricing is sensible and should ensure the
shares go to a premium. But the rating, roughly in line with the market as a
whole and significantly below the stores sector, reflects investors' doubts
about the company. Department stores are not popular, and Allders, with its
bias towards household goods, is perceived as less than top class. Further,
about half group profits come from the supposedly volatile duty free side.
Allders must educate the City and demonstrate its abilities to grow before
it can expect its shares to be awarded a higher rating.

FT  28 OCT 93 / DFS prospectus reveals cash moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATHFINDER prospectus for DFS Furniture, issued yesterday, reveals the
extent to which Mr Graham Kirkham, executive chairman and, with his family,
100 per cent shareholder, has taken cash out of the specialist upholstery
retailer in recent years.
In the year to August 1 1993 there were non-recurring directors' emoluments
of Pounds 9.54m and pension contributions of Pounds 3.84m. Substantial
payments have been paid in each year since 1989-90.
Until this month, when Mr Christopher Ferris joined as finance director, the
group only had two executive directors, Mr Kirkham and Mr Jon Massey, chief
operating officer.
The company also paid or proposed dividends of Pounds 7m in respect of the
1992-93 year. Mr Kirkham took Pounds 5.53m of his emoluments in 'works of
art and antiques'.
As a result of the non-recurring emoluments and the dividends, there was a
retained loss for the year of Pounds 2.23m.
In future Mr Kirkham will be paid Pounds 200,000 a year plus pension
contributions, a company car and medical insurance.
The prospectus also reveals that Mr Tony Ashwell, aged 45, one of 16 senior
managers in the tier immediately below board level, has been charged with
driving whilst disqualified, refusing to provide a breathalyser test and 'a
number of other offences' following 'an incident' in August this year.
Mr Kirkham and his family will sell about half the company's shares in the
flotation which is expected to value the company at about Pounds 200m.
The prospectus shows that profits before non-recurring items and tax rose to
Pounds 20.8m in the year to August 1 from Pounds 14.9m. This includes
interest receivable of Pounds 1.29m and a profit of Pounds 870,000 on asset
sales. Sales rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 114.2m. Since 1989 sales have
grown at 35 per cent a year compound and operating profits by 46 per cent
compound. Operating margins have exceeded 15 per cent each year since 1990.
The group has no debt and its cash reserves will be Pounds 13m after the
float.
Mr Kirkham said the group had 'a proven formula that travels well' and 'an
excessive obsession with the bottom line'. Its 27 stores reach about a third
of the population of mainland UK, and the group aims to achieve nationwide
coverage. That could mean 70 to 80 stores eventually.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Kodak delights Wall St by recruiting Motorola chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EASTMAN KODAK, the photographic products group, yesterday named Mr George
Fisher, the chairman and chief executive of electronics group Motorola, as
its new chairman in place of Mr Kay Whitmore, who was forced to resign in
August because of the company's lacklustre financial performance.
Mr Fisher, 52, is one of the most highly regarded managers in the US and his
appointment delighted Wall Street. His name had not featured in market
rumours of Kodak's shortlist. 'This is an appointment beyond my hopes -
beyond the dreams of avarice,' said Mr Michael Ellmann, an analyst at
Wertheim Schroder. The market expected a strong rise this morning in Kodak
stock, which closed last night up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 58 3/4 before the
appointment was announced.
Mr Fisher, who will succeed Mr Fisher on December 1, is expected to move
much more decisively to address Kodak's problems, which include competition
from own-label manufacturers in the mature film market, a copier business
which is barely profitable, and an insular, bureaucratic culture.
Mr Fisher, who has been chief executive of Motorola since 1988 and chairman
since 1990, will contribute technical expertise and a strong reputation as a
team builder.
He is a leading proponent of the business philosophy known as total quality
management.
Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Cola-Cola and a director of Kodak, who led
the search for the new chief, said Mr Fisher was 'the energetic leader who
the board believes will move Kodak to higher levels of achievement'.
Mr Fisher's departure from Motorola comes as a surprise. He told fellow
board members yesterday morning of his intention to take up 'an exceptional
offer from another very good company'.
By accepting the top job at Kodak, Mr Fisher has cleared a path for the
career of Mr Christopher Galvin, 42, grandson of Motorola's founder. Mr
Galvin is expected eventually to follow his grandfather and father to become
chairman and chief executive of Motorola.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Rush to invest in south-east Asia's biggest flotation: The
public clamour for a stake in the Singapore Telecom privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in Singapore have been rushing to make final share applications in
advance of the partial flotation next week of Singapore Telecom (ST), the
island republic's post and telecommunications utility.
The ST offer, billed as the largest flotation so far in south-east Asia,
closes today. The government has valued ST at a minimum of SDollars 30.5bn
(Pounds 12.7bn) but analysts predict that aggressive buying of ST shares
could raise the company's market capitalisation to between SDollars 40bn and
SDollars 50bn.
'The large amounts of foreign funds that have come into the Far Eastern
markets in recent months, particularly from the US, have given confidence to
domestic share buyers,' said one Singapore broker. 'But it looks like even
the allocation of ST shares available to foreigners is being bought by
Singaporeans. Foreign investors are watching and waiting on this one.'
About 10 per cent of ST is being floated with 50 per cent of the shares
reserved for Singaporeans, the bulk of them at a discount. The rest of the
shares are being made available to both Singaporeans and foreigners on a
tender basis.
ST has a monopoly on domestic and international services from Singapore
until the year 2007 and is keen to raise funds to expand overseas. ST's net
income rose 9 per cent to SDollars 1bn in the year to March 31, 1993 on
sales of SDollars 2.8bn.
The Singapore government has been conducting an intense publicity campaign
aimed at encouraging wider domestic share ownership. But there are now fears
that the campaign could backfire as overly anxious Singaporean investors bid
up the price of ST shares to what are considered to be unrealistic levels.
The government has priced ST at SDollars 2 per share. But brokers say some
Singaporeans are willing to bid more than twice that figure to ensure an
allocation of shares available on a tender basis. This, it is feared, could
result in a 'freak' high strike price which would then encourage
Singaporeans who bought at SDollars 2 to quickly offload their shares.
The strike price for the tendered portion of the ST shares is due to be
announced tomorrow. Trading - which is expected to be frenetic - is due to
start on Monday.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Globex faces reshaping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOBEX, the electronic futures trading system developed by Reuters and the
world's two largest futures exchanges, is likely to be radically
restructured, when the agreement between its backers is renegotiated in
April.
Yesterday, the chairmen of both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange - two of the three backers of the Dollars 80m (Pounds
54m) system - jockeyed for position, as one announced that he would be
willing to give up some control of the system, while the other arrived in
London for private talks with Reuters.
Launched 18 months ago, Globex has been dogged by low trading volume, delays
in gaining regulatory approval to install screens, unwillingness of other
exchanges to sign up, and bickering between the two exchanges.
Looking ahead to the April negotiations, Mr Pat Arbor, CBOT chairman, said
his exchange was prepared to give up control of the day-to-day running of
the system to attract other exchanges. Globex 'will look more democratic,
more open, more like a utility.'
Currently, Reuters operates the system, but the two exchanges control
trading on it. Other exchanges, including the London International Financial
Futures &amp; Options Exchange, have said they were unwilling to surrender
control of their products to competitors by joining.
Reuters will have the option to pull out of Globex in April, because the
CBOT and CME will not have met trading targets of 50,000 contracts a day
between them on the system. Currently, they are trading around 5,000
contracts a day. Globex needs to attract new exchanges in order to boost
volume and allow Reuters to recoup its estimated Dollars 75m investment.
Only France's Matif has joined so far.
Reuters declined to comment yesterday, but, in a recent interview with the
Financial Times, Ms Rosalyn Wilton, managing director of Reuters transaction
products, said: 'We want to explore all the various avenues and
opportunities. We want to be able to do something that is right for the
marketplace.' She added: 'One could ask what is the way to make it easier
(for other exchanges) and to inspire more confidence.'
It emerged yesterday that Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, has come to
London for private discussions with Mr Peter Job, chief executive of
Reuters. Mr Sandner said he would talk about the CME's 'long-term
relationship with Reuters'.

FT  28 OCT 93 / A pile of money in search of a home: The public clamour for
a stake in the Singapore Telecom privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public disturbances are rare in tightly controlled Singapore. But share
frenzy has been sweeping across the island republic. The centre of attention
has been the partial privatisation of Singapore Telecom (ST). The government
valuation of SDollars 30.5bn will make it Singapore's biggest quoted
company, accounting for 20 per cent of total stock market capitalisation.
'For a company with a domestic market of less than 3m people and only
limited investments overseas, a valuation of that order is a considerable
achievement,' says one telecommunications analyst. 'But it's really more a
reflection of the enormous amount of funds available for share buying within
Singapore - backed up by the weight of equity investment funds washing in
from overseas.'
Earlier this year the government announced a relaxation of strict rules
governing the use of funds held by Singaporeans in the central provident
fund (CPF), a compulsory savings scheme. More than SDollars 20bn of
additional CPF funds were made available to buy shares.
Group A ST shares, sold at Dollars 1.90, are available to Singaporeans to
buy through their CPF accounts. The initial limit of 600 shares each is
being increased by the government. Group B shares are available to
Singporeans at SDollars 2 each, with a limit of 1,000 shares per applicant.
Group C shares are causing the most excitement. These are available by way
of a single strike price tender at or above SDollars 2 each. Such has been
the interest, there are fears that a 'freak' high price could be set. 'You'd
be mad to bid above SDollars 3.50 a share,' says one foreign broker. 'But
the way this sale has been hyped, and given the amount of money around,
anything could happen.'
While foreign fund managers involved in Asian markets are anxious to include
ST in their investment portfolios, many are being cautious about the
tendering process and prefer to wait for a secondary market to develop. Some
foreign buyers object to paying more than Singaporeans, while others point
out that even the basic launch price sets an unduly high prospective
price-earnings ratio of 27.
But indications are that it is Singaporeans themselves who are leading the
rush to put in tenders for the Group C shares.
Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings. It has foreign exchange
reserves of more than USDollars 40bn. CPF assets are now put at SDollars
50bn. More than 90 per cent of the population own their homes, and the roads
are full of expensive cars. Share buying is one of the few avenues left for
Singporeans to use up excess funds. There are dangers lurking amid all the
market euphoria. The government deliberately structured the ST sale to
encourage long-term share ownership. Yet the likely success of the issue, in
part due to a government sponsored publicity campaign extolling the benefits
of share ownership, could defeat the government's objectives.
Analysts say that if the Group C strike price is much above the SDollars
2.50 mark, group B shareholders will probably quickly offload their shares.
If the price goes above SDollars 3 then some group A shareholders might also
be tempted to forego their future discounts and sell.
Earlier this week, Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, said there was no
doubt that some Singaporeans would get get their fingers burnt. 'The balloon
will have to burst some time.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Tory auditor may be in breach of professional guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDITOR of the company which controls most of the Conservative party's
assets is also a shareholder in that company, in possible breach of the
accountancy industry's professional guidelines.
Official records show that Mr Lewis Fialko, a fellow of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, owns two shares in Bourne
Association, the company which holds the leasehold on 22 Smith Square, the
Conservative party's headquarters in London.
Accounts filed at Companies House show that Mr Fialko's firm, Fialko, Burns
&amp; Co, based in Cricklewood, north-west London, is auditor to Bourne
Association. Bourne was shown as a 'quasi-subsidiary' of the Conservative
party for the first time in its 1993 accounts.
The guide to professional ethics used by the institute warns that 'a
member's objectivity may be threatened or appear to be threatened where he
or she holds a beneficial interest in the shares . . . in a company on which
the practice reports'.
The revelation follows recent criticism of the Conservative party for
failing to disclose political donations.
Mr Fialko said yesterday that he did not hold a beneficial interest in the
company because he was not entitled to receive any dividends and held just
two shares.
He said that he had been connected with the 'tax and financial affairs' of
the Conservative party since 1938 and became auditor and received his shares
in 1964.
The institute will not comment on individual cases. Speaking in general
terms, Mr Julian Osborne, secretary to its professional ethics committee,
said: 'The holding of shares (in a client company) is a severe area of
risk.'
The Conservative party said last night that it did not believe there was any
conflict of interest because Bourne was 'a slightly unusual company', Mr
Fialko was not entitled to dividends, and he had been auditor to the company
for many years.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Revolt over defence cuts could threaten government majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW in Tory ranks over further defence cuts erupted with renewed vigour
yesterday on the eve of the first full cabinet discussion of departmental
spending targets for the next three years.
A group of 14 Tory MPs signed a letter threatening to vote against any move
to impose more 'substantial' defence cuts. Any such cuts would 'seriously
jeopardise the capability of this country's military forces to defend it',
the letter warned.
A rebellion on this scale would overturn the government's precarious
17-strong majority. Its possibility will strengthen the hand of Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, ahead of what is certain to be a lively
cabinet meeting. After two months of discussions with ministers, the
so-called EDX spending committee has now finalised its recommendations for
departmental budgets until 1996-97. But it has not achieved a firm
settlement, leaving the final deal to be hammered out in cabinet.
Downing Street acknowledged yesterday that more than one cabinet meeting
might be needed to secure an agreement.
Yesterday's letter - delivered personally to the prime minister, Mr John
Major, by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the Commons defence
committee - follows reports that the Treasury was targeting the Ministry of
Defence for up to Pounds 1bn of new cuts.
Although a partial retreat by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is thought
to have defused Mr Rifkind's threat to demand a full defence review, the
defence secretary is expected to use today's meeting to oppose those cuts
still demanded.
The letter, which the signatories did not intend to be made public, argued
that Britain's defence forces were 'at best already fully stretched'.
Signatories included Sir Jerry Wiggin, the former defence minister, Mr
Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), Mr Christopher Gill, the Eurosceptic
MP for Ludlow, and Mr Cyril Townsend (Bexleyheath). It later emerged that
the number of signatures might understate the scale of the threatened
rebellion, as some Tories complained they were not asked to sign it.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Paris, Bonn set out EC foreign policy priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday proposed several foreign policy priorities for
the newly-created European Union which comes into effect under the
Maastricht treaty on Monday.
They also suggested that ministers of the twelve meet more frequently to
direct the European Community's executive.
But a joint letter by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to the Belgian presidency of the EC fell well short of widespread
expectations - and fears in countries such as Britain - that France and
Germany would place an ambitious agenda in front of tomorrow's Community
summit.
Instead, both leaders stressed that they had 'no other ambition than to
contribute towards implementing the Maastricht treaty' on European union,
which comes into effect on November 1, and to give Europe 'credibility and
the capacity to act'. Officials in Paris and Bonn underlined there was
little new in the letter - a contrast to the way France and Germany have
trumpeted their initiatives before past EC summits.
Yet it was France and Germany who called for this week's special summit to
celebrate final ratification, and plan the entry into force of the
Maastricht pact.
Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl now imply there is little to mark tomorrow's
special meeting from the EC's regular mid-December summit except certain
pressing foreign policy issues.
The two leaders are calling for EC foreign ministers to push on with four
particular 'joint actions' - a French-inspired plan to improve stability in
Europe, an offer to host an international investment conference to bolster
the Palestinian-Israeli peace plan, moves to ensure aid reaches Bosnia and
to rebuild the town of Mostar there, and to provide observers for Russia's
December 12 elections.
The new proposal is for governments to provide more continuity to their
ministerial presence in Brussels. This would involve junior EC affairs
ministers meeting between the monthly sessions of foreign ministers.
In France, which is still smarting from the Commission's Gatt negotiating
tactics with the US, the idea was said to be to keep the EC executive under
tighter control, but Bonn officials claimed it was merely to upgrade the
twelve's diplomacy.

FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK corporate financiers may have few takeovers to handle, but they have
rarely been busier. There has been a record Pounds 9.6bn worth of rights
issues in the first nine months of 1993. That flow of rights is now ebbing -
at least partly because almost any company with a plausible tale to tell has
already told it at least once. But flotations are filling the gap. Some
Pounds 2.7bn has been raised so far this year - including Pounds 140m by
four companies yesterday. Management buy-outs and investment trusts figure
strongly among fund-raisers. MBOs which have done well are presumably being
pressed by their backers to provide an exit route. Those which have done
badly are doubtless encouraged to repay debt before their cash flow
implodes. And new investment trusts are a consequence of narrowing discounts
and the flood of retail funds into collective investments.
Some companies are also raising funds for expansion and several quoted
groups are selling off divisions to the market. Both routes imply a
reluctance to take on further debt for expansion. They also suggest that
companies think the equity market is overpaying. Indeed, stock market
valuations are currently almost twice those of trade sales which managers
price themselves. That chimes with the caution of those company directors at
recent interim results who found the level of equities difficult to
comprehend. It may mean nothing - managers were, after all, poor judges of
the onset of recession. But it will be interesting to see whether fund
managers continue to take assets from companies at current prices.

FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Capital allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even though there is no evidence that they have worked, pressure is building
on the chancellor to extend the special capital allowances which expire at
the end of October. Industry's concern is understandable. For the government
not to renew the 40 per cent first-year depreciation allowance could be a
discouraging signal when confidence remains fragile. The CBI wants to go
further; it would like the special allowances made permanent, with
additional concessions for small business to boot.
That neatly obviates the criticism that temporary tinkering with capital
allowances affects the timing of investment spending without increasing its
overall amount. But it runs contrary to the spirit of the 1984 corporation
tax reform. This was based on the admirable principle that a lower overall
rate was preferable to loopholes which favour special interests. Some, such
as the Engineering Employers' Federation, argue that this trade-off benefits
service industries unfairly at the expense of capital-intensive
manufacturing. That might appeal to a business-minded chancellor with roots
in the Midlands, but it ignores the fact that capital allowances are a blunt
instrument for stimulating investment. Though the interest on borrowed funds
is tax deductible, British companies traditionally finance investment
spending out of retained earnings on which no tax deduction is available. A
taxation change which addressed this anomaly might yield investment benefits
as well as encouraging companies to make rational decisions on financing.

FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Alcatel/Northern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's referral to the MMC of Alcatel's proposed acquisition
of Northern Telecom's undersea cables business raises some ticklish issues
of international competition policy. The EC has sidestepped consideration of
the deal because it did not reach its turnover threshold. Yet it is not
immediately clear why UK competition authorities should become so agitated,
given that national market shares are somewhat meaningless in the undersea
cables business. After expressing some earlier reservations, even BT
refrained from making representations to the OFT.
From a global perspective, however, there is perhaps cause for
consternation. The international market is consolidating fast, raising fears
of cartelisation. Alcatel suggests that of all the undersea fibre-optic
cable installed since 1985, AT&amp;T accounts for 37 per cent of the Dollars
10bn market, Northern 23 per cent, Alcatel 19 per cent, and a Japanese
consortium 18 per cent. Even considering Mr Heseltine's fondness for
European industrial champions, consummation of the proposed merger would
represent a worrying degree of concentration.
In the past, national competition authorities have acted together to block
contentious international acquisitions - Gillette's proposed deal with
Eemland being the most notable example. But this is an unsatisfactory and
haphazard procedure. Nascent proposals to include international competition
issues in the next round of Gatt talks should be developed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilts auctions are turning out to be a poor indicator of what the future
holds. Disappointing bidding at last month's auction was followed by a
sustained rally. Healthy demand for the Pounds 3.5bn stock on offer
yesterday was not enough to stop gilts prices sliding back. The Bank of
England should anyway be pleased with the outcome of its biggest ever
auction. With Pounds 40bn funding in the bag, and the long end of the market
still hungry for supply, it can well afford to skip an auction in November.
Still, one might wonder whether yesterday's setback carries a warning.
The proximate cause was weakness in European markets. Investors concluded -
with encouragement from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president - that
continental interest rates will not fall as rapidly as hitherto expected.
The bull run in European bond markets has been supported by fickle
international investors. That trend is clearly evident in UK gilts and
yesterday's auction seems to have attracted its fair share of footloose
international cash. These investors will be quick to switch allegiance if
expectations of lower interest rates look likely to be disappointed.
The latest gloomy CBI survey if anything strengthens the argument in favour
of lower UK base rates. Expectations of falling unit costs among
manufacturers suggest inflationary pressures remain subdued. But with a
half-point cut already priced into short-dated gilts, it may take more than
a token easing to keep the bargain-hunters keen.

Jean-Loup Chretien? - ah yes, he's Canada's new prime minister, isn't he?
Wrong. That's Jean Chretien. His near namesake was the first west European
astronaut.
Jean-Loup, a French Air Force general, became a by-word for savoir faire in
his two cosmic jaunts aboard Soviet rockets in 1982 and 1988. He astounded
his Russian hosts by taking along meals of jellied salmon, quail meat and
crystallised fruit, and on his second trip not only did he enter the record
books by surviving for several hours on a space walk outside the Mir space
station, he also managed to fight off a tax demand from the French
government by saying he was away in orbit.
The new Canadian PM may feel he is walking on air, but his officials are
unlikely to be palmed off with such dizzy excuses.

Some selfless individuals from law firm Norton Rose today head for western
Bosnia in a convoy of lorries packed with medical supplies and food.
Ian Cooke, a 27-year-old property lawyer who leads the nine-strong team on
their fortnight's 'holiday', is not a complete neophyte, having done the
Romanian orphanage run and visited Croatian refugee camps in the past year.
He has raised Pounds 75,000 from assorted charities - while Norton Rose
chipped in Pounds 2,000. 'Lack of money is not the issue,' Cooke interjects
loyally, pointing out that transportation is the headache. Notwithstanding
the shooting of a Danish aid truck driver this week which has prompted the
UN to suspend relief to central Bosnia, Cooke says his team are leaving flak
jackets behind. 'I don't like to look provocative.'
So lawyers have feelings after all? Well, one team member, Gavin Collins,
has just parted with the profession - to become a vicar.

Meanwhile, Radio Free Europe, the Munich-based station which began life as a
CIA organ-isation, has a new admirer.
Long hounded by the Soviet authorities for its dissident broadcasts of
anti-Communist material, its airwaves must have fairly crackled with glee as
the Russian Communist Party solemnly thanked the station for being the only
media outlet to give the party's electoral programme full and fair coverage.
Not that the competition is very great. With most of the media taking a
thoroughly pro-Yeltsin line, the activities of the now 'dissident'
communists have been all but ignored by most of the Russian press.

While Russia's politicians haggle over the future of Lenin's embalmed body,
Leonid Brezhnev's luxury ambulance has drawn up inside Russia's Imperial
Bank.
Having paid Dollars 250,000 for the artefact in a charity auction jointly
organised by Sotheby's, the bank plans to show off its acquisition across
Europe. For the Zil is part of a sculpture known as the 'sleeping beauty'
which also features a young woman lying on a tomb  - a combination which,
according to Russian art experts, symbolises potential democratic power.
'This is the new imperial style in art. It suits us because we have become a
financial empire,' explains the bank which has recently entered into an
alliance with two other Russian finance houses. Indeed, it is evidently
quite taken with the regal theme. A recent advertising campaign depicts the
emperor Caesar under the slogan: 'Punctuality is the courtesy of Kings.'

Mogens Lykketoft, Denmark's Social Democratic finance minister, is proving a
dab hand at creative accounting. At the stroke of a pen, he has just wiped
about DKr200bn off his country's national debt.
At nearly DKr553bn, or 60 per cent of GDP in 1994, according to the draft
1994 budget, the overall figure was edging dangerously close to the maximum
debt-to-GDP ratio permitted for countries aiming to sign up for monetary
union.
Lykketoft had a brain wave. Why not treat as assets the tax revenue which
will be collected when savers retire and start tapping their private pension
schemes?
Precisely why the finance minister should be so worried is a bit of a
puzzle, given that under the special terms on which Denmark ratified the
Maastricht treaty, in the May referendum, the country won an exemption from
Emu.
Certainly the opposition's economics spokesman, Anders Fogh-Rasmussen, a
former minister of taxation, was unimpressed. 'Hokus pokus' was his verdict
on the wheeze he no doubt wished he had thought up himself before he lost
his job last year.

The sharp brains at the Institute of Economic Affairs - the think-tank that
lays claim to providing Margaret Thatcher with many of her policies from the
abolition of rent controls to the contracting out of council services - are
cut to the quick.
In the 914 pages of the first volume of the Lady's biography, The Downing
Street Years, the institute detects not a single mention of itself. Nor does
the 27-page index list Lord Harris or Arthur Seldon, the two men credited
with inventing Thatcherism at a time when Margaret Hilda Roberts was still
bending her mind to the properties of hydro-carbons.
Good thing a second volume is planned.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Personal View: The multiple benefits of a single tier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take the annual sales of Sainsbury's superstores. Add those of Tesco,
Safeway and Asda. It adds up to Pounds 25bn but it is barely a third of the
amount spent every year by local government. This year local councils will
spend Pounds 70bn; their spending on services alone will total Pounds 43bn.
Town halls are in the front line of service delivery. Local government is in
more frequent contact with most citizens and most businesses than the
legendary Sir Humphreys of Whitehall departments.
Concern about the cost effectiveness of that spending and the efficiency of
service delivery led the government to question whether the traditional
two-tier structure of local government in shire England was still the best
model. As a result a year ago we set up the Local Government Commission
under Sir John Banham to make recommendations on the future shape of local
government.
But because it was accepted that the review's programme was too long (the
final tranche of counties would still be in the melting pot in 1997) and
that the government's own preference was not explicit, the government has
since changed the Commission's guidelines. This should now mean that the
Commission's work will be finished by the end of next year. Many new local
authorities will come into being in 1996, and the rest the year after.
The government has also come down more emphatically in favour of all-purpose
unitary councils to replace the two-tier system, without ruling out some
two-tier structures.
Why has the Government decided to press-ahead with reform? The pitfalls of
trying to satisfy the views of local councillors (who form the hard core of
party activists in all political parties), MPs, local government employees
(2m of them) and getting all this through Parliament are all too obvious.
The situation has not been made easier by the passionate frontier wars waged
locally by councils armed with specially commissioned consultants reports
asserting their claim to primacy or survival.
But there are three good reasons for pushing ahead with reform:
To rationalise the delivery of services. It makes no sense for social
services and housing to be divided between county and district authorities
respectively. Nor is it obvious, for example, that county control of
highways planning and district control of planning for business or
residential development makes for easy decision taking. The current system
is confusing. There is no single door to knock on for service delivery or
redress. The number of councillors who serve on both county and district is
perhaps an indicator of the present unsatisfactory divide: accountability
must be better served by all-purpose councils.
The role of councils has changed fundamentally in recent years. Increasingly
councils are the commissioners and procurers, rather than providers, of
services. Compulsory competitive tendering is already established in
blue-collar services such as refuse collection and is to be introduced in
professional services such as architecture and legal work.
The case for a single tier of such 'enabling' councils is strong. They will
be powerful customers for business. Local government functions have become
more managerial and supervisory and the range of functions itself has
changed. The government has turned either to more executive methods - for
instance, using urban development councils to fulfil tasks such as inner
city regeneration - or to direct empowerment of local people, as in
education where budget decisions have been devolved to the head teacher's
study.
This has been a revolution, but a revolution largely between central and
local government itself with little debate outside the circle of those
directly involved. The reform of local government structure is a logical
response to this revolution. Of course it will pose problems of its own -
how to achieve a unitary authority large enough to tackle strategic issues
(planning, waste disposal, transport) without surrendering local identity
and accountability (the answer may be in devolving some service delivery to
existing town and parish councils). But at the end of the day it should
deliver streamlined local government which provides a one-stop shop for
citizens, and councils with which business can do business.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Atom smash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN physicists are lamenting the messy death of the Dollars 11bn
Superconducting Super Collider. Congress killed the project last week after
spending Dollars 2bn digging 15 miles of tunnel under the Texan plains for
what would have been the world's most powerful atom smasher. SSC enthusiasts
claim its demise could set back by a generation the search for an
all-encompassing theory of matter.
The view from the other side of the Atlantic is different. European
scientists - while not exactly wishing the SSC dead - point out that a
Pounds 1bn machine planned by Cern, the 18-nation particle physics research
centre near Geneva, could answer many of the same fundamental questions far
more cheaply.
From outside the world of particle physics, the demise of the mother of all
big science projects looks like a golden opportunity to enter a new era of
global co-operation. For too long the US has insisted on having national
facilities in every field of research, even when these represented costly
duplication of efforts elsewhere. The Americans have sometimes made gauche
gestures of international collaboration - like the belated approach to Japan
for help with the SSC - while insisting on keeping control of the project
firmly in their own hands.
A delicate gesture must now come from Europe. The 18 science ministers who
are due to meet in December for a presentation of Cern's proposed new atom
smasher, the Large Hadron Collider, should announce their intention to
convert Cern to a global centre for particle physics research. At the same
time they should invite the US and Japan to join as associate members.
Tact will be essential to heal the wounded pride of American physicists and,
most importantly, to convince Congress that a small portion of the money
saved by axing SSC should be spent in Geneva. European governments must not
give the impression that they are simply after US cash, so they can cut
their own contributions to Cern.
Fortunately, the congressional language terminating the SSC told the US
energy department to examine 'the feasibility of using SSC assets in whole
or in part in pursuit of an international high energy physics endeavour'.
The most persuasive argument is that US participation in Cern will give
fruitful employment to some of the 1,000 physicists who have been devoting
their talents to the SSC. It is not too late for the US to make a real
contribution to the new European collider; one of the two giant particle
detectors planned for Texas could be installed in Geneva instead.
Ironically, Cern is in practice already a global facility. One hundred
Japanese and 500 Americans already use its facilities as visiting scientists
supported by their own universities. The time has now come to bring their
governments - and others such as Canada and Korea - formally into the Cern
fold.

FT  28 OCT 93 / When the battle's lost and won: The hurly-burly facing
Canada's new Liberal government after this week's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might be expected that people would show a little gratitude to a
government which gave them one of the world's lowest inflation rates, the
cheapest borrowing costs in two decades, badly needed tax reforms, and a
free-trade agreement with their biggest trading partner.
Canadian voters displayed no such sentiments in Monday's general election.
They not only booted out the Progressive Conservative party which has
governed Canada for the past nine years, but pushed it to the brink of
oblivion with just two of the 295 seats in the House of Commons. Their
inexperienced leader, Ms Kim Campbell, lacked political instincts and a
coherent platform, and lost her seat.
The party has also fallen victim to the profound strains which have been
tearing at the fabric of Canadian society for the past 20 years. These
tensions - between English and French-speaking Canadians, between central
Canada and the west, and increasingly between the economically well-off and
those left behind by structural change - have only now surfaced at the
centre of government in Ottawa.
The election is 'a fundamental transformation', says Mrs Sylvia Ostry,
chairman of the Centre for International Studies at the University of
Toronto and one of the country's most respected economists. 'The Canadian
model of muddling through depended on the fault-lines not being
transparent.'
The delicate task of easing the strains, or at least channelling them in a
constructive direction, now falls to Mr Jean Chretien, whose Liberal party
won a landslide victory on Monday.
There is an ironic justice in Mr Chretien's return to power. The tensions
exposed by the election began opening up in the 1970s and early 1980s when
the Liberals were last in office under Mr Pierre Trudeau and Quebec
underwent its so-called Quiet Revolution. Beginning in the 1960s, a new
generation of assertive Quebeckers, led by the now-legendary Rene Levesque,
was determined to be 'maitres chez nous' (masters in our own house), with
their own economic base and greater autonomy from the federal government in
Ottawa. Their efforts were, however, strongly resisted, not least by Mr
Chretien.
Meanwhile, the Trudeau government gouged a new geographical schism between
Quebec and Ontario, whose economies centre on the car, steel and other
industries, and the energy, wheat and forestry-producing provinces of the
west. The creation of Petro-Canada, the government-owned oil company, in
1975, price controls on oil and gas, and curbs on new foreign investment all
caused deep resentment in the west.
While those specific complaints have subsided, resentment still smoulders in
Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia against politicians and civil
servants in faraway Ottawa. The suspicion is that they still favour the
resource-consuming industries of Quebec and Ontario rather than the
producers in the west.
The sour public mood has been greatly exacerbated by a profound
restructuring of the Canadian economy, which the Progressive Conservative
government began in the late 1980s, and which is far from complete. The
adjustment has been forced mainly by the twin shocks of the unexpectedly
deep 1990-92 recession and by the 1989 free trade agreement with the US.
Under the latter, multinationals are increasingly integrating their Canadian
operations with those in the US and Mexico, forcing Canadian managers and
workers to compete for factories and jobs. While free trade has created
valuable openings for Canadian exporters, such as a new generation of
high-technology companies, it has also exposed molly-coddled industries -
among them furniture, textiles and food-processing - to tough competition
from the south.
Mr William Macdonald, a Toronto lawyer and economic consultant, says that
'while analysis suggests substantial progress on many fronts, for most
(Canadian companies and individuals) it does not feel much better, and for
many it feels worse'. Many Canadians fear that their quality of life will
deteriorate even further as more jobs are lost under the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta), which includes Mexico and is due to take effect
next January.
Cultural, geographic and economic divisions spawned the two regional parties
which, between them, captured more than a third of all seats on Monday.
The Bloc Quebecois, under former Conservative cabinet minister Mr Lucien
Bouchard, aims to further Quebec nationalists' drive for greater autonomy,
and ultimately independence. The BQ hopes that its presence on the national
stage as the official opposition will boost the chances of Mr Levesque's old
provincial party, the Parti Quebecois, in next year's provincial elections.
If it wins, the PQ has promised an independence referendum within 12 months.
On the other side of the country, disaffected westerners have flocked to the
fledgling Reform party. 'They're mad as hell, and they want to do something
about it,' was how Mr Angus Reid, a leading pollster, explained Reform's
rise to a US television audience recently. Reform's platform includes
tougher immigration rules, a law-and-order crackdown, an end to official
bilingualism, and no special favours, such as new constitutional powers, for
Quebec.
The election has created two broad-brush scenarios of Canada's evolution
over the next few years.
Under the pessimistic one, the BQ and Reform will play to each other's
agendas, fanning separatism in Quebec and anti-French sentiment in the rest
of the country. At the same time the prospects for the economy, while it
gradually pulls out of recession, are not immediately bright. Unemployment,
currently at 11.2 per cent, is not expected to drop significantly for at
least a year. The jobless rate in Newfoundland, where the fishing industry
has been devastated by the disappearance of cod stocks, is about 20 per
cent.
The Liberals' ability to dampen regional discontent through government
financial hand-outs will be constrained by the sluggish economy and by the
towering federal budget deficit, which topped CDollars 35bn last year, equal
to 5.2 per cent of gross domestic product. Weak tax revenues could push the
shortfall even higher in the current fiscal year which ends next March. With
foreigners now buying more than 40 per cent of all federal government bonds
and two-thirds of debt issued by the provinces, economic policymakers' room
for manoeuvre is constrained by the opinions of foreign investors and
credit-rating agencies.
The Liberals have pledged to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP. But
economists agree that the new government will be able to reduce the budget
deficit only by trimming spending on the generous social programmes which
make up about 60 per cent of federal outlays.
But there is a more hopeful scenario. Most observers agree that the Liberals
are a different party now from the Trudeau years. 'The party has moved very
significantly back to the centre from the economic wilderness,' says Mr Tom
d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which
represents the chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest companies.
Mr Chretien's cabinet is likely to include several MPs with a strong
business background. The Liberals pledged during the campaign to try to
renegotiate Nafta by, for instance, adding a subsidies and anti-dumping
code. But Mr Chretien is widely expected to implement the deal with a
minimum of fuss if it is ratified by the US Congress next month. Mr D'Aquino
notes that 'if you have a strong majority, you can pretty well do what you
want'.
On the political front, federalists are crossing fingers that Quebeckers
will think twice about breaking away from Canada at the provincial elections
or an ensuing referendum. If they do, the BQ could fade away or soften its
separatist leanings. The Reform party's future is also not yet secure,
despite its big election win. Most of its MPs are political neophytes.
Reform's autocratic leader, Mr Preston Manning, may have trouble keeping his
troops in line if he carries out his campaign promise to make them more
accountable to their constituents.
There are countless permutations between the optimistic and pessimistic
scenarios. It is certain that Mr Chretien will be seeking the first, through
restoring growth and thus ensuring political stability. Canada may yet
survive in one piece. But the election result has undoubtedly increased the
risk that the disintegration of the country could precede any chance he has
to usher in economic recovery.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Regulating taxis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S DISTINCTIVE black cabs are like old-style red telephone boxes or
the King James Bible. They have become part of the fabric of national life.
News that the government is considering deregulating taxis and minicabs
throughout the UK will, therefore, in some quarters, be taken as a sign that
ministers are pushing free-market economics well beyond its sane limit.
Does not the gruelling 'knowledge' test that London's cabbies have to pass
ensure that they take the shortest route and rarely get lost? Are not the
cabs themselves well suited to performing tight turns in narrow streets and
catering for the needs of those in wheelchairs? Does not regulation give
security to women travelling at night and protect passengers from being
ripped off?
There is some truth in these points. Certainly a free-for-all would not be
desirable. In one respect, current regulations are even too lax. Minicab
drivers in London (but not other parts of the UK) are not licensed at all.
At a minimum, there should be a check on drivers to see whether they have
criminal records.
There is also a need for fares to be regulated. Passengers hailing taxis on
the street are not in a good bargaining position and so need to be protected
from exploitation. Similarly, there is a case for ensuring that some taxis
can cope with wheelchairs.
But regulations need not be so onerous. In particular, the various barriers
to entering the trade should be eased. Provided they meet basic regulatory
requirements, minicabs should be allowed greater freedom to ply for hire,
rather than being exclusively restricted to telephone bookings. While there
is a case for regulating the number of taxis in an area, in order to prevent
competition getting out of hand in the way that it has in some cities
following bus deregulation, there should be a bias towards easier entry into
the market.
There is also a case for relaxing fare controls. The snag with the current
system is that all taxis in a particular area charge the same fare while
minicabs cannot compete freely. The simplest option would be to make clear
that regulated fares are maximum prices not uniform rates. Competing taxis
would then be allowed to advertise their fares as such-and-such a percentage
discount from the maximum.
Ministers should also explore ways of meeting the needs of disabled people
without requiring all London taxis to use costly black cabs. One option
would be to require a certain portion of the taxi fleet to be adapted for
wheelchair use and compensate their owners. Other cabbies would then be free
to choose other vehicles if they wished.
The government's challenge is to find a way of regulating taxis with a light
touch while maintaining good standards of safety and customer protection. If
it can achieve this, fares will fall and the availability of taxis increase.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBS AND REVENGE killings in Northern Ireland prompt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
once again - rhetoric and political introspection in London. The British
government has a two-pronged strategy: use the security forces to combat the
IRA and protestant terror gangs, and keep talking to the Irish government
and Ulster politicians, but not to terrorists or their apologists, such as
Mr Gerry Adams. A desired outcome of the talks, conducted within the
framework of the Anglo-Irish agreement, is a comprehensive political
settlement, including devolution of administrative authority to a
locally-elected assembly in Belfast.
Tragically, this strategy is not working. The IRA bomb in the Shankill road
and this week's reprisals by 'loyalists' have raised the spectre of a
growing civil war in the streets of Belfast. It is dismally clear that the
conditions have not yet been found in which the province's main political
actors are prepared to make the sacrifices of compromise.
In this situation, the British government has limited powers of persuasion,
but it is time to re-examine the approach both to security and political
negotiation, as well as opening up a third dimension, the use of economic
leverage.
On the security front, there are no new ideas, but an old one which
continues to exert attractions, namely internment without trial of 'known'
terrorist leaders. Last time this was tried, as the Northern Ireland
secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has pointed out, it was counter-productive.
Locking up killers keeps them from their grisly work, but others would do
some of it for them while the IRA's overseas friends would have a field day.
Internment might, however, be a worthwhile weapon of counter-insurgency if
deployed at the right moment and in the right political context. It would
require that action be taken against terrorists on both sides of the
religious divide and would be effective only if the Irish government
simultaneously detained IRA activists living within its own boundaries. Such
a package would at least show determination by both the British and the
Irish governments to co-operate on security.
Although unionist leaders applaud the idea of internment for IRA activists,
they would probably see double-edged internment as a tilt towards Dublin. It
would be for the prime minister to convince them that such a move could be
an effective accompaniment to a decisive political step, involving the
transfer of substantial powers of government from Westminster to Belfast.
The message could be pressed home by making it clear that, without such
political progress, London will not tolerate the continued massive drain of
public funds into Ulster at a time of acute budgetary constraints.
The idea of Mr Major getting tougher on these matters may seem fanciful when
he depends upon the Ulstermen to bolster a shaky Commons majority of 17. If
the prime minister cannot rise above this political constraint, he will see
no end to Ulster's sea of troubles.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A night of hype at the opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM MELMOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was struck by David Murray's determinedly favourable review of the
Wexford Festival production of the opera Zampa (October 19), echoing the
conventional wisdom around the town. It was hyped up for me by the
production team located in the row immediately behind where I sat in the
Theatre Royal, laughing, clapping and stamping at the sheer ingenuity and
vitality of it all. Indeed, it was quite a relief at the end that they left
to bask in the curtain calls they had helped to generate. I rather shared
the opinion of the lady accompanying a senior UK operator, overheard during
the interval, who said the production was a cross between Gilbert and
Sullivan and Hello, Hello.
I fear the contrasting reticence of the note-taking producer of the Barber
of Seville and her team sitting mutely in front of us the previous evening
will result in an equally undeserved review - the cognoscenti in that case
appearing to give it the thumbs down, without appreciating the quality and
originality of the production.
The producer, designers and general hangers-on should stay back stage during
performances, failing which they should not indulge in what might, in other
circumstances, be described as talking up the share price.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The challenge of orderly decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Chris Lorenz, 'Struggling with the curse of success' (October 22),
implies a company losing market position to an innovator has failed:
companies should be nimble or iconoclastic enough to respond to new
developments in their market place.
I suggest that in some situations orderly decline is more appropriate than
attempts to beat off an innovator. Take the development of the word
processor. Should typewriter manufacturers have been nimble enough to
compete in the word processor market? No. Their mechanical manufacturing
skills were not suited to the electronic world. Orderly decline was the best
strategy.
The issue is not how to become nimble enough to respond to all innovations.
It is judging which developments require nimbleness and which orderly
decline - a judgment facing IBM's mainframe business today.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Case for EC-wide cuts in tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let us consider a dynamic economy, such as Japan 20-30 years ago, or some of
the east Asian 'tigers' today, whose trend growth rate is not far from 10
per cent a year. For such countries a growth rate of 5 per cent represents
recession and one of zero a slump.
Although different numbers apply to the more sluggish European economies,
the principles are the same. If the trend growth rate is about 3 per cent a
year, then an achieved rate of, say, 1 1/2 per cent represents continued
deterioration. The British Treasury made a great song and dance about the
continued gradual rise in real gross domestic product shown by the Central
Statistical Office's newly devised preliminary snapshot for the third
quarter - an indicator which, with a heavy dose of political interpretation,
took up most of last Friday's front page in the Evening Standard.
Let us, however, assume that this estimate is not revised substantially in
either direction. What it shows is that non-oil real GDP has been growing by
about 1.8 per cent a year since the end of 1992.
(The Treasury is entitled to exclude the highly volatile oil component to
measure the underlying movement. But it must be held to this convention,
even when it would suit it to take GDP including oil.)
The main point, however, is that an annual growth rate of 1.8 per cent is
well below most estimates of the trend growth of UK productive capacity.
What has been happening can be described as an incomplete recovery, a weak
recovery or even a worsening depression. The best term is the American
'growth recession'. What this means is that output is rising modestly, but
employment is still falling and the degree of slack increasing.
The same errors are being committed at a European level. The European
Commission is forecasting a Community recovery with output rising by 1 per
cent to 2 per cent in 1994. A similar prospect is held in store by a
majority of the German economic forecasting institutes, with one strong
dissentient. But even if the mainstream view is right, European unemployment
will continue to increase, together with unused capacity; and the atmosphere
of gloom, doom and protectionism will increase until growth recovers to the
3 per cent or so break-even point required before slack can be absorbed.
Much of the fashionable talk about growth in itself not bringing more jobs
simply reflects the fact that growth is insufficient, even bearing in mind
the need to prevent inflation from breaking out again.
Meanwhile, I could, if anyone were listening, help defuse a disagreement
between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, and Mr Jaques Delors, the
EC president. The latter would like more public infrastructure spending to
create jobs. Mr Clarke replies that it is not governments' task to spend to
create demand.
But it is their task, chancellor, it is - interpreting 'governments' broadly
to include central banks as well as finance ministers. Demand management has
been discredited because it was conducted in the past without regard to
inflation. But that is no excuse for throwing out the baby with the bath
water. Policies to raise demand need not involve increased government
spending or increasing the state's role in the economy.
The basic Keynesian equations show that an increase in private spending is
just as good as an increase in the government variety in promoting output
and employment - Keynes's own prejudices about infrastructure
notwithstanding. The one, narrow-minded and disgracefully protectionist
argument for preferring the government variety is that a higher proportion
of private spending 'leaks' into imports. But the whole virtue of a
European-wide approach is that these leakages cancel each other out.
What this is leading up to is that a European-wide tax cut would be as good
from the demand stimulation point of view as Mr Delors' infrastructure
spending; and it would be better from the point of view of supply-side
incentives and the signals it would send out.
Life, of course, is never that simple; and with so many countries suffering
from structural deficits, a low-tax strategy could in some places - although
I hope not everywhere - mean cancelling tax increases which might otherwise
have been made. Ronald Reagan was right to suspect that higher taxes end up
as higher government spending.
Equity delusions
The stock market has a reputation for forecasting 'five out of the last
three recessions'. In other words it is worth taking into account, but it
has a medium-term volatility which makes it an unreliable indicator on its
own. The chart shows that the FT-A 500 Index suggested a 1988 slump instead
of an inflationary boom, and - along with the Treasury and most mainstream
forecasters - indicated a premature 'green shoots' recovery from the 1990
recession.
Misleading, only to a lesser degree, has been the CBI optimism indicator,
even allowing for the fact that, as Mr Doug McWilliams of the Centre for
Economics and Business Research explains, about a half of the 30 percentage
point deterioration in the past six months is seasonal. (Why cannot the CBI
publish its data in seasonally adjusted form?)
The least unreliable CBI indicator has been that of recorded (not expected)
output and orders. True, this is not forward-looking. But it is a gain to
have some clue to the present, which official statistics, because of
irreducable lags, cannot provide. Another moral from the charts is that in
spite of the notorious damage inflicted on services by the recent recession,
manufacturing is still far more volatile than GDP as a whole.
Meanwhile, a Cambridge academic, Cliff Pratten, has made a systematic study
of the equity markets over many decades*. He discusses both the efficient
market hypothesis (EMH) and Keynes's view of a fragile conventional
valuation in which professional investors are trying to guess what other
investors are going to think. The moral of both views is the futility of
hoping to outwit the market by studying long-term prospects for profits: in
Keynes's view because it is futile and on the EMH because the information,
such as it is, is 'already in the market'.
Mr Pratten does say that some institutions have done better than the market
for quite long periods, but he does not give us their names or assure us
that they will continue to do so.
While financial commentators tend to worry that equities are vulnerable
after a rise such as the most recent one, academics like Mr Pratten find
evidence that equities are under-valued in relation to the most plausible
future movements of dividends, prices and interest rates.
Since Mr Pratten went to press two years ago, equity markets have risen by
nearly 20 per cent, of which about 12 per cent represents real appreciation
 -hardly enough to dent his view.
One reason why academics are more inclined to find under-valuation is that
they see the boom of the 1980s in a longer perspective, and that boom still
only took real share prices up to the level of the late 1930s. Meanwhile, I
know that current equity prices, like market exchange rates, give a bad
guide to future performance; but I also know that there is no one on whom I
could rely to give a better estimate of the centre of the likely probability
range.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COURTNEY D SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, makes some valid points in his
Personal View (October 12). But he tries to show Germany is not responsible
for high interest rates and slow economic growth by ignoring the linkages
between the German economy and the rest of Europe.
Economic pressures in one country are transmitted to other countries if
their exchange rates are fixed. The exchange rate mechanism eliminated the
one way countries could keep their economic policies separate: an adjustment
in the exchange rate.
If one economically powerful nation, such as Germany, raises interest rates
for very domestic considerations, the effect will be felt in other
countries, since the exchange rate cannot be changed.
Widening the ERM bands to 15 per cent will allow Germany to pursue a more
geo-centric policy with much less effect on other countries.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Book Review: Out of the cold war into a cool calm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE COLD WAR AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD
By Martin Walker
Fourth Estate Pounds 18.99, 404pp
It's over, and so am I,' says spymaster George Smiley at the end of John Le
Carre's last cold war novel, The Secret Pilgrim. 'Absolutely over. Time you
rang down the curtain on yesterday's cold warrior.' And in a weary
valediction, he preaches of the shifts in economic power that had brought
the conflict between east and west to an end; the need now for partnership
with Russia and, above all, for adjustment in the west. 'It's not only our
minds we're going to have to reconstruct,' he concludes. 'It's the
over-mighty modern state we've built for ourselves as a bastion against
something that isn't there any more.'
There is a similar valedictory feel to Martin Walker's new history of the
cold war. For more than four decades, confrontation between America and its
allies on the one hand and the Soviet empire and its proxies on the other
was the central fact around which the world organised its life -
politically, militarily, economically, socially. Now its removal has left
the countries of what used to be called 'the free world' - as much as those
liberated from communism - floundering, exhausted, groping for a sense of
collective purpose.
It may seem rather an obvious point, but it is still worth making. Four
years after the Berlin Wall came down, the cold war seems both too recent to
place in perspective and too remote to treat as anything other than a
distant memory.
With this book, Walker - Washington bureau chief of the Guardian, former
Moscow correspondent and child of the cold war generation - bravely steps
into the breach. Relying on extensive reading (though not, disappointingly,
on much original research), he escorts the reader from Yalta and the US
policy of 'containing' the Soviet threat, through the balance of terror
between US and Soviet nuclear arsenals, the proxy wars in the third world
and detente in Europe, to the crumbling of communism and 'victory' of the
west in the late 1980s.
The cold war was more of a global conflict than either of this century's two
world wars, and more than a confrontation between states or even empires: in
Walker's words it was a 'total war between economic and social systems, an
industrial test to destruction'.
By adopting this broad approach, he reminds us of a fact it is easy to
forget after such a seismic change in the world's affairs: there were many
occasions from the late 1940s when victory seemed far from assured, and that
lent the efforts of post-war western leaders a peculiar urgency. Whether in
rebuilding western Europe and Japan after the war, in competing with the
apparent success of the Soviet economy in the 1950s, in combating the spread
of Soviet influence in the developing world in the 1960s or simply in
meeting the military threat of an unpredictable nuclear superpower, every
government in the west was united by the same compulsion.
But there was another factor that lent the years of confrontation a
comforting sense of predictability. By the 1960s, the cold war had become
something of an institution with its own warped logic, codes of etiquette -
and, in a curious way, stability.
Walker writes well of the 'subtle gamesmanship' that developed between
Washington and Moscow as a result of the nuclear standoff - their sporadic
skirmishing through third parties in every arena of the world except the
most central one of Europe; the 'curious empathy' that evolved between them,
turning a shared need to avoid mutual destruction into a protracted pas de
deux over arms control.
Ultimately though, the cold war was fought and won on the economic
battlefield more than the political or military ones. Walker does not
underestimate the role played in ending the confrontation by remarkable men
such as Mikhail Gorbachev and, he has sneakingly to admit, Ronald Reagan.
Nor does he ignore the influence of the breezes in Europe, east and west,
that brought about greater communication and political transparency across
the Iron Curtain.
But in the last analysis, he argues, it was the weaknesses of the Soviet
economy - masked for a time by rising oil revenues in the Brezhnev years,
exposed when Moscow struggled to meet Washington's deficit spending splurge
in the 1980s - that brought the Soviet empire to its knees. Equally, from
the Marshall Plan in western Europe and the Korean war boom in Asia, it was
the superior ability of market economies - and social democratic variants
thereon - to provide guns for the state and butter for its citizens that
kept communism at bay. The irony is that this very effort - especially
during the sinew-straining 1980s - has left the west, as well as the east,
facing the need for economic and political adjustment.
At times Walker, whose writing is fluent but frequently glib, takes the
east-west analogies irritatingly far. Is it really fair to say, for example,
that America's difficulties over Vietnam in the late 1960s meant that 'the
two main political systems had rarely looked more alike, or less savoury'?
Or that: 'In the aftermath of the cold war, in the final months of the Bush
presidency, the US seemed to be stumbling painfully through its own Brezhnev
era'?
His conclusions, however, are undoubtedly right: that the west is now
struggling to adapt to an age when the global economic forces unleashed in
the battle against communism are challenging the traditional nation state.
With economic power now more evenly spread between the US, western Europe
and Japan - and with the Chinese juggernaut, too, advancing rapidly towards
the market - the next challenge is to maintain and extend that process of
integration, whether by working harder to bring Russia into the fold of
market economies or, more generally, by preventing the trade barriers from
going up again.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Restore reportage on parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JACK STRAW MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the last five years, press reporting of what happens in Parliament
has been cut by three-quarters. Now the Financial Times has abandoned
altogether its designated Politics page. Readers were not told the reasons.
Instead, there was a curt, four-line note of this fait accompli on the day
after Parliament re-assembled.
In preparing a report on the decline in press reporting of Parliament, I
spoke to many political journalists. In private many oppose what they see as
high-handed and short-sighted decisions by their papers' executives.
Parliament has many faults. Unlike newspaper editors, I dare say politicians
have feet of clay. But Parliament is the centre of our democratic system. If
people are to understand the system, and if they are to have both faith in
it and the ability to criticise it, they must be informed of its operation
daily. Newspapers of record should ensure they are.
The FT has a dozen separate, designated sections, from Management,
Construction, and the Arts, to Managed Funds. The relegation of reporting of
Parliament on to the general home news pages is, thus, gratuitous. When are
the FT's readers to be told the reason?
Your readers will be denied much information important to them and their
businesses. Gallery reporters used, for example, to monitor written answers
in Hansard - a crucial source of information about government and a means by
which ministers are held to account. No more. Gossip and intrigue now fill
more column centimetres than serious reporting. Your change is an excuse for
lazy journalism.
The only people who benefit are public affairs consultants. As serious
newspaper coverage of Parliament has slumped, businesses have to pay
exorbitant fees to an ever-growing army of lobbyists.
I hope that the FT will think again. It seems a strange way to practise the
'open government' which it so often preaches from its leader page.

policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof CHRISTOPHER BLISS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article of October 26 ('Time to retune for Emu harmony'), Sir
Leon Brittan claims that everything can be on course for Emu if inflation
rate co-ordination is substituted for over-rigid interest rate and exchange
rate co-ordination. So much for a past in which, for many European
governments, maintaining the exchange rate within a narrow band was taken to
be the vehicle of inflation rate convergence.
The realities of the European situation are not so simple that Sir Leon's
new formula will work any better than the old. Even if inflation convergence
could be achieved by monetary targeting, that could leave individual
countries with widely divergent unemployment rates. Then exchange rates
would be correct only in a transitory and insecure sense. To lock them at
that point with an Emu key, as Sir Leon would wish, would be to throw all
subsequent burdens of adjustment on to national flexibility and migration.
The problem at its root is that EC Europe is not an optimal currency area
and cannot easily become one. To slide around that obstacle with fine words,
new targets, and technical fixes, will neither establish good economic
policy, nor will it work as politics. Germany, in particular, is unlikely to
settle for an insubstantial convergence defined by formulae convenient at
the time.

<TEXT>
The first act of Elgar's Rondo has such a stirring end that a great deal
else can be forgiven. In comes the band of the Worcestershire Regiment
playing Land of Hope and Glory with all the pomp and circumstance that can
be fitted into the RSC's Swan Theatre.
The band plays again in the second act in the presence of King George V, who
goes to sleep. There is other music, notably the movement from Elgar's
Second Symphony, which gives its title to the piece.
David Pownall has written a middlingly good middlebrow play which leaves a
lot of loose ends. Experts on Elgar may be just as confused as those who
know little about him.
There is general consent that he was the first English composer of
international standing since Henry Purcell two centuries before. He took his
inspiration from the Germans. He was very much a man of the Midlands, which
is an excellent reason for this play being premiered in Stratford. After his
wife died in 1920 he wrote little more original music, although he lived
until 1934.
As a young man he was the bandmaster at the Worcestershire County lunatic
asylum, his father having been unable to afford to send him to the Leipzig
Conservatory. He was admired by George Bernard Shaw, and was the first major
composer to realise the possibilities of the gramophone.
Pownall picks up some of the facts and tries to develop a thesis of his own.
This is that Elgar was hurt by his lighter pieces going down well in England
while his more ambitious work was admired mainly on the Continent. At the
same time, the early years of the 20th century were not a good period for an
English composer who loved Germany. Elgar began to dry up and the Third
Symphony was never completed.
It is quite fun in parts. Alec McCowen is a wonderful broody Elgar and there
is an outstanding performance by Ian Hughes as a young Catholic priest. But
it does not fit together. Characters such as George V and GBS wander in and
out. Elgar's wife Alice, played by Sheila Ballantine, is so repetitively
snobbish as not to be credible. Nothing about her is developed.
There are moments of knockabout music hall comedy - 'watch your back,
Dvorak, don't be so juicy, Debussy' - also a curiously embittered gardener
who pees in the cider. Some facts, such as Elgar's period as bandmaster in
the mental home, are unjustifiably taken for granted.
The direction is by Di Trevis. She could have had a more ordered text.
Still, there is always Land of Hope and Glory to look back on.
The Royal Shakespeare Company has bucked the trend of declining theatre
audiences and reported attendances of 90 per cent of capacity at Stratford
on Avon and the Barbican in 1992-93, writes Antony Thorncroft. This was a 2
per cent rise on the previous year. The RSC reduced its dependency on
subsidy per paid admission from Pounds 10.16 to Pounds 9.54.

THE PIANO (15) Jane Campion
DIRTY WEEKEND (18) Michael Winner
HOCUS POCUS (PG) Kenny Ortega
IT IS the 1850s. You are a mute Scottish woman sent to wildest New Zealand
to marry a landowner you have never met. Your father arranged the marriage;
your little daughter goes with you. You insist on taking one luxury object,
your piano. You already hold the Bible and the complete works of Shakespeare
 -or much of them - inside your grave, well-schooled Victorian head.
But soon things will change. The brittle battlements of art and education
will be stormed by new emotions, new passions, new horrors.
Jane Campion's The Piano, which won this year's Cannes Golden Palm, is a
masterpiece: more, an astonishing masterpiece. We know we are on
inspiration's Cloud Nine from the early scenes. The black-garbed heroine
(Holly Hunter) transported ashore on sailors' shoulders looks like a giant
sea-born spider being carried towards Eden. Behind her the sky is a
lowering, ominous water-colour. Before her lies the beach, a silver-white
sheet on which she sets down her life's few, surreal essentials. Chiefly
that packing-cased piano, on which she plays a few wistful notes through a
crack in the planking.
But, first rumble of doom: husband-to-be Sam Neill will not spare the
servant-power to carry it to his home. Second rumble of doom: his estate
manager Baines (Harvey Keitel) will spare the manpower to carry it to his
home. With her piano held hostage by this Scottish hulk, half gone-native
with his daubs of Maori make-up, Hunter can only win the instrument back -
in key-by-key barter - by giving Keitel lessons.
The lessons consist of her offering him musical instruction and him offering
her initially-resisted physical attentions. These start with eyes poring
over her petite figure encased in voluminous black; then graduate to a
finger delicately sounding a stocking-hole; then consummate in an erotic
wrestling match watched by the horrified Neill. Once again a crack in wooden
planking is the fateful - soon to be tragic - point of access.
Is this the first ever film to depict the growth of erotic feelings from the
woman's viewpoint - first as victim, later as willing accomplice? Or is it
just the first film to do so unforgettably? Campion, with her cameraman
Stuart Dryburgh and sound designer Lee Smith, make the whole landscape of
this dank, twisted jungle seem part of the emotional maze closing around the
heroine. For days after seeing the movie, you hear the swish of hooped
dresses on muddy forest floor or the crackle of condescension, like dry
twigs, as Mr Neill's family 'welcomes' the new non-speaking bride. (Says an
aunt: 'There's nothing so easy to like as a pet and they're quite silent'.)
But this mute heroine presides over a movie of piercing eloquence. As well
as orchestrating her supersensitive soundtrack, Campion provides images that
swell in the memory. As in her first feature Sweetie - the calling-card of a
genius even before she gave us An Angel At My Table - the New Zealand-born
director's screen pictures are never just exotic backcloth. They extend
landscape and gesture, human face and inhuman wilderness into metaphor.
Marvel at the moment when the camera, placed behind Hunter, rises and moves
mysteriously in towards her hair-knot, then on beyond into the dark,
mist-strewn forest. It is as if we are passing right through her mind into
her mind's gathering nightmare.
The Piano is about disorientation. But more, it is about emotional
free-fall; about the fateful plunge we humans go on willingly risking - in
music, sex, passion, in almost every profound human transaction - from first
diffident address to ultimate self-offering or self-immolation.
If the love story is one variation on the theme, another is the heroine's
vertiginous reaching out towards another world, another culture. In this
imperial outpost barely quarantined from barbarism, superstition is not just
the natives' prerogative. The Victorian interlopers have their own dotty
mystical panaceas. When the adult-mimicking children are caught playing
games of mock sexual embrace with the forest trees, they are ordered by the
grown-ups to wash them down. In this empire of unreason Campion finds the
perfect setting for her climax of plausible horror. The discovery of
infidelity; the husband's rage; the act of mutilation; and the human cry so
loud, so unnerving that it seems to bounce off the heavens and back again.
But in this film, even after the horror, it is the mystery that we remember.
The words that never issue from Hunter's mouth - though we sense them moving
about behind those clenched, luminously responsive features - are the words
that never issue from the film. Born to deal with passions beyond reason, we
on Earth know that the inexpressible, the incommunicable, lives out there in
the jungle beyond words. The triumph of The Piano is that it finds a
language of its own in its vocabulary of image and metaphor; and that it
reminds us of a time, before the world was glibly dubbed a 'global village',
when human beings had a proper, primal awe of the distances separating land
from land, man from man, and man from woman.
Any movie week that starts with the sublime usually ends up with the other
commodity. Female self-emancipation comes in different sizes and guises, and
in Michael Winner's Dirty Weekend it is large, loud and lunatic. With
Charles Bronson now giving up mugger-chasing for free bus travel, Lia
Williams has been tapped as Mr W's new gun-toting, knife-toting,
scowl-toting citizen-vigilante.
She is Bella, heroine of Helen Zahavi's acclaimed (by some) novel about a
young woman who turns avenging angel against male harassment. She does this
over one busy weekend in Brighton. A hammer to the cranium of a Peeping Tom,
a plastic bag over the head of a Tired Businessman, bullets to the bodies of
three alley thugs . . . And the important thing is that Bella enjoys it all.
'This is jolly, isn't it?' she says during one paroxysm of perforation. And
by the final reel she is spending her last night in Brighton ridding the
famous pier of a vagrant serial killer.
Typically of a Winner film, this nocturnal finale takes place in what seems
to be broad daylight. But when did our Mr W ever care about realism? Enough
that the celluloid passes through the camera; that the post-dubbed voices
match the lip movements; and that a series of stalwart British actors earn
their crust by making unbelievable dialogue sound believable. Miss Williams,
fresh from Oleanna on the London stage, manages to give a demon polish even
to lines like 'You piece of stateless scum', uttered to Ian Richardson's
interesting impersonation of an Asian clairvoyant.
After a short struggle I gave up and enjoyed this film. Certainly it is
omega to the alpha of The Piano. Certainly it is crude, rude and
preposterous. But at least it is lively. And what is life without lurid
contrasts between the Good and Bad?
Anything would be better than Hocus Pocus. For dirty weekend read Disney
Hallowe'en. Bette Midler, wearing buck teeth and an orange fright-wig,
scampers across the skies of Salem, Massachusetts, casting spells, singing
songs and bearing an eerie resemblance to another famous lady with flashing
eyes and forceful front teeth. But 'Margaret Thatcher, The Salem Years'
this, alas, is not. Rather the film tells of three reincarnated witches and
the youngsters who tediously combat them, helped by a cat and a friendly
walking corpse. The script is bad, the songs worse, the jokes nowhere to be
found.
But then spoof Gothicism cannot be expected to flourish in the wake of
Vincent Price's death. That velvet snarl; that leonine scowl; farewell to
the greatest actor of his genre. I shall be writing more about the cinema's
Demon King, and recalling a recent conversation on Saturday.

Anyone who has ever doubted that war is seriously bad for your health should
watch Critical Eye: The Dirty War (C4, 9.00) which looks at mystery
illnesses experienced by survivors and the authorities' attitudes to them.
Some cases have been attributed to the effects of allied bombing of chemical
works, others to burning oil wells.
Inoculation with drugs - some experimental - to protect troops against
chemical and biological warfare has also been targeted as a possible cause.
One way or another at the moment, half one's conversation seems to be about
law and order. Question Time (BBC1, 10.30) concentrates on the subject with
a special edition and a panel which includes George Carmen, QC, perhaps
still pink with triumph from Virgin Atlantic's libel victory over British
Airways.
Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes (C4, 10.00) does a lot for brother-sister
incest and even serves the London's Docklands landscape rather well. This is
a memorable film with superb acting by Alan Rickman, as smooth and sinister
as a melting waxwork.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: Ashton's shadow over a sad Sylvia - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delibes' Sylvia is a marvel. Whatever the failings of the first libretto, an
Ecole pompier confection of classical Greek cliches, Delibes was inspired to
produce one of the masterpieces of French music. A profusion of melody, wit
in orchestration, and that rarest of commodities, true charm, have lured
choreographers to the score, but with no lasting success. The most notable,
and most felicitous, creator was surely Frederick Ashton, whose 1952 staging
for the Royal Ballet was crammed with wonderful dances, as elegant in style,
and as mellifluously touching, as the music.
Delightful as this version was Ashton was beset by doubts, as he so often
was about his work. He abbreviated it in 1967, when he should have been
urged to preserve it intact, and the piece has been absent from the
repertory for 25 years. What we lost was, I think, a masterpiece, enhanced
at every turn by the brilliant designs of Robin and Christopher Ironside.
These, like Ashton's choreography, looked affectionately at Sylvia's
narrative, at its period charm, at the score's abundant felicities, and made
them vivid and adorable in the theatre. This was never a 'serious' piece,
but its lightness of touch, its abiding wit, were ideal. It should have been
brought back to the stage years ago, not as an act of pietism, but as
testimony to Ashton's genius in its greatest years. (I have been told that a
full filmed record exists in the Covent Garden archives).
The loss of this production struck me all the more piercingly on Tuesday
night as I watched David Bintley's new version for Birmingham Royal Ballet,
with designs by Sue Blane. In a programme note, Bintley indicates that he
thought the old scenario too weak, and he has thus revised it. The result
is, to my eyes, more foolish than the original. It mixes periods,
confronting Diana and her huntresses with the hero, Aminta, entering in
dinner jacket at the wheel of a motor car. Eros, the deus ex this particular
machina, is an old buffer in modern dress; Orion, the villain, is seen in
antique rig and then in dinner jacket; Sylvia swaps chiffon for a little
black dress. The action veers between brutal lechery and a routine for camp
pirates. I could believe neither in the narrative conventions implicit in
the music nor in Bintley's need to up-date them by inserting modish elements
about sexual identity, nor his depressing reliance upon cheap jokes.
The result might seem less dismal were there buoyant choreography to carry
us over anachronism and dramatic illogicality. Bintley's usual fluency and
inventiveness seem less than effective, and he is in no way helped by Sue
Blane's lumpen designs. The sets resemble Christmas grottos in a down-market
store , and hem in the dance area; costuming is unflattering, dull.
Performances at the official first night in Birmingham on Tuesday struck me
as less than happy. Miyako Yoshida, so sweet and brilliant in style, looked
lost and was not shown off by choreography for a role that is curiously
shadowy. Kevin O'Hare ran the gamut of Aminta's anguish (the character is
blinded early on in this version), but was seriously o'erparted by the
dancing. Joseph Cipolla was Orion as charmless brute; Michael O'Hare, as
Eros, has a role in which he must display a great deal too much charm. Diana
and her huntresses appear at odds with their dances throughout.
The staging is, alas, misconceived, and less than happily performed. The
proper amends to Delibes, and to the idea of Sylvia as a wonderfully
enoyable ballet, would be a revival of the Ashton / Ironside production at
Covent Garden.
Sylvia was sponsored by PowerGen.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Arts: The superficial Mr Director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a piece of liberal journalism, Fay Weldon's 1978 play Mr Director is a
lively piece of satire. Debbie, a 14-year-old recurrent absconder who has
had an extensive sexual history and three abortions, is under the 'care' of
an institution for disturbed girls. Care? Its director is a blase cynic who
shirks his responsibilities. His underlings, Marion the frustrated lesbian
and Harry the former child molester, place Debbie, as a guinea pig, in the
new solitary-confinement box. They switch the temperature up or down to make
her 'acknowledge authority'.
Now that we know about pin down and other abuses in similar institutions,
this set-up is far from ludicrous. But it is also far from being a play.
None of Weldon's characterisations are decently fleshed out. She gives glib,
sassy thumbnail sketches of her characters  - Manny (Mr Director) also has a
rebellious wife, Helen, who brings a reporter, Steve, to investigate the
situation - and gives everyone lively dialogue. We get to know a fair deal
about five of the characters, and Weldon means us to keep seeing them in
different lights.
It is, of course, all clever. Manny and Helen are the cleverest of the six
characters, and Weldon is clever enough to turn Manny's own wit against him.
The best lines go to Helen. She points out, bitterly, that girls like Debbie
only get penalised because men are so alarmed by women acting as independent
agents in sexual matters. Or, as she puts it, 'Only fuck when fucked'. What
men cannot abide in women is 'free quasi-male sexuality.'
OK: but never for a moment do we enter these people's nervous systems.
Weldon has deflated her characters into pithy cartoon figures. Smart, clear
lines; versus a terrible lack of emotional depth and sincerity. At the core
is Debbie, who spouts and spouts whenever we are allowed to hear her. Yet,
even in a small theatre like the Orange Tree, we seem to be watching her
from a great distance. Her spiel sounds like so much verbatim reportage.
Michael Elwyn directs this revival. His six actors give performances with as
much polish and as little depth as the play.
At the Orange Tree, Richmond, until November 27

GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS use maps or locations on-screen. They match
other data, such as demographic or financial, to a map or other
representation of physical space.
DATA CAPTURE, sometimes known as data take-on, presents specific
difficulties for a GIS. Data cleansing - the process of resolving
discrepancies or omissions in data - is a large part of the task. Sheffield
reports that it found relatively few omissions.

Malcolm Newman, the driver behind the project, must be an amazing negotiator
 -many people have paid more for a feasibility study than he paid in
consultancy charges for his custom system. Unisys still retains the rights
to the software and is no doubt looking forward to more sales. This will
still benefit Sheffield City Council as it will receive royalties.
These sort of deals are becoming increasingly common as software houses
recognise the value of getting clients involved in design. Too often,
computer systems have been designed by programmers who have no idea of
business needs. They implement systems which are elegant in programming
terms but offer no value to an end-user. Persuading a real client to
co-operate in building the first version of a system is invaluable. It is
then relatively easy to implement the system in a way that allows it to be
re-used for other customers.
One of the paradoxes of computer systems is that things which are relatively
easy with manual systems can be difficult for computers.
Take the problem of matching a map's edges. Anyone who has used an atlas
knows the irritation when the road goes over a page boundary. But the eye
can make the join relatively easily. Not so with computer digitisation.
If a road goes off the edge of one map that has shrunk, on to one that has
stretched, there are many difficulties. Not only does the program have to
identify where the join should be, it has to adjust the lines on either side
of the join. For a computer system this involves complex mathematics.
Overall, I thought this was an exciting case study. The system will produce
real benefits for Sheffield residents. It uses some elegant software and
shows how the public and private sectors can work together for mutual
advantage.
I was impressed with Newman. He has a personal touch reminiscent of a
successful entrepreneur. He also drives a hard bargain - ask Unisys.

COMPANY SNAPSHOT
Nature of business: Sheffield City Council provides services to 501,000
people in an area of 36,000 hectares. It is run by 87 councillors (known as
members). The city hosts two universities, which increase the population
during term-time by 25,000. The care of 250 schools are included in its
educational duties, and its 76,000 council houses make it one of the biggest
property owners in the country.
Employees: 26,000.
Turnover: The council has a revenue budget of Pounds 700,000 per annum to
pay for the provision of services, and a capital budget of Pounds 50m to pay
for the improvements of housing stock, schools, etc, on an asset-base of
Pounds 10bn
Key personnel: Pamela Gordon, chief executive; Malcolm Newman, city
treasurer and deputy ceo; Wendy Miller, head of information technology; Alan
Platt, GIS project manager. Property services manager Jill Bungay is
programme director for the first two phases of the GIS.
TECHNOLOGY FILE
Software: Three bespoke geographical applications were developed by Unisys
for Sheffield, using the the ARGIS fourth-generation language: Terrier, the
land register, Highways (live September 93), and Cartography (live in May
93). Sheffield IT services has developed the Land Charges application
in-house. The database used to store references is Oracle.
Hardware: A pair of Unix-based Solborne 2000 servers, supporting seven PCs
and seven 17-inch Sun and Solborne workstations, connected on a fibre-optic
network.
Supplier: Unisys specified the hardware and provided consultancy and
development. Data capture included text and graphics, provisional quotes,
and specifications, and was subcontracted to Cork-based agency QC.
Other systems: Existing operational systems use a mixture of hardware,
largely ICL, including an SX 580-20 mainframe and 30 Unix-based minis.
Operational applications on housing, rents, etc, will be accessible via the
GIS.
Cost: Hardware is leased over a five-year period at Pounds 160,000.
Development and consultancy cost Pounds 140,000. Data capture, budgeted at
Pounds 300,000, now on a fixed price contract of Pounds 500,000. Estimated
savings - on map-handling and salaries over a five-year period - are
estimated at Pounds 335,000.

on getting the most out of software / Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Computers are about to start sweeping away the hidebound world of dusty
files, ledgers and deed boxes. This digital clean-out is being led by
Sheffield City Council to simplify the often frustrating and time-consuming
business of conveyancing in which the title deeds and boundaries of a
property under purchase are researched.
In November, Sheffield's ambitious mapping project goes live. But the
system, known as a geographical information system (GIS), holds far more
than maps. It represents a cross-departmental approach to problems that many
UK councils, authorities, utilities and commercial organisations currently
approach piecemeal.
Almost any inquiry or process involving a physical location will eventually
come within the scope of Sheffield's system. This includes highways and the
buying, selling and development of assets. Plans, maps, references,
histories of specific properties and the way they will be affected by future
developments will all be brought into one geographical database.
The system should end the long hours spent burrowing through old documents
to make sense of disparate, often outdated, information from different
documents and departments.
The system is already used to simplify many jobs, mostly inside the UK
council's offices. Since September, it has proved its worth to the highways
and maps department. But this is after a long incubation period which held
more obstacles than expected when Sheffield started looking at GIS in 1988.
The need to deliver quantifiable benefits has brought about the Land Charges
application. One of four current GIS projects, this saves time and money,
accelerating every property purchase or sale made by the council. It will
also provide the council with an income from external users, such as
solicitors involved in house purchases.
It was part of Sheffield's plan that GIS would be of outside interest. The
vision of Malcolm Newman, the city treasurer, has brought about a system
relevant to different departments outside his own spheres of finance,
information technology, property and purchasing.
'Everything we do is about community-based services,' says Newman.
'Improving the services we give to Sheffield people is at the core of what
we're doing. We spend a great deal of time putting pins in maps, for the
targeting of resources such as playgrounds, libraries and so on, in
education, recreation, housing and almost every area of operation.
'What's exciting is that we're now able to take 'flat' service information
and present it. Members, for example, can see the ward profile. Suddenly
people start seeing the city as one large map on which all the issues are
linked. The real impact of decisions on communities can be understood.'
Sheffield has taken an incremental 'building block' approach and early
benefits of the system are in the saving of administration costs. The four
projects are a land and property register known as Properties Terrier, a
cartography facility for the preparation and maintenance of maps, a highways
system recording streets, boundaries and adopted roads, and the Land Charges
system, the first to be built in-house by council IT staff. This alone
should accelerate the process of buying and selling, as well as generating
income worth Pounds 200,000 from external users.
'Disposals are incredibly important to the council. We rely on selling land
and buildings to balance our books,' explains Newman.
He willingly talks not only about the scale of the project and the financial
realities underpinning it, but also about the difficulties and delays in
implementation.
Newman's range of duties gave him a cross-departmental view of what was
required and he persuaded different departments to contribute part of their
budget to the project.
The shared approach also meant the system had to be 'owned' by its users,
not by the finance or IT departments. The appointment of chartered surveyor
Jill Bungay, a senior manager in property services, as programme director
for the first two phases of development ensured a user-based approach.
Sheffield has looked at geographical information systems since 1988. A
cross-disciplinary working party decided integration with existing IT
resources was vital. It decided on an extra layer of software and hardware,
using an Oracle database on Unix-based equipment, as proposed by Unisys, the
US-based computer group.
Unisys was contracted to supply the system and write the initial
applications. The cost to Sheffield reflects a 'partnership' deal in which
the city provides a prototype and a GIS show site for Unisys, which hopes to
sell the system to other authorities.
'We had to be able to integrate with the GIS the information in systems we
use in our day-to-day business, on housing, repairs, rent, revenue, council
tax collection, benefit payments and planning applications, not just for
operational use but to provide analysis,' explains Wendy Miller, head of IT.
'The idea is that the system will be productive in targeting finite
resources such as siting a new school or an old people's home.'
Development of the geographical system was spurred by the legal requirement
on councils to have an accurate capital asset register in place by April
1994. Many of the council's duties and services rely on references to maps
and plans. But maps are of different sizes, scales, ages and reliability.
The area for which Sheffield is responsible is represented by 860 separate
Ordnance Survey maps. None matches exactly and while Alan Platt, the IT
project manager, took a 'warts and all' approach to data capture, the data
was not easy to dovetail, being variable and sometimes inaccurate.
In 1991, Pinpoint Analysis, a company which provides mapping information of
postcodes based on grid references, was commissioned to provide a national
grid OS reference for every postal address in the area for inclusion in the
GIS system.
The task of digitalising the city's geographical information went to QC, the
Irish-based data capture company. This was a complex undertaking in view of
the age of the printed maps; interpreting their content took time and
effort.
'One of the problems was that, with this being a bespoke development, Unisys
and ourselves were both on a large learning curve,' says Miller. The system
is now able to show, on one screen, whatever view is requested of it.
Ownership - by recreation, education, highways or housing committees - is
shown in different colours. The lines on the screen and the 'zoom view' make
it possible to take a historical view of a plot of land. This is vital for
Bungay's staff, who are responsible for 5,000 properties with an annual
rent-roll of Pounds 4m.
'People ringing in with inquiries or complaints - perhaps about
grass-cutting - expect the local authority to either own everything, or know
who does. It's time-consuming and tedious, especially when the answer might
be 'no' at the end of a day's search. We can now give an answer in 30
seconds,' says Bungay.
Newman is enthusiastic about the long-term potential and spin-off benefits
to other parties such as health, police, water authorities and
telecommunications.

Forget the youth market. The only growing sector of the UK population is the
over 50s, according to Danielle Barr of the 3rd Age marketing consultancy.
National census figures indicate the population aged 50-54 will rise by 29
per cent between 1991 and 2001. The same group, by then aged 60-64, will
increase 32 per cent over the next decade.
Marketers and manufacturers have arguably been slow to awaken to this grey
dawn. But at a conference at London's Royal College of Art next month*,
designers and advertising people will attempt to show that design for this
age group can bring a wide range of benefits.
In the past, design for the elderly demanded the creation of products to
satisfy 'special needs' associated with various degrees of disability.
Innovation is still vitally necessary here, but there is a new agenda, too.
Increasingly, people entering what has been called their 'third age' from 50
to 75 are able-bodied, mobile and affluent.
Dire predictions have been made of conflict between generations as a swollen
elderly population gobbles up resources amassed from the taxes paid by a
proportionally smaller working population. It is possible that the wealth of
the new elderly will be largely consumed in paying for their own health
care. But it is equally possible that healthier living followed eventually
by sudden natural death - a phenomenon known as the compression of morbidity
 -will leave them free to make more pleasurable purchases.
The problem is that there are not yet the products aimed to please these
people. 'What l don't see enough of are things l can't wait to own,' says
Roger Coleman, director of the Design Age programme at the RCA who turned 50
this year. Services such as holidays and financial services can be safely
targeted at this group, but it seems products cannot afford to be explicit
about their suitability for older people for fear of deterring other buyers.
Yet, as Coleman points out, 'these are the people who were led to believe in
their youth that their wish was the manufacturer's command. Should we expect
them, for example, now to wear dowdy clothes?'
A few manufacturers recognise the 50-plus generation is the one that grew up
with rock and roll. Levi's range of jeans using the euphemism 'loose fit'
could be seen as hinting that they suit the broader beam of older people.
Some car manufacturers have not taken on board - either in their designs or
in their advertising - the fact that more than 40 per cent of small to
medium-sized cars are bought by people aged 45 or more.
The supermarket chain, Safeway, was sceptical, too. It became a sponsor of
the Design Age programme because it thought it might gain publicity, rather
than because it thought it might learn something.
However, in projects with RCA students aimed at finding ways of making
shopping easier for the elderly, Richard Scott, director of construction at
Safeway Stores, discovered that many ideas benefit all customers and some
bring immediate advantage to the retailer as well.
One idea was to lower the height of the top shelves in Safeway stores,
helping the young and the old and easing shelf-loading.
Another project was to create a basket carrier for elderly customers with
relatively small amounts of shopping, so they would not be encumbered by a
heavy basket on one arm. The right carrier design should bring additional
benefits. By pushing their baskets in front of them, customers would carve a
narrower path, allowing more comfortable shopping.
'The most extraordinary thing is how quickly people understand the principle
of universality in design,' says Scott. Design for the elderly can lead to
better design for all.
* 'Design for our Future Selves' conference, November 9-12 at the Royal
College of Art, Kensington Gore, London SW7 2EU. The organisers would
welcome business and industry delegates. Roger Coleman: Tel 071 584 5020.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Golden touch on
brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Gold Blend, the American Express gold card, St Ivel Gold and Capital
Gold, comes Andrex Gold. The toilet, too, can now become the repository of a
superior premium product.
Scott, the US-owned company which was an early pioneer of a comfortable
alternative to scratchy loo paper in the 1940s, is launching in the UK the
'softer, thicker, more absorbent tissue' manufactured using new 'air-dry
technology'.
While some manufacturers of branded goods are responding to pressure from
supermarkets' own-label products by cutting prices, Scott is doing the
opposite. Its Andrex Gold will cost about 7 per cent more than ordinary
Andrex - already sold at a premium of up to 40 per cent on own-brands.
So who is going to buy it? Scott believes purchasers will be 'more
downmarket than up, older rather than younger, and more likely to live in
the Midlands or the north'. The typical purchaser 'needs reassurance' that
she is providing the very best for her family.
She - women use a lot more toilet paper than men, as well as being generally
responsible for purchasing - will recognise the product's benefits by its
name. In spite of a search for alternatives, Scott has fallen back on gold
as the most clearly identifiable symbol of superiority.
The new sub-brand will be supported by a Pounds 2m advertising and
promotional campaign over the next six months. The shock news is that
advertisements for Andrex Gold, created by J Walter Thompson, will not
feature the puppy. The puppy stands for 'functional, family values' and will
be reserved for the standard tissue; the Gold campaign will emphasise
'indulgent, luxurious, stylish' qualities of the new product.
The puppy is, however, currently getting a good run on UK television in ads
for the main Andrex brand and in an on-pack promotion for Puppy Tales books
written by Gerald Durrell. For viewers puzzled by the use of the 'JR
Hartley' Yellow Pages music, the plot is as follows: puppy and boy search
book shops for Puppy Tales books but find that they are available only
through Andrex.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): What's in a name? -
Lucy Kellaway asks whether it really matters what a company calls itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the aftermath of the first world war there could hardly have been a worse
name for a company operating in France than Bosch. The word boche, which
means rascal, had become a term of abuse for Germans: yet the French bought
Robert Bosch engines and pumps regardless.
Equally, Rentokil is about as bad a name as you could think of for a company
trying to make it in healthcare and in tropical plants. Yet that name is
here to stay. On this page last week chief executive Clive Thompson
explained that he had shunned the advice of image consultants to rename his
company. Rentokil, he said, has a reputation that transcends any association
with hired assassins and is too entrenched now to discard.
So what's in a name? Does it matter what a company calls itself? 'If you
have a bad name you can still have a successful company,' says Wally Olins,
who has made a handsome living out of dreaming up new names for companies.
'But it is easier for a company if it has a name that helps it.'
However good or bad its name, a company needs a powerful reason to change
once it has taken root. English China Clays, like many other
long-established businesses, found its name had been overtaken by events. As
the company was no longer mainly in England, nor mainly in china clays, it
decided to drop the words and use initials instead. However, as the outside
world persisted in calling it 'ECC (formerly English China Clays)', the
company eventually gave up and reverted to its full title.
According to Adrian Day, a senior consultant at Siegel and Gale, the
communications consultancy, companies wanting a new name no longer reach
automatically for initials. Not only have most combinations of two or three
letters already been taken, but companies are discovering that establishing
a new identity around meaningless initials can be expensive. 'It takes a lot
of time and expenditure to make them mean something,' he says.
Even when the new name is a real word, it may be a struggle to get it
accepted. When Woolworths became Kingfisher, shareholders at its annual
meeting became so agitated the company had to call in the police. The
management, however, felt that Woolworths had become a misleading name as it
owned more businesses than just that chain.
Not all companies think it matters if they have the same name as one of
their brands - indeed, some think it an advantage. Consolidated Foods, the
US consumer goods company, changed its name to Sara Lee in the hope that the
goodwill associated with that brand would rub off on the whole company.
The most pressing reason for a new name is that the old one has become
sullied. Thus Ratners, the UK high-street jeweller, has recently become
Signet; Control Securities, the property and leisure company whose former
chairman and chief executive has been charged in connection with the BCCI
case, has started a new life as Ascot Holdings.
New names come in all shapes and sizes; they also come at all prices. At one
extreme British Telecom is estimated to have spent some Pounds 50m letting
Wolff Olins, the consultancy, transform it into BT. At the other Control
Securities and Ratners spent little more than the cost of reprinting their
stationery.
The name Signet simply occurred to a Ratners manager one day; he put it to
his colleagues, they liked it and that was that. Control Securities' new
name was even simpler - Ascot was the name of a shell company it owned.
By contrast, 25 people and a computer working flat out at image consultancy
Interbrand for 14 weeks were required to come up with a new name for ICI's
pharmaceuticals offshoot. The name Zeneca might seem scant reward for all
that effort. Yet Interbrand's Paul Stobart explains that choosing a name is
more difficult than it might appear; nearly all the obvious ones have
already been taken. Moreover, the more markets a company is in, and the more
countries, the more difficult it is to find an available name. A list of
1,000 possibles was checked against six trademark groups in more than 30
countries. Then the foreign language experts had to eliminate anything that
was rude or indiscreet in a foreign language.
The next stage was to present the company with a shortlist. 'People get very
emotional about names. ICI was professional about it, but some companies can
be a real nightmare,' says Stobart. ICI decided on Zeneca because the Zen
part has associations with Zenith. To give the name extra significance, the
company explains that a little cross was added to the Z to make it resemble
the alchemy symbol meaning to solve.
Such clever twists may be lost on the average consumer of pharmaceutical
products, to whom one computer-generated name may be as good as any other.
Yet experts can distinguish between names just as winetasters can pick out
different vintages. 'The way the name appears, the sound and texture of it
when spoken, the symmetry of it, are all important. The word needs to have a
good look and appeal, with nothing that is ugly or difficult to pronounce,'
says Stobart.
In choosing a name such as Zeneca, ICI has gone for the industry norm. In
pharmaceuticals unusual names, such as Glaxo, are common. In other
industries different rules apply. Advertising agencies and most professional
firms call themselves after their partners - the more names the better.
Hairdressers cannot resist jokes: Headmasters, Curl up and Dye, Crops and
Bobbers and so on. Puns are also acceptable for opticians - For Eyes is a
market leader - and bathroom shops; but greengrocers and butchers stick to
sensible names like High Class Butchers.
Says Olins: 'Most people in any industry do what the peer group dictates.'
Anyone who breaks out will not be on their own for long. In the computer
industry, IBM set the standard, and was followed by lookalike names such as
ICL. Then came Apple, which was deliberately daring to be different. It was
followed by Apricot and an orchard of computer companies. 'Why are fruits
like computers?' asks Olins. 'Because someone did it once.'
Despite all the effort that goes into getting a name right, many of the best
names have been created by accident. One of Day's favourites is Virgin
Atlantic. The lesson is perhaps that anyone trying to name an airline should
think of a good name for an alternative record company, and take it from
there.

FT  28 OCT 93 / People: Whitehouse leaves a year between Halifax and NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, Mike Whitehouse will take up the new post of director of
operations for National Westminster bank's UK branch business. He signed his
contract a year to the day since he left the Halifax building society.
Whitehouse, 47, left the Halifax, the UK's largest building society, after
28 years - 25 of them dealing with information technology, and the last
three as operations director and a main board director.
He joined the society straight from school in Halifax, on the advice of his
headmaster, having found that he was too young to join Customs &amp; Excise.
When he joined, the number of employees in the information technology
department was just five: now it is about 700. 'Information technology was
the engine room of the business,' he says.
He sees his job at NatWest as similar to the task he was performing at the
Halifax: being responsible for mainline products, strengthening the
organisation's position in the retail sector, and improving its distribution
system.
'Halifax is a bank in all but name,' he says, adding that he does not think
he will find a very different atmosphere when he moves from a building
society to a bank.
He believes he will be much more in tune with the ethos of NatWest than he
had become with the Halifax, describing the bank as 'realistic and
hands-on'.
He also highlights the 'young culture' of the bank - Derek Wanless, group
chief executive, is just 46 - and says it has defined what it wanted to
achieve much more clearly than the Halifax had done.
Having agreed when he left the Halifax not to work for a major competitor
for a year, Whitehouse became a non-executive director of the Skipton
building society, the 14th largest society, at the beginning of September;
he resigned that post just a month later.
Although he had had no personal contacts at NatWest, the bank, having seen
his record at the Halifax, approached him direct.

FT  28 OCT 93 / People: Critics and supporters on energy advice panel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's first energy advisory panel, the composition of which was
announced yesterday, includes at least three members likely to voice
opposition to ministerial policies.
But the government's free market approach to energy will also receive strong
support from some members, not least Nigel Evans, managing director of
Caminus Energy and an adviser to the government in the recent coal review.
The panel includes energy industry executives and consultants, a city expert
on privatisation and a union leader. The government announced its intention
to set up the panel in the coal white paper after a recommendation from MPs
on the trade and industry select committee.
Among potential critics, Dieter Helm, a consultant with the Oxera research
company, has consistently argued that the government should adopt a more
centralised energy policy. He has also been a strong critic of the results
of electricity privatisation.
Criticism can also be expected from Tony Cooper, general secretary of the
Engineers' and Managers' Association. His union is merging with the British
Association of Coal Management and he is likely to argue forcefully for a
strong role for coal.
The case for coal will also be put by Mike Parker, former director of
Economics at British Coal who recently published a gloomy prognosis of the
industry's prospects.
Among other members is Lynda Rouse, director of the public sector unit at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who is a specialist on power and energy
privatisation.
Other members are: Lady Archer, chairman of the National Energy Foundation
and of Lloyd's hardship committee; Ron Campbell, former managing director of
Babcock Energy and a consultant; David Green, director of the Combined Heat
and Power Association; Peter Ibbotson, construction director at Sainsbury;
Alexander Kemp, economics professor at Aberdeeen University; Sam Laidlaw,
managing director of Amerada Hess (UK); Paul Rich, managing director of
Allied Steel and Wire; Ann Scully, vice chairman of the National Consumers
Council and chair of the Domestic Coal Consumers' Association; Tony White of
the National Grid; and Alan Williams, professor at Leeds University's energy
department.
The panel, chaired by Martin Holdgate, whose appointment is already
announced, is to advise on the government's annual energy report, also
published in the coal white paper. The report will provide 'information
relevant to business and investment decisions', and will be published by
mid-1994.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Conservative balancing act shows signs
of strain - Andrew Jack wonders about the wisdom of a 'pick and choose'
approach in party accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THING unites and another divides two recent political documents tinged
with more than a hint of blue. The first is 'The Downing Street Years', the
reminiscences of Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister. The second is
the freshly revamped Conservative party accounts.
Both are alike in portraying events in the best possible light, where
necessary with a highly partial view of events. But while the former is
voluminous in its justification, ranging over more than 900 pages, the
latter is, in contrast, extremely thin on detail. Which of the two is more
readable or more controversial is open to debate.
The details in the Conservative party accounts, and the inadequacies in the
accounts of the two major opposition parties, raises the case for a greater
degree of standardisation of financial reporting among political
organisations, and perhaps even for a formal set of guidelines.
There is no doubt that disclosure has increased markedly in the Conservative
party. The 1992 accounts were just four pages long, and contained a minimum
of information. There was a simple income and expenditure account, showing a
deficit for the year of Pounds 5.5m.
In comparison, those for the year to March 31 1993, which were released just
before the Conservative party conference at the start of this month, run
instead to 20 pages enclosed in glossy covers.
The party has made the most of its auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which it
says advised it on greater disclosure, and which it paid Pounds 27,500 for
audit work and Pounds 17,700 for other accounting work last year.
It also enlisted the help of Andersen Consulting, to advise it on
reorganisation. As a result, Mr Nicholas Edwards from the firm sits on a
working party designed to help with restructuring.
Perhaps most important in the 1993 accounts, there is, for the first time, a
balance sheet, which highlights the fact that the party has a net deficiency
of assets of Pounds 13.3m.
That is far more than either the Labour Party, with a deficit of Pounds
10,000, or the Federal executive of the Social and Liberal Democrats, with a
deficit of just over Pounds 122,000.
But that raises a difficulty. Auditing standards state that 'the facts
should be explained clearly' if there is any doubt about whether the company
is a 'going concern'.
Labour notes that its accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis
because Unity Trust bank will provide an overdraft of up to Pounds 825,000
for 1993, and the Co-Operative Bank has agreed conditional overdraft
facilities of Pounds 1.9m.
The Liberal Democrats note intriguingly that 'funding required in excess of
the joint overdraft facility is provided by certain individuals in the form
of interest free informal loans'. Again, there is some reassurance.
But there is no such guarantee for the Conservative party, despite its far
larger deficit. Nor is there any indication that the directors are required
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.
The Conservative accounts give the appearance of being forward-looking by
adopting the new-style audit report and statement of directors'
responsibilities, which is not yet compulsory for companies. But the party
has been selective, including all elements except the one that requires the
directors to remind readers of their obligations.
There are some other areas where this pick-and-choose approach is evident.
The accounts apparently adopt Fred 4, the accounting standard still in draft
form which stresses economic substance over legal form, by including five
'quasi-subsidiaries' which the party does not formally control.
Just three of these have filings at Companies House, and do provide some
interesting revelations. Not least is the fact that the auditor to Bourne
Association is also a shareholder in the company, a position which could be
perceived as jeopardising his independence.
The inclusion of the quasi-subsidiaries strengthens the Conservative's
balance sheet considerably by including Pounds 5.9m in properties - mainly
representing the London headquarters at Smith Square, which is held directly
by a company called Bourne Association.
But Fred 4 says 'a summary of the financial statements of each
quasi-subsidiary should be included in the notes to the accounts'. There is
no such disclosure.
Nor do the accounts include financial details of the constituency
associations, which the accounts show provide it with interest-free loans
repayable on demand totalling more than Pounds 2.7m in the last financial
year, and which could also arguably be considered as quasi-subsidiaries.
The Conservatives can claim that the party is not obliged to comply with
accounting standards or company law. But its accounts state that they have
been prepared 'in accordance with accounting standards and, so far as is
pertinent, the Companies Act'.
In addition, the Coopers' audit report - which is not qualified - does state
that the accounts give 'a true and fair view', which suggests they follow
the financial reporting rules laid down in company law and accounting
standards.
The legal status of all the political parties is rather vague. The
Conservatives won a victory against the Inland Revenue in the early 1980s
that determined it was not liable to pay tax on income - though it does on
investments.
But since it is not incorporated, that raises the question of whether all
the members of the Conservative Party are protected by limited liability and
may be called upon to make good any deficit to creditors.
The Liberal Democrats note that its parties are unincorporated associations,
which do not have a legally separate identity of its members, and who do not
have limited liability. There is no such detail in the Labour and
Conservative accounts warning of such a similar potential exposure to
members.
There are some other points of interest in the Conservative accounts. For
example, the party revalues its property - reducing its value by Pounds 2m -
but then knocks off a further depreciation charge to reach the assets figure
shown in the balance sheet.
It says the assets exceed the liabilities of its defined benefits pension
scheme by Pounds 367,000. But it gives this figure rather than expressing it
as a proportion, as required by SSAP 24, the accounting standard on
pensions.
That is not to say the accounts of the opposition parties are by any means
perfect. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats insist on using a confusing
selection of different fund statements - the latter with interlocking
accounts from the Federal party and the English party, for instance.
Labour's auditor, Hard Dowdy, makes reference to a true and fair view of
'the financial statements' although the numbers are consistently referred to
the 'statement of accounts' in its document. There is no accounting policy
note on leases, though the accounts make it clear the party has some.
The Liberal Democrats, audited by Grant Thornton, tuck away in reserve
movements Pounds 17,189 shifted between the income and expenditure account
and the general election fund from a Visa card product.
What is needed is a far clearer set of guidelines on how to define the
entity for which all three parties' should be accounting; more consistent
application of standards; and clearer thought about the format used to show
figures.
At present, there are clearly still a few too many partial political slants
on the accounts presented by Britain's parties.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Sir Richard Dobson: tough BAT team player: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Richard Dobson, former president of BAT Industries and former chairman
of British Leyland, has died aged 79 after a career at the forefront of
post-war British business.
He joined BAT from Cambridge University in 1935. The company posted him to
China where he remained until the outbreak of the second world war, during
which he served in the Royal Air Force in the Middle East, Burma and Italy.
On his return to BAT in 1946 he rose swiftly through the ranks. He was
appointed to the board in 1955, became vice-chairman in 1968 and was made
chairman in 1970, a post he held until 1976. Knighted that year, he was
president until 1979.
It was as chairman that his particular skills came to the attention of
British Leyland. He was a tough team player in a diversifying multi-national
group facing increasing pressure from the anti-smoking lobby. Sir Richard
remained an unrepentant smoker of both pipes and cigarettes.
British Leyland was at that time a state-owned company in all but name. So
the appointment of a keen advocate of private enterprise attracted
considerable publicity.
But that was nothing compared with the controversy that surrounded his
enforced departure only 18 months later.
In a speech to a businessmen's supper club in September 1977, Sir Richard
referred to 'wogs' as the recipients of BL bribes, and called trade unions
'bastards'.
The leftwing son of a club member taped his remarks, and a Marxist journal
called Socialist Challenge printed them.
The Labour government found the ensuing scandal too hard to pass off as
simply embarrassing. Sir Richard resigned.
Sir Richard was also on the board of Exxon from 1975-84.
He is survived by his wife Betty and one stepdaughter.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Nissan denies cuts plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, has denied it has told workers at its
Sunderland plant that either a third of them will lose their jobs or wages
will be cut by 8 per cent and all overtime and bonuses scrapped, Chris Tighe
writes.
The company confirmed it was consulting its 4,600 Sunderland employees over
next year's production plans because of the downturn in the continental
European car market. But it insisted that at this stage it was presenting
options for discussion, not final decisions.
It declined to say whether the threatened loss of a third of the workforce,
or an 8 per cent wage cut next March, reported in the Newcastle-based
regional paper The Journal, were among the possibilities floated at a
meeting on Monday of the company council, the employees' representative
body.
'Job security has always been a top priority; it remains so,' Nissan said.
It said the company council would put its own proposals to management.
Briefings for all employees were held to reassure them there would be
extensive consultation before final decisions.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday strongly defended his Citizen's Charter policy,
James Blitz writes. At a ceremony in London to award public organisations
'Charter Marks', the prime minister said the government had fought cynicism
about such services. 'It is easy to forget what enormous changes we are
seeing in the quality and standards of our public services,' he said.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Warnings on credit adverts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY 'health warnings' at the bottom of financial advertisements for
credit should be abolished or at least simplified, the Incorporated Society
of British Advertisers told an Office of Fair Trading inquiry yesterday.
Consumers are confused and put off by the pedantic wording of the warnings,
the advertisers' body told the inquiry into the working and enforcement of
the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The investigation forms part of the
government's drive to reduce unnecessary regulation.
The warnings on the possible consequences of defaulting on secured loans,
and information on, for example, how interest rates are calculated, must by
law appear at the end of all advertisements that involve credit
arrangements.
The rules cover advertisements for, among others, car loans, mortgages and
credit cards, and apply to radio and television as well as print
advertising.
Mr Kenneth Miles, director-general of the society, said there were 'no
grounds for regarding most financial advertising as deserving of suspicion'.
Consumers were in danger of suffering from 'information overload'.
The society is arguing for self-regulation and for the Advertising Standards
Authority, which is financed by an industry levy, to oversee credit
advertisements. The authority performed this function before 1980, when
regulations under the 1974 act came into effect.
The authority said yesterday that it would be prepared to take the job again
provided it had adequate resources. It said that complaints about consumer
credit could total 5,000 a year, on top of the 11,000 complaints about other
areas of advertising already handled.
The society's evidence was given on the first day of a two-day public
hearing in London.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Ministers to step in at 'duff' schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is set to intervene in several inner-city schools after a
damning report by an education watchdog which said they were failing local
communities.
From January 1 next year education ministers will have the power to replace
local authority control of deficient schools with centrally appointed
management teams called 'education associations'.
Last month Mr John Patten, the education secretary, attacked standards of
education in inner cities, saying that many schools were 'duff' and
'debauching their local communities'. He has suggested that several hundred
schools might require education associations.
The report on schools in eight areas of England was prepared by the Office
of Standards in Education, a government body set up this year to take over
from Her Majesty's Inspectorate and to act as a regulator for education.
The report's findings included:
Good pre-school provision increased the chances of young children benefiting
from school, but this was not assured in all areas.
Many pupils never recovered from early failures to learn to read and write.
Teaching is 'superficial and lacks pace', with a good-natured atmosphere in
classrooms which 'neither challenges pupils not secures their
participation'.
School managers rarely set standards of practice, while monitoring and
evaluation of pupils' learning were 'weak' in many schools.
Arrangements for support of pupils with particular needs were 'poor', with
resources spread too thinly.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Black cabs at risk in licensing review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE black taxi cab, a familiar symbol of London around the world, could
disappear as a result of a government review of taxis and minicab
legislation, announced yesterday.
Mr Steven Norris, a junior transport minister, called for the views of taxi
users, drivers' organisations and others as part of a review of taxi and
minicab legislation, much of it more than 100 years old.
'The law on taxis and private hire vehicles (minicabs) is a mess,' he said.
'It is antiquated, complicated, difficult to understand and enforce and
totally unsatisfactory.' He called for an end to 'outdated or unnecessary
controls.'
The government is proud of the regulations, which have meant that the most
modern taxis are accessible to people in wheelchairs. But the complete
removal of all restrictions on the type of vehicle that can be used as a
taxi cab is one of several options in a green paper published yesterday.
A casualty of the review could be The Knowledge, the mental map of London's
streets that taxi drivers in the capital often spend three years acquiring.
The government questions whether drivers' knowledge needs to be so
exhaustive.
One of the main issues to be looked at under the review will be whether
taxis and minicabs should continue to be licensed separately. The
distinction between the two has become increasingly blurred.
The different rules governing the two types of vehicle have been a source of
anger, particularly for taxi drivers, who have more onerous regulations.
One option is for the regime in place in London, where taxis and their
drivers are tightly controlled but minicabs are subject to minimum
regulation, to be extended to the rest of the country. Another is for the
system operating in the provinces, where minicabs are more tightly
controlled, to be brought into London.
Mr Norris said the government had not made up its mind which system to adopt
but the green paper declares a preference for a single regime to cover
England and Wales.
The review will also look at the special design of licensed taxis, the need
for identification marks on minicabs, standards of driver fitness and the
need for limits on the number of licences issued.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Home-buyers' costs fall: TSB index says owners need to spend
less than ever on a mortgage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL first-time house buyers need to spend less than ever on a
mortgage, says research which suggests that the affordability of homes is
improving twice as quickly as other measures suggest.
The TSB's quarterly Affordability Index, launched yesterday, shows that
would-be home owners need to spend an average of 26 per cent of their
take-home pay on a mortgage. This is down from 38 per cent a year ago and 67
per cent in the first quarter of 1990, when interest rates were at a peak.
Evidence that first-time buyers have 'never had it so good' is important. Mr
John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said: 'It is the key
to recovery and possibly to ending the negative equity nightmare further up
the chain.'
The TSB said that simple house price-to-earnings ratios suggested an
improvement of just one-third since 1989. Yet the new index, compiled by Mr
John Stewart, a housing consultant, showed an improvement of nearly
two-thirds.
The survey gives some examples of how the housing market has changed. In
spring 1989, it says, a single woman in her 20s in the south-east would have
needed 116 per cent of her take-home pay to buy a typical first-time
property. Now she would need 38 per cent. The TSB index's average first-time
buyer earns Pounds 15,100 a year, has monthly take-home pay of Pounds 915
and spends Pounds 242 on a mortgage for an average Pounds 48,800 first-time
buyer property.
The bank said that, in spite of price rises in the past year, affordability
had improved because interest rates had fallen.
Mr Stewart said: 'It's clear that during the false dawn early last year,
when the market looked like it was going to recover, affordability was still
poor . . . but now property prices do not need to fall further on grounds of
affordability.'
The Lord Chancellor's Department yesterday announced a 6.5 per cent fall in
mortgage possession actions in county courts - from 34,535 in the third
quarter of 1992 to 32,276 in July-September this year.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Construction orders decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION orders fell by 1 per cent to just under Pounds 4bn in the three
months to August, Department of the Environment figures released yesterday
show. The figures underline the industry's fragile recovery.
The decline from the previous three months provided further ammunition for
the industry, which is increasingly worried about possible cuts in
government construction spending in next month's Budget.
Although total orders rose 8 per cent compared with the same period of 1992,
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the latest figures offered
'few crumbs of comfort'.
New orders in private housing were 8 per cent lower in the June-to-August
period than in the previous three months, but 6 per cent higher than in the
same period last year.
Private commercial orders were 13 per cent higher than in March-to-May and
21 per cent higher than in June-to-August of last year.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Oftel warns over new phone codes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES and other non-domestic telephone users have less than a year to
prepare for a change in national codes that will add an extra digit to all
telephone and fax codes from April 1995.
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, warned yesterday that testing of
new numbers would begin next June, by when businesses with call barring and
other network management facilities ought to have their equipment modified
to cope with the new codes. Call barring allows employers to limit the types
of calls that can be made.
The codes will add the digit '1' to all area codes after the initial '0',
with entirely new codes for Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester and
Bristol.
Oftel yesterday published several guides to assist businesses with the
changes. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said: 'Operators,
apparatus suppliers and maintainers have a particular responsibility for
guiding their customers through the change.'
Although the code change takes effect from April 16 1995, there are two key
dates for businesses next year. From mid-June, British Telecommunications
and other operators will be testing new numbers on their networks, so
callers may find new numbers in use.
From August, the old and new numbers will both be accepted nationwide. The
new international access code '00' will also be operational from August, by
when equipment barring international calls needs to be modified.
The numbering change is to deal with a shortage of new codes to satisfy the
expected rapid growth in telecommunications services.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Five Tories defy whip in coal vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE Conservative MPs voted against the government and three abstained last
night after a vitriolic Labour attack on the government's plans for the coal
industry.
The debate, initiated by the opposition, was prompted by British Coal's
announcement that it expects to shut a dozen pits thought to have been saved
by a coal review earlier this year.
The rebellion was bigger than the revolt which followed the publication of
the government's pit closure plans last year, when four Conservative MPs
voted with Labour and three abstained.
However, there was little of the tension which surrounded the earlier vote,
when the future of senior ministers, and possibly the government, seemed to
be at risk.
The rebels - Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Mrs Ann Winterton, Mr Bill Cash, Mr
Winston Churchill and Mr Richard Alexander - were all long-standing critics
of the government's energy policy.
The government won a division on the Labour motion by 317 votes to 283, a
majority of 34. Mr Patrick Cormack, Mr Stephen Day and Mr David Nicholson
abstained.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, strongly defended the government's
plans to privatise the coal industry, which he said was the only way to
secure the future of the remaining mines.
But Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry secretary, said ministers had
fraudulently suggested in the white paper that they would reprieve 12 pits
that had been marked for closure.
'The white paper has not saved a single miner's job, and it was not intended
to,' he said. Addressing himself to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, Mr Cook said: 'The only job it was intended to save was yours and
that of your junior minister for energy (Mr Tim Eggar).'
Mr Cook claimed that the market for coal had been rigged by 'sweetheart
contracts' between electricity companies and gas-fired stations, 'many of
which they own themselves'. He said: 'That is not a market in competition.
That is a cartel which is closing down the doors on Britain's pits.'
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, gave no firm indication of how many pits
would close. But he said the government would accept the recommendations of
the Health and Safety Commission on safety in the coal industry.
Mr Eggar said that every pit was entering a modified colliery review
procedure, which was the standard way of examining whether a pit would
continue to operate.
Before the debate more than 300 miners and their families lobbied
parliament. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mineworkers' union,
said the aim of the action was to maintain public pressure. But he warned:
'Tory rebels voting for a common-sense policy are as rare as snowflakes in
the middle of July.'
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, last night said that
uneconomic pits should be closed steadily - but with mining communities
given good warning and with favourable redundancy terms available.
Interviewed on ITV, Lady Thatcher said she had two main points - she wanted
to protect miners who crossed the picket lines in the 1984-85 miners' strike
and were 'so loyal' to Britain. And to do this meant keeping the colliery
review procedure. 'That is what the miners rely on, and so you close the
uneconomic pits steadily and with good warning, and you give them good
redundancy.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Labour sticks to all-women shortlists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S National Executive Committee has decided to press ahead with
women-only shortlists in some parliamentary constituencies, ignoring claims
that the plan is illegal.
Some Labour MPs have warned that attempts to force constituency parties to
exclude male candidates could provoke a court challenge under the Sex
Discrimination Act.
Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North and an NEC member, said local parties
might take action 'because people have been nursing those seats for some
time'.
Claims that the plan would breach the act were bolstered this week by Lord
Lester QC, who helped to draft the equal opportunities legislation.
Yet the NEC said yesterday that the party was determined to implement the
policy, which was approved by delegates to the annual conference in Brighton
last month.
A party official said: 'The message the NEC wants to send is that we are
neither unwilling nor unable to implement the policy. Our legal advice is
that there is no impediment.'
The NEC will now instruct Labour's regional parties to draw up lists of
Conservative-held marginal seats, half of which will be instructed to
prepare women-only candidate shortlists. Such shortlists will also be
mandatory in half of the Labour-held seats in each region that will become
vacant at the next general election because of the retirement of the sitting
MP.
Officials calculate that the quota system would increase the number of
female Labour MPs from 37 to between 75 and 80 if Labour won a comfortable
majority at the next general election.
The decision to press ahead with the policy reflects the Labour leadership's
determination to stand by its commitment to positive discrimination, in
spite of recent embarrassments.
Last week's elections to the shadow cabinet were overshadowed by a row over
new rules requiring MPs to cast at least four of their 18 votes for women.
Two high-profile women, Ms Harriet Harman and Mrs Ann Clwyd, lost their
places amid claims that some male MPs had deliberately spread their votes
among female candidates who had no hope of winning a seat.
Mr John Smith, the party leader, signalled his commitment to the quota
system by reappointing Ms Harman to the front bench.
The NEC also decided yesterday to stop the party's commission on electoral
reform from discussing voting systems for local and regional government.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Application of Euro laws 'over complicated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH government bureaucracy is creating complex additions to European
Community employment law that run counter to the idea of deregulation, a
leading personnel official warned yesterday.
Mr Roger Farrance, president of the Institute of Personnel Management, told
its annual conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, that the government was
repeatedly 'going over the top when it comes to applying legislation arising
from (European) Commission initiatives'.
Mr Farrance said: 'The recent maternity leave and maternity pay proposals
are crazily over-complicated. Employers would much rather have a simple,
easy-to-explain system than anything so far proposed.'
He criticised new health and safety regulations, which he said had been made
far too complicated.
Mr Farrance said the institute shared government wishes to avoid new costs
and impositions from Europe, and pointed to the institute's opposition to
'rigid works council proposals'.
When implementing EC legislation, said Mr Farrance, the government was
adding new and complex requirements that ran counter to its de-regulation
philosophy.
Bureaucracy, he said, was also muddying UK-bred employment initiatives such
as the training and enterprise councils and the local enterprise councils,
which he said were clouded in mystery.
Mr Farrance also attacked corporate cost-cutting policies that were based on
the belief that 'headcount slashing is the best way to raise profits'. He
added: 'There are better ways.'
The pay of personnel managers has risen about 4 per cent over the past 12
months, similar to pay rises for other managers, and down from 6.6 per cent
the previous year, according to the annual survey by Reward Group and the
IPM.
The survey says that senior and middle managers are paid up to 13 per cent
more than their management colleagues, while junior staff are generally paid
about 8 per cent less. Personnel directors at board level are paid much the
same as their colleagues.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Union warns over IBM threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF AT the computer unit of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in
Swansea face losing union recognition if IBM, which does not recognise
unions, beats two other bidders to take over the unit.
Many of the 360 staff at the computer unit will take industrial action
tomorrow against privatisation after an 83 per cent vote in favour among
members of the NUCPS civil service union.
The union said that if IBM won it would mean further action. The two other
US companies bidding for the contract, Computer Sciences and EDS-Scicon,
have said they would negotiate with the union if they won.
Meanwhile, employees of IBM could wait 10 years for promotion, Sir Anthony
Cleaver, its UK chairman, warned yesterday.
Sir Anthony, delivering a speech to the Institute of Personnel Management
conference at Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said the company's new four-tier
management structure meant that there were only three levels between
salesmen and the chairman.
The company has undergone a reorganisation of management structures,
removing tiers of management to produce a 'flatter' hier-archy.
The restructuring coincided with IBM reducing its UK workforce from 18,500
in 1989 to 12,000 in a four-year period through voluntary redundancies.
Sir Anthony recognised the difficulties of maintaining motivation for
employees working in a 'delayered' company.
'A four-tier management structure means a maximum of one promotion every 10
years and even that is for the one man who makes it to the top. I wonder
whether we really know how to handle this?'
Changes to IBM's revenue base - only 51 per cent came from hardware last
year - had meant heavy investment in training.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Politics accused of 'crippling' the NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL interference is crippling the National Health Service, its former
personnel director said yesterday.
Mr Eric Caines, head of the Centre for Health Service Mangement, described
politics, in a study published yesterday, as the 'great inhibitor' in the
running of the NHS.
Mr Caines suggested that political considerations were breeding undue
caution among personnel officers who had become more concerned with
shielding and sheltering managers than with helping them take new
directions.
'When the politics factor is combined with the vast degree of centralisation
which is the general pattern in the public sector, and certainly within the
NHS, the effect at field level is crippling,' he said.
The health service would remain 'low-key and cautious' in its approach to
new developments which might raise the political temperature. 'It is
difficult to see how, all else being equal, it is going to change in the
foreseeable future.'
Mr Caines also attacked centralised pay structures: 'Can any system ever
have been better devised to stifle initiative and imagination and to breed
frustration?'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Landmark equal pay ruling is welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY differentials between men and women will be more difficult to justify
after a landmark ruling from the European Court of Justice, the Equal
Opportunities Commission said yesterday.
The ruling concerned Dr Pamela Enderby, a senior-grade speech therapist, who
for eight years has been seeking to establish pay comparability with
senior-grade pharmacists and clinical psychologists.
An industrial tribunal in 1989 ruled that Frenchay District Health
Authority, Bristol, had been justified in paying speech therapists, who were
mainly women, less than clinical psychologists and hospital pharmacists, who
were mainly men, because their pay had been set in separate,
non-discriminatory ways.
The commission said the court had ruled that employers now had to justify
objectively any pay differences between men and women doing jobs of equal
value. They could no longer simply offer a description of how different
rates of pay came about.
The judgment puts Dr Enderby's case back to where it began eight years ago.
In effect, it means she has established her right to go to a tribunal and
have her equal-pay case heard.
The commission said the judgment did not mean that her claim would be rubber
stamped. 'Nobody has yet assessed the merit of her claim to equal pay.
Independent experts will have to do an audit.'
The speech therapist's claim and the length of her battle for equal pay
highlights the complexity of existing legislation. The commission has urged
the government to simplify the law on equal pay and sex discrimination.
It said yesterday that many claimants lost heart and did not pursue their
claims because of legal complexity. 'There are complexities in the law that
could be simplified and unnecessary ambiguities removed,' it said.
MSF, the white-collar union, which backed the court action, said: 'This case
marks a turning point for thousands of speech therapists who are demanding
equal pay with their male colleagues.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Danish order gains subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL will receive government subsidies for an order to supply coal
to a Danish electricity generator.
The government's decision, announced yesterday by Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, will encourage hopes among other potential coal buyers, including
UK industrial companies, that their purchases will also qualify for
subsidies.
It indicates that the government is taking a more lenient view on which
deals it is prepared to subsidise than it indicated when it introduced the
coal subsidy scheme last March.
Ministers originally suggested they were prepared to grant subsidies of up
to Pounds 500m for contracts between British Coal and UK electricity
generators. In the absence of such deals, however, ministers have granted
subsidies to two other types of contract. The first, announced last week,
was for a contract between British Coal and Alcan, an industrial company.
The Danish deal involves British Coal exporting 100,000 tonnes of coal. Some
of the exports will be produced by opencast operations and so will not
qualify for the subsidy.
It is thought the government has provided British Coal with about half of
the difference between the cost of producing the coal and the selling price.
Both the Alcan and Danish deal subsidies are for coal mined from Ellington,
Northumberland.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Japanese MPs query Thorp deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE members of the Japanese parliament have cast doubt on the economics of
the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant by calling for a renegotiation of
Japan's contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel at the controversial
Cumbria plant.
The call, which comes in an open letter to British MPs, runs counter to
official Japanese support for Thorp. It is signed by members of four of the
seven parties in the ruling coalition, including the Japan New Party of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister.
The letter comes as the UK government is preparing to decide the fate of the
Pounds 2.8bn British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing project.
Japanese power companies are Thorp's biggest foreign customers, with
contracts for reprocessing more than 2,500 tonnes of spent fuel over the
next decade. That spent fuel will yield some 15 tonnes of plutonium  - which
is used in nuclear weapons and certain types of nuclear reactor.
The letter argues that Japan risks building up a big plutonium surplus if it
sticks to these contracts.
Mr Tadatoshi Akiba, socialist MP for Hiroshima and leader of the campaign,
said Japan's plutonium demand was less than forecast due to delays in its
nuclear programme. 'It is official Japanese policy not to have a surplus of
plutonium,' he said. 'It is in both sides' interest to get together and talk
about it.'
The Japanese government is reassessing its plutonium policy and is sensitive
to environmental pressure after the international outcry over a shipment of
reprocessed fuel from France last January.
BNF said last night that none of its contracts contained a clause allowing
customers to delay reprocessing at Thorp to comply with their need for
plutonium. Plutonium recovered at Thorp remained the property of the
customer, BNF said, though plutonium would remain stored at Thorp until it
was demonstrated by the customer that it was required for fuel fabrication.
           *       *        *       *        *
IN THEIR letter the Japanese MPs say: 'If current contracts are maintained
with Thorp, Japan will be accumulating a very large surplus of plutonium. It
has always been the policy of our country, however, that it will not
accumulate surplus stockpiles of plutonium.
'The current world situation mandates that proliferation concerns receive
the utmost attention. Under these circumstances, it is highly undesirable at
this time for both Japan and the UK to extract more plutonium than is
necessary.
'Therefore, we believe that it is of mutual interest that our two
governments sit down to negotiate the various contingencies concerning Thorp
without delay in order that we may mutually avoid the separating of surplus
plutonium and the incurring of large economic costs.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Kaufman tells ITV chiefs of bleak future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV COMPANIES are living 'everyday life in Pompeii before Vesuvius erupts',
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP, warned yesterday.
He told Yorkshire-Tyne Tees executives that the future looked bleak when the
rules governing ownership of television companies were relaxed to allow
hostile takeovers.
Chairing a Commons national heritage committee inquiry into the BBC's
future, Mr Kaufman said ITV companies needed to face reality.
'We are talking about minnows being swept away in a tidal wave,' said the
former shadow foreign secretary.
He suggested that ITV companies should merge with the BBC and turn
themselves into software suppliers of programmes for the new age of
broadcasting which he said was just around the corner.
Currently, ITV chiefs are only dealing in millions of pounds when huge
multi-media foreign organisations are talking in terms of billions in
overseas sales, he added.
'And the overseas rivals will oust British companies on their own territory
unless they face reality,' he said.
'We are already seeing 11 per cent of the British TV audience belonging to
Mr (Rupert) Murdoch and that is before Mr Murdoch has got going and that is
before the technological revolution has arrived.'
Mr Kaufman foresaw a reasonable future for the BBC and ITV only into the
early part of the next century - after that, he predicted, their audi-ence
levels would plummet.
'It is not a question of competing in the outside world, it is competing to
keep any kind of audience in this country when the new regime arrives,' he
said.
Giving evidence, Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman and chief
executive, said he refuted Mr Kaufman's volcano analogy.
'We are aware that Vesuvius might be erupting and we want to get ourselves
organised in a planned and proper way and not be running around like scalded
cats frightened about what is going to happen,' he said.
Mr Leach asked for the moratorium, which blocks foreign takeovers of ITV
companies and which is due to end in January, to be extended.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Cook attacks Tory pit policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that British Coal is about to shut down 12 pits as part of its
restructuring programme triggered a furious debate in the Commons yesterday,
with Labour accusing the government of issuing false assurances about the
industry's future.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said ministers had
fraudulently suggested in a white paper in the spring that they would
reprieve 12 pits that had been marked for closure.
'The white paper has not saved a single miner's job, and it was not intended
to,' he said. Addressing himself to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, Mr Cook said: 'The only job it was intended to save was yours and
that of your junior minister for energy (Mr Tim Eggar).'
Mr Cooke was opening a debate on the industry that was called by the
opposition. There was some criticism of the government from its own
backbenchers. But, although a few Tories looked likely to abstain on
Labour's motion criticising the pit closure programme, the government seemed
assured of a majority.
Last March the government completed a coal review that raised the industry's
hopes with promises to save a dozen pits from closure. But British Coal said
recently that it was on the point of shutting down these pits, and that
others might close soon afterwards.
Before the debate more than 300 miners and their families had lobbied
parliament.
Addressing the lobby, Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM mineworkers'
union, said the aim of the action was to maintain public pressure on the
issue. But he warned: 'Tory rebels voting for a common-sense policy are as
rare as snowflakes in . . . July.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Ulster committee wins new backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS moved closer to establishing a select committee on Northern
Ireland yesterday when its procedure committee decided to examine how such a
body might be composed.
The Labour party, which was opposed to re-opening the controversial issue,
accused the government of doing a secret deal with the Ulster unionists, who
have long favoured the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the
work of the Northern Ireland Office.
Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, made clear his
support for a select committee urging the government 'to look at our report
and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990, supported the
establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the appropriate
time.
Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the
Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their
'pay-off' to the Ulster unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons
defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year.
The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British
parliament might set up such a committee.
Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, stressed that there
was 'no question of simply adopting or endorsing the report of the
Hume-Adams dialogue'.
His comments yesterday are likely to be welcomed by Downing Street. The UK
government has continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put
forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA.
Mr Reynolds praised Mr Hume for his efforts to start a peace process, but
said it needed a wider base.
The prospects of the Hume-Adams plan being accepted by the UK government
further receded yesterday after Mr Adams helped to carry the coffin of
Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road fish shop blast
at the weekend. Unionists and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, attacked Mr Adams's action.
Mr Hume yesterday defended his talks with Mr Adams, saying that he had taken
a risk in difficult circumstances.
Although the Hume-Adams proposals for peace will be discussed tomorrow at a
meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, the prime minister, both
governments now appear to be more interested in reviving the stalled
'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick. A soldier was
charged last night with the attempted murder of Mr Eddie Copeland, a leading
Republican, outside Mr Begley's home. Mr Copeland was among mourners outside
the Begley home in the Republican Ardoyne area of Belfast when he was hit in
the stomach by a bullet.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Fall in SIB fraud referrals likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, referred 23
cases of investment business fraud to the police or Serious Fraud Office for
criminal investigation in the six months to the end of September this year,
Alison Smith writes.
This brings the total number of referrals since the Financial Services Act
1988 to 196, but suggests that the total for 1993-94 could be below the
record 60 cases in 1992-93.
Investigations have now been completed in 134 cases, and the subsequent
trials have so far led to 98 convictions and 14 acquittals.
The statistics show that 16 of the 23 cases referred for criminal
investigation are of so-called 'authorised' groups that have passed the
tests of 'fitness and properness' needed for membership in a self-regulatory
body.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Ministers back down on BR franchise bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT bowed to pressure from Conservative rebels last night and
agreed to allow British Rail to bid for franchises to run some services
after it is privatised.
Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman in the Lords, outlined
a possible compromise on franchising during his closing speech on the third
reading of the bill in the Lords.
He said the government had dropped plans to reverse an amendment to the bill
which allows BR to compete freely for franchises with private-sector
companies.
The government had earlier said that the amendment, moved by Lord Peyton, a
former transport secretary, would wreck the bill by allowing BR to maintain
control over most of its routes.
However, the government will table further amendments to restrict BR's
rights to bid when the bill returns to the Commons on Monday for its final
stages.
Lord Caithness said there were 'certain circumstances' in which it might be
appropriate for BR to be a franchisee. But the corporation should not be
treated in the same way as other potential bidders.
The government has not yet decided exactly what restrictions to place on BR.
However, the conditions would probably include a ceiling on the number of
bids, and transparent accounting to prevent cross-subsidisation of
loss-making services from revenues on other routes.
Restrictions along these lines would allow the government to argue that it
was meeting the spirit of the Lords amendment without allowing BR an unfair
advantage in competing against independent bidders.
The compromise follows growing unease on the Tory backbenches, especially
among MPs from southern constituencies who fear a post-privatisation
backlash from commuters.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, has already offered concessions
on railcards and pension guarantees in an effort to build support for the
bill.
However, Lord Caithness said the government would not accept a separate
Lords amendment giving the trustees of the railway pensions fund power to
veto public spending.
The government's willingness to compromise was welcomed by opposition MPs,
who have argued strongly that BR should be allowed a free rein in bidding
for franchises.
But Mr Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said a
compromise would be a 'Pyrrhic victory' which would force BR to 'bid with
their hands tied behind their back'.
'The government will place various wrecking amendments in the bill to ensure
that BR is an impotent bidder of last resort,' he said.
Lord Clinton-Davis, Labour's transport spokesman in the Lords, said the
government compromise was 'another piece of Mr MacGregor's sleight of hand'.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Great and good control Tory asset vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORDS, KNIGHTS and senior military officials are among those who nominally
control the vehicle which owns the principal assets of the Conservative
party.
Documents obtained from Companies House show that Bourne Association, a
private limited company, is the most important of a number of companies
intimately linked to the Conservative party.
Mr Lewis Fialko, the accountant who audits Bourne, is a shareholder despite
possible breaches of guidelines on independence.
Bourne was formally identified as a 'quasi-subsidiary' when disclosed as
part of an initiative to provide greater financial information in the 1993
Conservative party accounts. The company owns the leasehold on Conservative
Central Office, which was valued in the Bourne accounts for the year to
March 31 1992 at Pounds 7.25m, down from Pounds 12.5m in the previous year.
The Conservative accounts, for the year to March 31 1993, show the property
has again been revalued downwards to Pounds 5.25m.
The Bourne documents also show that the Royal Bank of Scotland, with which
the Conservative party had a Pounds 15.3m overdraft in the 1993 accounts,
has a charge over the office. It shows the building as a leasehold dated in
1958 between London County Council and Limes Property Investments.
There are 26 issued shares in Bourne, held by individuals which in 1991
included Lords Beaverbrook and Chelmer, Major-General Sir Brian
Wyldbore-Smith, former director of the Conservative party's board of
finance, and Major-General H. Ramsay, who gives his address as Conservative
Central Office.
Bourne Association is one of five 'quasi-subsidiaries' from which the party
draws financial benefit, although there is no direct shareholding by the
Conservatives. There are two other so-called river companies: Colne
Association and Arun Association.
Their articles of association are broadly the same as Bourne, showing that
they exist to 'promote the welfare of the British peoples . . . free
enterprise and individual freedom and liberty . . . and further the objects
of the Conservative and Unionist Party'.
They say they accept gifts which they will maintain as long as they think
fit, and give away all or any of their property or assets necessary to
promote their objectives.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Plea on Bank by ex-Treasury chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAMPAIGN to give the Bank of England independent control over monetary
policy gained another convert last night when Sir Peter Middleton, until two
years ago the top civil servant at the Treasury, said the change would help
bring down inflation.
Giving evidence to the Commons' Treasury and civil service committee, Sir
Peter said he favoured a long-term inflation target of between zero and 2
per cent. This compares with the government's target for underlying
inflation of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
Sir Peter is now chairman of the Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment group,
and was Treasury permanent secretary between 1983 and 1991. He said letting
the Bank set interest rates rather than the chancellor would mean that the
government had fewer levers to pull in managing economic policy. But if
Britain agreed that keeping inflation low in the long-term was important, an
independent Bank was 'probably the best way' to achieve this.
The evidence from Sir Peter surprised some members of the committee because,
while he was at the Treasury, it was assumed he was among the leaders in the
fight to prevent any handing over of interest rate responsibility to the
Bank.
Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, Bank of England governor between 1973 and
1983 and also in favour of independence for the central bank, told the
committee that Britain would have had greater success in combating inflation
if the Bank had been able to set interest rates free from political
pressures.

FT  28 OCT 93 / R-R wins Pounds 140m Army contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and power equipment group, has won a Pounds
140m contract from the Ministry of Defence to produce the next generation of
bridges for the Army's Royal Engineers.
The contract is expected to double employment to 250 at Wolverhampton-based
Thompson Defence Projects, a Rolls-Royce unit set up to develop the bridges.
It will also create jobs at subcontractors, including Unipower, the
specialist vehicles producer with plants at Watford, Hertfordshire, and
Tipton, West Midlands.
Thompson was awarded the development contract for the bridging system in
1987, but yesterday's announcement of a production contract is a boost for
its export drive.
Rolls-Royce said a version of the bridge was a contender for the US Army's
heavy assault bridge, and a number of continental countries had expressed
interest.
The Bridging for the 1990s (BR90) system is a family of bridges based on
seven modular panels of aluminium alloy welded fabrication, interchangeable
throughout the various bridge types. These can span gaps from nine to 62
metres. The aim is to save time on bridge construction. The system will be
deployed with units of the Royal Engineers in Germany and the UK and is
planned to enter service between January 1996 and June 1997.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Adams is condemned for carrying bomber's coffin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS of the Hume-Adams peace plan for Ulster being accepted by the
UK government further receded yesterday after Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of
the IRA's political wing, helped to carry the coffin of an IRA bomber.
Meanwhile, the Commons moved closer to establishing a select committee on
Northern Ireland when its procedure committee decided to examine how such a
body might be composed.
Politicians from all sides attacked the actions of Mr Adams who shouldered
the coffin of Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road
fish shop blast at the weekend.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We have seen
photographs . . . of people in abject misery as a result of what happened in
the Shankill Road and (now) we see Mr Adams carrying the coffin supporting
one of those who did it.'
The Democratic Unionist party yesterday condemned the 'hypocrisy' of Mr
Adams, and said the show of solidarity between the Sinn Fein leader and the
bomber of men, women and children indicated 'the nationalist leopard is
incapable of changing its blood red spots'.
Mr Adams last night defended his actions. He said his attendance had been
made a matter of controversy. If he had been absent, it would have had the
same affect.
In the Commons Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee,
made clear his support for a select committee by urging the government 'to
look at our report and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990,
supported the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the
appropriate time.
Labour, which was opposed to re-opening the issue, accused the government of
doing a secret deal with the Ulster Unionist party, which has long favoured
the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the work of the Northern
Ireland Office.
Downing Street said the establishment of a select committee was a matter for
the Commons. However, the establishment of such a committee has become a
touchstone of the relationship between the government and the unionists.
Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the
Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their
'pay-off' to the Ulster Unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons
defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year.
The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British
parliament might set up such a committee.
In Dublin yesterday, Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, stressed
there was 'no question of simply adopting or endorsing the report of the
Hume-Adams dialogue'.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Tumim warns of jail overcrowding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRISON overcrowding will undermine the significant improvements made in the
country's jails and reduce their impact in cutting crime, Judge Stephen
Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, warned yesterday following the
publication of his annual report.
Judge Tumim said that a lot of prisons were beginning to play a crime
prevention role by encouraging prisoners to lead law-abiding lives and learn
something positive. Overcrowding would mean a return to 'warehousing' of
prisoners who came out as bad as they went in.
'There is a real risk of going back to overcrowded jails and crisis
management which would be disastrous,' he said.
Judge Tumim's report says that the prison building programme has created a
number of new prisons with model regimes which function well.
However, many prisoners are still held in Victorian prisons on cramped urban
sites. These lack the space and facilities to occupy prisoners' time
constructively, he said.
Judge Tumim commends the progress made on improving sanitary and catering
arrangements in prisons. But this has sometimes been at the expense of
upgrading or creating facilities for out-of-cell activity, he says.
He added that the privatisation of the management at some prisons appears to
have encouraged prison staff to be more innovative and flexible in their
work.
'This may produce a growing recognition that establishments could be run
more effectively, with more humane lives for prisoners, more job
satisfaction and greater value for money, if staff . . . are used more
flexibly and sensibly,' he added.
The report condemns the handling by the Prison Service of the contracting
out of prison education services.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Court backs warehouse club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed warehouse club to be built in Essex by Costco is a genuine
wholesale operation and not a 'sham' designed to circumvent planning
restrictions on retail outlets, a High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Giving his judgment, Mr Justice Schiemann upheld the planning permission
given by Thurrock Borough Council for Costco to build the 12,881 sq m
discount store near Grays town centre.
He rejected the legal challenge brought by three supermarket companies, J.
Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco, all of which had argued that planning
permission for the store should be overturned because the proposed club
would be a retail outlet rather than a wholesale one as claimed by Costco.
The judge ruled that the council was correct in deciding that restrictions
on Costco's operations meant that the warehouse club would be a wholesale
operation aimed at local businesses, rather than a general retail outlet
aimed at the general public.
Costco would only allow bulk-purchases - such as a minimum of 20lbs of
potatoes - and offer only a limited range of goods in any product range.
This amounted to a deliberate attempt to exclude ordinary members of the
public wanting to buy a few small items, he said.
The criteria for joining the club - restricting shoppers to either business
users or those from specified employment groups - also supported its
intention to operate as a wholesaler, he said.
Concerns that Costco might develop the store into a retail outlet on the
'thin end of the wedge' principle had been addressed by an agreement between
the company and Thurrock planners, who restricted sales to the general
public. The judge rejected claims by the supermarkets that this agreement
was too vague to be enforceable.
The scheme could be taken at face value rather than as a sham designed to
circumvent planning rules, he said.
Mr Justice Schiemann also rejected the supermarkets' argument that the
council should have considered a letter from the Department of the
Environment, which recommended that warehouse clubs should be treated as
retailers rather than wholesalers.
The supermarkets were refused leave to appeal and ordered to pay the costs
of both Costco and the council.

THE Ministry of Agriculture's first estimate of the UK cereals harvest is
19.7m tonnes, down 2.4m tonnes (11 per cent) on last year's 22.1m, mainly as
a result of set-aside.
The figure is based on the provisional results of the first 1993 farm-based
Cereals Production Survey of England and Wales and on preliminary production
estimates from Scotland and Northern Ireland.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Go-ahead by BP for N Sea platform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTS for construction of the platform for the North Sea's Andrew Field
were placed yesterday by BP Exploration, the operator.
The company placed the contract for the steel jacket with Highland
Fabricators of Nigg, Ross-shire, and for the deck with Trafalgar House of
Teesside. The 25-month construction phase begins next summer.
Development of the Andrew field, 140 miles north-east of Aberdeen, has yet
to be given board approval, but construction work could also begin next
summer.
The two losers in the order battle are the UIE yard, at Clydebank, Glasgow,
which bid for the deck, and the Italian company Belleli, which bid for the
jacket.
Highland Fabricators, which employs 800, said the order provided work
equivalent to between 350 and 400 jobs.
No figures were disclosed, but the deck order is thought to be worth Pounds
100m and the support structure Pounds 25m.
The value of the UK's North Sea oil reserves fell by 7 per cent last month
because of declining oil prices and a stronger pound, economists at the
Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday in its monthly North Sea index.
Output from production platforms in the North Sea was valued at Pounds 21.2m
a day, compared with Pounds 22.9m in August. But gas production rose by 23
per cent to a four-month peak as more gas fields came on stream and output
rose to meet winter demand.
The gas was worth Pounds 8m a day, giving a total oil and gas production
value of Pounds 29.1m.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Political Notebook: Heroic assumptions and political
realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public spending round to accompany the introduction of next month's
unified Budget is nearly complete. After two months of wrangling the full
cabinet will today begin taking some real decisions.
There are one or two more rows to come. Under the new system the important
players around the cabinet table are unwilling to settle their budgets until
the last moment.
The neat theory that the creation of a cabinet committee - the so-called EDX
 -to thrash out the government's priorities would speed up the process has
proved to be wishful thinking. Collective decision-making has its price.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will be at the head of a queue
arguing that big spending cuts must fall elsewhere. He will be carrying with
him, of course, the letter to Mr John Major from 14 Tory MPs threatening a
backbench rebellion if the Treasury gets its way.
Mr Peter Lilley, Mr David Hunt, Mrs Virginia Bottomley and Mr John MacGregor
will be among others appealing to the collective good sense of their
colleagues. Even the urbane Mr Douglas Hurd wants a full hearing.
But if not today, then by next week the cabinet will agree a set of figures
which will meet the remit set in July for public spending to be more or less
frozen in real terms for the next three years.
To do anything else would be to undermine fatally the notion that Mr Kenneth
Clarke is serious about tackling the public sector borrowing requirement.
And whatever the success of last minute appeals to the full cabinet, it is
clear just where the axe will cut most deeply.
The Treasury has already announced that all Whitehall budgets will be fixed
on the heroic assumption that public-sector pay will not rise at all in cash
terms next year.
Teachers, nurses, policeman and civil servants are thus expected to take a
cut in living standards. In reality ministers know that most of them will
get a pay increase - at the expense of higher public-sector unemployment.
But the ministers who joined Mr Clarke in the deliberations of EDX decided
at the outset they had no other choice. Without a pay freeze the numbers
would not add up.
One participant was reminded of the hoary joke about the economist stranded
on a desert island with cases and cases of food but nothing to open them
with. The economist 'assumed' a can-opener.
Other assumptions made when the process started back in June have
disappeared already in harsh political realities. EDX, it was said, would
get to grips with the inexorable rise in the Pounds 80bn social security
budget - representing nearly a third of all public spending.
Instead social security will emerge as one of the biggest 'winners' of the
negotiations. True, Mr Lilley will be taking some harsh measures to curb the
growth of invalidity benefit payments. There may also be a fierce clampdown
on fraud and, probably, new restrictions on benefit payments to cover
mortgage interest.
But the combination of a precarious Commons majority and a series of
manifesto pledges has allowed the rightwing social security security to
defend most of his programmes.
The Treasury cannot count the number of times Mr Lilley has responded to a
demand for the means-testing of child benefit or cuts in unemployment
benefit with: 'It would never get through the Commons'.
So the social security budget - along with those for legal aid and
agricultural support payments - will continue to rise in real terms. So too
will those of health and education - though at a slower rate and at the cost
of accepting a few more heroic assumptions about efficiency gains.
Health is protected by a manifesto pledge, education because it was once Mr
Major's big idea.
Instead the main victims of EDX have been the traditional 'soft' targets for
all governments: capital spending on housing and roads, the local authority
grant settlement, inner city regeneration schemes and, for all Mr Rifkind's
protests, defence.
The participants have also discovered something else. The term unified
budget is a misnomer. For all the talk of bringing together spending and
revenue decisions, the Treasury has not allowed any discussion of the
trade-off between the two sides of the balance sheet. It is perhaps not
surprising that some ministers believe the whole concept of a unified budget
will not long outlive its creator, Mr Norman Lamont.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mexico to join 'border bank'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Mexico yesterday announced agreement on setting up a North
American Development Bank to help finance environmental and infrastructure
projects along their border.
The Nadbank, along with a new Border Environmental Co-operation Commission,
is expected to play a critical role in winning support for the imperilled
North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada.
A Nadbank was originally proposed by Congressman Esteban Torres of
California. Its establishment has won his endorsement of Nafta and other
undecided Hispanic Congressmen may follow suit.
Yesterday's announcement also triggered the endorsements of the National
Council of La Raza, the biggest US Hispanic organisation, and of
environmental groups such as the National Wildlife Federation and the
Natural Resources Defence Council.
Waverers have come down on both sides of the fence, but Nafta opponents
still outnumber its supporters in Congress, particularly in the House of
Representatives.
Mr Jeffrey Shafer, assistant US Treasury secretary for international
affairs, said Mexico and the US would each contribute Dollars 225m (Pounds
149m) over four years in paid-up capital to Nadbank. 'Through market
borrowings, we believe we can leverage the paid-in capital into Dollars 2bn
initially, perhaps eventually up to Dollars 3bn.'
Nadbank loans or guarantees would back around Dollars 2bn of environmental
infrastructure projects along the border.

The Netherlands and India are to sign an investment promotion and protection
agreement, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, said in India
yesterday, Stefan Wagstyl writes from New Delhi.
Mr Lubbers is leading a business delegation seeking to expand commerce with
India in the wake of the 1991 economic reforms. Their trip follows visits
this year by delegations from other countries.
He welcomed India's economic liberalisation but warned Delhi against moving
too slowly. 'Too much caution in liberalising the economy risks eroding the
confidence of foreign investors in India's willingness and capability to
carry out reforms,' he said.

CARIBBEAN Community countries worried about the North American Free Trade
Agreement have changed their stance and are to support US President Bill
Clinton's efforts to have it implemented.
The members of Caricom and several countries in Central America had
consistently argued they would lose markets in the US and Canada to Mexico
if Nafta was implemented. They feared a more competitive Mexico, with free
access to its northern neighbours, would drive Caribbean and Central
American products out of the market.
The community now says it fully supports the agreement, and it and other
countries in the region, 'will have to learn to live with Nafta'.
'The region is committed to Nafta, to the extent that it will support all
efforts to have the legislation approved by the US Congress,' said Mr
Patrick Manning, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago.
Mr Edwin Carrington, the community's secretary general, and the region will
continue to support Nafta, providing its concerns are being taken into
account. The Caribbean's change of heart comes after the region started
lobbying legislators in Washington to consider proposed legislation for
transitional arrangements to protect the region's markets from Mexican
competition.
Caribbean countries are asking US legislators to support proposals for a
three-year 'grace period' during which the region's exports to the US and
Canada will have parity with Mexican products. The proposal aims at giving
them time to negotiate possible membership of Nafta.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US blocks international fair tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to impose multilateral discipline on governments which unfairly tax
foreign companies are in jeopardy following a US decision to opt out of that
part of the Uruguay Round package.
Negotiators said yesterday other countries in the Uruguay Round of talks on
world trade liberalisation might have no choice but to follow the US lead,
leaving multinational companies vulnerable to tax discrimination wherever
they are based.
The issue has become sensitive over the past year, following threats by the
US administration to boost taxes on foreign companies operating in the US.
This is based on allegations that foreign companies engineer comparative
advantage against local rivals by manipulating their accounts between
different national jurisdictions to minimise tax exposure in the US.
The US decision to press for an opt-out for that part of the proposed
Uruguay Round services agreement which guarantees that foreign companies are
in general terms treated in the same way as local companies comes after
months of haggling over clauses which protect national independence on tax
policy. Consensus was reached last week, with the single exception of the
US.
A negotiator said that after opting out, the US treasury would be able to
discriminate as it liked in tax policy without facing the danger of a
challenge through Gatt's dispute settlement system. 'They say they would not
abuse their freedom, but other countries have got reason to be nervous,' he
said.
Critics of the US say such an opt-out would be illegal in other contexts.
For example, no government would be allowed to levy value added tax at a
higher rate on foreign companies than on local companies.
'We knew the US had problems, but didn't expect them to take such a radical
position,' an EC negotiator said.
Gatt officials say the new draft clause does nothing to curb national
autonomy to treat foreign and local companies differently, so long as
differences are not arbitrary or protectionism in disguise. Discrimination
would be legitimate if it were intended to ensure 'equitable or effective'
collection of taxes, to safeguard the tax base, or pre-empt tax evasion.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is handling a growing number of
trade disputes but resolving fewer of them, a development which underscores
warnings of an outbreak of trade friction if the Gatt world trade talks
fail.
A report to the governing council yesterday by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt
director-general, shows that requests for consultations under Gatt disputes
procedures rose to 26 in the 12 months to September, from 11 in the previous
year. Independent disputes panels to probe eight new trade complaints were
established in the past 12 months, the same as in the previous period.
However, the number of panel recommendations adopted by the Gatt council
fell from eight to only one in the past 12 months.
As many as 12 panel reports in the year to September, were not implemented.
In five cases the offending country made action conditional on a successful
outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks.
Mr Sutherland says in the report that Gatt members can only negotiate new
obligations with conviction if they are confident trading partners will
observe existing ones fully.
Yesterday's council meeting was dominated by a series of disputes at
different stages of resolution. The European Community, backed by African
and Caribbean states, refused for the third time to adopt a panel report
condemning its now abandoned banana import regime.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: A spot of competition for India's
bootleggers - The opening of a huge but long closed liquor market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPTY Johnnie Walker bottles are so much in demand in India that they sell
for up to Rs50 (Pounds 1), as long as the labels are intact. They are
popular with bootleggers who fill the empties with locally brewed hooch.
About 60 per cent of the Scotch and other international-brand liquor sold in
India is counterfeited in this way; less than 20 per cent is legally
imported; the rest is smuggled.
For years the world's leading drinks groups could do little to meet this
pent-up demand. Successive governments banned imports except for luxury
hotels, diplomats and duty-free sales to travellers.
But, with the liberalisation programme launched by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the
prime minister, international drinks groups are being allowed back into
India.
The four largest groups, Guinness's United Distillers, Grand Metropolitan's
IDV, Allied-Lyons' Hiram Walker and Seagram, all have plans to start
producing and selling their drinks in India.
They are entering a fast-growing but difficult market. Hard liquor is
anathema to strict Hindus and Moslems alike and a commitment to its
eradication is enshrined in the constitution. In practice, only the state of
Gujarat is dry and consumption of spirits per head in the rest of the
country is among the world's highest.
Indian drinkers consume an estimated 230m cases of spirits a year, about
two-thirds of it rough country-made liquor called arrack so crudely produced
that deaths from poisoning are not uncommon.
Most of the remaining one-third of sales, about 75m cases, is accounted for
by larger distilleries making a range of spirits, mainly whiskies with
English brand-names such as Royal Velvet and McDowell's No 1. Sales of
foreign-brand liquors (including counterfeits) are roughly estimated at 1.5m
cases.
The international drinks groups are aiming at a niche between the top local
drinks, which sell for up to Rs500 a bottle, and the international brands,
selling at Rs1,500-plus on the black market. The target customers are urban
middle-class Indians who are tempted by foreign brands but cannot afford
black market prices.
'There are now 100m-150m people with more money to spend, with changing
lifestyles and aspirations, who want internationally-known quality
products,' says Mr LP Jaiswal, chairman of Jagatjit Industries, a leading
Indian drinks company.
Mr Tony Greener, chairman and chief executive of Guinness, the UK group
which owns United Distillers, says: 'We believe there are outstanding
opportunities to be developed.'
The three British-owned groups are entering India via joint ventures: United
Distillers with UB group, India's largest drinks producer; Hiram Walker with
Jagatjit Industries; and IDV probably with Narang Industries, a Delhi-based
distiller, though a deal has yet to be completed. Seagram of Canada is
establishing a 100-per-cent-owned marketing subsidiary but will find a local
production partner.
The international companies have modest production targets of less than
100,000 cases each a year, partly because of the difficulties of operating
in India and partly because of government restrictions.
The Indian government is anxious that foreign liquor should not be a drain
on the foreign exchange account, so officials have stipulated that bulk
imports of malt liquor - the essence of Scotch - and other ingredients will
have to be matched by exports.
Since exports may grow only slowly, they will limit the scale of imports.
Moreover, there will be no increases in overall licensed production
capacity.
United and UB are each investing about Pounds 3m in a venture which will
build a bottling plant in Bombay and produce about 50,000 cases a year of
Indian-distilled and blended whisky and 30,000 cases of locally-bottled
Scotch, either Vat 69 or Black &amp; White. Hiram Walker and its partner plan to
produce 30,000 cases of locally-bottled Teacher's whisky and another 30,000
of blends with locally-made alcohol.
IDV is considering local production of Smirnoff vodka, Gilbey's gin and at
least one whisky. Seagram's is planning a Pounds 5m investment in bottling
Scotch and in producing Indian spirits and fruit juices, as well as
wine-making.
None of the ventures is expected to make a quick profit. Mr Devin Narang,
managing director of Narang Industries, says: 'In the short term we have to
build the brands. But in the long term the prospects are good.'
Indian drinks executives do not expect the new initiatives to drive the
bootleggers out of business. For one thing, the newly-introduced brands will
themselves be the subject of counterfeiting. For another, the international
groups have no plans to produce their top brands in India. There will be no
Indian-bottled Johnnie Walker. So, the second-hand bottle sellers will still
have a market.

FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: 'Bribery' charge against Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORRUPTION in Mexico yesterday resurfaced as an issue in the debate over
Nafta as a congressional committee heard from a businessman who claimed he
was offered the chance to pay a bribe while representing IBM.
Congressman John LaFalce, the anti-Nafta chairman of the House committee on
small business, brought Mr Kaveh Moussavi to testify because of concerns
about Mexican corruption and the 'safety of the air-travelling public in and
out of Mexico'.
Mr Moussavi, who acted as an agent for IBM in an attempt to renew Mexico's
air traffic control system, repeated charges that he was asked by men he
said were Mexican officials for a Dollars 1m (Pounds 662,000) payment to the
government's solidarity programme to secure the Dollars 21m contract for the
US computer maker. 'If this is what the government of Mexico is capable of
doing to a Dollars 75bn company. . . what hope is there for your
constituency?' he asked.
An official of the Mexican government called the allegations unfounded and
said they had been reviewed by the Mexican controller general and the
Congress.
Mr Moussavi said he had IBM documents asserting the Mexican air traffic
control system represented a 'menace to the air travelling public' because
the existing computer and radar systems were not integrated.
This charge was disputed by Congressman Joel Hefley, who said he had a
document saying IBM 'had no reason to believe the current air traffic
control system was unsafe'.

FT  28 OCT 93 / US durable goods orders still rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US DURABLE goods orders rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent in September,
providing further evidence of an accelerating industrial economy in the
third quarter of this year.
Last month's figures would have been even better - up 2.7 per cent - but for
another sharp drop in orders for military aircraft, which more than offset
strong gains in the car sector and caused the transportation component to
incur a 1.8 per cent decline.
Nevertheless the overall index, also up by a revised 2.6 per cent in August,
has risen in three of the last four months. The August and September gains
were the first recorded in consecutive months for a full year. New orders
now stand 8.3 per cent above the levels of a year ago.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the latest data were 'another sign of
continued economic growth'. The extent of the third-quarter advance will be
revealed today with the publication of gross domestic product returns for
the three-month period.
Yesterday Merrill Lynch, in its economic commentary, predicted 2.7 per cent
real growth in GDP (nearly 3.5 per cent in the non-farm sector). The
securities firm also said expansion in the fourth quarter 'could be as
strong as 5 per cent'.
The strength in new orders for durable goods last month was also matched by
shipments, up 1.9 per cent to a record Dollars 137bn (Pounds 91bn). Here the
transportation sector led the way, with new car deliveries more than
compensating for the decline in aircraft. New car and truck sales in
mid-October were running at their highest annual rate (13.5m units) in the
last 18 months and 18.5 per cent above the levels of the same period last
year.
But the improvement in shipments last month, recorded across all industrial
sectors, means that this index now stands 7.6 per cent above the level of a
year ago.
Unfilled orders for durable goods also declined for the seventh consecutive
month in September by 1.0 per cent to Dollars 428.8bn, the lowest level
since June, 1988. Factoring out transportation, this measurement dropped by
only 0.1 per cent in the month.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Clinton delivers healthcare reform plan to Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday finally delivered to Congress the
1,300-page legislative text for his much-postponed healthcare reform plan.
The bill, if passed next year, would be phased in to guarantee universal
healthcare coverage by the start of 1998, a year later than the
administration had once hoped.
'I have one simple request. I ask that before Congress finishes its work
next year you pass and I sign a bill that will actually guarantee health
security to every American,' Mr Clinton told congressional leaders in the
marble hall of the Capitol yesterday.
This universal coverage would be achieved by requiring all employers to
offer health insurance to their employees and to pay for much of the cost,
with government subsidies to ease the sting for smaller businesses as well
as poorer families.
All but the very largest businesses would be grouped into regional alliances
which would function as purchasing pools, with the aim of driving down
insurance premiums. These alliances would offer a variety of health plans.
The choice between these would lie with the individual, but the portion of
the premium paid by his or her employer would stay at 80 per cent of the
average premium offered by the alliance. The percentage paid by the
individual would vary, depending on which plan he or she chose.
Among the most important modifications to the original draft of the plan is
a provision for capping the overall amount of subsidies provided by the
government to businesses and lower-income families. If the cap is exceeded,
the president would have to go to Congress with proposals for dealing with
the overrun.
Senior administration officials insisted this did not involve any
repudiation of the guarantee of universal coverage, but said it was
important not to create another entitlement programme that could continue on
autopilot.
In other changes, the administration now proposes expanding the subsidies
provided to small businesses by including companies with up to 75 employees,
instead of 50 as originally planned.
Every plan - including those of health maintenance organisations which
normally limit members to a small pool of doctors and hospitals - would be
required to offer the option of visiting an outside doctor, for an
additional premium.
The administration's budget specialists have reworked their numbers, and now
estimate the plan will cut a net Dollars 58bn (Pounds 38.4bn) from the
projected budget deficit over the six years from 1995 to 2000.
The cost to the federal government of extending coverage to 37m people
currently uninsured, including subsidies to small businesses, would be
Dollars 116bn over the 1995-2000 period.
The cost of adding prescription drugs to the existing Medicare programme for
the elderly would be Dollars 66bn, while long-term nursing care - a benefit
which will not be fully phased in until 2002 - would cost Dollars 65bn in
1995-2000.
Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said his
office had used the most conservative assumptions - including an inflation
rate of 3.5 per cent, higher than in the original draft - and added a 15 per
cent cushion for unforeseen contingencies.
Offsetting this, the administration expects to raise Dollars 65bn from a 75
cents-a-packet tax on cigarettes, and Dollars 24bn from a levy on big
companies which opt not to join the regional alliances. Another Dollars
189bn is expected to be saved on the federal Medicare and Medicaid
programmes.
Mr Panetta insisted the numbers had been carefully analysed and were
credible. However, in the first document the White House issued its
mathematicians concluded there were only five years in the 1995-2000 period,
necessitating an embarrassing amplification.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE south-eastern states of the US, one of the fastest-growing regions in
the country, scored another success on Tuesday night when the city of
Charlotte, North Carolina, was awarded a franchise to run a new professional
American football team.
The owners of the 28 teams that make up the current National Football League
unanimously chose Charlotte over four other cities: St Louis, Baltimore,
Jacksonville and Memphis.
The business group behind the Charlotte bid, led by restaurant owner and
former footballer Mr Jerry Richardson, will pay Dollars 140m (Pounds 93m) to
the NFL for the rights to own the team. This compares with the Dollars 16m
Seattle and Tampa Bay paid when the NFL last expanded in 1976.
The owners chose Charlotte because it offered an opportunity for the NFL to
expand into new territory. The city is at the heart of the 'New South' - the
states of the civil war confederacy now enjoying an economic renaissance.
The new team will be called the Carolina Panthers, and will draw upon the
support of 10m people who live within 100 miles of Charlotte. The NFL owners
were impressed by the group's plans to build a privately financed Dollars
160m sports stadium in the city.
More than Dollars 100m of the cost has already been raised through the sale
of 50,000 permanent seating licences, which Carolinans bought in the hope of
bringing professional football to their region.
The cities which lost out in Tuesday's vote have another chance to join the
NFL. The owners were due to choose two new franchises on Tuesday, but after
their failure to agree on a second city they will try again on November 30.
St Louis and Baltimore, which lost NFL franchises in the 1980s when the
owners moved their teams to other cities, are favourites.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration appears resigned to the fact that Mr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, will not be able to return to his
homeland by Saturday, the date set in July's Governor's Island agreement.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said yesterday that this
was 'less and less likely' given recent developments in Haiti, where
pro-Aristide legislators have either gone into hiding or left the country.
Earlier in the week President Bill Clinton was more optimistic, though he
admitted he had been disappointed before over Haiti.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said during his visit to Latvia
it was more important to 'achieve harmony and tranquillity' in Haiti than to
be 'fixed on a date' for Mr Aristide's return.
Mr Aristide himself is to give a speech at the United Nations today in which
he is expected again to commit himself to policies of national
reconciliation. But one of his key advisers in Washington, Mr Michael
Barnes, the former congressman from Maryland, was quoted yesterday as
saying: 'It would not be possible for him to go back with any sense of
security.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / Chretien says No to helicopter order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister-elect, yesterday reaffirmed his
intention to cancel a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.9bn) order for 50
European-built helicopters shortly after his Liberal party takes office
towards the end of next week.
The Liberals won 178 out of 295 seats in last Monday's general election.
Cancellation of the helicopter order was among the Liberals' most frequently
repeated campaign promises.
The European consortium, led by the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy,
together with its main Canadian partner, Paramax of Montreal, had hoped to
make a last-ditch appeal to Mr Chretien to include the helicopter order in a
wide-ranging defence policy review.
Speaking at a press conference in Ottawa, Mr Chretien said he would discuss
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with President
Bill Clinton in Seattle on November 19.
Although the Liberals plan to seek a a renegotiation of both the 1989
US-Canada free trade agreement and Nafta, which includes Mexico, Mr Chretien
hinted that the new government would avoid any precipitate action.
He noted that under the 1989 deal, the US must negotiate a subsidies and
anti-dumping code within seven years. 'This is a treaty with the US and they
have to proceed with it,' he said.
Business leaders believe the new cabinet will be more sympathetic to
business than the interventionist Trudeau administration, the last Liberal
government. 'Times have changed immensely,' said Mr Tim Reid, Canadian
Chamber of Commerce president. 'I think the Liberals have learned something
from being in opposition for nine years.'
At least two economic ministries are expected to be filled by veteran MPs
with backgrounds in commerce and industry. Mr Paul Martin, who ran one of
Canada's biggest shipping lines before entering politics, is a leading
contender for the finance or industry portfolio.
Mr Roy MacLaren, who is expected to become either trade or industry
minister, is a shareholder in a Toronto publishing business.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Tourism hit by shootings in Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHATEVER the motives of the lone gunman who shot dead three foreigners as
they dined late on Tuesday in the Cairo Semiramis Hotel, those in Egypt's
demoralised tourist trade are resigned to the fact that they may not matter
a jot.
Whether the 28-year-old man arrested over the shooting was an Islamic
fundamentalist or mentally disturbed, the effect is the same - to offer
further evidence that Egypt is not a safe place for foreign visitors.
Mr Andrew Quinlan, the shaken manager of the Semiramis, scarcely needed to
tell reporters yesterday morning that he thought the attack would hurt
already weak bookings. In the lobby, one Greek tour operator was already
pulling his clients out of the hotel, and out of Egypt. 'We've already
postponed two trips because of violence,' he said. 'This is enough.'
There is no hard evidence that the accused man was part of an 18-month
campaign waged by Islamic extremists to undermine the government by
attacking targets in the previously flourishing tourist industry. Some
witnesses claim he called out Islamic slogans as he fired on the two tables
of foreign diners, leaving another three men seriously injured. The slain
men, two Americans and a Frenchman, were lawyers attending a conference.
Interior ministry officials said the gunman was simply mentally disturbed.
But there is little doubt that for whatever motive, he had singled out
foreigners in the restaurant, where staff said there was the usual mix of
tourists and locals, and that the attack is the gravest against visitors to
Egypt in recent years. There is also no doubt that it has dealt a
potentially catastrophic blow to the tourist trade, already reeling from the
effects of previous attacks.
Tourist nights for the first eight months of the year are a third down on
last year. Revenue figures from tourism - officially calculated by
multiplying tourist nights by an estimated average spend of Dollars 125 per
visitor - are barely likely to clear Dollars 2bn this year after a record
Dollars 3bn in 1991-92. This in itself is vital, given that tourism vies
with Suez canal receipts, oil exports and remittances as the country's main
foreign exchange earner.
But more worrying is the longer-term effect of the industry's decline. Of
those hard currency earners, tourism is the only one that western economists
considered capable of significant growth in the next few years. From the
mid-1980s to the present, the sector had grown at an average 17.5 per cent a
year - far outstripping the economy's average growth of about 6 per cent
over the period.
More important to an economy with at least 20 per cent unemployment and
which needs to add a minimum of 400,000 to 500,000 jobs a year to keep pace
with labour force growth, tourism has long been the country's biggest job
creator. The tourism ministry and western economists reckon about one in 15
jobs across the economy depends directly on tourism.
The job factor is particularly significant in Upper Egypt, both the
country's poorest region and that most severely wracked by Islamic extremist
violence - two facts most observers in Egypt consider directly related. And
it is there, rather than in the newly developed resorts of Sinai and the Red
Sea, that the tourist slump is deepest. The Nile cruise business, Upper
Egypt's mainstay, is, according to one economist, 'in outright collapse'.
Hoteliers and cruise operators have already slashed prices, a trend many
worry may lead to an irrevocable drop in standards and facilities. But more
important is the effect of the slump on future investment and private sector
confidence.
The government makes no hard figures available on what proportion of total
investment, local and foreign, has been dedicated to tourism recently, but
it is commonly accepted to be the most flourishing sector outside the
capital-intensive oil industry.
'Tourism has very effectively mobilised savings in the private sector - it
is a real symbol of the private sector here. That might now be under
threat,' says one economist.
Several big tourism investment schemes are under way, particularly in the
Red Sea and Sinai where there have been no attacks and where tourist
arrivals remain healthy. Last week the International Finance Corporation,
the World Bank's private sector arm, approved financing for two local
companies in a Dollars 100m project to develop Ras Abu Soma, now a bare spit
of the Red Sea coast, into a multi-hotel golfing and diving resort.
But investment agencies in Cairo say all the schemes were entered into
before the present troubles, and fresh projects have dried up. 'What we have
noticed is a very sharp drop in the number of feasibility studies being
presented - almost to zero,' says one agency director.
In the short term there is little the industry can do but tighten security a
notch further, by installing X-ray checks on bags, and hope. The Semiramis
was widely regarded as Cairo's safest hotel - it is where US secretaries of
state usually stay.
In the meantime, the editors of the Egyptian Gazette can only rue yesterday
morning's banner headline. 'Egypt safest place on earth,' it read,
paraphrasing remarks made in Washington on Tuesday by President Hosni
Mubarak.
By and large Mr Mubarak is correct. The streets of Egypt's towns are far
safer than those of Washington or even parts of London. Attacks against
tourists are, as the government never tires of repeating, far fewer and less
lethal than in Turkey or Miami. But try telling that to the tour operators.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Bank fraud victims greet decision with jubilation or dismay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS to BCCI were sharply divided yesterday at the outcome of the
Luxembourg ruling, which will delay their receipt of any dividends from the
collapsed bank.
Mr Adil Elias was jubilant at the news. One of the three who brought the
appeal, he is an engineering consultant fromOrlando, Florida, and has been
at the centre of the campaign to fight for a greater contribution from the
government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder.
He was also elected to the BCCI creditors' committee at a meeting of
worldwide creditors in Wembley arena in May this year, when it was disclosed
that the amount the bank owed him was almost Dollars 2m.
The second man, who also stood as candidate for the creditors' committee but
withdrew, was Mr Hal Skolnik, a creditor in his own right and a director of
a company called Sheerbonnet. The third, Mr Assilaos Artiki, is a Greek
insurance broker.
Other creditors were clearly dismayed there would now be further delays
before they received back any of the money they had lost.
Mr Brian Smallridge, finance director of Bury metropolitan district council
and one of the six members of the British creditors' committee recognised by
the courts, said yesterday he was surprised and disappointed at the result.
Bury was one of the 30 UK local authorities which lost money in BCCI.
Referring to hopes that the UK government would seek a better deal with Abu
Dhabi, Mr Smallridge said yesterday: 'We would be delighted if Mr Major
could come back with a large amount of money, but I don't know what
influence he has.'
He expressed surprise that Mr Elias should claim support from most of the
creditors, pointing to a ballot of creditors last year, in which 93 per cent
of those responding approved of the plan.
But Mr Tony Scott, secretary of the BCCI Depositors Association and a member
of the creditors' committee, said he was pleased the Luxembourg court had
taken 'an independent line', because the settlement had been 'grossly
inadequate'. Now was the time for the creditor committees to take the lead,
he added.
Mr Donald Macleod, convener of the Western Isles council, which lost Pounds
24m as a result of the bank's collapse, expressed disappointment at the
court decision. 'The council, in common with the majority of BCCI investors,
agreed to accept the liquidator's proposal, not because it was ideal, but
because it was the best offer available and, indeed, the only realistic
course of action open to it,' he said.

BRITAIN appears to be exhibiting greater frustration at lack of progress in
talks with China on Hong Kong as an important British cabinet committee
meeting on the colony approaches in London on November 10.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator with China over Hong Kong,
said yesterday there 'remains a substantial gap' between the two sides. Sir
Robin, who is Britain's ambassador in Beijing, was speaking after the
opening session of the 15th round of talks.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten is to attend the cabinet session, called to
discuss whether to proceed with plans to extend the franchise for elections
due in the colony in 1994 and 1995.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Singapore trial enters second week

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SINGAPORE trial of three prominent local economists and two financial
journalists accused of breaking the republic's Official Secrets Act by
prematurely disclosing an official economic growth estimate enters its
second week today.
The prosecution, led by Mr Chan Sek Keong, the Attorney General, has brought
forward witnesses to back its claim that the defendants colluded in leaking
an official 1992 second-quarter estimate on economic growth.
The 4.6 per cent growth figure appeared in a report in the Singapore
Business Times, the republic's leading financial newspaper, at the end of
June last year. The figure was subsequently confirmed by the government.
The accused are Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics
department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de
facto central bank, Mr Manu Bhaskaran and Mr Raymond Foo, both economists at
the regional brokerage Crosby Securities, Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the
Business Times, and Mr Kenneth James, a journalist on the newspaper.
All have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Most of the case so far has concerned what did or did not happen at a
meeting in Mr Shanmugaratnam's office at the MAS in June 1992. The
prosecution alleges that Mr Shanmugaratnam communicated the estimate to Mr
Bhaskaran at the meeting. The prosecution also alleges that Mr Bhaskaran
subsequently communicated the figure to the other defendants.
Mr Shanmugaratnam, in a statement made to internal security department
officers which was read to the court, denied deliberately leaking the figure
to Mr Bhaskaran and colluding with him. Mr Bhaskaran, in a similar
statement, said he had caught sight of the figure among papers Mr
Shanmugaratnam had at the meeting and had subsequently concluded that it
referred to second-quarter growth.
Mr Daniel, in a statement read to the court, said he had published the
estimate figure even though he knew it would violate the Official Secrets
Act. Mr Daniel said he concluded that by not publishing the figure a false
picture might be conveyed of the state of Singapore's economy.
If found guilty each of the defendants faces a maximum of two years in jail
or a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 860) fine, or both. The trial is expected to go
on for another two weeks.

   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in BCCI said yesterday they regretted
the Luxembourg court's decision and pointed out that creditors would suffer.
Observing that the liquidation arrangements had been approved by the English
and Cayman courts, they said: 'The creditors, who voted 93 per cent in
favour of the arrangements last year, will be the losers. They have lost
their only opportunity for a timely payment. The liquidators have already
said that in the absence of the arrangements creditors cannot expect a
payment for as much as 10 years and that they may then recover less than 10
per cent of their claim.'
Abu Dhabi shareholders, including members of the ruling al-Nahayan family
and state-owned organisations, owned 77.4 per cent of BCCI. Diplomats
suggest there are now three options for Abu Dhabi: To consider an improved
offer above the 40 per cent payout which has now been rejected. But this
assumes that Abu Dhabi would be willing even to consider an improved offer
and if so whether it could be sure that an improved offer would pass muster
with Luxembourg law. They point out it will take some time to study the
judgment. To dig in its heels and challenge the liquidators to take Abu
Dhabi to court. But if this happened the issue could drag on for years with
creditors having little hope of recovering even 10 per cent. For
representatives from the majority shareholder and the liquidators to agree
parameters for a settlement and make a joint proposal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government has revised its inflation forecast for 1993-94 to
3 per cent, down from its budget calculation of 3.5 per cent.
The revision followed the announcement from the official statistics bureau
that the consumer price index rose by only 0.6 per cent in the September
quarter, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.2 per cent during the
quarter.
This is below all expectations of the market, which has been worried about
the weak Australian dollar during the past six months and about a federal
government budget loaded with new tax measures.
The biggest price rises were in tobacco products, meats and vegetables, and
motor vehicles. Price declines were biggest in mortgage interest rates,
credit card charges, clothing and pharmaceutical goods.
Australian business and trade unions have kept up the pressure on the
government of Mr Paul Keating to cut interest rates and kick along the slow
economic recovery.
More encouraging news concerned the official figures on skilled vacancies,
which have risen in two consecutive months. The September figure was 32 per
cent higher than a year ago.

UNITED Nations efforts to resolve the long-standing dispute over the former
Spanish territory of Western Sahara suffered a sharp setback yesterday after
the Polisario Front refused to enter scheduled talks with Morocco.
Initiated three months ago in the Western Sahara capital, Laayoune, these
were to have resumed in New York on Monday in the presence of the UN
mediator, Mr Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, a former foreign minister of Pakistan.
But the Polisario declined to participate because the Moroccan delegation
included former officials of the nationalist movement who have thrown in
their lot with Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the territory.
Announcing the breakdown, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary
general, spoke of a 'critical' situation.
But he reaffirmed his determination to work for the UN-supervised referendum
which was supposed to have been held almost two years ago but which
continues to be held up by a dispute over who should be entitled to vote.
Mr Boutros Ghali, who has returned to New York from London following an
extensive trip abroad, including a visit to Somalia, was to report on the
crisis and other issues arising from his visits to a meeting of the Security
Council last night.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Travellers warned to avoid Algeria

   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and other EC countries yesterday warned their nationals to avoid
Algeria unless absolutely necessary because of the recent wave of killings
and kidnappings.
The warning coincided with a report from Amnesty International which told
the Algerian authorities that 'no level of opposition violence, no matter
how horrifying, can be used to justify torture, summary executions and
unfair trials'.
The EC countries are seeking Algerian help in providing additional security
for their nationals, following the kidnapping on Sunday of three employees
of the French consulate in Algiers. No news of the three, all French
nationals, has been received since they were seized.
'Visitors are advised to postpone all but essential visits to Algeria, where
there have recently been a number of terrorist attacks on foreign
residents,' the Foreign Office in London said yesterday.
France has urged families of its expatriates in Algeria to take advantage of
school holidays to return home.
Algeria has blamed Moslem extremists for the murders of two French
surveyors, two Russian army officers and three oil workers employed by an
Italian company.
In its report Amnesty International said hundreds of people had been
sentenced to death this year in Algeria by courts which violated
requirements of international law.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Liquidators try to put brave face on BCCI ruling: Judgment
of Luxembourg court throws the winding-up of collapsed international bank
into uncertainty
</HEADLINE>

YESTERDAY'S decision in the Luxembourg courts, upholding an appeal against a
Dollars 1.7bn compensation plan for creditors of the failed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International, left the liquidators to the bank trying to put
on a brave face over what to do next.
The decision to uphold the appeal was portrayed as a victory by the three
BCCI creditors who brought the action. But most of those involved in the
liquidation stressed the need to study the written judgment before deciding
what to do.
Touche Ross, the liquidator, said it believed the decision announced in
court by Judge Raul Gretsch was based essentially on 'public interest'
issues in Luxembourg law. These included whether some groups of creditors
would be disadvantaged under the agreement the liquidators had negotiated.
The interpretation of the judgment will influence what steps are taken next.
When the liquidators meet next week to discuss the implications, they are
faced with three principal options:
Appeal against the judgment. There is provision to appeal to the final court
in Luxembourg, the Cour de Cassation. But these appeals tend to take place
on narrow technical grounds, and the liquidators were yesterday expressing
some doubts about how likely this would be.
Attempt to renegotiate with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in BCCI. The liquidators have always maintained that they
obtained the best deal that was possible after five months of discussions
concluded in February 1992. Abu Dhabi has said it is not willing to offer a
higher figure.
Sue Abu Dhabi. The 'contribution agreement' under appeal in Luxembourg was
that the liquidators would agree to waive any legal actions against the
government in exchange for at least Dollars 1.7bn. They could now resume
that legal threat.
Mr Christopher Morris, a partner at Touche Ross who is one of the
liquidators to the English liquidation of BCCI, was quick to stress
yesterday that any future decisions would be developed and approved in close
co-ordination with creditors' committees around the world.
In any event, the action is likely to extend for many months any
distribution of dividends to creditors of BCCI. The most optimistic view had
been that Touche might be able to offer a dividend of up to 15p in the pound
by next August.
First the liquidators would have had to seek approval from the bank's
estimated 530,000 possible creditors worldwide to seek their agreement to a
distribution. Judging by the response in previous correspondence with
creditors, that would have taken several months.
Now they must consider different strategies to recover money. Mr Brian
Smouha, another partner with Touche Ross and one of the three
court-appointed liquidators to the bank in Luxembourg, was keen to stress
that the decision did not destroy all the action that had been taken since
the bank was shut worldwide under the co-ordination of the Bank of England
in July 1991.
Touche has commenced legal actions against the Bank of England, the two
auditors to BCCI - Ernst &amp; Whinney (now part of Ernst &amp; Young) and Price
Waterhouse - and against National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh
Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer.
Mr Smouha said that realisations so far had exceeded Dollars 1bn,
principally from several undisclosed settlements and from the liquidation of
parts of BCCI's loan book. But that contrasts with total stated assets at
the time of the collapse of Dollars 14bn. The liquidators say there is a
'black hole' of accounted assets of Dollars 12.4bn.
Yesterday's court ruling also confirmed that an appeal against the 'pooling
agreement' had been dropped. That allows the liquidators to finalise
discussions with the many different BCCI liquidations around the world and
confirm which are willing to co-operate and join in the global attempts at
settlement.
Mr Fred Goodwin, a Touche partner, said that so far total fees and expenses
on the liquidation worldwide were between Pounds 100m and Pounds 130m.
