THE Italian government yesterday called a confidence vote tomorrow on a
minimum tax on the self-employed, threatening its survival and delaying
initial voting on a crucial deficit cutting budget, Reuter reports from
Rome.
The government called the vote in order to retain the so-called 'minimum
tax', seen by its supporters as a key weapon in the fight against tax
evasion, which had been due to lapse tomorrow.
The government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi must automatically
step down if it loses. Most observers expect the government to come through
the vote but an inital senate vote on the 1994 austerity budget will now
have to be delayed until next week.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Eco-taxes proposed as job creators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECO-TAXES on pollution and scarce natural resources could play a big role in
resolving Europe's jobs crisis, so long as they are preceded by rigorous
research to ensure they do not add costs to industry.
This is the view Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner,
advances in his submission to the Commission's White Paper on
competitiveness, growth and employment, being prepared for December's
meeting of EC leaders, but likely to get a first airing at tomorrow's
special EC summit in Brussels.
Mr Paleokrassas believes the White Paper could be a seminal document, if it
leads to gradual changes in Europe's model of development, designed both to
improve the environment and to get jobs and competitive advantage out of
being greener. He argues, for instance, that the controversial Commission
carbon/energy tax proposal for a levy of Dollars 10 per barrel of oil
equivalent by 2000 would fractionally reduce the cost of the average
industrial product, by virtue of increasing energy efficiency. Environmental
action sharpens competitive edge, he says, and is frequently very
labour-intensive. He estimates that an EC-wide plan for energy-saving in
housing could yield 35m 'job-years'.
'At the end of the day, you would have more jobs, less pollution, and more
competitiveness for European industry,' Mr Paleokrassas said.
He has submitted a four-pronged approach for the White Paper:
An urgent research programme to measure the costs and benefits of
environmental measures;
A shift in taxes away from labour and profits onto pollution and resources;
The removal of any net costs to industry from environmental measures, on the
basis of the research programme's findings;
A new system of land-use, building-use and vehicle taxes, to improve the
environmental and fiscal position of cities, responsible for about
three-quarters of pollution.
Mr Paleokrassas' remarks come as the present Belgian presidency of the EC is
examining alternatives to the Commission's carbon/energy tax, which is
designed to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year
2000. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, has written to Mrs
Christiane Scrivener, EC commissioner for taxation, proposing instead that
the EC harmonise existing excise taxes on energy. Mr Paleokrassas says he
could accept this approach provided it levels excise duties upwards and has
the same effect. The energy tax is blocked by UK opposition to any EC tax,
by French concern to exempt its extensive nuclear industry, and by
misgivings among the four poorest EC member states that it will blunt their
development. The northern countries led by Germany remain committed.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Firm backing for Airbus reform call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace yesterday backed a call by the
managing director of Airbus Industrie that the four-nation consortium be
reorganised.
Mr Jean Pierson had called for work to begin on 'reforming the structure' of
Airbus. If this did not happen urgently, Airbus risked losing clients to
more efficient competitors, said Mr Pierson.
Backing this call, an executive in one of the Airbus partners said that Mr
Pierson's open expression of support for moves to transform Airbus from a
consortium into a limited company meant that the change 'might come sooner
than some expect'.
Airbus is a consortium made up of France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace,
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (Casa) of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus unit
of Germany's Daimler-Benz. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) said that Mr Pierson
was echoing a call by its head, Mr Jurgen Schrempp.
The company said the four Airbus partners would discuss Mr Pierson's
initiative and make a decision on the timing of a move to a limited company
status.
BAe said it had been pressing for such a change for several years. The
change would mean Airbus would take over the legal ownership of its own
assets, currently the property of the consortium partners.
This would allow for better cost control, said BAe. The company pointed out,
however, that the structure of the consortium had allowed the company to be
created and prosper.
It is now the world's second biggest passenger aircraft maker behind Boeing
and ahead of McDonnell Douglas, both of the US.
Mr Pierson said on Tuesday that 1993 'had been a disaster' for the
organisation, with falling orders.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Hurd rejects Maastricht 'paradise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday warned its European Community partners not to treat the
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty next month as a 'passport to
paradise'.
As France and Germany tabled a joint initiative to give substance to the
European union established on November 1, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, said it was time for EC governments to refocus on the concerns of
their citizens.
Speaking to British MPs ahead of tomorrow's summit in Brussels, the foreign
secretary insisted that Britain was winning the argument for a more
flexible, decentralised Europe. 'Those who want to go down the old road to
greater centralisation have learned something in the last two years,' the
foreign secretary said. Mr Hurd did little to disguise Britain's view that
the summit, called by Bonn to celebrate Maastricht, was unnecessary.
But since it was taking place the leaders should spend the time discussing
European competitiveness and employment rather than issuing 'blasts of
trumpets' to usher in European union.
Mr Hurd added that the summit should recommit the EC to the conclusion by
December 15 of the Uruguay round of the Gatt world trade talks. However, he
indicated that Britain would not seek to 'corner' France in Brussels over
its refusal to accept the EC-US deal over farm subsidies.
Looking ahead to the next inter-governmental conference in 1996, the foreign
secretary said that the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway would
involve further changes in the Community's institutions.
He said present arrangements, under which two large and one small countries
constitute a 'blocking' minority, must be preserved when the Community's
membership increases from 12 to 16. That result would allow a
proportionately smaller group of states to veto decisions of the majority.
The British government also wanted to reduce the number of commissioners
once the Community was enlarged.
Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the Commission, had agreed that the 21
commissioners at present implied by the entry of four new members was
impracticable.
But Britain was so far alone among the large EC countries in voicing
willingness to reduce its representation from two to one.

EURO Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday faced a fresh blow when
BA Holidays, the package tour subsidiary of British Airways, announced that
it was abandoning sales of holidays to the struggling EuroDisneyland theme
park.
BA Holidays said it was cancelling its holiday sales to EuroDisneyland
because the British tended to prefer to travel to the park by road or rail,
rather than air. It has only sold 1,000 of the 5,000 hotel rooms allocated
to it this year at the Euro Disney resort and expressed concern that demand
for air packages was likely to fall further when the Eurotunnel rail link
opens.
Euro Disney yesterday played down the significance of BA Holidays'
withdrawal claiming that it was 'never a major player in our tour operation
business from the UK'.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed an historic decree allowing the

writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
The decree follows two years of wrangling, during which the now-dissolved
Russian parliament had accepted private ownership of land but set a 10-year
moratorium on its sale by private citizens. Yesterday's decree lays the
foundations for a mortgage system, enabling banks to lend money to farmers
using land as collateral, and sets out reforms to the state and collective
farms which still dominate Russia's ailing agricultural sector.
However, Mr Victor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, said the decree -
which has yet to be published in its final version - does not allow
foreigners to buy land. They would be allowed to lease it 'under certain
conditions', which he did not spell out.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE between European Community countries dropped in the first quarter of
this year compared with the same period last year, according to figures
published yesterday by Eurostat, the EC's statistical office.
However, Eurostat warned the statistics should be treated with caution
because of the teething problems with Intrastat, its new system for
measuring cross-border trade.
The figures published yesterday, the first under the new system, show that
some Ecu161bn (Pounds 125bn) worth of goods were dispatched in the first
quarter of this year, against Ecu181bn in the equivalent period. However,
the Community's trade deficit with non-EC countries narrowed from Ecu19.9bn
to Ecu12.6bn in the same period.
Intrastat, which measures trade flows across the barrier-free European
market, is running about four months slower than the old system of measuring
EC trade.
EC statisticians say that as companies get used to it, and the system is
refined, speed and reliability will improve.
Under the old system, statistics were compiled from forms filled in as goods
passed frontiers, and first-quarter figures for inter-EC trade would have
appeared at the end of June. But the new system involves individual
companies filling in the forms themselves, often without the help of customs
agents who smoothed the administration at borders. As a result the level and
reliability of replies has dropped.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTIAN BLANC, officially appointed chairman of Air France yesterday,
will meet union leaders at the beginning of next week to try to resolve the
industrial dispute which has brought the state-owned airline to a virtual
standstill for the past nine days.
In a statement to employees, Mr Blanc said he had been given 'carte blanche'
by the government to negotiate a new recovery plan for the loss- making
airline. Nothing would be decided on the plan before discussions with
employees.
A previous recovery plan, which envisaged 4,000 job cuts by the end of next
year, was withdrawn by the government last weekend after it triggered the
strikes at Air France and raised fears of broader unrest in the public
sector. The scrapping of the plan prompted the resignation of Mr Bernard
Attali as head of the national carrier.
Mr Blanc's comments came amid signs of an easing in the strike at some of
the airline's services and continued divisions among union groups about
whether to continue their protest.
At Orly airport, aircraft maintenance staff and baggage handlers were
returning to work, although bus drivers and freight workers stayed out.
At Charles de Gaulle, the other main Paris airport, ground staff and freight
workers voted to maintain their protest.
Force Ouvriere, representing about 35 per cent of Air France's ground staff,
has called on workers to return to work. But the left-wing Confederation
Generale du Travail (CGT) and the CFDT, which both represent just over 20
per cent of ground staff, continued to demand a written guarantee that Mr
Attali's austerity plan would be withdrawn and that strikers would be paid
for the period of their action.
Air France services, which were paralysed on Tuesday, saw some improvement.
A total of 20 Air France flights left from Charles de Gaulle and Orly
airports and the airline said it expected 36 would be operated today.
Foreign airlines were largely unaffected.
French unions continued to threaten strike action at other public-sector
groups. A spokesman for the CGT said it would target some of the 21 publicly
owned groups that the government is seeking to privatise.

FT  28 OCT 93 / France's grassroots shake the union tree: The prospect of
social chaos strikes fear in the political establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT WAS a revolt as we have not seen since 1968,' said Mr Bernard Bosson,
French transport minister, explaining to parliament why he had backed down
in the face of the Air France strike.
Mr Bosson was exaggerating in order to defend his action to sceptical
deputies; according to some reports, he may have over-interpreted
conciliatory signals from Mr Edouard Balladur, his prime minister, and gone
further than intended in appeasing the strikers.
Nonetheless, the prospect of social chaos - still epitomised by the 1968
insurrection - strikes fear in France's political establishment. It remains
an ever-present possibility, ironically, because of the feeble structure of
France's unions. The generally weak hold of union leaders over their
rank-and-file was amply demonstrated yesterday when ground staff at Charles
de Gaulle and Orly airports defied their advice and voted to stay on strike
until Mr Bosson puts his promise of no compulsory lay-offs into writing.
The unions feel they have won a famous victory, which they hope to extend.
'The government's retreat has boosted union credibility,' said Mr Marc
Blondel, head of the Force Ouvriere (FO), one of the three main federations.
'We are going to use this in other state enterprises which have announced
redundancies, like Bull,' he warned.
Other possible targets are state-controlled Snecma, the jet engine-maker,
and Aerospatiale, the aircraft company. Both have announced redundancy plans
which, unlike Thomson, the defence electronics group, they are sticking to,
so far. Employees of SNCF, the state railways, may also take advantage of
the fact that they share the same presiding minister, Mr Bosson, as Air
France.
It will take a lot, however, to reverse the French trade union movement's
long decline and fragmentation, as evidenced by the fact that:
France has the least unionised workforce of any industrialised country. A
1991 survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
put France's degree of unionisation at 12 per cent, even below that of
Turkey or the US. Mr Rene Mourieaux, a French academic specialising in
labour relations, estimates that rising unemployment has reduced this
further to an average of 8-9 per cent, because workers stop paying their
union dues when they lose their jobs.
It has three big competing union organisations: the left-wing but
anti-Communist FO; the Communist-dominated Confederation Generale du Travail
(CGT); and the more moderate Confederation Francaise Democratique des
Travailleurs (CFDT). Representation of all three in individual companies is
declining, so that for the first time in 1990, 'non-unionised'
representatives won the largest slice of seats in elections to companies'
works councils.
Some of the 'non-unionised' are members of what are called 'co-ordinations'.
These are ad hoc bodies which have sprung up as a liaison between competing
unions (as in the railways), or in protest at the feebleness of existing
unions (as in agriculture and teaching) or to fill a union vacuum (as among
nurses and social workers).
Farming apart, these bodies have mushroomed in the public sector because the
private sector has become steadily less fertile soil for union radicalism.
The number of work days which private industry has lost through strikes has
declined progressively from 5m in 1976 to less than 500,000 last year. The
last big private sector strike was at Peugeot in 1989. Recession has imposed
its own industrial peace in the private sector, where the unions know that
most companies have no choice but to trim to the needs of the market.
In the public sector, where the unions can always hope that the state will
bankroll their demands, Mr Mourieaux sees a remobilisation of organised
labour. Grassroots pressure is pushing federation leaders into more joint
action - the CFDT stayed out of the CGT-FO's day of action on October 12,
but plans to join the other two in striking at state companies on November
18. The paltry Socialist-Communist presence in the National Assembly now
gives the unions no parliamentary voice, though the latter know they can
count on President Francois Mitterrand's sympathetic ear.
So far, the Balladur government has tried to insure itself against a winter
of discontent by making a show of consulting union leaders on a variety of
issues. For this consultation to work, 'we need strong trade unions,' says
Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister. Instead, he has got workers airing
strong feelings on the streets but without strong unions to channel them.

<TEXT>
THE chief executive of RWE, Germany's biggest electricity generator,
yesterday proposed a moratorium of several years on any final decision about
a new generation of nuclear power stations in the country.
Mr Friedhelm Gieske called instead for rapid political agreement on a
permitted working life of 35-40 years for the present generation of reactors
to give the electricity industry a reliable planning framework for
investments.
At the same time he warned that failure to allow a new prototype extra-safe
reactor to be built in Germany would prevent the country from helping to
raise safety standards throughout the world.
'We are inclined to be far more conscious of the risks than we are of the
opportunities,' he said. 'If we carry on like this, I am afraid Germany will
be gravely weakened as an industrial location.'
He was speaking just before negotiations seeking an energy consensus between
the government and opposition failed because of disagreement over the
long-term nuclear option. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, and Gerhard
Schroder, Lower Saxony premier, said they would not be continued in the same
form because positions were irreconcilable.
In an attempt to head off any rapid move to abandon nuclear energy
completely, as proposed by the opposition Social Democratic (SPD) and Green
parties, Mr Gieske said that a standstill would be a sensible decision. 'I
can personally live very well with a moratorium of several years,' he told
RWE's annual news conference. 'This would give us a pause for thought, for a
complete rethink.'
He said the SPD decision to reject a compromise negotiated by Mr Schroder
and Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, was inexplicable. 'That is
why I believe that in the short term we will not reach a consensus,' he
said. 'But as long as there is still talking, I will not give up hope.'
RWE, the largest of Germany's big three electricity utilities, is the least
dependent on nuclear energy. But Mr Gieske's paramount demand is for a
decision which will simply provide long-term planning certainty.
On the issue of nuclear waste reprocessing, the other immediate question
needing a political decision, Mr Dietmar Kuhnt, chief executive of RWE
Energie, said the company had no plans to pull out of its British and French
contracts. Although direct disposal was under political consideration,
preceded by 'long-term interim storage' of high-level radioactive waste,
such a solution was still illegal.

The European Commission has given Germany two months to abolish tax aid to
its national airlines on the grounds that it distorts competition in the EC
aviation market, Reuter reports from Brussels. Brussels said Bonn had two
months to say whether it would abolish by next January the scheme which
allows its airlines to pay less tax by applying special depreciation rules
to their investments. The scheme is due to finish at the end of next year.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Domestic site likely for Mercedes plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is emerging ahead of Britain, France and the Czech Republic as the
most likely location for a new plant to assemble Mercedes-Benz' planned
small car.
The decision hinges on negotiations with unions on labour changes to reduce
costs at the plant.
Mr Dieter Zetsche, product development director of Mercedes-Benz car
division, said a decision would be made before the end of the year. The
favourite site is at Rastatt in south-west Germany, where the company
already carries out some final assembly of its E-Class executive and luxury
cars.
However, other sites in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are being
investigated through the London office of management consultants Arthur D
Little.
Mr Zetsche said building the plant at an existing site was the favoured
option as this would be cheaper, although the unions would have to agree to
meet the necessary cost targets.
'If we were to locate it in Germany, it would most probably be in Rastatt,
where we have a huge site.'
A decision to go ahead with the car, which would be smaller than a
Volkswagen Golf or a Ford Escort, is expected in the next two months. The
plant would have a capacity for 200,000 cars a year.
German unions are anxious to keep the small car plant in the country to help
offset the loss of 37,400 jobs in Germany that Mercedes is eliminating the
three years from 1992 to 1994.
The company has recently announced that it is to build a Dollars 300m
assembly plant in Alabama in the US to produce up to 60,000 four-wheel drive
leisure utility vehicles a year from 1997. It will also start production
late next year of a multi-purpose vehicle in Spain.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Allianz calls for steps to reduce insurance losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, has called on its corporate
clients to co-operate in implementing a package of radical measures designed
to reduce huge losses in the German industrial insurance sector
Mr Manfred Illner, a director of Allianz's main domestic insurance
subsidiary, outlined six steps which the group wants to implement in order
to cut losses in this sector.
Simply raising premiums to the level where the business was again profitable
was not acceptable, Mr Illner said on Tuesday night, nor was withdrawing
from this area of the insurance market as has happened in other countries.
He urged Allianz's corporate clients to co-operate in measures which range
from setting premiums which are more appropriate to the scale of the risk,
to introducing better risk-management procedures in companies and agreeing
limits to maximum coverage levels.
This, Mr Illner warned, was the only way of keeping Germany insurable, 'and
German industry must remain insurable so that it, and Germany as a location
for industry, can maintain their position.'
Last year, Allianz, the market leader in the German insurance industry, lost
DM100m (Pounds 40.6m) in the industrial risks sector, and the German
market's 10 biggest losses in the engineering sector alone amounted to
DM125m. One hail storm in May this year caused a pay-out of DM28m to just
one client, Munich airport.
Over the past five years the German insurance market has lost DM2.6bn in
industrial fire insurance alone, but there has also been a significant
increase in the number and size of claims in other sectors. The German
insurance market is the biggest in Europe.
These sharply increased losses reflect a number of factors, including the
cost and sophistication of the technology which is covered by insurance, an
increase in crimes such as arson, and poor weather conditions.

<TEXT>
X:IMPORTANT talks on wage restraint and labour market reforms in Spain
opened under a pall yesterday as unions announced nation-wide demonstrations
on November 25 in protest at the government's economic policy.
Union leaders, who are meeting government ministers and representatives of
the employers' confederation, agreed to continue negotiating the so-called
social pact next week but held out little hope of any agreement after the
first round of talks.
The call for demonstrations underlined the grave task facing the government
as it seeks to persuade the unions to accept an incomes policy pegging wages
to below the inflation rate over the next three years, and an overhaul of
labour regulations to lower the cost of dismissals.
Officials and employers fear that Spanish union militancy is being fuelled
by events in France. 'The climbdown over Air France is the worst possible
news for us because we have to do everything the French government should be
doing and more,' said a leading Barcelona industrialist.
Union leaders at the social pact talks were in part responding to what they
see as government intransigence over the negotiations and in part to the
groundswell of rank-and-file unrest.
'The government is wrecking the talks, not us,' said Mr Antonio Gutierrez,
leader of Comisiones Obreras, the Communist party-led union. The government
has insisted that it will impose wage restraint and labour market reforms
before the end of the year if there is no agreement with the unions.
Unrest is running high among Spain's 70,000 public sector steelworkers
following a decision by INI, the state-holding company, to defer until the
outcome of the social pact talks a wage and productivity package agreed in
June. INI's agreement with its unions was marginally more generous than the
incomes policy the government is currently backing.
Union leaders at companies such as CSI, the state's integrated steel
concern, and CASA, the aerospace manufacturer, said they would prepare
strike action following a meeting with the INI management yesterday.
Meanwhile, the first of several planned industrial stoppages took place
yesterday at the three plants run by SEAT, troubled subsidiary of
Volkswagen. The four-hour strike went ahead despite a promise by Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez Arriortua, the Spanish-born VW board member, that job losses
would be minimal because workers would be re-hired under a scheme to
increase the proportion of SEAT compoments manufactured in Spain.
In Spain's biggest labour shakeout to date, VW announced last week it was
closing SEAT's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona and shed 9,000 jobs, 3,000 of
them through voluntary retirement. The Barcelona-based regional government
of Catalonia has since said it will provide credit lines for component
manufacturers setting up in the Zona Franca plant to supply SEAT.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Tietmeyer rejects calls for interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, yesterday rejected calls from
Germany's independent research institutes to accelerate the pace of cuts in
short-term interest rates .
Mr Tietmeyer said that for the time being there was no scope for another cut
in rates, rebutting the institutes' argument - contained in their autumn
report published early this week - that further reductions would help the
country emerge from recession.
'The Bundesbank rejects all calls to stimulate the economy with forced
interest cuts,' Mr Tietmeyer said at a conference in Frankfurt.
'Unlike the institutes, we see no narrow link between short-term interest
rate cuts and growth and employment.'
He said the rate cuts last week were justified by the more moderate
development of money supply growth and inflation in recent months.
Last Thursday the central bank reduced both the Lombard and the discount
rate by half a percentage point, to 6.25 and 5.75 per cent respectively.
The repo rate, which provides liquidity to the banking system, was cut more
modestly, from 6.67 to 6.4 per cent.
Voicing the Bundesbank's conviction that long-term rates are more important
for German industry than short-term ones, he argued that the institutes had
underestimated the risks of a rise in long-term rates if the Bundesbank
delivered further, substantial cuts in the discount and Lombard rates.
He said that neither the absolute level of current interest rates, nor the
'inverted' structure of the interest rate curve (whereby short-term rates
are higher than long-term ones) acted as a brake on investment in German
industry. On the contrary, those who wanted to invest could borrow money at
long-term interest rates which were almost 'incomparably favourable' in
international terms.
Mr Tietmeyer said there was no doubt that the central bank would hold to its
course of gradual rate reductions, but not at the price of creating new
uncertainties for the financial markets as regards German monetary policy.
Later in his speech Mr Tietmeyer repeated a statement he has made several
times since he succeeded Mr Helmut Schlesinger as Bundesbank president at
the beginning of October: that the Bundesbank would not act as 'the central
bank for Europe' in the run-up to European monetary union. Its paramount
objective will remain domestic: to squeeze inflation out of Germany and
thereby preserve the value of the D-Mark.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Top Conservatives question future of unified Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEHALL officials and senior Conservatives have put a serious question
mark over the long-term future of the Treasury's new 'unified' Budget.
A month before Mr Kenneth Clarke unveils the first joint tax and spending
package on November 30, some ministers believe the new system - combining
the old spring Budget and autumn public spending statement - cannot last.
The change is being condemned in Whitehall as a clever administrative reform
which risks going horribly wrong. It is viewed within Conservative Central
Office as a grievous political error.
One senior Conservative commented bluntly: 'The change could cost us the
next general election.' The party had won the last three elections by going
to the country within weeks of announcing income tax cuts in March. No one
had considered that it would make no sense to call an election in January.
The initial enthusiasm of some in the cabinet for the move has been damped
down by the Treasury's refusal to discuss tax changes during the current
spending negotiations. Ministers are now describing the phrase 'unified
Budget' as a misnomer.
Party managers have also realised that switching the Budget to November may
make it more difficult to manage the government's small and fractious
majority at Westminster.
In the past, the finance bill has been debated after the start of the
financial year in April. The fact that Budget tax changes were already in
place discouraged backbench rebellions.
But now a five-month gap between announcements in November and
implementation the following April will give potential Conservative rebels
ample time to marshall their forces, particularly if the outlook for the
economy changes during that period.
Mr Clarke might partially circumvent the threat by giving immediate effect
on November 30 to any increases in excise duties and value added tax. But he
cannot bring forward changes in corporation and income tax.
In Whitehall the new system is being attacked on both economic and political
grounds. Officials fear that the requirement to take critical decisions
nearly six months before the start of the financial year could lead to fatal
misjudgments over taxation and borrowing.
That problem is particularly acute this year because of the uncertainty over
the pace of economic recovery and the size of the borrowing requirement. The
chancellor will be basing his decisions on a forecast of public borrowing
for next year which contains a huge margin of error.
The consensus among Whitehall's mandarins is that Mr Clarke should announce
a significant increase in taxes because the economic recovery is well
founded and public borrowing remains much too high. But they acknowledge
that since the evidence of recovery will remain patchy until next year the
political pressures are in the opposite direction.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Creditors of BCCI face long delay after ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International may face
a delay of several more years before receiving any compensation for the
millions they lost when the bank collapsed. This follows a surprise decision
by the Luxembourg courts yesterday upholding an appeal against plans by the
liquidators for an agreement with Abu Dhabi which could have led to a payout
next year.
The decision represented a victory for three individual creditors who have
argued in the English and Luxembourg courts against the liquidators'
agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the
bank.
It jeopardises the agreement by which Abu Dhabi would have contributed more
than Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.12bn) to the liquidators for distribution to
creditors, in exchange for a waiver of all legal claims against it.
Mr Brian Smouha, one of three liquidators to BCCI appointed by the
Luxembourg courts and the man who negotiated the agreement with Abu Dhabi,
warned that the decision might trigger legal actions and delay payments for
as much as 10 years. 'We were disappointed,' said Mr Smouha, a partner with
accountants Touche Ross. 'This has caused there to be no money in the hands
of the creditors. Now they can face only uncertainties.' Mr Keith Vaz, the
opposition Labour MP who has championed the cause of BCCI creditors, called
for the British government to intervene in bringing about a settlement.
But Downing Street said the government was not a party to the hearing, and
would not be involved in further legal action.
Judge Raul Gretsch told the Luxembourg court of appeal: 'The appeal is
justified and the liquidators have no right to sign an agreement.' The
ruling has destroyed the prospect of a ballot by the liquidators of BCCI's
estimated 530,000 creditors on their plans, which could have led to a
payment of 15p in the pound to creditors next August.
The Luxembourg liquidators are due to meet today to discuss their options.
They will consider appealing the judgment, attempting to renegotiate with
Abu Dhabi, or suing it to gain more money. But Mr Julien Roden, one of the
Luxembourg liquidators, yesterday appeared to rule out an appeal.
Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the BCCI liquidators under
English law, said: 'We think a very large number of creditors are going to
be very upset. Those who have money may get more, but the vast number of
creditors are suffering very greatly.'

FT  28 OCT 93 / A city on edge as killings dull hopes for an end to
violence: The mood in Belfast after the latest deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELFAST this week is living on its nerves, its population once again peering
into the abyss.
Since last Saturday, 14 people have been killed and more than 60 injured in
an upsurge of political violence. An IRA bomb on the Shankill Road - killing
10 and wounding over 50, most of them shoppers  - has been followed by an
intensified campaign by Loyalist paramilitaries to gun down Catholics
indiscriminately.
'We just don't know where or who is going to get hit next. We are back where
we were 20 years ago. I just feel like shutting up shop and leaving,' said a
frightened woman owner of a newsagents on the Crumlin Road in west Belfast.
Many shops in Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods were shut yesterday,
either out of respect for the funerals of six of the latest victims, out of
fear of further trouble, or simply because their owners can no longer make
ends meet.
In some streets in the Protestant Shankill, and the Catholic Falls and
Ardoyne areas of west Belfast, unemployment is higher than 50 per cent.
Hard-faced young men hang around on street corners and watch armoured cars
cruise past on patrol, while two army helicopters and an aircraft circling
constantly overhead add to the sense of foreboding.
A man on the Shankill Road watching the crowd gathering for the funeral
service of five of Saturday's bomb victims said: 'We Protestants feel
abandoned by the government. As long as the IRA can get away with atrocities
like this there are going to be more and more killings by the Loyalists.'
Hundreds of wreaths had been placed on the pavement outside the fishmonger's
shop on the Shankill Road where the bomb exploded. Among messages of
sympathy from friends and families, one had a more chilling message: 'With
deepest sympathy from the officers and members of the Red Hand Commando,'
the loyalist paramilitary group.
A bulldozer was yesterday clearing the gap in the terrace where the shop had
stood. On the side wall, a paramilitary plaque still hung in full view. It
said: 'West Belfast Brigade Headquarters. Ulster Defence Association.'
Less than half a mile away, over 1,000 people attended the funeral of Thomas
Begley, the IRA man who planted the bomb and killed himself in the process.
At one point, Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, shouldered the coffin. Earlier this week, Mr Adams had said that he
wanted the IRA to go into retirement.
As one observer remarked, Mr Adams' action was as if to say that the peace
initiative launched with Mr John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, just a month
ago had also been pronounced dead.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said newspaper photographs had
shown 'people in abject misery as a result of what happened in the Shankill
Road, and today we see Mr Adams carrying the coffin, supporting one of those
who did it'.
Tomorrow, Mr John Major, the prime minister and Mr Albert Reynolds, his
Irish counterpart, will meet in Brussels to discuss the Hume-Adams
initiative.
Yesterday the mood in the working-class housing estates of west Belfast was
not one of hopeful anticipation for what may be discussed in Brussels. Hopes
here are simpler and narrower - that friends, family and oneself will not be
the next victims.

FT  28 OCT 93 / Stores lose fight to stop warehouse shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S three biggest supermarket chains yesterday lost their High Court
battle to stop the opening of the country's first cut-price warehouse
shopping club next month.
The decision clears the way for the arrival in the UK of the fastest-growing
form of retailing in the US and is a setback for the supermarket chains
already facing mounting competition from discount food retailers such as
Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and the UK's Kwik Save and Shoprite.
Costco, the US warehouse club operator, plans to open the 139,000 square
feet store - with about five times the selling space of typical food
superstores - in Thurrock, Essex, on November 30.
Warehouse clubs sell products from cans of beans to car tyres in large
no-frills sheds to fee-paying members at prices 25 per cent or more lower
than high street retailers. They achieved sales of Dollars 34bn (Pounds
22.5bn) in the US last year and analysts believe there could be scope for
about 50 clubs in the UK, with sales of about Pounds 3bn. Costco's
development at Thurrock is one of five warehouse clubs to have applied for
planning permission in the UK.
J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway, had taken joint action to
try to quash planning permission granted to Costco by Thurrock Borough
Council. They denied they were afraid of competition, but argued that the
club should have been treated as a retail, rather than wholesale, outlet and
should therefore have been subjected to tougher planning criteria.
The 'big three' said that while the majority of warehouse clubs' customers
in the US were businesses, private individuals accounted for over 35 per
cent of turnover, and that meant they should be considered retailers.
But yesterday Mr Justice Schiemann ruled that Thurrock had been correct in
treating the proposed discount store as a wholesaler.
The supermarket chains yesterday put a brave face on the setback, claiming
they had 'achieved their central objective'. Mr John Littman, of Rapleys,
the chains' joint planning consultant, said the aim had been to 'make the
secretary of state for the environment, planning authorities and the general
public aware of the need to consider carefully the implications of warehouse
membership club planning applications.'
The retailers were refused leave to appeal against the decision, but said
they had yet to decide whether to challenge that ruling. They have also not
yet decided whether to pursue similar action against UK cash-and-carry
operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which plans to build a club at Wednesbury, W
Midlands.
Mr Paul Moulton, managing director of Costco Europe, said he was
'particularly pleased with the ruling that we are not a retailer. We are in
a different business than the superstores'.
Retail analysts believe the development of warehouse clubs and discount
stores in the UK is part of a shift in retailing away from the high profit
margin culture of the 1980s towards increasing competition on price.
Fears that such competition will make it difficult for the biggest UK
grocers to maintain the rapid profits growth of the past 10 years have meant
the food retail sector has underperformed the all-share index by 28 per cent
since January. The big three's shares fell again yesterday, with Sainsbury
off 8p at 416p, Argyll, down 5p at 304p and Tesco down 4 1/2 p to 216p.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Strike called over Belgian austerity plan: EC summit faces
disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S Socialist trade unions yesterday called for a one-day public
transport strike on Friday to protest against the government's proposed
austerity package.
The day of the strike coincides with the summit of European Community
leaders in Brussels, which as a result will face disruption from traffic
chaos, stoppages and demonstrations.
Last week, the Socialist unions walked out of talks with government and
employers on how to solve the problems of lack of competitiveness,
unemployment and a growing social security deficit.
Yesterday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, unveiled outline measures
which the country's centre-left coalition will now try to push through on
its own. The task is particularly delicate because there are doubts whether
the French-speaking Socialist members of the coalition will support
proposals opposed by the unions.
The unions are angry about plans to limit wage costs. Mr Dehaene has
suggested freezing pay and delaying the impact of salary increases for 1994
which have already been agreed with employers.
Senior Belgian government officials said yesterday that the package of
measures would try to achieve the same aims as last week's failed talks, but
without inflaming the unions and risking the collapse of the coalition.
A statement issued after yesterday's cabinet discussion of the package tried
to reassure the unions by promising that the government would concentrate on
improving employment. But Mr Dehaene warned at a news conference that some
form of wage restraint would almost certainly have to be included in the
final measures.
Mr Dehaene, who will chair Friday's EC summit, will start talks on the
detail of the measures with his coalition partners on Saturday morning.
Officials admitted yesterday that the failure to agree a framework deal with
the unions and the employers would make the task much more difficult.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by the Belgian presidency of the EC to keep a potentially damaging
row over the relative voting power of big and small Community states out of
this Friday's Brussels summit looked yesterday as though they might have
failed.
A discussion by foreign ministers of the Twelve on how to adjust the EC's
institutional arrangements to accommodate four small countries negotiating
entry into the EC by 1995 - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - ended in a
stand-off between the big and small member states.
Germany, the UK, France and Spain are looking to adjust the qualified, or
weighted, majority voting system, to ensure they and their likely allies
will continue to be able to block unpalatable legislation, after the Twelve
become the Sixteen. They also want to ensure that the six-monthly rotation
of the EC presidency, now alphabetical, will always ensure that a European
power is involved in EC foreign policy, by adjusting the 'troika' system of
representation through the current, preceding and succeeding presidencies.
All the small member states said yesterday that institutional changes should
wait until after enlargement, and be dealt with at the EC's next
constitutional review in 1996. A debate now would 'fuel divisions in the EC
which we do not need at this juncture', said Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign
minister. Others said any appearance of rewriting the rules to favour larger
states could sink the enlargement negotiations. 'This is a stand-off,' said
a diplomat from one small member state, 'at the end of the day we are going
to have to decide do we want enlargement or do we want institutional
reform.'
But Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, stressed: 'It is in the interests
of Great Britain that there should be an adequate system of blocking
minority (voting) after the entry of the new members.'
The UK, Germany, France and Spain, acknowledged that it was a very sensitive
issue, but said that although the Belgian presidency was refusing to put it
on the summit agenda, it would almost certainly come up in discussions.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Delors sets agenda for reducing jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said in Luxembourg
yesterday he was convinced the EC could reduce mass unemployment, which is
'paralysing European societies'.
This would be achieved through a mix of job-sharing, part-time work and wage
flexibility, according to the latest draft of the commission's white paper
on competitiveness, growth and employment.
The Commission has set a target of creating 20m new jobs by the end of this
decade in its blueprint for tackling mass unemployment in Europe.
The white paper, which is being co-ordinated by Mr Delors, will get its
first real airing at this Friday's special EC summit in Brussels. The final
version will be the centrepiece of December's meeting of EC leaders.
The creation of 20m jobs, to reduce current EC unemployment rates of 10.4
per cent to 5 per cent by the year 2000, would match the performance of the
US economy in the 1980s. It implies annual growth rates between 3 and 3.5
per cent, levels which are not likely to start until 1995.
Mr Delors said in Luxembourg yesterday that he was convinced the EC could
reduce mass unemployment.
'I have a lot of ideas in my head and I hope I can convince the heads of
government,' the Commission president said, a day after being rebuffed by EC
finance ministers on his ideas for boosting economic growth.
The Commission draft calls for an overhaul of EC labour markets, and an
increase in investment from 19 per cent to 23-24 per cent of Community GDP,
a figure last seen in 1964-74.
'The slower expansion of private consumption would be the price to pay for
increasing competitiveness, job creation, and therefore future prosperity,'
the draft says.
The Commission makes clear that it is not advocating EC-wide legislation.
Reforms should be tailored to the specific needs of member states, but
carried out within a mutually reinforcing framework. Among the chief
recommendations of the draft white paper are:
New incentives for part-time work. This would reduce the average hours
worked and allow the number of jobs to increase.
Greater wage flexibility, including possible dilution of minimum wage
legislation.
Employment costs. The paper says labour should not be taxed more heavily
than capital, and calls for a progressive reduction in non-wage costs for
lower-skilled jobs.
Taxes on pollution and energy to compensate for revenue losses as a result
of the reduction in employment costs.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (19): Putting the glitz on faded
grandeur - Profile: Galle Face Hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE press release reads like an obituary for Asia's most venerable and
charming hotel, writes Richard Cowper. The new management has 'proven
experience in developing interactive tourism concepts. . . and has received
international attention for the successful conceptualisation, restoration
and redebut of the Raffles Hotel in Singapore,' it says.
Upmarket Disney has come to Colombo's Galle Face Hotel.
To the consternation of hotel cognoscenti the world over, Mr Cyril Gardiner,
one of Asia's most idiosyncratic and much-loved hoteliers, has signed away
day-to-day management of the hotel that has been his passion for 33 years.
In August, Mr Gardiner, a wealthy patrician businessman who bought the Galle
Face in 1960 after his GM car business was wiped out by a complete
government ban on passenger cars, signed a deal with DBS Land, the
Singaporean government-backed company, which owns the Raffles Hotel.
In return for Dollars 7m investment in the Galle Face, DBS Land has gained a
25 per cent share of a new joint venture which has been granted a 99-year
lease on the hotel and surrounding land. The Raffles has been given a
30-year contract to manage the hotel.
For those who like their hotels well-packaged and easy to assimilate the
glitzy Raffles treatment is likely to prove attractive.
But for those who seek an escape from theme hotels with lobby chandeliers
and obsequious staff who say: 'Have a nice day, sir' and for those who found
Mr Gardiner's stately pile on the Indian Ocean near the top of their list,
the new Galle Face may prove a disappointment.
Many formed a deep attachment to the faded grandeur of a hotel that outdoes
the Taj in Bombay for architectural splendour and the Eastern and Oriental
in Penang for dramatic seafront views.
Even the most committed of those who have stayed at the three-storey hotel -
opened in 1864 next to Galle Face Green facing the Indian Ocean - would
agree that it needs investment.
The grandest ballroom in Asia outside Shanghai does not hide the fact that
the hotel's roof is in need of replacement. A complete overhaul of the air
conditioning, electrics, plumbing and phone system is necessary, while one
virtually unuseable wing needs complete renovation.
But despite all this the hotel works and the high-ceilinged rooms, with
ancient barefoot waiters serving stengahs on a terrace the length of two
cricket pitches, gives the place a unique magic.
The fear is that the Raffles management, with its driving commercial
imperative, and coming from a city where money is king, may end up creating
a highly expensive birthday cake out of one that has evolved in a stately
fashion over the past 129 years.
Mr Gardiner, a man who gave discounts for non-smokers, never sacked an
employee and for decades refused to countenance a shop in the confines of
the 70-roomed hotel because it would smack of commercialism, may yet live to
rue the day he made the deal.
Or perhaps he is more canny than we can know. With a Dickensian passion for
accounts he has never borrowed and last year made profits of SLRs19m. At 71
he no longer has the energy he once had and, as he himself says: 'I have to
safeguard the Galle Face into the next century. The place needs renovation
and investment, but not too much investment.'
His deal with DBS ensures that his staff are employed until retirement, that
he still retains a controlling share of the joint venture companies' equity,
and he still retains ultimate sanction over all physical alterations.
In the first development phase, over the next 12 months, DBS plans to spend
most of its Dollars 7m on training staff in Singapore, refurbishing existing
rooms, restoring the south wing, adding four new restaurants and a shop, a
business centre and a health club.
But in the next phase there seems certain to be as many as a dozen new shops
and there is already talk of an extension, one of the very reasons some
believe that the Raffles lost its ambience in an attempt to capture the
hordes of tourists who pass through Singapore on package tours.
The Raffles in Singapore had 1.5m visitors last year - about four times Sri
Lanka's total tourist population. Mr Gardiner never liked his hotel too
full.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (18): Back on track after unrest -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER

<TEXT>
SUCH has been the revival in Sri Lanka's tourist industry that enthusiastic
hoteliers and travel agents are now talking of paradise regained.
After a decade of civil war and unrest which saw tourist arrivals fall to a
miserable 185,000, the industry is on course to exceed the figure of 400,000
for the first time since violent ethnic riots left more than 1,000 dead on
the streets of Colombo in 1983.
Few would deny that Sri Lanka, with its palm trees and beaches, old colonial
hotels, delightful tea plantations and spectacular ancient Buddhist cities,
is the perfect winter destination.
Last year, 393,669 people thought just that - an extraordinary increase of
24 per cent on the previous year. The industry has now become the country's
third-largest official foreign exchange earner.
After a decade of penny-pinching, hoteliers are pulling out their cheque
books. The government has approved the construction of 35 new hotels worth
about SLRs6bn. One thousand rooms are under construction and 2,000 more are
in the pipeline.
There is still over-capacity in Colombo's five-star hotels but the days when
they courted shady Chinese gambling tycoons to set up casinos in their
establishments because occupancy was so low, seem long gone.
Sri Lanka has commissioned a tourism master plan from the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Tourist Organisation (WTO) for
the years to 2001.
Mr M. N. L. Lantra, director of research and planning at the Ceylon Tourist
Board, says the draft plan envisages total capital expenditure of about
Dollars 400m with a target of doubling tourist arrivals to about 850,000 by
the year 2001.
To achieve this, room capacity will need to double to just under 20,000 by
the turn of the century.
Foreign exchange earnings are expected to increase from just under Dollars
200m a year now to Dollars 700m by the year 2001 at 1991 prices. Direct and
indirect employment in the industry is forecast to grow from about 70,000
now to 136,000.
The plan calls on Colombo to liberalise its air transport arrangements to
attract additional foreign airlines and more charter operators.
Among many other recommendations, it urges the government to take account of
environmental concerns, such as sewage outlets, and to make a special effort
to ensure Colombo is made more attractive. Potential draws such as Galle
Face Green and Beira Lake have been allowed to wither dismally, to the
consternation of locals and foreigners alike.
There are two causes for concern on the hoteliers' horizon in spite of all
the optimism.
First, the world recession. Tourist arrivals in the first nine months of the
year were up about 1 per cent on the same period in 1992 but the past three
months have shown a worrying decline of 10 per cent.
Tourists from the UK have visited Sri Lanka in record numbers but those from
Germany, Sri Lanka's biggest market, have declined sharply, as have those
from France.
Second is the potentially lethal effect of a deterioration in the
carefully-balanced security equation.
For the past year, Tamil terrorism has largely been confined to the north of
the country, out of bounds to tourists.
The number of foreign visitors actually increased in May this year despite
the assassination in Colombo of the country's president. But a series of
incidents directly involving tourists could undermine overnight all the hard
work and investment.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (16): Short-term outlook still seems
bright - Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of Sri Lanka's textiles industry has been impressive. In 1977,
textile exports were worth less than Dollars 10m. By the mid 1980s, the
figure had soared to Dollars 280m.
The real growth in the industry has come in the past three years: in 1990,
textiles and clothing exports were worth about Dollars 500m. Last year,
earnings from textiles exports rose to Dollars 1.2bn. A healthy 38 per cent
growth in the value of textile exports is projected for this year.
The rapid expansion of the textiles industry has transformed the Sri Lankan
economy. A few years ago, agricultural produce - mainly tea, rubber and
coconuts - accounted for the bulk of the country's export earnings. In 1992,
textiles accounted for 49 per cent of total export earnings and made up 70
per cent of the value of manufacturing exports.
But while the textiles industry has been at the forefront of Sri Lanka's
efforts to industrialise its economy there are considerable problems.
Sri Lanka has so far failed to build up an industrial base to service its
textiles industry. Almost all fabrics, plus many other goods such as zips
and buttons, are imported. Imports of textile goods last year were worth
more than Dollars 600m - some 50 per cent of the value of total textiles
export earnings.
Textiles, particularly at the lower, less value-added end of the business,
is a notoriously footloose industry. Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about
competition from lower cost producers. 'We are watching the emergence of
Vietnam very closely,' said an official in the Ministry of Handlooms and
Textiles. 'With lower wage rates, Vietnam and Bangladesh could very quickly
mount a challenge to our industry.'
At present the minimum wage in Sri Lanka's textile industry is SLRs2,000
(about Dollars 40) a month.
Buoyed by the success of the textiles industry, the late President Premadasa
inaugurated a programme to encourage 200 textile enterprises to open further
factories in rural areas. Serious problems of unemployment in country areas
would thus be partly alleviated. Those who set up factories under the
programme were given considerable tax incentives plus valuable allocations
of export quotas.
To date, officials say about 120 factories have opened up in the
countryside, although how many of these are fully operational is not clear.
The programme's contribution to the overall health of the textiles industry
is questionable.
Some manufacturers complain that they now have to waste considerable amounts
of time and money transporting materials to and from remote areas over often
very badly maintained roads. Some manufacturers have opened factories in
country areas simply to gain more quotas and take advantage of the tax
incentives offered. They often still carry out the bulk of production at
facilities near Colombo.
Industry analysts say the quotas allocation under the 200 factories
programme has not been properly supervised. This has caused confusion over
quotas with Sri Lanka now producing more than its quota allocation in some
categories, less than its allocation in others. There is concern that unless
the system is reorganised Sri Lanka could face difficulties in upcoming
quota negotiations.
Balanced against these problems, the short-term outlook for the textiles
industry still seems bright. The industry is beginning to attract some
investments in more value-added products.
Progress is also being made in developing markets for non quota goods such
as skirts, housecoats and nightwear. 'We have to move upmarket; there is no
alternative,' said one official.
But for the moment, wages remain the critical factor. Competition at the
lower end of the textiles market is intense. In these recessionary times
textile buyers are looking even more closely at cost cutting.
Vietnam and Bangladesh are not the only countries which are challenging Sri
Lanka's textile industry. A big US buyer recently decided to stop purchasing
from suppliers in Sri Lanka and go instead to the Caribbean, where it could
import US-made fabric for finishing and re-export back to the US.
'The next few years should still see industry growth,' said one big
manufacturer. 'But I would be far more cautious about the long term.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (15): Gains despite loaded dice - Tea
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FATE could not have been more cruel to the 22 companies which last year were
awarded five-year profit-sharing management contracts to run Sri Lanka's
decaying state plantation sector.
When they picked up the reins at 450 government-owned tea, rubber and
coconut estates in July 1992, they were well aware that the sector was
losing about SLRs5bn (Dollars 114m) a year - just over SLRs400m a month.
Some estimates put losses over the last few decades as high as SLRs50bn.
What the companies could never have forecast was a year in which the worst
drought in the living memory of many planters caused output in the sector's
most lucrative crop, tea, to fall to just 179,000 tonnes - the lowest level
for 36 years.
If that were not pain enough, earlier this year they were forced to absorb a
25 per cent government-imposed pay increase in an industry where wages
already account for over 75 per cent of total costs.
In spite of the loaded dice, the companies contrived to make a sharp dent in
overall losses by mounting a successful drive to eliminate theft, waste and
poor labour management. They saved tens of millions of dollars in stolen
tea, fertilisers, wages to ghost workers, bribes to officials and
outrageously over-priced transport costs.
Says Mr LG Munasinghe, Sri Lanka's Tea Commissioner: 'Pilferage in the state
sector may have accounted for between 8 to 10 per cent of total turnover.'
The companies introduced new financial management techniques, fired some of
those caught thieving, sidelined the most inefficient and, most important of
all, began the long process of improving agricultural field practices. Some
notable gains have already been made. Average losses for the second half of
last year were cut sharply to around SLRs133m a month, and more
dramatically, in the first half of 1993 to SLRs83m a month - just 20 per
cent of the average monthly loss when they first took over. Four companies
say they hope to make a profit this year.
Equally encouraging is the belief that better field practices have already
helped to achieve a slight boost in tea output, though nobody can put a
figure on the exact size of the increase. This year Sri Lanka is expected to
regain its position as the world's largest exporter of tea, after falling
into second place behind India in 1992.
According to Mr Munasinghe, production is likely to end the year at around
222,000 tonnes - up about 25 per cent on last year, though not as high as
the record 241,000 tonnes produced in 1991. He believes better used of
fertiliser and other improved practises may enable Sri Lanka to boost output
to 250,000 tonnes next year, if the weather is favourable.
Further good news for companies struggling to turn their estates round is
that Colombo is expected soon to announce substantial changes in the
contracts awarded last year. These will probably include a decision to
extend the contract from five years to 30 years, possibly with the option of
a further 30-year extension.
'Before the end of the year, I fully expect to be in a position to grant a
new contract, possibly a usufruct contract of 30 years,' says Mr Rupasena
Karunatilleke, Sri Lanka's minister of plantation industries. The contract,
which will be similar to a lease, is tantamount to privatisation. The
companies will no longer merely share in the profits - if there are any -
but will bear all the risks of any losses too.'
The longer contract is vital if companies are to take a long-term view and
raise much needed capital to modernise the country's ageing plantations.
Many of the tea bushes are 50 years old and of the wrong type, with scores
of estates averaging output of just 1,000kg a hectare  - less than half that
of India and Kenya, Sri Lanka's main competitors.
The expectation is the Asian Development Bank will come up with about
Dollars 60m in low interest loans, which the government will lend to the
industry, providing companies put up capital of their own.
Many estates are already improving their finances by diversification. Some
have switched a proportion of their land into cash crops, while a few are
looking at the feasibility of gem mining. Others are selling valuable timber
resources, while one company is hoping to build a golf course and another is
looking at the possibility of turning an old tea factory into a hotel. All
this is heartening news for a sector stifled for decades by the dead weight
of a top-heavy management and bureaucracy that often seemed hardly to care
whether the industry remained solvent or not.
Turning the industry around will nevertheless be an uphill task.
Unacceptably high wages are likely to remain a feature for several years to
come, while labour agitation in a highly unionised sector has already
manifested itself in several strikes against management efforts to cut
labour costs. Above all, it is in tea that Sri Lanka has the experience and
expertise. But tea prices seem so often to favour the industrialised
countries at the expense of third world producing nations.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (17): Wages have changed only a little -
Company profile: Eskimo Fashions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESKIMO Fashions is a hot and dusty one-hour drive away from Colombo. At its
factory in the middle of a coconut plantation Eskimo produces winter tights
and gloves, mostly destined for the European market, writes Kieran Cooke.
Eskimo is fully owned by the Ergee group, one of Germany's biggest textiles
companies. Production started in 1982: Eskimo now produces about 18,000
pairs of tights and 6,000 pairs of gloves each day.
Mr Hermann Michael-Lohs, Eskimo's managing director, says that Sri Lanka
still has considerable labour cost advantages. Wages for the factory's 1,800
workers have changed little in the past 10 years. 'In 1982, the minimum wage
was SLRs520 a month - now it is SLRs2,000. But in D-Mark terms, because of
the devaluation of the rupee, the wage is about the same.'
But Mr Michael-Lohs says that Sri Lanka's textile industry is still very
underdeveloped, with no industrial base. 'We import about 50 per cent of our
final product cost. That's high compared to many others - in some companies
imported goods account for more than 90 per cent of the final cost. Sri
Lanka is still mainly a textile producer and not a manufacturer.'
Eskimo imports its yarn from India or Indonesia. Not having a local supply
of such goods means that Eskimo needs to keep more than two months of
materials in stock to ensure continuing production. A recent strike in the
Indian textile industry underlined the need to maintain considerable stocks
of material.
'That's a big financial burden and puts our costs up,' says Mr Michael-Lohs.
'We also have to find storage space.'
Some design work is carried out in Sri Lanka and the workforce has been
quick to learn new skills. But the more sophisticated production is still
carried out at another Eskimo factory in Malaysia.
'We have a good labour force here, with good relations between workers and
management,' says Mr Michael-Lohs. 'But we always have to keep a watch on
wages. The moment they go up, we become uncompetitive. As a country tries to
industrialise, the textile industry is always one of the pioneering
industries. But it's also the first industry to move on when costs start to
rise.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (12): Business has been kind - Profile:
Zam Refai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HOW would you like to buy a gem of an island?' giggles Mr Z A M Refai's
right-hand man, pushing across the desk a picture of a coconut-palmed
paradise, just off the coast of the tourist resort of Bentota, writes
Richard Cowper.
Minutes earlier, Mr Refai - or Zam, as he is known in the trade - was
pocketing a Dollars 30,000 sapphire that had been cut and polished by one of
his most skilled employees.
Business has been kind to Mr Refai of ZAM Gems, the company named after his
own initials. A Moslem from the coastal gem trading town of Beruwala, 35
miles south of the capital of Colombo, he started business 26 years ago with
capital of Dollars 1,000 - a paltry sum in a trade where single gems can be
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Today, he is a multi-millionaire with five up-market jewellery shops,
numerous jewellery-making workshops and a turnover which he conservatively
puts at Dollars 2.5m a year.
Unlike the country's sophisticated and fabulously rich top 500 gem
merchants, who have conducted business for centuries from their mansions in
the China Fort area of Beruwala, Mr Refai is a self-made man and he clearly
revels in his new-found wealth.
In addition to the magical Barberyn island with its old white British
lighthouse, he owns an exquisite blue aquamarine so huge that it is the
biggest such gem ever found in this island of gems. At 946 carats, the size
of a goose egg, the stone is a museum piece whose value can only be guessed
at.
Mr Refai, a trader at heart, says that at the right price he might be
willing to sell.
'What would that price be?' I asked.
'It's a huge draw at my most exclusive shop in the Hilton Hotel,' he says.
'But I might be prepared to accept Dollars 250,000.'
Such information is rare in what is undoubtedly one of the world's most
secretive trades. The easy transportability of gems worth huge sums has made
them extremely attractive to smugglers, drug money launderers, tax evaders
and those who wish to avoid currency controls - not to mention the nouveau
riche and some members of the aristocracy.
'How much did you pay for it?' I hazard.
'It took my best man one week to cut and polish it, for which I paid him
Dollars 2,500 and. . .' pointing to his brand new four-wheel-drive vehicle.
. . 'it cost me less than I paid for this,' he says with a laugh.
'Fortune has treated me well. Mr Premadasa (the former president) gave me
and all other gem and jewellery exporters an indefinite tax holiday. I don't
pay any tax at all,' he says.
Until 1985, his sole business was the export of polished and cut gems such
as rubies, topaz, moonstones and the famous blue sapphire for which Sri
Lanka has been renowned for nearly 2,500 years.
But as tourism came into its own, he expanded into making fine jewellery,
using gold and gems and copying western designs. He opened shops in several
of Colombo's five-star hotels, opening up a niche in the market that has
made him one of the country's top five jewellery exporters.
With an uncanny ability to see the main chance, he has concentrated on the
tourist market from Japan, a country which imports more gems and jewellery
than any other in the world.
Not all is plain sailing. He is now exposed to the vagaries of the Sri
Lankan political climate. After President Premadasa was assassinated in May,
Mr Rafai hardly sold a piece of jewellery in his Colombo shops for three
months.
But jewellery, although expanding fast, still accounts for just 20 per cent
of his turnover and, should an emergency arise, he could always 'slip a
handful of sapphires into my pocket and sell them abroad for a small
fortune.'
Political stability is the key to the future and he is looking forward to
the day when tourism - now at 400,000 visitors a year - reaches the 1m mark.
'Then I shall be a truly rich man,' he says with a smile, giving the Dollars
30,000 pink padmaraga sapphire in his pocket another twist.

FOR many Colombo businesspeople, the war against Tamil separatists in the
north of the country seems very remote, writes Kieran Cooke.
'We really don't notice it much down here,' says Mr Tilak de Zoyza, managing
director of the Associated Motorways (AMW) car industry group.
AMW is one of Sri Lanka's biggest importers of cars and motorcycles, mainly
from Japan. But its main business is what is known as tyre rebuilding.
AMW collects used tyres and employs the latest technology to rebuild them.
The rebuilt tyres have 80 per cent of the life of a new tyre. AMW's tyre
rebuilding facility is one of the biggest in the region.
Mr de Zoyza feels there could be more economic progress if the war ended.
But of more immediate concern is government economic policy.
'There has been a remarkable change over the past four years,' says Mr de
Zoyza.
'Former President Premadasa pushed through a whole series of measures to
liberalise the economy. We were given tax incentives to encourage us to buy
new machinery and employ more people.
'As a result, business has been investing far more and reaping the
dividends. This year AMW will have a turnover of about SLRs720m; double that
of three years ago.'
Improved investment incentives plus the easing of exchange controls mean
that companies have been able to enter into joint ventures with overseas
investors, introducing much-needed technology and expertise to Sri Lankan
industry.
AMW has recently entered into a joint venture to manufacture tyres with the
giant RPG group of India.
It has started another tyre retreading operation with a Malaysian company
and Mr de Zoyza is thinking of going into the shoe business, again with a
company from Malaysia.
'The whole business atmosphere has changed in recent years,' says Mr de
Zoyza.
'While interest rates are high - more than 20 per cent - credit is not so
tightly controlled as it once was. The loosening of foreign exchange
controls has been a key development.
'Not long ago one of the big state banks gave me a credit card with a limit
of Dollars 10,000. I've never had a credit card in my life. Such a thing was
unthinkable only a few years ago.'
The AMW group now employs more than 2,000 people. AMW's capital has been
increased by its listing on the Colombo stock exchange.
Foreign shareholders control more than 20 per cent of the group's equity.
'We now realise we can't just depend on the home market for growth,' says Mr
de Zoyza.
'We must export and we are expanding our manufacturing base to make us more
competitive in the region.'
AMW has several links with Japanese conglomerates. For many years it has
been manufacturing motorcycle and bicycle tyres in collaboration with the
Japanese Inoui group.
It is also hoping to resurrect an old relationship with Yuasa, the Japanese
battery manufacturer.
'The rising yen is creating problems for Japanese business,' says Mr de
Zoyza. 'Companies like ours are building up the necessary expertise and
industrial base to offer an alternative, low-cost manufacturing facility.
'Despite the war I'm optimistic about the future.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (11): Old-fashioned attitudes - Gems
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE total value of precious gems smuggled out of Sri Lanka could be as high
as Colombo's annual foreign aid receipts, says a former governor of the
country's central bank and an expert in the gem trade.
If Dr Neville Karunatilleke is right, then 'unofficial exports' of Sri
Lanka's fabled array of star rubies, cornflower-blue sapphires, tourmalines,
moonstones, garnets and dozens of other precious gems, may be worth as much
as Dollars 300m a year. This would make gems Sri Lanka's largest single
export after garments and tea.
Dr Karunatilleke's guesstimate for smuggled rough stones and gems is about
double the official 1992 export figure for jewellery, diamond re-exports and
gems combined of SLRs6,888m.
As Colombo moves towards a more liberal export-import regime and towards
almost complete freedom of exchange controls, the chances are that smuggling
will decline to a much lower level.
Perhaps more important than legitimising the trade, a proportion of which is
always likely to prove attractive to smugglers and tax evaders, is the need
to catapult an old-fashioned industry into the 20th century.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, for example, hundreds of Thai traders bought
for a song what Sri Lankans then thought were worthless, milky-white
so-called Geuda stones. The Thais took them to Bangkok, subjected them to
specialised heat treatment and became the proud possessors of blue sapphires
worth up to Dollars 5,000 a carat, and often more than one hundred times
what they paid for them.
By the time the Sri Lankan industry woke up to the fact it was being
cheated, it had lost many hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sales.
Even though Sri Lankans are no longer giving away their Geuda stones they
have been slow to adopt the new technology and over 95 per cent (an
estimated 6 tonnes a year) of Sri Lankan Geudas are still being sold to
Thailand, mostly smuggled.
As the technology has improved, even high-quality rubies and sapphires are
now heat-treated to improve their colour. This can increase their value by
four or five times and is now widely accepted in the world marketplace.
In Sri Lanka, traditional attitudes that heating a gem is somehow cheating
has meant the industry has been slow to invest in the specialised furnaces
needed - a loss that the state Gem Corporation is trying to remedy with a
training programme and a campaign to persuade gem traders to adopt the Thai
technology.
Some progress has been made but because there is little vertical integration
in the industry and many gem cutters operate on a cottage industry basis,
gaining access to capital has not been easy.
Current estimates are that 150 small operators are engaged in heat treatment
throughout the country, compared to 500 large professional operations in
Bangkok alone.
Sri Lanka has also been slow off the mark to add value by using the
thousands of tiny less valuable gems in developing its jewellery export
sector.
The lack of initiative, poor access to capital and modern jewellery design
has been compounded by the recent loss to the Middle East of many of its
experienced gem cutters and jewellers.
However, in the past few years about a dozen companies have made an impact
on the market, notably Blue Diamond, Eluwalla, Sifani and Zam Gems. Some
have specialised in large-scale exports while others, such as Sifani,
specialise in adaptations of top-of-the-range jewellery.
Official Sri Lankan exports in jewellery have soared in the last two years
from just SLRs94m in 1990 to SLRs310m in 1992. Purchases by foreign
tourists, who carry jewellery out of the country unrecorded, could boost the
value of the export trade to around SLRs1bn in 1993.
One notable success story for Sri Lanka has been the cutting and polishing
of imported diamonds. In the space of just four years, with foreign capital
and help, the industry has grown from nothing to annual exports projected
this year at SLRs8bn; up 16 per cent on last year and nearly double that of
1991.
Although added value is only 20 per cent on diamond polishing compared to
more than 95 per cent for gems mined domestically, many hope it will presage
a new era for Sri Lanka's industry. The most ambitious are hoping the
country will follow the Thai road and import rough stones and gems from all
over the world, for cutting, polishing and making into jewellery.
To help achieve this goal, parliament has just passed two new acts setting
up a national gem and jewellery authority to engage in research and offer
training and promotion, and a gem bank to provide access to much-needed
capital. Sri Lanka's gem mining, cutting and jewellery business employs
about 300,000 people in a country where 25 per cent of the land is said to
be potentially gem bearing.
Colombo seems finally to have woken up to the fact that its main potential
competitor and teacher, Thailand, is heading towards a business with a total
annual turnover of Dollars 4bn in 1993 and it wants a much larger slice of
the action.
Says Dr Karunatilleke: 'Sri Lanka's industry has never been fully exploited
because 80 per cent of it has been under ground. But with the new bank
offering credit and the gem authority providing training I am optimistic
that many traders will decide to go legitimate and give us the modern
industry we are all looking for.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (14): A fast-growing business - Profile:
Lanka Garments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shabbir Sangani, head of Lanka Garments, has views which would raise
eyebrows among Sri Lanka's economic planners, writes Kieran Cooke.
'We should forget all this business about becoming a newly industrialised
country,' says Mr Sangani.
'If the economy does take off and we start growing above 5 per cent, then
wages are bound to rise. We'll lose our main advantage; the garment industry
will go elsewhere and then we'll create more problems than we've solved.'
Mr Sangani is one of a new breed of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. At 29, he
heads a fast-growing, privately-held business employing 1,500, with a
turnover of more than Dollars 2m last year.
He started Lanka Garments in the mid-1980s with Dollars 15,000 capital
loaned by his father.
He now has three factories, one on the outskirts of Colombo and two in rural
areas, set up under former President Premadasa's industry disbursement
programme.
Lanka Garments produces jackets and rainwear for the US market.
Very little of the product content is sourced in Sri Lanka. The fabric for a
popular brand of jacket destined for the US market is purchased in China by
a South Korean company.
The only thing sourced locally is the thread.
The company's workforce is more than 90 per cent female. Wages are set at a
minimum of SLRs2,000 a month. A South Korean has been brought in to help
supervise the work.
'She earns about 50 times the wages of a local but has paid her wage by
increases in productivity,' says Mr Sangani.
Like other garment producers, Mr Sangani feels that Sri Lanka will face
growing competition on wages from countries such as Vietnam, India and
Bangladesh.
To hedge against any downturn in the garment business, Mr Sangani has
diversified into diamonds. A diamond cutting factory next door to Lanka
Garments in Colombo now employs 250 workers.
An Israeli technical adviser has been brought in.
The uncut diamonds arrive from dealers in Antwerp and Tel Aviv. They are cut
in Sri Lanka and then shipped for sale in Japan.
The next step is to open a jewellery factory. The cut diamonds and the
jewellery for their setting will then both be sent to Japan.
Mr Sangani has a half-Japanese Sri Lankan partner who makes the
all-important contacts in Tokyo.
'I'm going to stick with these two industries,' says Mr Sangani. 'In theory,
when textiles hits a rough patch, then diamonds will come to the rescue. But
I know nothing in business works quite so neatly.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (9): Prime minister rose rapidly on
political ladder - Profile: Ranil Wickremesinghe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBO Postal District 7 is an area of elegant colonial mansions and
tree-lined avenues. Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka's prime minister
since May, is seen as very much a product of the 'Colombo 7 set' and - as a
nephew of former President J. R. Jaywardene - a part of the country's
political establishment, writes Kieran Cooke.
But few doubt the considerable talents of the prime minister. Aged only 44,
Mr Wickremesinghe has had a fast rise up the political ladder. There are
considerable risks involved in achieving high office.
'We have to take security precautions all the time,' says Mr Wickremesinghe.
'But I never thought of following any other career.'
Mr Wickremesinghe's father, who ran Sri Lanka's biggest newspaper group, was
a Christian. His mother was a Buddhist. The prime minister's uncle is an
Anglican bishop.
Former President Premadasa, a man of humble origins, was deeply suspicious
of the traditional political establishment. But Mr Wickremesinghe survived
and prospered during the former president's time, mainly due to his ability,
as then minister of industries, to push through much-needed economic
reforms.
'We are continuing with Premadasa's policies. There might be a certain
change of style; that's inevitable. The opposition accuses us of being
elitist. But there are more people in business now than at any time in the
past. The opposition talks about socialism but we have introduced real
socialism by giving people enough to eat and raising living standards.'
Mr Wickremesinghe says that despite opposition from some unions, the
government will continue with its privatisation policy. 'Union fears are
without foundation. We are going about the process slowly and carefully. But
I've no doubt that before too long we'll have more efficient, largely
privately-run enterprises.'
A lawyer, Mr Wickremesinghe became an MP when he was only 28 and
subsequently served as deputy minister of foreign affairs.
Despite the assassinations of both President Premadasa and the leader of an
opposition party earlier this year, Mr Wickremesinghe says there is
political stability in Sri Lanka.
'We have a mature political culture. Premadasa's assassination was a test
and we got through it without any major problems.'
But the war against Tamil separatists in the north and east of the country
is the main issue. There have been indications that the new administration
wants to take a harder line on the problem than Mr Premadasa.
'I don't think policy has changed. We have always said we are willing to
negotiate but it seems the LTTE (The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
main separatist group) only responds to pressure. We are not closing the
door to talks but the orders to the army remain the same: to eliminate
terrorism and ensure that more and more areas are under government control.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (10): A distinct change of style -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER President Ranasinghe Premadasa often found Sri Lanka's tabloid press
more vicious than the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north of the country or the
Pol Pot-style Singhalese nationalist rebellion in the south.
Each Sunday the tabloids would tear Mr Premadasa's reputation to pieces,
focusing on the fact that he was not a 'goigama' - the farmer caste which
has traditionally produced Sri Lanka's political leaders.
Since the assassination of Mr Premadasa in May, the tabloid newspapers have
gone quiet. The new head of state, President D. B. Wijetunga, soft spoken
and avuncular, does not make a good political target.
Whereas Mr Premadasa was always viewed as an outsider by the political
establishment, Mr Wijetunga is a 'goigama' from the Kandy hill country.
Mr Wijetunga's prime minister, Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, is part of the
Colombo elite. The English educated professional class is relieved that what
is perceived to be the natural political order has been restored.
The new leadership has brought a distinct change of style. Gone is the
populism and the showmanship of the Premadasa regime. Mr Premadasa, said to
have worked 18 hours a day, was known as a very hard taskmaster. He was also
feared by those who had crossed his political path.
Now the political mood is more relaxed. The media is more open. But there
has been some continuity. There has been no dramatic change in the direction
of government policy. Some of Mr Premadasa's key advisers are still in
positions of power. Mr R. Paskaralingam, an important Premadasa confidant
and the man credited with persuading the former president of the need for
economic reform, is also Mr Wijetunga's secretary of finance.
The big question now is whether the country's new leaders have the strength
to carry through tough economic policies, or whether short-term political
trade-offs will be made. A budget due in early November will serve as an
indicator of the new government's political will.
During his time in office Mr Premadasa did put down - albeit brutally - an
uprising in the south. He also tried, and failed, to negotiate a peace with
the Tamil separatists. Perhaps most importantly, he made moves to open up
the economy, while at the same time launching a much-praised poverty
alleviation programme.
Mr Wijetunga has been able to build on that legacy; able to sell
Premadasaism without Premadasa.
Less than three weeks after Mr Premadasa's assassination, voters went to the
polls in seven of Sri Lanka's nine provinces to elect new provincial
councils. The UNP made what was considered to be a surprisingly strong
showing in the polls, although it did lose control of the western province,
which contains Colombo and more than 25 per cent of the country's 17m
people. Most importantly, the polls, which had a 75 per cent turn-out, were
peaceful - seen by outsiders as evidence of the resilience and maturity of
the country's political system.
The UNP would appear to be secure. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP),
headed by Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, a former prime minister, is in some
disarray. Mrs Bandaranaike, suffering the after-effects of a stroke, is not
as active as she once was although she still commands a considerable
personal following, especially in rural areas.
Mrs Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika - now chief minister of western
province - is at loggerheads with her brother, SLFP MP Anura Bandaranaike.
In mid-October, Mr Bandaranaike resigned from the SLFP claiming the party
was in danger of being controlled by what he called 'discredited Marxists.'
Now there is talk that Mr Bandaranaike could join the UNP, the party to
which his father, Mr Solomon Bandaranaike, prime minister in the 1950s,
originally belonged.
Meanwhile, the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), a breakaway UNP
grouping, would appear to have lost its political platform which was almost
entirely based on an intense dislike for the rule of former president
Premadasa.
After the violence of May, everyone is now hoping for a period of political
calm. But already the talk is of presidential elections, due to be held
before the end of next year.
Mr Wijetunga, 71, was originally seen as a caretaker president but now shows
signs of wanting to stay in office beyond next year's elections.
At the moment, people seem comfortable with Mr Wijetunga. The opposition,
more concerned with its own quarrels, holds few political cards.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (8): Deficit is at a record high - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM is rarely painless. Moving ahead rapidly to create a more liberal
trade and foreign exchange regime, Sri Lanka has been hit hard by a sharp
deterioration in its balance of trade, giving finance officials serious
cause for concern.
A steady reduction in import tariffs, likely to be continued in next month's
budget, and the easing last year of most foreign exchange controls on the
current account, have helped to push the country's trade deficit to a record
high, in spite of soaring exports.
In the first six months of 1993, the trade gap widened by 38 per cent from
SLRs24.73bn in the first six months of 1992 to SLRs34.19bn, a level which
most agree is not sustainable in the long run.
As a proportion of total trade, the deficit remained the same at 21 per
cent, but imports continued to grow at a faster rate than exports and from a
much higher base. Part of the 35 per cent increase in imports to SLRs95.97bn
in the first half of 1993 was a one-off purchase by Air Lanka, the country's
civil airline, of two Airbus A340s. Much of the growth came from capital
goods used for investment or intermediate goods, such as textiles, which are
re-exported.
On exports, the outlook is brighter than it has been for some time.
According to Mr A. R. Mansoor, minister for trade, the most remarkable
development has been the expansion in the range of industrial exports.
'With 500 garment factories on stream, clothes are our top export earner.
But, most encouraging of all, we are now selling 2,000 industrial products
overseas,' he says.
The first half of 1993 saw a sharp recovery in overseas sales of tea, rubber
and cash crops following a severe drought in 1992. This, coupled with the
continuing success of Sri Lanka's runaway textile sector, saw exports jump
by 34 per cent in the first half of the year, putting the country on course
for a record export performance in 1993. Exports in the first six months
totalled SLRs61.8bn; up from SLRs46.34bn in the same period last year.
Textiles and garments led the way with a 31 per cent increase in export
value to SLRs30.77bn in the first six months after a record-breaking year in
1992. For the first time, textile and garment exports accounted for 50 per
cent of Sri Lanka's total overseas sales.
Even in value-added terms, garment exports (imported inputs account for
about 60 per cent of the gross export value) have now overtaken the
country's traditional tea and rubber export mainstay.
In the first half of 1993, Sri Lanka's agricultural exports grew by 21 per
cent to SLRs14.57bn, accounting for 24 per cent of total exports. Tea made a
strong recovery in the first six months of 1993, up 35 per cent to SLRs9.2bn
following last year's drought when it recorded its most dismal performance
since 1956.
The removal of substantial export taxes on tea, rubber and coconut at the
end 1992 saw the elimination of an important structural inefficiency in the
economy and did much to improve the prospects for an industry where poor
prices and high costs have meant many plantations have made losses.
This year the Russians have come to the rescue of Sri Lankan tea exporters
after the loss of the Iraq market two years ago due to the Gulf war United
Nations embargo and a sharp reduction in tea imports this year by Iran and
Egypt, two of Sri Lanka's big markets.
Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries imported
almost 20,000 tonnes in the first six months and are expected to import
about 30,000 tonnes of Sri Lankan tea - mostly of the cheaper variety - out
of an expected total of 220,000 tonnes of exports this year.
The star export performers in 1993, however, have been other industrial
products, up more than 64 per cent on last year to SLRs12.2bn, and going
some small way to substantiating Mr Mansoor's claim that the country may
soon no longer be a two-horse export economy of tea and textiles.
Fastest growing of all the export items in this category has been polished
diamonds, up almost threefold to SLRs2.53bn in the first half, with exports
of manufactured rubber goods not far behind.
But Sri Lanka's economy still has a long way to go before it can shake off
the suspicion it is still over-reliant on just a few dominant sectors. After
all, tea and textiles alone accounted for 65 per cent of the country's total
exports in the first six months of this year.

OPERATIVES of New Delhi's secret service Special Investigation Team (SIT)
set up to track down the killers of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former Indian prime
minister, are now regular visitors to Colombo, writes Mervyn de Silva and
Richard Cowper.
SIT is working closely with Sri Lanka's police and intelligence services and
its mission is clear: seize or kill Velupillai Prabhakaran founder and
commander of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the
man they are convinced master-minded the assassination of the Indian prime
minister.
Mr Gandhi was killed in May 1991 by a young female Tamil suicide bomber from
Sri Lanka at an election rally in the southern Indian city of Madras. The
modus operandi was very similar to that used by the LTTE to murder Sri
Lanka's President Premadasa at an election rally in Colombo in May this
year.
The co-operation between New Delhi and Colombo in this and other security
areas is a far cry from the last decade when India operated a policy aimed
at destabilising her tiny southern neighbour.
Today, New Delhi no longer supports and arms Tamil Tiger guerrillas. It
fears that it might end up with its own rebel movement in the fractious
southern Tamil state of Tamil Nadu and is taking a tough line against LTTE
arms smuggling.
Earlier this year, the Indian navy captured and destroyed a trawler in the
Palk Straits, a 20-mile strip of water that separates Tamil Nadu and Sri
Lanka's Jaffna peninsula. As well as arms and explosives, on board was
Prabhakaran's right-hand man, known as Kittu. He and a number of other
senior LTTE commanders died in the incident in circumstances that have never
been fully explained.
The loss of Kittu is said to have been a heavy blow to the rebel leader.
Prabhakaran is said to have placed great reliance on Kittu as one of the few
commanders he could trust.
So deep is his fear of New Delhi that he recently placed Mahattya, his
deputy, under house arrest in Jaffna as a suspected 'Indian agent.'
All this seems an age from the early 1980s when Rajiv's mother, Mrs Indira
Gandhi, ordered RAW - India's equivalent of the CIA - to arm and train
cadres of a tiny Tamil rebel movement in secret Indian camps. The close
relationship began to break down when Rajiv - who succeeded his mother as
prime minister after she was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard - signed an
Indo-Sri Lankan peace accord in 1987. An Indian peacekeeping force was
despatched to Jaffna to force a settlement on the Tamil Tigers.
India and Mr Gandhi were to pay dearly for this change in policy. With just
a few thousand guerrillas, Prabhakaran engaged and drove out an Indian army
of 120,000 men. At least 7,000 Indian soldiers died and many more were
wounded before the pullout came in 1990.
In parts of Tamil Nadu - the traditional Dravidian enemy of the Buddhist
Singhalese - the Tamil Tigers are still seen as heroes. But New Delhi has a
new foreign policy of regional co-operation and a very deep personal score
to settle with the man who brought to a premature end the reign of India's
most famous political dynasty.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (6): Humanitarian effort to feed
civilians - The battle for hearts and minds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER

<TEXT>
WHEN Colombo put down in bloody fashion a Singhalese nationalist uprising in
1989 it soon found itself having to contend with a volley of international
condemnation. Its systematic abuse of human rights also alienated many of
its own people, writes Richard Cowper.
Today, Sri Lanka is still fighting a guerrilla war but it has put greater
efforts into winning hearts and minds at home and abroad.
The country is now known overseas for its unique humanitarian effort in
providing virtually all the food and necessities to more than 500,000 Tamil
civilians living in the rebel-controlled Jaffna peninsula, where Tamil Tiger
guerrillas have been waging an 11-year struggle for an independent homeland.
'Normally, civilians trapped in guerrilla-controlled areas have to find
their own food,' says Mr Dominic Dufour, head of the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) based in Colombo.
'The government has realised that no rebel with a Kalashnikov ever starves.
But this programme is unique. It's the only country in the world where you
can officially mail a letter from the capital to a rebel stronghold.'
The government started the programme in 1990 and now spends more than
Dollars 500m a year, despatching an average of 10,000 tonnes of food each
month to Jaffna in a fleet of cargo ships under the supervision of the ICRC.
The food is distributed free to about 240,000 people who have been displaced
from their Jaffna homes. The rest is sold in shops to civilians and
guerrillas alike, under the watchful gaze of highly-efficient Tamil Tiger
tax collectors.
Mr Christie Silva, in charge of the programme at the Ministry of
Reconstruction and Rehabilitation says: 'It's true we do not want hundreds
of thousands of civilians fleeing south. But neither do we want to see
starvation.
'We have to think of the future: after all, they are our people; they are
also Sri Lankans.'
No one is pretending the government is without fault. There are reports of
malnutrition in some areas of Jaffna. A ban on diesel shipments, to deny
guerrillas fuel for their vehicles, means there is a power blackout for most
nights of the month.
The country's 80,000-strong army sometimes oversteps the mark in its bitter
struggle to recapture large areas of the north and some patches of the east
which are still controlled by the guerrillas.
In a visit this month to the Palaly army-controlled zone, just north north
of Jaffna city, I saw several night-time bursts of 150mm howitzer shells. In
an area so densely populated anything less than perfect accuracy is likely
to kill or injure non-combatants.
Reports of civilian Tamil deaths by army shelling are not uncommon.
But in the war for hearts and minds, there is some evidence that the
government may be winning. A proposal to hold local elections in the
country's troubled eastern province is seen as a further step towards
normality in an area once largely controlled by the Tamil Tigers.
In the north, the growing financial predations of the guerrillas against a
hard-pressed and besieged civilian population are beginning to take their
toll.
Some Tamil civilians appear to have become heartily sick of the war and
might even welcome a return to civilian control.
But Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the ruthless Tamil Tiger leader, does not
appear to be willing to negotiate a political solution and Colombo therefore
sees itself compelled to pursue a military one.
All the hard-won gains could disappear overnight if the army attempts to
recapture the Jaffna peninsula, as it is threatening to do.
Thousands of Tamil civilians might be killed and the Tigers would do
everything in their power - including using human shields - to ensure that
Sri Lanka's image was again tarnished in the eyes of the international
community.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (5): Fresh confidence among army chiefs
 -Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 300 people were killed and hundreds injured earlier this month in
one of the fiercest battles of the 11-year war between Sri Lanka's armed
forces and Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
But political and military observers say what was unusual about the battle
for Kilaly - a small guerrilla port on the edge of the Jaffna lagoon - was
not the scale of the action but the fact that seven Sri Lankan army officers
were killed in the fighting.
Army officers, members of a once largely ceremonial force, have not been
noted for leading from the front. But after nearly a year of inactivity
following the deaths of several senior commanders in a land-mine explosion,
there is now a new grit and determination at the top in Sri Lanka's
80,000-strong army.
The country's senior military commanders, confident they have the country's
troubled Eastern province under control, say they have at last been given
the go-ahead to retake the rebel-held northern peninsula of Jaffna, from
which they were expelled in humiliating circumstances in 1990.
This confidence appears to be percolating down to even the most battle-weary
of frontline officers. President D. B. Wijetunga - angered by earlier
political prevarication, the assassination in May of President Ranasinghe
Premadasa and the high cost of a war that has claimed 32,000 lives - has
publicly vowed to crush terrorism.
Not for him the policy of his predecessor who accomodated guerrillas in
five-star hotels. Mr Wijetunga appears to believe it is not possible to
negotiate with Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the autocratic and militarily
brilliant leader of the Tigers. 'There is no ethnic problem in the north,
only terrorism,' says Mr Wijetunga.
Defence Department officials refuse to say when the main offensive across
the war-torn Jaffna peninsula - also home to about 600,000 Tamil civilians -
is likely to be launched. But military commanders hint that it could come
next year.
The army has already started building up its strength. Ten thousand new
recruits are under training and more are expected. The total complement may
end up at about 100,000 men.
The military plans to buy helicopter gunships, landing craft and fast patrol
boats for the confrontation with an estimated 3,000-4,000 well-armed and
trained guerrillas who have been fighting for an independent Tamil homeland.
Part of the explanation for the more determined political will in Colombo,
and the army's new confidence, may lie in the recent success the military
has had in bringing an element of normality back to the country's troubled
Eastern province.
Less than three years ago, the province's two main cities of Trincomalee and
Batticalore were in rebel hands and large tracts of the mixed Tamil, Moslem
and Singhalese province were no-go areas to the army and the civil
authorities. Today, most of the province is under government control, at
least during the day, and many Tamil Tiger guerrillas based in the area
appear to have fled north to the Jaffna peninsula.
The government is planning to hold local elections in the Eastern province
in February and, later in the year, a referendum on whether to merge with
the country's northern province. If local elections are successful, tens of
thousands of Sri Lankan troops could be released for duty in Jaffna.
President Wijetunga, who is also Sri Lanka's finance minister, is intent on
trying to catapult his country into the ranks of the newly industrialised
nations by the beginning of the next century, and is only too well aware of
the heavy economic toll the war is taking on a country where many still live
below the poverty line.
To finance soaring war costs the government has recently been forced to
impose a special defence levy of 3 per cent on all transactions, operating
in a manner similar to value added tax. This year, direct military
expenditure is expected to total more than SLRs20bn - about 15 per cent of
the budget - but at least the same amount again is spent on feeding and
rehabilitating the war-torn civilian population in the north and east.
Thousands of foreign investors have been frightened away by the fighting and
many believe the number of tourist arrivals could climb to more than 1m
within a few years if the war was ended. The economy of Jaffna, once the
biggest supplier of fish and cash crops in Sri Lanka, is at a standstill and
tourists no longer visit the East with its fabulous beaches.
President Wijetunga appears to be willing to stake all on the attempt to
recapture the Jaffna peninsula guerrilla stronghold by force in an attempt
to bring the war to a swift conclusion.
A brief glance at the map would seem to suggest that the army is in an
excellent position to launch an offensive. It has a series of
army-controlled zones ringing the peninsula: at Palaly in the north it
controls Jaffna city's airport in a zone 20km wide and 5km deep; across a
sunken bridge to the west of the city it controls a number of sizeable
islands; and to the south-east it has cut off the peninsula from the Sri
Lankan mainland by linking its Elephant Pass army base to the sea.
But the war in the north is a classic guerrilla action, fought by the most
tenacious and fanatical of men and women, as the recent battle of Kilaly
showed. On the second day of the army advance from its base at Elephant
pass, a carefully dug-in group of 1,000 guerrillas took the Sri Lankan
forces by surprise and in bitter hand-to-hand fighting killed 118 soldiers.
Hardcore guerrillas, led by a daring military strategist, may number little
more than 5,000 throughout Sri Lanka, but they were able to defeat 120,000
Indian troops in the late 1980s. Every combatant carries a cyanide pill
around the neck, which they swallow rather than allow themselves to be taken
prisoner alive.
There may be fewer guerrillas, and less well-trained, than when they pushed
the Indians out and when they controlled much of the Eastern province, but
they remain as ruthless and are still able to assassinate politicians and
military commanders.
There is some evidence they may no longer have such fierce support from the
Tamil population in Jaffna. Creation of Tamil Eelam (the rebel's free state)
is as far away as ever and some locals have dared to speak out against a
guerrilla force, whose tax collecting ability at home and abroad, is
legendary. But after a decade of indoctrination most ordinary Tamils in
Jaffna still fear Sri Lanka's 'Singhalese Buddhist army' more.
Even if Tamil civilians did not fight voluntarily they might be forced into
battle on the side of the guerrillas. It is by no means certain that the Sri
Lankan armed forces could march into Jaffna city without killing on the way
tens of thousands of civilians in the densely-populated province.
House-to-house fighting in the city could be even bloodier, and the question
no one seems able to answer with confidence is whether the army yet has the
numbers, ability and determination to retain control of the peninsula once
it has marched in.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (10): Risky business
 -Profile: Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the financial companies primed for privatisation by the Balladur
government, Credit Lyonnais is by far the most risky - and the most
exciting.
Credit Lyonnais is now counting the cost of five years of aggressive
expansion under its chairman, Jean-Yves Haberer.
It has been left with an impressive European retail banking network and a
bulging junk bond portfolio, but with a large number of bad loans on its
books and a trail of losses that added up to FFr1.8bn in 1992 and to FFr1bn
in the first half of this year.
Mr Haberer recently confirmed that he was considering a post at another
company.
The hot tip to replace him is Jean Peyrelevade, the highly-respected head of
the UAP insurance group, who is one of the few figures in French finance
deemed capable of taking on Credit Lyonnais.
Nevertheless the Credit Lyonnais scenario is not entirely grim. Its big
corporate catastrophes are now over. As the economy recovers it should start
reaping the benefits of its impressive domestic network and of Mr Haberer's
best legacy, its brand new European network.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (8): A prudent
approach - Profile: AGF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SO far Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the third largest insurer in
France after UAP and Axa, has been relatively resilient in spite of the
pressures on the French insurance industry. It saw net profits fall to
FFr1.5bn in 1992 from FFr2.7bn in 1991, but recently reported that profits
had stabilised at FFr1.4bn in the first half of 1993.
AGF has not been unaffected by the recession. Banque du Phenix, one of its
banking subsidiaries, last year was hit by the property squeeze and this
year it has borne heavy losses on its stake in Comptoir des Entrepreneurs.
However AGF, under the chairmanship of Michel Albert, has been less exposed
to the more volatile areas of the economy than UAP and GAN, its fellow
state-controlled insurers, and has benefited from his long-term strategy of
protecting profitability rather than chasing market share. Mr Albert has
already said that he expects the second half of 1993 to show an improvement
over the first.
AGF has adopted the same prudent approach to international expansion as to
the management of its domestic business. Yet it scored a coup last year by
taking a stake in AMB, the German insurer, beating UAP in the race to become
the first big French insurer with a sizeable presence in Germany.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (11): Chasing pole
position - Profile: UAP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SOON as the Balladur government put the finishing touches to its
privatisation plans Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de
Paris (UAP), started to argue that his company, as the largest player in
French insurance, should be the first insurer to be sold.
Mr Peyrelevade might not be around to supervise the sell-off. He is mooted
as a prime contender to take over the chair of Credit Lyonnais, with Jacques
Friedmann, a long-standing ally of Mr Balladur, succeeding him at UAP.
Yet Mr Peyrelevade is as busy as ever at UAP. He recently trumpeted a
'significant increase' in profits for this year after UAP's net profits
tumbled to FFr1.1bn in 1992 from FFr3.8bn in 1991. He did warn, however,
that the group was unlikely to return to its peak profits of FFr4bn in 1990.
The forthcoming privatisation, coupled with speculation about his own move
to Credit Lyonnais, has prompted Mr Peyrelevade to tidy up the main piece of
unfinished business at UAP - its four-year struggle to win control of
Colonia, the German insurer. He has now done the deal. UAP, as he proudly
pointed out to the Paris stockmarket, is now the second largest insurer in
Europe and is chasing hard on the heels of Germany's Allianz for pole
position.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (7): A watershed for
finance - Privatisation will bring with it big changes for banks and
insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, this summer announced
the names of the 21 companies scheduled for privatisation by his government,
some of France's most powerful financial groups appeared high on his list.
The Balladur privatisation drive has important implications for the French
financial sector. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the first of the
government's share sales, has already been sold as eventually will Credit
Lyonnais. The sales of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances
Generales de France (AGF), the powerful insurers, are expected next year
followed by the GAN Group.
These share sales will mark a watershed in the development of the French
financial system by heralding significant changes in its traditionally close
relationship with the state and by forcing the old state-controlled banks
and insurers to carve out new roles as private sector companies.
The precise nature of the state's relationship with these groups is shrouded
in secrecy. In theory the government has no direct influence over the public
sector banks and insurers in terms of their day-to-day management and
strategy. But in practice it has exerted significant influence over both
areas - directly and indirectly.
The source of the government's direct influence is its power to hire and
fire the chairmen of the companies it controls. A change of government
usually triggers an elaborate game of musical chairs as the new
administration replaces the old appointees with its own candidates.
It is scarcely a coincidence that the chairman of almost all France's big
banks and insurers started their careers as political advisers to prominent
politicians or as civil servants in important ministries. Once in their new
posts they can reshuffle the senior management of their companies, often by
bringing in people from their old ministries.
Some observers suspect that the presence of so many fonctionnaires, or civil
servants, has instilled a bureaucratic culture in France's large financial
groups. They claim banks and insurers have been left with top-heavy
management structures, a reluctance to shed staff and a cautious approach to
international expansion.
Privatisation should bring the fonctionnaire era to an end. The chairmen
will then be appointed, as with any other private sector company, by the
shareholders, making future appointees more likely to be professional
financiers than well-connected bureaucrats.
Similarly privatisation should make the banks and insurers less vulnerable
to indirect pressure from the state in areas such as interest rate policy
and investment strategy.
Anglo-Saxon sceptics tend to assume that the French government simply
dictates interest rate policy to the state banks, BNP and Credit Lyonnais,
by telling them whether and when they can change base rates. In practice the
system is more subtle in that the political appointees at the top of the big
banks are not only virtually guaranteed to be sympathetic to the
government's aims, but know instinctively what it expects them to do.
Conspiracy theorists cite as evidence of the state's influence events of
earlier this year when the French banks incurred heavy losses by holding
base rates at a time when the Bank of France raised its short term lending
rates as part of the government's battle to defend the franc. They also
claim it is instructive that BNP and Credit Lyonnais are usually the first
to cut base rates, while any increases tend to be led by the privatised
banks, Societe Generale or Credit du Nord (part of Paribas).
The banks claim publicly that the government has no control, either direct
or indirect, over base rates. Privately they admit that, since the
privatisation of Societe Generale in the late 1980s, the system has been
more flexible in that at least one of the Big Three retail banks is
genuinely independent of the state. The sale of BNP and Credit Lyonnais,
should erode the government's influence even further.
Similarly the government should find it much more difficult to use the state
banks and insurers as tools in its industrial policy by 'suggesting' that
they take strategic stakes in other public sector companies. The government
claims that such investment decisions are taken voluntarily. But the row a
few years ago when BNP tried to avoid taking a stake in Air France suggests
otherwise.
However this ritual may well survive privatisation. The entire French
corporate sector is riddled with cross-shareholdings and 'sweetheart' deals.
Moreover the government has been at pains to ensure that it has some
residual influence over the privatisation candidates by appointing its own
candidates to lead them into the private sector. Rene Thomas, veteran
chairman of BNP, has already been replaced by Michel Pebereau, who was
involved with the privatisation of Credit Commercial de France (CCF).
Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, is mooted as the next
target. He is expected to move to the chairman's seat at Credit Nationale,
paving the way for Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, to take over at Credit
Lyonnais.
But old habits die hard. A few years ago Marc Vienot, chairman of the
thoroughly privatised Societe Generale, was searching for an heir apparent.
His choice was not, as one might expect, an experienced banker from Societe
Generale itself or one of its competitors, but Daniel Bouton, a career civil
servant.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of bureaucrats at the economy ministry in Bercy to the east of Paris
is now beavering away on one of the trickiest problems on the Balladur
government's agenda - how to reform France's anachronistic, and fiendishly
complicated pension system.
Pension reform is not only logistically complex, but politically explosive.
The Bercy bureaucrats must find a way of reducing the financial strains on
the present state-controlled system without attacking the living standards
of France's pensioners, or burdening tax payers with even higher pension
contributions.
Both Edouard Balladur, prime minister, and Edmond Alphandery, his economy
minister, are said to be determined to press ahead with pension reform. The
consensus is that one element of their programme will be the introduction of
private pensions to bolster the state system. This would not only provide a
lucrative source of business for the banks and insurance companies, but
should also have a beneficial effect on the Paris stockmarket.
France's pensioners enjoy a reasonably high standard of living. The
retirement age, reduced to 60 by the socialists in the early 1980s, is one
of the lowest in Europe. The socialists also ensured that anyone who had
worked for 37.5 years could retire at 60 and then receive 50 per cent of
their annual salaries in their 10 highest-earning years up to a maximum of
FFr149,820.
The pension system, which dates back to the post-war years, is run on a cash
management basis whereby the Caisse de Retraite, a state institution, pays
out pensions from the contributions it receives from those in employment.
This system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large,
young working population to support its pensioners.
But the system has since come under strain as the population has aged and,
in proportional terms, the number of pensioners has risen, while the working
population has shrunk. The system is now operating at an annual deficit of
FFr20bn with 3.3 workers to support each pensioner. By the year 2005, when
the progeny of the post-war 'baby boom' start to retire, there will be 1.9
workers for each pensioner and only 1.3 by 2040. That means that, if the
present system continues, each worker would have to relinquish 35 per cent
of his or her salary in pension contributions, against 19 per cent today.
Mr Balladur has already started to refine the system. He resisted pressure
from the right to reverse the socialist reforms by raising the retirement
age, but has done so indirectly by increasing the 'qualifying period' for
state pensions from 37.5 years to 40 years from 2003 onwards. He has also
extended the 'period of calculation' for pensions to the 20 highest-earning
years thereby slightly reducing the final entitlement.
These measures were only ever regarded as stop-gaps. Mr Alphandery's working
party is now trying to thrash out proposals for comprehensive reform. Mr
Alphandery says he hopes to be able to finalise his proposals by the end of
this year and to present them to the National Assembly for approval during
the next parliamentary session which starts in April.
The simplest solution to the pension problem would be to encourage today's
tax payers to invest in private pensions for their own retirement. This
would alleviate the pressure on the state system by enabling the government
gradually to steadily reduce its pension payments - and the pension deficit.
The expansion of private pensions would create an attractive new market for
France's banks and insurers. It would also have a big effect on the
stockmarket by providing an influx of investment for French equities.
Moreover it would create a new breed of private pension funds which would
accelerate modernisation of the Paris market by acting as powerful
institutional investors to 'discipline' companies as they do in the US and
the UK.
However, the prospect of persuading French voters to spend extra money on
private pensions while they are still contributing to the state system, is
potentially problematic for the Balladur government which comes up for
re-election in spring 1995.
The government would also be wary of burdening tax payers with extra
expenditure at a time when it is desperately trying to stimulate consumer
spending to haul France out of recession.
Some observers suspect that the Bercy working party may be looking for more
imaginative solutions. One option might be to package private pensions as
savings schemes, given that the French have traditionally been fond of
saving and the savings ratio is already high at more than 13 per cent.
The Bercy working party might also consider launching a bumper pension fund,
along the lines of this summer's highly successful 'Balladur bond' issue
which raised FFr110bn for Mr Balladur's job creation schemes. Such a fund
would not only plug the present pension deficit but could go some way
towards solving the longer terms problems of the French pension system.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (6): Rekindling the
public's interest - It is hoped that the stockmarket will benefit from
privatisation with an increase in equity investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE unveiling of his privatisation plans, Edmond Alphandery, the French
economy minister, made clear that his government saw the share sales not
only as a means of raising capital, but also as a chance to raise the level
of investment in the Paris stockmarket.
The market has long been waiting for such an initiative. The last real boost
for French equities was the centre-right government's privatisation drive in
1986 and 1987, which drew international investors into the Paris market and
encouraged the French public to switch some of their savings into equities.
International investors have continued to plough their money into France,
but the October 1987 stockmarket crash brought the French public's new found
interest in share ownership to an abrupt halt. The current round of
privatisations offers an ideal opportunity to try to rekindle the public's
interest.
The privatisations could not have come at a better time from the
stockmarket's perspective. The French financial sector was transformed in
the late 1980s by a sweeping deregulation programme in which old monopolies
were abolished, closed markets opened and the Matif, now one of the world's
largest futures markets, was launched.
However the stockmarket's progress has since been impeded by the survival of
old anachronisms such as the impot de bourse, the tax on share transactions,
and the strict rules on block trading, which have prompted many traders to
execute larger deals in London rather than Paris.
Edouard Balladur's government, like that of the late Pierre Beregovoy, his
socialist predecessor, has tried to address these difficulties with mixed
success. Meanwhile the overwheening issue facing the Paris stockmarket is
its relatively low level of liquidity - the legacy of a dearth of equity and
of capital.
The equity shortage is due partly to the nepotistic structure of the French
corporate sector whereby many large companies, including Michelin and
L'Oreal, are still controlled by their founding families. The other groups
have negotiated so many cross-shareholdings and 'sweetheart' deals that they
are not only virtually bid-proof, but only a small proportion of their
shares are actually traded.
Another contributor to the equity problem is the power of the state, which
still controls many of France's largest companies. The Balladur
privatisations represent a powerful, if partial, solution by unleashing
around FFr45bn of new shares on to the stockmarket this year and at least
FFr55bn next year.
'Liquidity has been a problem for the Paris market, but the situation is
getting better,' said David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel
in Paris.
'The privatisations should help and we have also seen a great deal of
private sector activity this year with convertible bond and warrant issues.
By the end of 1993 the Paris market will have been tapped for up to
FFr70bn.'
Privatisation should also help to assuage the other side of the liquidity
problem: the shortage of capital caused by the traditional ambivalence of
the French towards equity investment and the state's stranglehold over the
pensions system, which means that Paris, unlike London and New York, can not
count on an influx of investment from private pension funds.
The forthcoming reform of French pensions, which is likely to involve the
creation of private pension funds, should provide a long-term solution to
this problem. But in the meantime the privatisations should at least bring
in a short-term flow of capital from foreign institutions and the French
public.
The increase in foreign investment was one of the main achievements of
France's last privatisation drive. The 1986 and 1987 share sales provided an
opening for international investors into the Paris market and the proportion
of French equities in foreign hands has since increased steadily, rising
from 21 per cent to 28 per cent in the last two years alone, according to
the Bank of France.
So far the present privatisation plan seems set to bring yet more foreign
capital into France. The government was forced after just two days to close
the institutional part of its first privatisation, the Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) share sale, because of strong demand, particularly from US
investors.
These investors were undoubtedly attracted by the unexpectedly low price of
the BNP shares. The strong dollar was an additional incentive for US
investors, as was the strong yen for the Japanese. However, analysts have
also detected an underlying increase in interest in the Paris market.
'This is a great time to buy French shares,' said Thierry Tamers, head of
North American sales at Baring Securities in Paris. 'The economy is probably
at the bottom of the cycle and many of the privatisation candidates, like
BNP, are recovery stocks.'
The successful outcome of the public part of the BNP issue also boded well
for the government's prospects of persuading the French public to
participate in the privatisations. The French responded well to the
mid-1980s privatisations - when 11 per cent of the population bought
FFr40bn, or almost a third, of the available shares - but the 1987 crash
dashed the government's hopes of boosting share ownership. The number of
private investors has since fallen from 5.5m to less than 4.5m.
The Balladur government hopes to reverse this trend. This summer's FFr110bn
'Balladur bond' issue was cleverly designed as a bridge to persuade the
French to switch their savings, first into government bonds, and then into
privatisation shares. Recent reductions in interest rates, coupled with the
prospect of further cuts, should make equities seem increasingly attractive
in comparison with the dwindling returns on cash investments.
'Everything is conspiring to make the equity market look very attractive
against cash - a savings glut, low inflation and falling interest rates,'
said James Capel's Mr Harrington. 'We're still waiting to see a flow of
funds from cash into shares in France. The privatisation programme may be
exactly what investors have been waiting for.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (5): Less grim than
signs suggest - The Corporate Sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE who read the recent round of interim statements from the heads of
large French companies could be forgiven for thinking that corporate France
was in a sorry state.
The French economy is still in recession. There is no sign of an upturn in
domestic demand and the franc is too strong to trigger an increase in
exports. The companies quoted on the CAC-40 Index are now nearing the end of
their fourth successive year of earnings decline.
Yet the full picture is not quite as grim as the interim statements suggest.
Analysts have already written off 1993 as yet another year of depressed
earnings, but they expect 1994 to mark the start of the recovery. Moreover
corporate France is in sound financial shape. The corporate sector is now in
a positive cash position for the first time in decades, according to the
Bank of France.
These positive signs have sent the CAC-40 Index soaring for much of this
year. Foreign investors, particularly the US and UK institutions, have
poured new capital into France. A number of French companies, notably the
Axa insurance group and Schneider electrical engineering concern, have taken
advantage of their strong share prices by staging capital-raising exercises.
The sepia-tinted analysis of the French corporate sector should not be
overstated. Many companies are still under intense financial pressure.
The domestic market has been sluggish for some time but until last autumn,
French industry did at least have the consolation of strong export growth,
thanks to the combination of years of low inflation and a competitive
currency.
Last autumn's currency crisis put a stop to that. The franc's relative
strength since September 1993 has not only reduced reported profits from
international subsidiaries but has dealt a devastating blow to sales of
French products in weaker currency countries such as the UK, Spain and
Italy.
The export squeeze is one of the main difficulties facing LVMH, the luxury
goods group, which recently issued a profits warning for the full year after
announcing a fall in first half profits. Peugeot, the car maker, blamed
adverse exchange rates for its first half losses, as did Michelin, the tyre
group. Renault, the other major French motor company, saw its recovery
checked by a steep fall in interim net profits.
The picture is equally bleak on the domestic front. Consumer spending is
still stubbornly static. There is also no sign of an increase in industrial
investment, partly because French companies are continuing to bask in the
benefits of their heavy investment in the late 1980s and partly because the
depressed state of demand leaves them with little incentive to increase
capacity.
A number of retail groups, including Pinault-Printemps and BHV, have
recently announced reduced interim profits. The banking and insurance groups
are still being forced to make steep provisions because of the property
crisis and the alarming rate of small company failures. Credit Lyonnais, the
most vulnerable of the big banks, recently reported a FFr1bn interim net
loss.
Unsurprisingly, the toll of job losses has continued. The number of people
out of work has risen by more than 200,000 since the start of this year to
reach over 3.22m, or 11.7 per cent of the workforce. A number of large
groups have accelerated their rationalisation drives, including Air France
and Michelin. LVMH is embroiled in an ugly battle with the champagne trade
unions over its plans to shed staff for the first time in the champagne
industry's history.
The Balladur government hopes that unemployment will stabilise next year,
albeit at a frighteningly high level. Even the most pessimistic private
sector economists expect to see some growth for French gross domestic
product in 1994. Corporate profits should also improve. James Capel in Paris
anticipates a 40 per cent increase in CAC-40 earnings for 1994 (fuelled
mainly by the financial sector) after a 14.8 per cent fall in 1993.
Corporate activity is already picking up. The government's privatisation
drive has triggered a flurry of negotiations over cross-shareholdings and
strategic stakes as companies volunteer to be noyaux durs, or 'hard core'
shareholders, in the privatisation candidates. The government was spoilt for
choice in selecting noyaux durs for Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the
first privatisation issue. It is now lining up candidates for future sales.
Privatisation has also heralded a series of 'parallel' deals. Renault has
finally completed its long-awaited merger with Sweden's Volvo. Union des
Assurances de Paris speeded up talks with the Suez holding company to
finalise its deal over control of Colonia, the German insurer, before its
privatisation gets under way.
Meanwhile Lafarge Coppee and Generale des Eaux have joined the queue of
private sector companies raising capital from the Paris markets, so that
they can take advantage of any strategic opportunities that arise while the
franc is still strong and the stock market is buoyant.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (4): Phlegmatic reaction to
assassination - Stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLOMBO stock market watchers were expecting the worst in the aftermath of
the assassination of President Premadasa in May this year. There was talk of
a political and economic crisis: analysts were readying themselves for a
plunge in share prices.
But the crisis did not occur. The stock exchange reaction to events was
remarkably phlegmatic. By June, the market was in a bullish mood. New issues
were well received. In the June-September period this year, the market rose
by more than 20 per cent.
'The fact that the market did not overreact to the assassination shows its
resilience and maturity,' says Mr L. S. Jayawardena, chairman of the Sri
Lanka Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 'The Sri Lanka market might
be relatively small, but in the space of just a few years it has become a
sophisticated market in which foreigners are showing increasing interest.'
Mr Jayawardena was appointed to the SEC in 1987. Total market turnover at
the time was less than SLRs200m (Dollars 4m). By 1990, total turnover had
shot up to SLRs1.56bn and last year turnover reached SLRs 5bn. This year, it
is likely to be more than triple that amount.
Mr Jayawardena says the main stimulus to market growth came in June 1990
when the government made the first moves to ease rules on exchange dealings
by foreigners. Before that time a 100 per cent transfer tax was levied on
share transactions by foreigners.
'The relaxation of the rules on foreign participation in the market was a
major decision in an inward-looking country like ours,' says Mr Jayawardena.
'As foreign money came in, so locals felt greater confidence and started to
buy shares.'
Mr Premal De Mel, a researcher with the Colombo firm MacKinnon and Keels
Financial Services, estimates that about 60 per cent of trading on the
market is now foreign-based. 'This is still a small market and the weight of
foreign funds coming in can make a big difference,' says Mr De Mel.
Both foreign and local investors were encouraged by the government's new
industrial strategy of the late 1980s which emphasised that the private
sector must play a lead role in promoting the country's economic growth.
The government's privatisation or 'peoplisation' programme got under way in
1989 with the public share issue of United Motors Lanka. That issue was
poorly received in a market still unschooled in the ways of the stock
exchange.
But by early 1991, when state-owned Ceylon Oxygen came to the market, the
share climate had changed. The issue was oversubscribed more than five
times.
New listings have increased from one in 1990 to 12 last year and a possible
13 this year. At present 196 companies are listed on the Colombo exchange.
An SEC-sponsored public education programme telling people about the stock
market helped to broaden share ownership. By the end of last year the SEC
estimated that the number of shareholders in the market had increased to
40,000 - from only 10,000 in 1990. In addition, 20,000 shareholders had been
created through the peoplisation programme under which employees were given
10 per cent of shares in the privatised state-owned enterprises.
But it has not been all plain sailing for the exchange. Market overheating
in 1991 was followed by a prolonged downturn through 1992. As a result,
market capitalisation dropped from SLRs81bn to SLRs66bn in the year.
Although foreign interest in the market remained, local investors tended to
shy away from new public share offers, choosing instead to take advantage of
high bank deposit rates and Treasury bills which offered attractive 18 per
cent yields.
The privatisation of one of the bigger state banks, the National Development
Bank of Sri Lanka (NDB), in February this year helped turn the market. The
NDB issue, backed strongly by foreign investors, was oversubscribed nearly
four times. The subsequent entry into the market of two state-controlled
hotel groups further buoyed investor confidence.
The main constraint on market growth now is liquidity. Despite high interest
rates and the attraction of raising funds on the stock market, many of Sri
Lanka's biggest companies still choose to remain private, mostly
family-controlled businesses. Many are reluctant to put themselves in a
position where they have to make financial disclosures.
The Colombo stock exchange has come a long way in a very short time and is
one of the region's most technically sophisticated.
When he took on the job of SEC chairman one of the first moves Mr
Jayawardena made was to set about introducing a computer-based central
depository system. With funding and technical assistance from USAID, the
scripless system came into being in late 1991.
'We realise we are small, but we are one of the most technically advanced
exchanges in the region,' says Mr Jayawardena. 'Given continuing healthy
economic growth and providing more companies discover the advantages of
going public, there's no reason we won't expand rapidly in the years ahead.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (2): Separatist war is still critical
factor - The economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SRI LANKA'S ambition, as stated by President D. B. Wijetunga, is to move
into the league of newly-industrialised countries by the year 2000.
Economic growth in recent years has been moving ahead at a respectable pace.
Sri Lanka's GDP grew by 6.2 per cent in 1990, 4.6 per cent in 1991, 4.3 per
cent last year and, according to central bank officials, is likely to expand
a further 5.7 per cent in 1993.
There is an air of economic confidence about. The shop shelves are full;
Colombo's roads are becoming clogged with imported cars. Officials talk of
economic lift-off.
'We are pushing forward to achieve our NIC goal,' says Mr Ranil
Wickremesinghe, prime minister since May. 'We want to move from a lower
income to a middle income country.'
But while short-term prospects remain bright, there are many who question
the realism of the government's long-term objectives. The continuing war in
the north and east of the country looms like a dark cloud over the economic
future.
On the plus side, there has been a vast improvement in economic performance
in the past few years. Through much of the 1980s, the government had to
fight not only a war against Tamil separatists in the north and east but
also a Maoist-style insurgency in the south. The economy stagnated.
Investment declined. The tourists stayed away.
That has all changed. Industrial output, mostly based on textiles and
garments, has expanded rapidly. In 1992, the value of industrial exports
surged by more than 40 per cent, with the textiles sector accounting for
nearly 50 per cent of total export earnings.
In the first half of 1993, industrial exports rose more than 30 per cent.
Agriculture, which accounts for about 25 per cent of export earnings,
suffered due to a prolonged drought last year and output declined by 1.5 per
cent. But figures this year are far healthier, with a nearly 40 per cent
rise in the output of tea, Sri Lanka's main crop, and a 22 per cent rise in
rubber output in the first six months.
Direct foreign investment last year nearly doubled to Dollars 120m. More
than Dollars 400m of foreign investments are now in the pipeline. In
addition, nearly Dollars 30m of portfolio investment came into the local
stock market, attracted by the government's economic liberalisation policies
and the partial privatisation of several state entities.
Tourist arrivals were up 24 per cent last year and will get close to the
record figure of 407,000, set in 1982, the year before the main outbreak of
ethnic troubles on the island.
Meanwhile, average per capita incomes have risen from Dollars 214 in 1976 to
Dollars 553 a year last year. According to official figures, unemployment -
one of the problem areas in the economy - has dropped from about 24 per cent
10 years ago to 14 per cent.
The government's overall financial policy has also met with some success.
The budget deficit was reduced to 7.4 per cent of GDP in 1992, compared to
11.6 per cent of GDP in the previous year. In 1992, for the third year
running, there was an overall balance of payments surplus, helped by an
inflow, now running at Dollars 400m per year, of remittances from Sri
Lankans working abroad.
A few years ago, Sri Lanka had zero foreign exchange reserves and foreign
exchange controls led to a thriving black market in the rupee. Now most
exchange controls have gone, the rupee is free floating and, according to
official figures, foreign reserves have risen to Dollars 1.7bn, enough to
cover up to six months' imports.
But there is still a lengthy list on the minus side of the economic table.
There seems little hope of any further reduction in the budget deficit, at
least in the short term. Government spending went up by nearly 40 per cent
in the first five months of 1993, in part due to substantial increases in
the cost of fighting the war.
The jump in spending is also a byproduct of the continuing fight against
inflation, described by President Wijetunga as 'the great monster of our
times'. The central bank says inflation was 11.4 per cent last year. The
overall inflation rate is now estimated to be between 12 and 15 per cent.
Treasury officials admit that efforts to stem inflation have so far failed.
High interest rates of more than 20 per cent, designed to counteract
inflation, have attracted large amounts of funds into the country. Portfolio
investments from abroad have added to the inflationary pressures. The
central bank has had to spend large amounts mopping up excess liquidity in
the system. The broad money supply has increased by about 20 per cent so far
this year.
To bridge its budget deficit, Sri Lanka is still largely dependent on
considerable amounts of foreign grants and aid, which totalled more than
Dollars 800m in 1992.
While exports have been growing fast, they have been outpaced by import
growth. The value of imports rose 24 per cent in the first five months of
this year and the trade deficit widened to Dollars 673m.
Some of these economic difficulties might be seen as only short-term
structural deficiencies, to be tackled over a period of time. The more
difficult question, given Sri Lanka's NIC aspirations, is how does the
country achieve the next stage of development.
To ensure onward development, investments need to be made in more value
added industries. But such long-term and capital-intensive investments are
not being made. Sri Lanka's economic position is still fragile: upward
pressures on wages could lead to its textiles industry decamping to lower
cost countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
Above all else, the war remains the critical factor. It soaks up increasing
amounts of precious government funds. Multi-million-dollar long-term
investments in power plants, fertiliser factories and in textile mills are
unlikely to be forthcoming given the present security problems.
The government places high hopes in the tourism industry. But a target of
doubled tourist arrivals to more than 800,000 by the end of the decade seems
unrealistic in the present circumstances, with some of the country's best
tourist facilities on the east coast of the island virtually out of bounds
due to the war.
Sri Lanka has made impressive short-term economic gains. In the long term,
an end to the war and continuing political stability are the keys to whether
or not the country will achieve its NIC goal.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (4): Consolidating
operations - Insurers aim to exploit two new areas, pensions and health
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLINCHING a deal is almost always important to any self-respecting company
chairman, but Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris
(UAP) was particularly relieved to conclude his company's recent agreement
with Suez, the French holding company.
Mr Peyrelevade had for more than four years been trying to persuade Suez to
cede its controlling interest in Colonia, the second largest German insurer,
to UAP. This autumn he became even more anxious to reach an agreement before
UAP's forthcoming privatisation in the face of fierce speculation about his
own possible move to become chairman of Credit Lyonnais.
The main obstacle to UAP's ambitions was Gerard Worms, his opposite number
at Suez who had worked for Mr Peyrelevade in the mid-1980s when the latter
was chairman of Suez. Whenever UAP and Suez had come close to agreeing a
deal in their four years of talks, Mr Worms had hung out for more cash. But
Suez has in the past year come under intense financial pressure and Mr
Peyrelevade seized his chance.
UAP now owns a controlling stake in Colonia and as a result has leapt up the
insurance industry league table to become the second largest insurer in
Europe after Germany's powerful Allianz group. Mr Peyrelevade has made no
secret of the fact that UAP's next objective will be to oust Allianz from
the top slot.
The triumph of the Colonia deal marked a turning point, not only for UAP,
but for the rest of the FFr672bn French insurance industry.
France's insurers had a tough time in the early 1990s. The Big Four
insurance companies - UAP, Axa, Assurances Generales de Paris (AGF) and
Groupe GAN - all suffered falls in profits last year because of the parallel
problems of the depressed insurance market and the effect of the recession
on their property portfolios.
Yet the industry is now edging towards recovery. The worst affected area of
the insurance market, the damage sector, is showing signs of improvement.
The life business is in a position to benefit from the expansion of two new
product areas - private pensions and health policies.
Meanwhile the three state-controlled insurers - UAP, AGF and GAN - are all
preparing for sale to the private sector as part of the Balladur
government's privatisation programme.
The condition of the French insurance industry differs widely from sector to
sector. Demand for life insurance has continued to grow throughout the
recession as the nervous French have put their spare cash into long term
savings schemes.
At the same time the expansion of the mutuels, the specialist financial
services companies that grew rapidly in the 1980s, has been checked.
'The life insurance market is still buoyant,' said Michel Albert, chairman
of AGF. 'But the banks have taken most of the growth, rather than the
traditional insurers, and profitability is depressed because of the level of
competition and reductions in interest rates.'
These pressures seem likely to intensify for the foreseeable future, but the
insurers do hope to exploit two new growth areas - private pensions,
following the forthcoming reform of the state pension system, and private
health insurance, as the government progressively reduces its contribution
to the cost of medical care.
Meanwhile the damage insurance market, which was hammered by the recession,
is now improving. The insurers have sustained heavy losses in this sector,
partly because of escalating commercial claims and partly because of a steep
increase in car thefts.
Until recently these difficulties were aggravated by the insurers'
reluctance to risk losing business by raising premiums. However premiums
have since risen thereby lessening the pressure on profitability.
'Most companies, including GAN, have been raising premiums,' said Francois
Heilbronner, chairman of GAN. 'The industry as a whole still isn't
technically profitable in damage insurance, but most companies should break
even next year.'
However, the insurers face a long wait before they can hope to augment the
profits from their insurance interests with the proceeds of property
disposals as they did in the late 1980s.
Many companies last year had to make hefty provisions on their losses in the
property market (generally sustained by banking subsidiaries). The property
market has since stabilised, and signs of recovery are beginning to appear
in the residential sector, but there is still little scope for lucrative
property deals.
As a result the big French insurers see the mid-1990s as a period of
consolidation. The emphasis of their domestic operations is to improve
productivity by cutting costs. Some companies, notably AGF, have invested
heavily in staff training and information technology to streamline their
distribution networks. Others, such as Axa, have experimented with new
techniques, such as direct marketing, which could eventually create a
cheaper distribution system.
The French insurers are also consolidating their international operations.
Mr Peyrelevade has said that the Colonia deal will be UAP's last big
acquisition for some time, although the group is continuing talks to try to
expand its UK business.
Similarly AGF, having succeeded in acquiring a 33.5 per cent stake in
Germany's AMB, envisages a more cautious approach to expansion. Mr Albert
said it was time for the group to 'consolidate our international operations
by improving their profitability'. He also said he hoped that privatisation
would provide an opportunity to cement AGF's new network by enabling its new
partners to buy its shares as noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors.
Moreover Mr Albert is convinced that the network of strategic stakes and
cross-shareholdings amassed by AGF and UAP will be the blueprint for
European insurers in the 1990s.
'The AGF of the future will look like a federation, rather than an empire,'
he said. 'There are synergies to be found in information technology,
reinsurance and risk control. But the European insurance markets are too
different to create huge, centralised groups.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (3): The clouds
begin to lift - The banking industry is looking forward to a year of
recovery in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW that the dust has settled after the successful privatisation of Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), the talking point in French banking circles has
moved back to that old favourite, Credit Lyonnais, and to how much longer
Jean-Yves Haberer can cling on to the chairmanship.
Mr Haberer has already hinted that he is on his way out. He recently
confirmed that he was considering the offer of another public sector post
which is rumoured to be the chairmanship of Credit National.
The favourite candidate to succeed him at Credit Lyonnais is Jean
Peyrelevade, now head of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest
French insurance group.
The choice of Mr Peyrelevade looks suspiciously like a calculated piece of
political spite on the part of the centre-right Balladur government. Mr
Peyrelevade was a socialist appointee, but he is far too influential in
French financial circles for the government to fire him.
The chairmanship of one of France's biggest and most glamorous banks is too
prestigious a position to be refused, but it also involves the unenviable
task of tackling Credit Lyonnais' financial problems and hauling the bank
back into the black.
Luckily for Mr Peyrelevade, or for whoever else takes the helm, the worst
may well be over for Credit Lyonnais and its fellow French banks. The French
banking industry has had a tough two years due to the painful combination of
a sluggish credit market and the need to make hefty provisions on falling
property values and sour corporate loans.
The clouds are now lifting. The French economy is still in recession, the
credit market has yet to respond to the recent reductions in interest rates
and the corporate sector remains under intense pressure. But the situation
has stabilised and recovery is now in sight.
'I feel that we're at the bottom of the economic cycle,' said Michel
Pebereau, chairman of BNP. 'Our small corporate clients are less pessimistic
and there has been a slight improvement in the residential property market.
The economy ought to recover progressively from early next year.'
The revival of the banking sector is likely to lag a little behind the rest
of the economy. One catalyst for its recovery will be an upturn in demand
for credit, which should start to improve against the backdrop of the
Balladur government's steady reductions in interest rates. However the
trauma of the recession, the first in France since the mid-1970s oil shocks,
is likely to make companies cautious about borrowing money.
Consumers are in a similar state and are likely to remain nervous for as
long as the toll of job losses continues to rise.
'It will take time for confidence to recover both in the corporate sector
and among consumers,' said Sheila Garrard, European banking analyst at
Lehman Brothers in London. 'There is usually a time lag between the end of a
recession and a banking recovery. But this recession seemed to hit the
French banks very fast, so they may well recover quickly.'
The speed of the banks' recovery could be checked by the constant threat of
fresh competition from the French post office and other financial services
groups, notably the insurers. Conversely the banks should soon benefit from
the impact of the productivity progammes implemented in the early 1990s,
when they shed staff and invested in new technology.
However the main trigger for the banks' revival will be a reduction in the
high level of provisions they have had to make in recent years. Almost all
the banks faced heavy writedowns in 1992 because of the downturn in the
commercial property market and the steep increase in business failures among
smaller corporate clients.
Credit Lyonnais, which went into the red last year, has also been burdened
by its exposure to a string of corporate catastrophes such as the Maxwell
media empire and MGM, the stricken Hollywood film studio.
The property market has stabilised this year. But the rate of business
failures is still frighteningly high. Some banks, including BNP and Paribas,
have also faced writedowns on sovereign loans, although the provisioning
problem was mitigated in the first half because of the banks' windfall
trading profits on currency and equities.
Ms Garrard of Lehman Brothers expects the level of provisions to stabilise
next year and to return to 'a more normal level' next year. 'Investors have
already written off 1993 for the French banks and, according to recent
chairmen's statements, we can expect more of the same in 1994,' she said.
'But everyone expects 1995 to be a year of recovery.'
Meanwhile the banks are adopting a restrained approach on the strategic
front. Even Credit Lyonnais, which pursued an aggressive policy of lending
and international expansion under Mr Haberer in the late 1980s, sees the
mid-1990s as a period for consolidation.
The new chairman's top priorities will be to stabilise the group and repair
its balance sheet so that it is in a suitable state for privatisation.
Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, has made it clear that, although
he might expand the group's industrial banking activities, he favours
caution on the international front.
Paribas is still licking its wounds by cutting costs and slowly pruning out
peripheral interests after the trauma of its first-ever loss in 1991.
Meanwhile Mr Pebereau sees his strategy at BNP as evolutionary, rather than
revolutionary. His international plans centre on developing BNP's
partnership with Dresdner Bank of Germany. After BNP's privatisation the two
banks have been awaiting the European Commission's approval before
finalising the terms of their proposed share swap.
They may then, according to Mr Pebereau, consider linking up with other
European banks, albeit on a commercial basis, not through equity exchanges.
'We just couldn't go out and buy a bank in each country within the European
Community, it would be too costly and complicated,' he said. 'The Dresdner
agreement enables us to expand within Europe without getting involved with
dangerous and expensive investments.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (1): Progress is hampered by conflict -
Sri Lanka's gross domestic product grew by 4.3 per cent in 1992 and exports
climbed by more than 20 per cent. There is optimism in Colombo, but the war
against Tamil separatists is a big obstacle to long-term economic progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ON the morning of May 1 1993, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, Sri Lanka's
president, was on his way to a political rally. A populist given to
flamboyant gestures, Mr Premadasa jumped out of his car at a busy junction
and started directing traffic.
A man pushing a bicycle walked towards the president. A bomb tied to the
man's waist blew the president to bits. More than 20 other people were also
killed in the blast.
A few days earlier, Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, a popular opposition leader
and former defence minister had been shot dead.
The government blamed both murders on Tamil separatists fighting for
statehood in the north and east of the country.
The prophets of doom forecast that another round of bloodshed was about to
sweep the country. There were fears that after five years of autocratic
Premadasa rule, there would be political instability and the economy would
nosedive.
In the event, a power transition was effected with the minimum of
disruption. Mr D. B. Wijetunga, the mild-mannered former prime minister,
moved up to the presidential position. Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, the
44-year-old industries minister, became prime minister.
The economy proved resilient to events. Despite continuing violence and the
worst drought to hit Sri Lanka in 50 years, gross domestic product grew by
4.3 per cent in 1992 and officials say GDP growth this year is likely to be
5.7 per cent.
Exports climbed by more than 20 per cent in 1992 and seem set to expand by a
similar amount this year. Moves towards a more open, free market economy are
continuing. There is plenty of optimism about. 'It is our goal to achieve
newly industrialised country (NIC) status as we enter the 21st century,'
says President Wijetunga.
But violence and the war against Tamil separatists remain the biggest
obstacle in the way of Sri Lanka's long-term economic progress. Fighting
between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels has not only cost
thousands of lives. The war has also cut off almost a third of the country
from normal economic and social activity.
The war costs the equivalent of between 3 and 4 per cent of GDP each year,
with security eating up 15 per cent of precious budget funds.
Former President Premadasa tried and failed to negotiate with the Tamil
Tigers, the main rebel group. President Wijetunga shows signs of taking a
harder line.
But the government has learned that it is very difficult to defeat a
disciplined guerrilla force whose tactics include suicide bombings. Any
full-scale military offensive against the rebels in the north could provoke
mayhem in other parts of the island.
While the war continues, Sri Lanka is unlikely to attract the sort of
long-term capital-intensive investment it so urgently needs in order to
achieve NIC status and follow in the footsteps of dynamic economies such as
those of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
The country needs mills to feed its textile industry. If industrial
expansion is to continue, new power plants should be coming on stream. But
in the present circumstances investors, both local and foreign, seem
unwilling to commit large-scale funds to Sri Lanka on a long-term basis.
It is a credit to the government that despite the war in the north and a
Maoist-style insurgency in the late 1980s, which caused havoc in the south
of the country, considerable progress has been achieved on many fronts.
Sri Lanka has been praised by aid organisations for its poverty eradication
programmes. Standards of literacy and health are well in advance of any
other country in the south Asia region.
Over the past five years Sri Lanka's economic structure has undergone
fundamental change. Agriculture, once the mainstay of the economy, has
declined in importance with tea and other traditional crops accounting for
less than 24 per cent of the total value of exports last year. Meanwhile,
industrial exports, mainly textiles and garments, grew by 41 per cent last
year and now account for more than 65 per cent of total export values.
In the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has been a pioneer in introducing
market-based reforms. Exchange controls have been progressively lifted.
Tariffs have been reduced. A number of state enterprises have been
privatised.
'The results of these policies are clearly evident,' says President
Wijetunga. 'We have more than doubled our rate of economic growth. Our
average per capita income has risen from SLRs1,902 in 1976 to SLRs24,234 in
1992 (Dollars 214 and Dollars 553 at prevailing exchange rates) despite
having 3.7m more mouths to feed.
'We have made a dent in unemployment, which has declined from about 24 per
cent to around 14 per cent. . . there is hope in the air and the
international community has developed confidence in our land and its
policies.'
But not all government policies have worked. Inflation, now running at
between 12 and 15 per cent according to central bank officials, remains an
intractable problem. The government has made large cutbacks in spending in
some sectors and a tough budget is forecast in early November.
But spending on security is rising rapidly and while considerable progress
has been made in cutting the budget deficit, which now amounts to 7.4 per
cent of GDP, Sri Lanka remains dependent on foreign funding to meet its
spending needs. Sri Lanka received Dollars 840m in aid last year; a far
higher amount, on a per capita basis, than other countries in the region.
Foreign direct investment in 1992 nearly doubled to Dollars 120m and further
strong investment growth has been evident this year. But most of this
investment is relatively short term. A large proportion of inward investment
has gone into textiles: some argue that the country is now overly dependent
on one industrial sector.
A lot of investment has come from the east, particularly from South Korea
and Taiwan. Sri Lanka needs to build an industrial base but many companies
use the island only as an assembly point for garments, taking advantage of
cheap labour and the country's quotas. Most cloth for the textiles factories
is imported. Owners of the few textile mills operating in Sri Lanka allege
that the South Koreans and others are dumping cloth on the island and
threatening the survival of their mills.
Although significant progress has been made in fiscal reforms and moves
towards a more open economy, the process has been slow. The IMF is concerned
about recent public sector pay rises and excessive credit growth,
particularly in the plantations sector. Last year, Mr Wijetunga, then prime
minister, admitted that the two big state banks, which control more 65 per
cent of the banking industry, had accumulated a total of SLRs18bn in bad
loans and were technically insolvent.
Privatisation - termed 'peoplisation' by the government - has so far
excluded many of the big state enterprises such as the two biggest banks,
the telecommunications company and Air Lanka, the national carrier.
Sri Lanka is arguably a more democratic country than its economically
thriving neighbours to the east. 'We are the opposite of Singapore or South
Korea,' says Mr Wickremesinghe. 'Democracies have to carry people along; a
government has to explain. We are a politically mature country.'
But an active democracy often leads to tough economic decisions being put
off for political reasons. Government officials acknowledge they have to
tread very carefully with privatisation so as not to offend powerful unions.
The present Wijetunga government is regarded as less tough in many areas
than the Premadasa regime. More political trade-offs are likely,
particularly in the run-up to presidential elections due to be held before
the end of 1994.
For the moment, the United National Party, in power since 1977, seems secure
in office, with the main opposition party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party
(SLFP) led by Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, a former prime minister, divided by
bitter quarrels.
The government still has a very tough job. Sri Lanka's well-educated people
have high aspirations. In the late 1980s, former President Premadasa
ruthlessly quashed a left-wing insurgency in the south. Remnants of that
movement, resentful at the lack of economic opportunities available, still
exist.
But above all, it is a settlement of the fighting in the north and east
which holds the key to Sri Lanka's future. In Colombo, the war often feels
remote. But as long as the fighting continues, it will be difficult for Sri
Lanka to climb the economic ladder and capitalise on its impressive advances
of recent years.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (1): Strains start
to ease - Recession persists and the remnants of market protectionism and
government controls are still in evidence. However, the Balladur
administration's recently launched privatisation programme could, if it is
successful, propel the sector into a new era of modernisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, this month announced
that more than 2.8m private investors had applied for shares in Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), he knew that the first phase of the French
government's privatisation programme had been a success.
The success of the privatisations is critical not only to the credibility of
Mr Alphandery and the rest of the Balladur administration, but to the future
of the French financial system.
The last privatisation drive, launched in the mid-1980s when Edouard
Balladur was economy minister, marked the start of the modernisation of
France's financial sector by loosening its old links with the state and
heralding a new wave of market deregulation.
International investment has since flooded into France. Many of the leading
players in French finance have expanded their activities into other
countries. Yet the path towards modernisation has been impeded by lingering
anachronisms from the old era of market protectionism and government
controls. Although the humiliating spectacle of the Balladur government's
climbdown in the Air France dispute has raised serious doubts among
international investors about the strength of its commitment to liberalising
industrial policy, in theory the new privatisation programme should be the
catalyst for completing the process that Mr Balladur began.
Despite the Air France debacle, the Balladur privatisations, which could
include the sales of the Credit Lyonnais banking group and three insurance
groups, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurances Generales de France
(AGF) and Groupe GAN, as well as that of BNP, could scarcely have been
better timed.
The French economy is still in recession, but seems to have stabilised.
Although no sign of industrial investment responding to lower interest rates
has yet emerged and consumer confidence is depressed by the continuing rise
in unemployment, the consensus among economists is that France will return
to growth next year.
'There is no evidence yet of a general economic recovery,' said Michel
Albert, chairman of AGF. 'We're still in a state of stagnation, but there
are some positive signs.'
It was this promise of recovery that secured the success of the BNP issue.
BNP, like the other leading French banks, has had a hard time over the past
two years. The credit market has been static for the first time since the
second world war and the banks have been forced to make hefty provisions
because of the rise in business failures and the collapse of the commercial
property market.
All the French banks have suffered but by far the most vulnerable has been
Credit Lyonnais, which last year crashed into the red because of its
exposure to a string of corporate horror stories, from the late Robert
Maxwell media empire to MGM, the troubled Hollywood movie studio.
The banks are still under strain, but most analysts suspect the worst is
over - even for Credit Lyonnais. Trading is now more stable, as is the
property market and, although the banks may have to make more provisions on
small corporate loans, they do at least have breathing space to tackle
internal issues such as cost cutting and productivity improvements.
'Our performance at the moment is still influenced by the economic
situation,' said Michel Pebereau, chairman of BNP. 'The economy will
eventually recover and in the meantime we must concentrate on becoming more
efficient and on controlling costs.'
The insurance industry is in a similar predicament, albeit for different
reasons. The main difficulties for the French insurers were intense
competition from the banks and specialist mutuels groups in the buoyant life
insurance business and a steep increase in claims in the less resilient
damage sector. They have also been affected by falling commercial property
prices, which meant they could no longer compensate for their trading
problems with lucrative real estate deals.
Those pressures are now easing. Commercial property is still in the doldrums
but the insurers, like the banks, are starting to benefit from recent cost
cutting and technology initiatives. Life insurance remains competitive, but
the growth of the mutuels seems to have peaked and the market has continued
to grow in spite of the recession. Signs of improvement are also appearing
in the damage sector, where companies have countered the rise in claims by
increasing premiums. Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, expects the
industry next year to come out of the red in damage insurance.
As a result UAP, AGF, GAN and eventually Credit Lyonnais should be able to
present investors with convincing recovery stories when their privatisations
get under way. They should also benefit, as did BNP, from the high level of
interest in French equities on the part of international investors. The
Balladur privatisations have come at a time when US and Japanese investors
are keen to take advantage of their strong currencies and the US mutual
funds are in the process of internationalising their portfolios.
The level of interest among the French public is also high, as illustrated
by the BNP issue. Mr Balladur plans to use the privatisation drive to boost
share ownership in France. Last summer's ingenious 'Balladur bond' and the
decision to price BNP's shares so cheaply are just two of the tactics he has
employed. Further, as interest rates fall, equities should seem even more
attractive to the public against the dwindling returns on bonds and cash
savings schemes.
The companies themselves all appear to welcome the prospect of
privatisation. 'Privatisation won't be a revolutionary process for us,' said
Mr Albert of AGF. 'Don't forget we were a private company for many years
before we were nationalised in 1946. We've also been preparing to be
re-privatised since 1986 and if it had not been for the 1987 stockmarket
crash we'd have been sold off six years ago. We've already changed the
culture of the company by making sure that all our employees realise that
profitability is our goal.'
Yet privatisation will herald some changes. The most obvious differences
will be that the government will no longer be able to hire - and fire -
senior executives, and that the companies themselves should have more
flexibility to raise capital by issuing new shares. The banks may also have
more freedom to determine their own policies on interest rates and
investment.
Moreover, the entire financial system should benefit from the impact of
privatisation on the Paris stockmarket. One of the market's main problems
has been a lack of liquidity, caused by a shortage of equity and investment.
Privatisation will provide an instant, if partial solution by releasing up
to FFr45bn (Pounds 5.24bn) of new shares on to the Paris market this year
and at least FFr55bn next year. It should also help to address the
investment issue by bringing new capital from international institutions and
the French public into equities.
The next landmark for the French financial sector after privatisation will
be pension reform, which will not only provide a profitable source of new
business for the banks and insurers but should also include the creation of
private pension funds.
Pension reform is still at a preliminary stage. Mr Balladur only recently
asked Mr Alphandery to create a working party to examine the options for the
future. It will be years before the French pension funds can achieve the
size and stature of the established funds in the US and the UK.
Yet the formation of fledgling pension funds is at least a step in the right
direction. In the long term, the growth of such institutions should ensure
that the Paris markets have the support of the type of powerful independent
investors that already underpin the markets in London and New York thereby
helping to complete the modernisation of the French financial system.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (2): Changing
economic tune - A more dynamic strategy is needed to set the country on its
feet again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Edouard Balladur this spring moved into his opulent new offices at the
Hotel de Matignon, the French prime minister's residence, one word cropped
up again and again in his speeches - austerity.
Austerity, said Mr Balladur, was the only way that the government could
regain control of the French economy and haul it out of recession. He has
since changed his tune. Mr Balladur now accepts that he has to adopt a more
dynamic strategy if he is to succeed in revitalising the economy - and
stemming the rising tide of unemployment - before his centre-right coalition
comes up for re-election in spring 1995.
The Balladur government has since unveiled a series of reflationary measures
 -a public works programme, income tax cuts and employment reform - in a
desperate attempt to end the recession. The critical question, with little
more than a year to go before the 1995 elections, is whether his efforts
will be enough.
Mr Balladur has a tough task on his hands. France took far longer to slip
into recession than most of its competitors. The economy continued to grow,
albeit at a slackening pace, until the final quarter of last year. It has
since stayed stubbornly in recession - squeezed by high real interest rates
and a strong currency - with a hefty budget deficit and escalating
unemployment.
Interest rates have fallen steadily since the centre-right took power in
late March. The franc has also weakened after the ERM crisis in early August
when France, like its fellow European Community member states, was forced to
widen its ERM trading bands from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent.
Yet so far there has been little improvement in France's economic
performance. The problems of its trading partners, notably Germany, have
undermined corporate confidence. The industrial output index stabilised over
the summer, having fallen by an average of 1.9 per cent in the first quarter
and 0.3 per cent in the second. But a recent report by Societe Generale
described the 'apparent stability' as 'very fragile'.
Unemployment levelled this summer with the number of people out of work
rising in August by just 4,000 to 3.22m, or 11.7 per cent of the workforce,
compared with average monthly job losses of 30,000 during the spring. But
the rate of job losses is expected to accelerate in the autumn. OFCE, the
economic institute, expects the unemployment total to reach 3.4m, or 12.4
per cent of the workforce, by the end of the year.
As a result consumer confidence has remained weak with an inevitable effect
on expenditure. Consumer spending has also been depressed by the high rate
of real interest rates, whereby inflation is significantly lower than base
rates, in spite of the recent round of rate reductions, making it more
attractive for the French to save, rather than spend their money.
The personal savings ratio, which fell to an average of 10.9 per cent in the
boom year of 1987, rose to 12.8 per cent last year and now hovers well above
13 per cent, according to Societe Generale.
The Balladur government is trying to reverse the trend. Michel Giraud,
employment minister, this summer launched a series of reforms intended to
relax France's notoriously strict employment laws. These included making the
39-hour working week more flexible and waiving employers' social security
contributions for the first three new workers they hire.
Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister, this autumn joined the fray by including
in his 1994 budget plan FFr19bn of tax cuts, directed principally at the
middle classes, and fiscal reforms aimed at shifting French savings towards
housing and consumption.
Most economists, and even Mr Balladur's own back benchers, doubt that these
will be adequate. But the French government has little room for manoeuvre.
One important constraint is the budget deficit, which limits the scope for
public sector spending. Mr Sarkozy's official estimates suggest that the
deficit will reach FFr317bn this year. Private sector economists expect the
final tally to be higher.
Meanwhile the government's ability to reduce interest rates is inhibited by
the need to protect the franc. The French currency has remained relatively
robust since the ERM crisis, buoyed by the Bank of France's cautious rate
reductions. This policy seems set to continue given that the French
authorities are not only anxious about the risk of endangering the franc,
but are also keen for the central bank to rebuild its reserves after the ERM
crisis and to repay its debts to Germany's Bundesbank. It will be able to
accomplish both tasks more easily if the franc stays strong against the
D-Mark.
As a result France's economic prospects are pedestrian, at best. Mr Sarkozy
hopes to reduce the budget deficit to FFr300bn next year, thanks to FFr55bn
of privatisation proceeds and an anticipated increase in French exports
which, he expects, to fuel real growth in gross domestic product of 1.4 per
cent.
Other observers are less optimistic. Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French
economist at Salomon Brothers, suspects that the economic difficulties
elsewhere in Europe, notably in Germany, will impede France's export growth
and that domestic demand will remain depressed. He predicts significantly
slower growth in GDP of 0.5 percentage points for France in 1994 with a
deficit of FFr350bn to FFr360bn.
The OFCE agrees. It is braced for even lower GDP growth of 0.3 percentage
points next year with unemployment rising to 3.7m, or 13.6 per cent of the
workforce by the end of 1994. Jean-Paul Fitoussi, head of the OFCE,
described Mr Balladur's reflationary measures as steps in the right
direction. But he holds out little hope of seeing the French dole queues
shortening before the next elections.

FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames Water drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock Pounds 25m provision announced by Thames Water with its figures
yesterday was the signal for hefty profit-taking throughout the water
sector. Shares in Thames were inevitably the worst hit, closing 13 down at
561p in high turnover of 5.6m. Elsewhere, Severn Trent slipped 8 to 555p,
South West 10 to 602p, Southern 11 to 600p and Yorkshire 12 to 578p.
Yield considerations have sent the water sector soaring in the past two
months, the sector index jumping nearly 15 per cent since the beginning of
August.
Mr Bill Dale at SG Warburg said: 'The sector has risen so far so fast and
was vulnerable to a short-term setback, which the Thames provision duly
provided. However, we believe Thames remains a core holding in the sector
reflecting the strength of its efficient underlying business.'
The Thames provision, which was taken against two overseas contracts, also
reignited worries over diversification by water companies away from their
core business areas. These concerns added to impending regulatory anxieties
in the UK and led to some limited switching into the electricity stocks.
There was also further heavy business in the generators. Among the steepest
rises, Yorkshire advanced 8 to 641p, Eastern 7 to 614p and Manweb 8 to 658p.
Turnover in Scottish Power hit 8.4m as it added 3 at 416p.
Salomon Brothers chose a basket of Recs (regional electricity companies)
yesterday to launch a covered warrant in the equity market. The warrant
allows investors to buy an option - in this case at Pounds 1.50 - which they
can then exercise at any time over the next 49 weeks and buy the underlying
shares of the Recs at the price at the date of the warrant's purchase.
Yesterday the strike price was Pounds 26. The issue coincides with Salomon
reiterating its positive stance on the Recs.
The fall in the oil price hampered most stocks in the sector. BP lost 2 1/2
to 337p in moderate turnover. Enterprise Oil gave up 5 to 476p. Against this
trend was Shell, which firmed a penny to 709p, with one analyst pinning some
reason to good results by Exxon.
A variety of factors conspired to bruise a recently bouncy drugs sector.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' fell back 11 to 429p in volume of 2.4m as
confirmation came that Mylan Laboratories, of the US, had won approval to
market the generic form of SmithKline's Tagamet. US patents on Tagamet
expire in May. Some downgradings were expected on the back of the move.
Panmure Gordon added to the stock's problems by switching its position from
sell to hold, and saying that others in the sector appeared better value.
Glaxo, which fell 23 to 691p. was hit by Morgan Stanley moving from a hold
to a sell. Some drugs analysts feel that Glaxo has risen too high in the
recent pharmaceuticals rally and that past Pounds 7 the shares seem
overvalued.
Nervousness ahead of results - due tomorrow - again hounded Wellcome and it
gave up 22 to 812p.
In the slight backlash in the drugs sector, Cantab was said by one analyst
to have made a somewhat lacklustre debut on the market. It began trading at
465p, after being placed at 460p, rose to a high of 473p and trailed off to
close at 468p.
US support, particularly in the ADRs, was said to have lifted Cable and
Wireless, up 15 at 958p, and Vodafone, ahead 7 at 561p.
Among financials, yield buyers were seen early in the day for Lloyds Bank,
though having risen to 574p the shares followed the market down to end
unchanged at 568p.
Vague bid talk was once again heard in TSB, the shares edging forward a
half-penny to 220p. Abbey National eased 4 to 413p with the market, with
active dealing in the traded options reported.
SG Warburg was reported to be a buyer of Prudential Corp, up a penny at
371p.
Food manufacturing stocks witnessed a mixed session as the recent
directionless trading continued to defy broker recommendations. Ahead of the
impending results season, Kleinwort Benson was one house believing the
sector's recent underperformance overdone and advising clients to go
'overweight'.
Turnover in motors group BBA rose to 15.3m, making it one of the day's most
actively traded stocks, as the company continued to bask in the glow of
Monday's appointment of a former BTR director as its new chief executive.
BBA shares jumped 12 to 179p, with sentiment further boosted by a strong
recommendation from NatWest Securities.
BTR followed the poor market trend, ending 5 off at 369p after volume of
4.8m.
Rolls-Royce shed 2 1/2 to 153p after Panmure Gordon advised investors to
sell the stock. In its 46-page Engineering Quarterly review on the
engineering and aerospace sector, the broker said of Rolls-Royce: 'There is
no recovery in sight.'
Agency broker James Capel was said to have moved from a hold to a sell on
Allied-Lyons, which retreated 7 to 591p.

<TEXT>
The announcement that troubled defence electronics group Ferranti
International was in talks that might lead to a bid for it at one penny a
share saw the stock undergo a dramatic 73 per cent slump amid record
turnover.
Although the mid-afternoon news had long been mooted in the market, it
nevertheless took dealers by surprise and the group immediately dived 6 3/4
to 2 1/2 p, as volume soared to a hefty 38.9m.
The company did not disclose its likely bidder but many in the market
pointed the finger at defence electronics group GEC, with one market watcher
saying: 'GEC is the most obvious candidate for a rescue. There is no doubt
that a rescue is what it would be. We shall now wait to see what can be
salvaged from this sorry tale.'
There was also a feeling in some quarters that the UK government may be
playing a part in brokering an agreement between Ferranti and its suitor.
Other candidates mentioned included French defence electronics group Thomson
CSF. GEC shed a penny to 341p in trading of 4.9m.

ALL EYES will be on the performance of Lasmo today after confirmation came
late in trading yesterday that finance chief Mr Michael Pavia is to resign
at the end of this week.
Last week Lasmo repeatedly denied any imminent boardroom changes. The
departure has been widely tipped in the market, with speculation gathering
momentum over the past few days. One market watcher believes that more
boardroom moves could be on the way. 'It is an overweight board at the
moment,' he said, adding that the company is likely to pause a while for the
City to digest the consequences of Mr Pavia's leaving.
The finance chief's departure is by far the most important change that the
City was expecting. 'He has paid the price for Ultramar,' said one analyst.
Sentiment surrounding Lasmo plunged after its acquisition of rival oil
company Ultramar early last year.
Takeover interest in Lasmo, on which there has been steady speculation since
British Gas's unsuccessful attempt several years ago, may be heightened by
Mr Pavia's resignation. Potential bidders may see the departure as a
willingness on the part of Lasmo to take on new ideas. European companies,
as opposed to UK-based ones, are expected to show the most interest.
Upbeat oil analysts believe the shares will bounce today as Lasmo has
cleared the air of the persistent market rumours. 'It will mark a turning
point,' said one. Yesterday the shares held unchanged at 145p in moderate
turnover of 2.9m, although the announcement came in the last half-hour of
trading.
Others believe the market had already factored Mr Pavia's departure into the
share price, although they think there will be a short-term boost on the
news. 'We may see US buyers becoming excited.' US interests are thought to
account for over 20 per cent of Lasmo shares.
Early speculation on a successor to Mr Pavia again focused on Mr John
Walmsley, former finance director of Enterprise Oil who left the company
earlier this year.

FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Big US selling bruises equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMISING early performance by UK share prices, triggered largely by Wall
Street's move to a record closing high overnight, was dismantled from
mid-morning onwards by a very disappointing quarterly survey published by
the Confederation of British Industry and some bad news on the US economy.
The equity market, now showing distinct signs that its upsurge this month
could have run out of steam, came under heavy fire from some of the big and
influential US investment banks and stockbrokers. It was a sudden burst of
heavy buying interest from these same US sources that triggered the big
upward move in the UK stock market, during late August and in the middle of
this month.
One senior trader said: 'There was a big hit on the market this morning when
some of the Americans offered large chunks of the Footsie future, which
dropped sharply to a level where the arbitrageurs moved in. Rather ominously
no-one around the market was happy to take the offers, and the market tone
deteriorated from then on.' He added that he still felt comfortable with the
market but that he saw little upside for the next few days.
The FT-SE 100 Index began the session in good form, reflecting Wall Street's
move on Monday to an all-time peak, and showed a near nine-point gain during
the morning and before the news from the Confederation of British Industry
survey was published.
The CBI quarterly survey was every bit as gloomy as some market observers
had feared, saying that the economic recovery had slowed and calling for a
reduction in domestic interest rates in the November 30 Budget.
This news, coupled with a very disappointing index of US consumer confidence
this month, drove the FT-SE 100 down to the day's low point of 3,164.8, a
fall of exactly 20 points, before it stabilised to close a disappointing
session 19.5 down at 3,165.3.
Market strategists were also disturbed by the US consumer confidence index
performance, which at 59.4 per cent, was well below general expectations
that were in the region of 63 per cent.
A number of UK commentators expressed concern about the equity market's
recent performance. 'I would like to think the market peaked at Footsie
3,199,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon. The strategy team at
NatWest Securities, in their latest Equity Market Commentary, pointed to 'a
deluge of profits downgrades so far this month - five upgrades compared with
18 downgrades - an uninspiring results season and a couple of disappointing
inflation figures'. BZW said: 'After the FT-SE 100's surge towards the 3,200
mark, the simple price/earnings and yield valuations begin to make the eyes
water.'
And dealers also expressed minor disappointment with the volume of business
transacted so far this week. Turnover yesterday of 589.5m shares, although
well up from Monday's dismal 482.6m, was well below recent levels which have
held at well above 600m per day for the past two weeks. Customer business on
Monday was valued at Pounds 1.17bn, also the lowest figure for two weeks.
The telecoms sector, roughly handled last week as one of the leading UK
brokers adopted a more cautious stance, put on a good showing in the wake of
some determined US buying.

<TEXT>
LARGE-SCALE US selling of Footsie futures left the December contract
floundering with few friends in the market, writes Christine Buckley.
With sentiment knocked by the CBI survey on industrial trends, the
flickering hope of an early interest rate cut proved too weak to give much
support to the contract.
Having been recently driven upwards by the inflow of US money, American
selling cut off an important lifeline.
The downward drift began after the contract had mustered a climb from its
opening at 3,182 to its day's high of 3,218. Then, after publication of the
CBI's findings December was at the mercy of the strong selling.
Some institutions were buyers though in insufficient numbers to provide a
lift as the heavy US off-loading ran in tandem with intensive selling by
independent traders.
A poor opening on Wall Street consolidated gloomy sentiment in the market
although December traded ahead of its fair value premium for most of the
session. However, its closing level of 3,180 was just on a par with the fair
value premium to the cash market which stands at about 15 points.
Action was moderate in traded options and volume reached 30,053 lots with a
fairly even balance between index and stock options. The most dealt stock
option was British Gas at 2,224 lots with the FT-SE 100 option at 8,090.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to poor
consumer data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER profit-taking and news of weakening consumer confidence had depressed
US stocks in early trading, share prices recovered their losses to end the
day mostly flat, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 1.12 down at 3,672.49, well off
its low for the day of 3,654.05. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.10 up at
464.30, while the American SE composite was 1.94 off at 473.64 and the
Nasdaq composite lost 4.29 at 765.46. NYSE volume was 285m shares.
Although prices firmed at the opening, it was clear that market participants
were ready to take some quick profits after Monday's gains when the Dow rose
to an all-time high. Consequently an early 10-point climb for the Dow turned
into a 10-point loss within the first hour of trading.
Profit-taking was not confined to the big blue chip industrial and cyclical
shares which lifted the Dow into record territory on Monday; secondary
stocks posted their second straight day of declines.
Concern about the economy deepened yesterday after the Conference Board
announced that its index of consumer confidence had dropped in October to
59.4, down from a revised 63.8 for the previous month.
The news lifted bond prices for the first time in three days, but initially
depressed equity market sentiment, until a round of buying mid-afternoon
helped most stocks recover their early losses. Only secondary issues traded
on the Nasdaq market remained firmly rooted in negative territory.
IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 after the troubled computer giant
unveiled a third-quarter loss of 12 cents a share, smaller than analysts had
expected. Investors were not sure what to make of the data, with the stock
rising initially, then falling, only to recover strongly in late trading.
Leading Dow stocks which were in good form on Monday wilted on
profit-taking. Eastman Kodak receded Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 7/8 and
Aluminum Co of America Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 5/8 .
RJR Nabisco lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 but rallied to end unchanged
at Dollars 5 3/8 , after the tobacco and foods company unveiled
third-quarter net income sharply lower than a year ago because of the
cigarette price war.
Pharma Resources rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 16 7/8 in heavy trade after the
US Food and Drug Administration said it would review the company's
applications for generic drugs, a decision that opens the way for the
company to seek new product approvals.
National Health Laboratories dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 in
volume of 3.2m shares after the company issued a warning about lower
third-quarter revenues.
Canada
TORONTO rebounded from earlier sluggishness to close well ahead as the
market shed some of its post-election nervousness.
Traders said they expect the TSE 300 index, which gained 31.9 at 4,187.1
yesterday, to continue improving on the back of the strength of US shares in
recent days. An analyst commented that the gain 'reflected additional
confidence in the economy and a move to catch up with Dow Jones'.
Advances led declines by 366 to 327 after volume of 51.4m shares valued at
CDollars 625.9m.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): JR East flotation leaves
Nikkei with 1.4% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK PRICES lost ground as investors liquidated holdings to buy East Japan
Railway shares which were floated yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei average declined 285.73, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,023.60.
Traders said overall trading was slack as investors focused on JR East
shares, which were not traded until the end of the day because of a lack of
sellers. The Nikkei rose to the day's high of 20,344.53 in the morning, and
fell to 20,019.90 during the afternoon.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said share prices had declined as the rush
of buy orders for JR East had clogged up the computer at the Tokyo stock
exchange, making large programme buying of shares impossible. Meanwhile,
small-lot selling by dealers on the final trading day for October
settlements also depressed prices.
Volume was 333.9m shares, against 312m. Falls overwhelmed rises by 967 to
109, with 107 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 24.13 to 1,645.31, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.83 to
1,295.28.
Due to the lack of sellers, buyers raised their bids throughout the day for
JR East, which was publicly offered in August at Y380,000. The stock finally
traded at Y600,000 at the session's end.
However, in spite of previous hopes that trading in JR East would boost
overall activity, stock prices lost ground, led by a fall in large-capital
issues. Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day, fell Y14 to Y335 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y8 to Y683.
Traders still hope that investors who had bought JR East at Y380,000 will
put their profits back into the stock market. 'Profits held by individual
investors who bought the stock at Y380,000 are estimated to total Y300bn to
Y400bn,' said one Japanese broker.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which was sold by investors wanting to buy
JR East shares, retreated Y30,000 to Y843,000.
Kajima, the construction company, lost Y2 at Y859 after public prosecutors
arrested the company's vice-president for allegedly bribing politicians.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 239.38 to 21,982.02 in volume of 20.1m
shares. The index dropped below the 22,000 line for the first time since
July 28 on small-lot selling.
Roundup
MOVES in politically sensitive markets enlivened the region.
NEW ZEALAND, where an election is due to be held on Saturday week, saw a
23-cent rise to NZDollars 4.23 in market leader Fletcher Challenge, and a
new four-year high in the NZSE-40 index, which closed 14.9 stronger at
2,113.01.
The New Zealand government has a 6.7 per cent holding in Fletcher, which
recently announced moves to simplify its structure by shaving off forest and
rural servicing assets into separate companies. The 3.2m shares traded in
the stock accounted for a big slice of the market's NZDollars 37.5m
turnover.
KARACHI closed higher for the 12th consecutive session, the KSE index rising
20.73 to a 1993 peak of 1,522.17. The bullish trend reflects the victory of
Ms Benazir Bhutto's PPP (Pakistan People's Party) in the October 6
elections.
BOMBAY dropped as fears over a political crisis in the northern state of
Kashmir undermined sentiment. The BSE index closed 40.8 lower at 2,700.3. In
COLOMBO, however, foreign buying of Sri Lankan stocks took the all-share
index up 14.57 to 758.93.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index rose 58 points in morning trade as bargain
hunters snapped up shares, and then fell back on profit-taking before ending
23.40 ahead at 8,790.90. Brokers said smaller companies were the main focus
of trading, with China-linked shares holding up well. Turnover eased from
HKDollars 5.61bn to HKDollars 5.02bn.
AUSTRALIA rebounded from morning lows, bargain hunters lifting the All
Ordinaries index a net 8.8 to 2,055.7, after touching 2,039.9. Turnover was
ADollars 310.2m. Heavyweights put in most of the recovery, BHP rising 22
cents to ADollars 17.16 and CRA 14 cents to ADollars 15.50.
SEOUL saw healthy interest in electricity utility Kepco as the composite
index rose 5.49 to 747.97. Kepco climbed Won600 to Won20,800, but brokers
were cautious, saying that heavy institutional selling pressure was lurking
at the Won21,000 level.
MANILA's composite index advanced 12.35 to 2,243.55 in spite of an overnight
correction in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which dipped Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 61 1/2 on Wall Street.
TAIWAN, where plans to ease curbs on foreign investment in the stock market
were announced yesterday, fell on profit-taking, the weighted index slipping
8.92 to 4,091.17.
BANGKOK got the jitters in the morning following the dismissal of Mr Sawasdi
Amornvivat, the national police chief, but the SET index came back from a
low of 1,135.67, down 13.87, to finish 8.74 higher on balance at 1,158.28 in
moderate turnover of Bt8.21bn.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent loses ground in late
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES mostly opened higher on Wall Street's overnight gains and a higher
dollar, but German stocks were an exception and the rest lost ground later
in the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Monday's post bourse losses, the DAX index dropping 15.67
to 2,058.72 on the session and the Ibis-indicated Dax losing another 9.98 to
2,048.74 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM8.4bn to DM8.8bn.
National inflation figures were mixed and the bond market was a little
disappointed. Broadly-based profit-taking was seen in financials, where
falls of 1 per cent were commonplace and Bayernhypo dropped DM10.50 to
DM477. However, Deutsche Pfandbrief-und Hypothekenbank (DePfa) climbed DM21
to DM831 after the bank reported a 29 per cent profit rise in the first nine
months of this year.
Some of the second line cyclicals posted gains. In the automotive sector,
Continental and Varta, tyre and battery makers respectively, rose DM5 to
DM243 and DM8 to DM326, while Porsche put on another DM19 to DM794.
The apparent rationale for these upgrades, in a rising US dollar and
prospectively better profit margins, was not applied to front-line cyclicals
like BMW, which fell DM6.50 on the session to DM624.50, and Daimler, DM5.50
lower at DM749.50. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that
the gains lower down the size scale were dealer-inspired.
Trading in PARIS was suspended twice during the session because of technical
problems, following a similar difficulty on Monday. The CAC-40 index
finished down 17.36 or 0.8 per cent at 2,210.37.
Thomson-CSF lost FFr3.50 to FFr164.50 as some negative brokers' comments on
the stock surfaced. One of them, from James Capel, forecast that 1993
profits were expected to fall to their lowest level since 1984, and would
continue to remain under pressure in 1994 and 1995.
Outside the CAC-40, Synthelabo, which on Monday shed 7.4 per cent, eased a
further FFr6.60 to FFr221.50 following the withdrawal by the French
regulator of the licence for its anti-anxiety drug. Mr Mark Tracey at
Goldman Sachs commented that this action confirmed his view of the company's
weak product mix and saw the shares continuing to underperform the market.
L'Oreal, the parent group, shed FFr19 to FFr1,195.
ZURICH forgot about following Frankfurt, and rebounded in active trading on
the firm dollar and lower interest rates. While it closed off its peaks, as
both the dollar and Wall Street weakened, the SMI index rose 15.3 to
2,700.2.
Selected insurance and chemical stocks led the advance, with strong interest
also seen in dollar-sensitive shares such as Surveillance and Nestle. Among
chemicals, Sandoz bearers rose SFr60 to SFr3,780; in the insurance sector,
Winterthur rose SFr14 to SFr794 and Swiss Re by SFr40 to SFr3,940, although
Zurich Insurance fell SFr13 to SFr1,340.
AMSTERDAM lost pace towards the close as the dollar softened and the CBS
Tendency index slipped 0.7 to 135.8, having seen a day's high of 137.6.
Unilever added just 10 cents to Fl 213.80, down from a day's high of Fl
216.40. James Capel has upgraded the stock to a buy partly on the basis that
the group is well placed to benefit from economic recovery and forecasts
earnings growth of up to 11 per cent over the next three years.
Philips, after hitting a new year's high at midsession of Fl 40.00, eased
back to close off 10 cents at Fl 39.20.
MILAN weakened on a late round of selling. The Comit index lost 6.68 to
585.53. Pressure was seen continuing in Fiat shares which ended off L144 or
3.8 per cent at L3,706. The telecommunications sector also weakened with
Stet down L113 at L4,058 and Sip down L94 at L3,529. Stet yesterday
announced the sale of its 20 per cent stake in a Dutch group.
ATHENS added weakness in construction stocks to the pressure on bank shares
which drove the market down on Monday, and the general index closed another
9.22, or 1.1 per cent down at 836.75. The building sector declined on news
that the Greek construction company, AEGEK, would be introduced to the
exchange in November.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Corporate recovery boosts Swedish
stocks - Strong overseas buying has also provided support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could hardly be more ironic. In the month when Sweden's blue collar trade
union has said that the country is in a depression and not in a recession,
and the government has predicted the worst economic performance since the
Second World War for this year, shares have broken through the all-time high
reached in August 1989.
At yesterday's close the Affarsvarlden general index showed a gain on the
year to date of more than 50 per cent, making the Stockholm stock exchange
one of Europe's strongest performers.
A combination of falling interest rates, corporate recovery and record
foreign buying have created the conditions for the rally. Interest rates
remain on a downward trend, as the central bank demonstrated last week when
it cut its key marginal rate further to 7.75 per cent.
At the same time, the weaker krona and massive corporate restructuring have
made the big multinationals much more competitive, causing exports and
profits to recover strongly in spite of weak demand in key markets.
Sweden's finance minister said last week that the economy had reached
bottom, echoing common expectation that economic growth will resume next
year after three consecutive years of contraction. This has encouraged
investors, who are getting ever less from keeping money in the bank, to buy
now for the recovery.
Adjusted for inflation, shares are still well below their former peak in
1989. Strip out Astra and Ericsson, the stock market's star turns, and the
performance is still less impressive. These two companies alone account for
some 24 per cent of total market capitalisation.
Ericsson has had a phenomenal year, rising from a low point of SKr172 in
January to SKr444 yesterday. At these levels a huge recovery in profits is
already being discounted; what seems to be driving the share price now is
expectations of a very heavy inflow of orders in a booming world
telecommunications market.
Astra has performed less spectacularly, but its shares have still risen from
SKr148 to SKr174, helped by very strong sales growth for key drugs.
These two companies apart, it has been the banking sector which has put in
the best performance, on the strengthening belief that the worst of the
Swedish banking crisis is now over. The bank and insurance index is up
nearly 280 per cent since the start of the year.
Most analysts believe that the market will climb as interest rates come down
and evidence of economic recovery becomes more visible. They point to a
series of corporate tax reforms as another factor which should help to
sustain upward momentum.
The reforms, to take effect from January, will scrap taxes on dividends from
Swedish companies for domestic residents, and halve the capital gains tax on
equities to 12.5 per cent.
The single most significant development on the stock exchange over the last
12 months has been the surge in overseas buying, which has lifted foreign
share ownership to around 24 per cent from just 10 per cent at the end of
1991. International institutions have been attracted not just by the
prospect of profits, but by a big increase in market liquidity.
Foreigners now hold around 44 per cent of Ericsson, compared with 27 per
cent at the end of last year, and some 38 per cent of Astra. Such levels of
ownership make the stock market far more sensitive to the behaviour of
international investors. The obvious danger is that the market will suffer a
setback if foreigners start to lock in profits.
There are other reasons to be wary, according to Mr David Longmuir, a
Scandinavian specialist with James Capel in London. One worry is how much
scope the government has for further deep cuts in interest rates. 'The
budget deficit is an enormous cloud on the horizon which will not go away,'
he states.
Another concern is the recent spate of rights offers and the prospect of new
privatisation issues. These are making heavy demands on institutional funds
and could stem the buying required to drive share prices higher.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Bank operations tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INTERBANK operations were tight ahead of a record sized government bond
auction today, writes Peter John.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 550m in
the money market, later revised to Pounds 650m.
The shortage was smaller than many in recent days, with the result that the
Bank of England did not offer early assistance.
However, there was an unwillingness among market participants to accept Bank
help at a second round at midday, when only Pounds 3m of bills were
purchased.
A further Pounds 219m of band one bank bills were bought in the afternoon,
with discount houses principally meeting the liquidity shortage. After the
official close the Bank gave late help of Pounds 190m, bringing the day's
total to Pounds 412m.
Also, short sterling moved within a very narrow range in spite of a gloomy
economic survey which might have given further impetus for a UK interest
rate cut.
The latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends
survey showed that UK manufact-urers' orders and output were flat and export
orders lower.
One dealer said: 'You can make a very good case for a one-point cut now and
short sterling is still only discounting a half-point reduction. I think the
market is overbought and people are holding back ahead of today's gilts
auction.'
The short sterling futures contract for December was up at 94.65 in early
trading but slipped back to close two basis points weaker on balance at
94.59.
German and French short-term interest rate futures held steady ahead of
today's securities repurchase by the Bundesbank. German call money was
quoted at around 6.5 per cent, little changed from Monday's level, and
dealers said the market was well offered.
The German Euromark contract for December was slightly easier at 93.88 by
the close and the French December contract finished unchanged at 93.73.
Market opinion was split as to the likely level of the repo funds allocated,
but the amount is expected to be similar to last week's DM74.1bn and most
dealers said the award would have no significant impact on short interest
rates. Call money was seen holding above the repo rate of 6.40 per cent this
week.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Confidence data hit US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar fell briefly against a generally weaker D-Mark yesterday as
the latest consumer survey showed that confidence in the economy had
dropped, writes Peter John.
The correction marked the end of a one-week run which saw the US currency
record a gain of some 7 pfennigs against the D-Mark.
Profit-taking in Tokyo on Monday night had already brought the dollar back
from its highs against the D-Mark. Then, the latest consumer confidence
index showed a fall to 59.4 per cent in October from 62.6 per cent in
September against expectations of a rise.
The dollar slid a pfennig against the D-Mark but rallied later to close at
DM1.6810, up from DM1.6735 previously.
By contrast, the Canadian dollar was down more than two cents against the US
currency at one stage. Dealers said the Bank of Canada was intervening to
dampen volatility in the Canadian currency as it was announced that the
Conservative party had been trounced by the Liberals in the country's
general elections.
News that the Bloc Quebecois had become the leading opposition party revived
concern of a resurgence of separatism. There were also misgivings about the
Liberal Party's economic programme. The Canadian dollar fell to CDollars
1.3260 to the US dollar at one stage and closed a cent lower at CDollars
1.32.
The pound retreated from a Monday night gain against the D-Mark as investors
took early profits. It fell further as the latest Confederation of British
Industry quarterly industrial trends survey showed manufacturers' orders and
output were flat in the past four months and export orders had fallen back.
Sterling closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.4875 while it fell
against the dollar to Dollars 1.4795 from Dollars 1.4860.
The D-Mark continued easier against rival European currencies as provisional
west German consumer price inflation data for October came in much as
expected and no signals were anticipated from today's Bundesbank repo. It
slipped a centime to FFr3.48 against the French franc and fell against the
Greek drachma and Norwegian krone in spite of interest rate cuts in Greece
and Norway.
Greece cut its discount rate by half a point to 21.5 per cent and its
Lombard rate by a percentage point to 25.5 per cent. Foreign investors had
sold drachmas on worries over the new socialist administration but the
weekend policy statement was mild and investors decided to readjust their
positions. The drachma closed at Dr143.55 to the D-Mark against Dr145.54
previously.
Norway's central bank cut its rate for overnight deposits to 5 per cent from
5.5 per cent and the krone rose to NKr4.351 to the D-MArk from NKr4.352.
Portugal cut its nine-day repo rate by half a point to 10.375 per cent and
the escudo eased to Es103.62 to the D-Mark from Es103.2.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium crashes to 8-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM'S PRICE crashed through an important technical support level
yesterday to end the day on the London Metal Exchange at its lowest point
for eight years.
The fall triggered widespread selling on the LME, driving copper prices down
to fresh six-year lows and taking zinc to near six-year lows, lead and
nickel to near seven-year lows while tin was near its lowest point for 20
years.
Analysts suggested this reflected the fundamentally gloomy world economic
situation, huge and rising stock levels and unrestrained exports from the
former Soviet Union. No improvement could be expected until at least
half-way through 1994, they said.
Three-month aluminium was Dollars 1,074.75 a tonne at the close on the LME,
down Dollars 38.50, helped on its way by news that stocks in exchange
warehouses had risen by another 3,625 tonnes to a record 2,260,175 tonnes.
Analysts said the next technical support point was Dollars 1,050.
The price is now perilously near 45 cents a lb (Dollars 991 a tonne) which
the Anthony Bird consultancy group recently described as 'a disaster price'
that would quickly force western producers to close another 2m tonnes of
annual capacity on top of the 1.4m tonnes already temporarily shut down.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Keeping the faith in a falling
market - Kieran Cooke talks to a mine operator who refuses to admit defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SIA Hok Kiang, a Malaysian tin miner, sat in his hut surrounded by jungle
anxiously watching the latest prices on his computer screen.
The tin market was falling yet again. Ten years earlier the metal had been
fetching between MDollars 32 (USDollars 13) and MDollars 34 a kilogram at
the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market; now it was down to MDollars 10.80.
'It just can't go on like this,' said Mr Sia. 'There's no sense in tin
prices being so low. By any judgment, prices will have to start rising
again.' He has since been proved right - last week the KLTM price touched
MDollars 12.71, but that was still well below the break-even level for most
of the world's producers.
Mr Sia is managing director and part owner of the world's most extensively
developed underground tin mine at Sungei Lembing, a remote settlement at the
end of a valley on peninsular Malaysia's east coast.
At the turn of the century 5,000 miners were producing more than 4,000
tonnes of tin a year at Sungei Lembing. Now only 55 miners work at the mine.
'I am ashamed to say how little we are producing now,' said Mr Sia. 'We are
mining enough to cover costs and stop the mine falling into total neglect.
That's all we can do with prices being the way they are.'
Malaysia was once the world's leading tin producer. Tin is part of the
country's history: hundreds of thousands of immigrants from China originally
came to the country to work the tin mines.
But with prices falling, tin mines have been closing. Ten years ago Malaysia
was producing more than 60,000 tonnes of tin in concentrates. This year
production will probably fall to below 10,000 tonnes.
Mr Sia, a geologist who, through a varied career, has prospected for gold in
Peru and diamonds in central Africa, is one of the few in the tin industry
confident about the future.
'Tin cannot just go out of fashion,' he said. 'It's still an essential
metal, a vital part of so many products.'
Mr Sia's optimism was based on the view that global demand for tin remained
strong, at about 160,000 tonnes a year, while all the signs pointed to a
fall in world production.
'There is a lot of rubbish being talked about the collapse in tin prices,'
he insisted. 'People talk about growing production by China and about the US
selling off its tin stockpiles. That alone doesn't explain the price drop. I
think the market is being manipulated.'
Mr Sia forecast that the world stockpile of tin, estimated at about 40,000
tonnes, would soon start to fall. And he accused some traders of inventing
figures on world production and creating an artificial surplus.
'These traders are able to manipulate prices between Kuala Lumpur and
London,' he explained. 'They buy cheap and make a killing when prices rise.
The Kuala Lumpur market should be shut down, then trading would be much more
transparent.'
Sungei Lembing was originally developed by Cornish tin miners 100 years ago.
The mine, stretching over an area of 4,000 acres, has 500 miles of workings
and in some places shafts go down more than 2,000 feet.
Only a very small portion of the mine is now being worked, but the echoes of
more prosperous times still fill the area. The mine office is lined with
musty books from the old Sungei Lembing club, once centre of activity for
more than 100 expatriates. Pre-war British equipment, some of it still in
use, is everywhere.
Supported by a loan from the Commonwealth Development Corporation, Mr Sia
and a partner took over Sungei Lembing in 1989. The previous owners, a
Malaysian concern, had gone into liquidation because the fall in tin prices
following the collapse of International Tin Council's price support
operation four years earlier. Mr Sia had to buy the old equipment back from
the liquidator.
Mr Sia spends much of his time computerising the old records of the mine.
'The British kept thorough recordings of geological structures for every six
inches of tunnel advance,' he said. 'When I came here they were stacked
ceiling high: I now have a complete record of the workings from the turn of
the century up to 1986. Only the war years, when the Japanese flooded the
mine, are missing.'
Sungei Lembing has more than 700,000 tonnes of proven and probable ore
reserves, containing nearly 10,000 tonnes of recoverable metal. Mr Sia said
the average grading was about 1.5 per cent, though some fairly extensive
workings contained about 15 per cent.
'Last August I found a very rich deposit with 55 per cent grading,' said Mr
Sia. 'With tin prices so low I don't want to mine this precious reserve. But
obviously such rich deposits are easier to mine and give a far better
return.'
Substantial amounts of money have to be invested in the mine to shore up the
tunnels and replace rusting railway tracks. To cover costs Mr Sia is
contemplating using the mine's surface area to plant palm oil and other cash
crops.
'Some people call me eccentric,' admitted Mr Sia, 'but I'm determined to
keep Sungei Lembing open. If prices are still down at present levels in a
few years time I might have to concede defeat. But if prices rise, I'll
become a big player in the market. There are those who describe tin mining
as a sunset industry. I say that the sunset is always followed by the
sunrise.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin producers agree to cut
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S biggest tin producers have agreed a series of measures that they
hope will reduce global stocks and raise prices.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries, at the conclusion of a meeting
in Kuala Lumpur, said 1994 tin exports by member countries would be limited
to 78,000 tonnes - a 13 per cent reduction from the present annual exports
permitted under its quota regime.
The ATPC groups Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Thailand, Australia, Bolivia
and Zaire.
For the present China and Brazil, two of the world's biggest tin producers,
remain outside the association. But earlier this week the former country
agreed to join the ATPC by the end of the year. China's tin exports, which
are said by some ATPC delegates to have been as high as 30,000 tonnes last
year, are felt to be one of the main reasons for the slump in tin prices
over the past few years.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, said low tin
prices were also caused by increased sales of tin stocks by the US Defence
Logistics Agency. Tin prices in Malaysia, once the world's biggest producer,
dropped to a historic low of MDollars 10.78 (MDollars 4.22) a kilogram last
month, compared with MDollars 32 ten years ago.
'We hope the measures taken will induce an upward movement of prices from
the current ridiculously low levels,' said Mr Lim.
The association, while noting that tin prices had rallied somewhat in recent
weeks, said the most important task was to reduce the global tin stockpile,
at present estimated to be 40,000 tonnes. 'It is reasonable to expect a
meaningful depletion of around 10,400 tonnes in the stock level during 1994,
thereby reducing the total overhang to a more manageable 28,500 tonnes' said
the ATPC.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Researchers unlock secret of
locust swarms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS IN Kenya have identified behaviour-modifying chemicals in desert
locusts that could be used to prevent them from swarming and devastating
crops in Africa and Asia.
Professor Thomas Odhiambo, director of the International Centre of Insect
Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, told a meeting at the House of Commons in
London yesterday that research into preventing locust plagues was 'moving in
the right direction'.
His team has isolated chemicals which make many locusts reach sexual
maturity and lay their eggs within a very short time of each other. This
brings large numbers together and leads to swarming and migration to
crop-growing regions.
Prof Odhiambo said the research, which is costing Dollars 1.2m a year, could
end the need for mass spraying of locust breeding grounds in semi-arid
savannah where the insects serve an important role in recycling nutrients
such as nitrogen.
'When you spray as you have been doing for years at the beginning of each
outbreak, it's in very fragile environments. You're not asking permission
from the pastoral communities and the insecticides end up in the camel milk
which these people drink,' he said.
If the research was successful, it could also overcome problems that arise
from the misplaced generosity of international donors, he said.
Donated pesticide left over from previous locust plagues was now lying
leaking in dumps in Morocco and Somalia. 'These countries don't know how to
deal with expired insecticides,' he said. 'There's no incinerator anywhere
in Africa.'
Prof Odhiambo said it was too early to specify how the chemicals would be
used to prevent swarming and keep the locusts in their isolated, grasshopper
state.
'In normal breeding grounds there are probably less than half a dozen
locusts per hectare,' he said. 'From next year our concentration has to be
in the field to understand how these chemicals are responsible for managing
this behaviour. We think we've identified a small population in Namibia
which has never swarmed and we need to understand why.'
They also wanted to discover what made swarms of locusts break up and return
to their isolated state.
The research is being funded by the United Nations Development Programme,
the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the German and
Swedish governments. The initial four-year programme ends in December next
year and Prof Odhiambo thinks at least 10 years of fieldwork will be needed.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unpropitious time chosen for
British Coal's export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is understandably pleased with itself this week as it begins to
ship its biggest export order this year - for 100,000 tonnes of steam coal
to a Danish electricity generator. But it could hardly have chosen a more
difficult time to make a push into the European market.
Steam coal prices look set to fall once again for 1994 deliveries. Contracts
are now being concluded between the South African producers and the Belgian
utility Electrabel at prices Dollars 3 below last year's, giving a 1994
price at the South African export terminal of Dollars 27 a tonne. With ocean
freight rates from Richards Bay to Rotterdam around Dollars 6.75, delivered
prices into north-west Europe look unlikely to exceed Pounds 22 a tonne.
Although some of the power companies in Europe - the Netherlands' GKE for
example - will be paying slightly higher prices for better quality coals,
many will be seeking, and getting, deliveries at spot-related prices.
Stadtwerke Bremen in Germany is believed to have settled first quarter 1994
business at Dollars 21 fob Richards Bay and the two Danish utilities, Elsam
and SK Power, at below Dollars 20 from South Africa.
Outsiders, seeing a market where supplies are threatened by the US coal
strike and the sudden rise of Russian rail freight rates to Dollars 20 a
tonne (they were Dollars 2 a tonne two years ago), will find this weakness
difficult to comprehend. But weak power demand in Europe and in Japan has
resulted in poor purchase levels, particularly from companies that had been
counted on to be big buyers - Electricite de France, Italy's ENEI, and the
British power companies.
While ENEI has been cutting back its annual purchases from nearly 10m tonnes
to about 2m tonnes this year, EDF, PowerGen and National Power have been
transformed into companies selling on their imports rather than signing up
for new business. Earlier this year EDF found itself in the embarrassing
position of paying suppliers either to delay or cancel deliveries.
Although some expansion in purchases can be expected in Europe from GKE,
from Electricidade de Portugal and from Morocco, 1994 looks likely to be as
gloomy as 1993.
In contrast to Europe, the Asian market is undergoing a boom. Although a
cool wet summer kept demand down and hydro supplies up in Japan, the sheer
volume of new coal-fired power stations coming on to the grid bodes well for
irresistible growth throughout the decade. Elsewhere in Asia - particularly
this year in South Korea - demand for imports is mounting as much from new
power stations as from, in southern India and on China's Pearl river,
inadequate indigenous supply.
The price outlook in Asia should be very different from Europe's, with new
demand not matched by the new supply. But the perversity of the settlement
calendar puts the Japanese steel producers, like their European competitors
all making losses, ahead of the power utilities, so weakening the steam coal
exporters' prospects relative to those of their coking coal cousins. If they
do have to take price cuts this year  - and the weakness of the Australian
dollar certainly makes cuts that much easier to accommodate - it will be
doubly galling since export stocks have fallen throughout the year to reach
a four-year low at the end of September.
However, the vigour of the Asian market will do little to improve the
prospects for those who believe British Coal's redemption will be through a
sustained export campaign. What pickings there will be over the next 12
months will be lean and cheap.

The GOLD retreated from near the top of its recent trading range yesterday,
but found support again above the Dollars 365-a-troy-ounce mark. Dealers
said physical buyers and bargain-hunting investors were attracted by a fall
towards Dollars 366, but the price still ended London trading with a net
fall of Dollars 4.50 at Dollars 367.25 an ounce. Gold's performance
undermine SILVER market sentiment and the junior precious metal closed in
London at Dollars 4.36 1/2 an ounce, down 9 cents. 'Silver has run out of
steam and some of its technical indicators have now turned slightly
bearish,' one trader commented. The aluminium market collapse (see story
above) knocked the stuffing out of other base metals. NICKEL fell away, with
London Metal Exchange stocks continuing to rise and the market in need of
further production cuts. But LEAD seemed to find some modest support near
Dollars 400 a tonne for three months delivery, and with fundamentals not as
depressed as other metals, closed only marginally lower on the day. The
London Commodity Exchange COCOA market failed to live up to early promise
and the March futures position closed Pounds 2 down at Pounds 969 a tonne.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Recruitment: Not brain-power, but frame of mind - Research
casts doubt on the way company leaders typically try to get tough problems
solved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLESS such happens to be your lot in reality, just suppose that you are the
chief of a company threatened by a hugely complicated problem. Since you've
tried and failed to solve it yourself, which of the following two options
offers you the best hope of obtaining a solution?
A - Single out the highest fliers in the company. Then spell out to them the
problem and how crucial it is to the outfit's future, pledging handsome
promotion to the one who cracks it.
B - Frame the problem as an abstract puzzle, making no reference to its
connection with the company let alone its importance. Then offer the puzzle
anonymously as a leisure-time diversion to the entire staff, perhaps via the
house journal, inviting answers but without mention of any reward.
My guess is that, simply because the first of the two options seems
obviously the right one, most of you will have picked the second. If so, I
suspect that those who are actually chief executives responded to my
hypothetical question differently from the way they typically react to such
issues in real life.
Be that as it may, however, the better chances of obtaining a solution would
appear to lie with option B. And the evidence for that in turn lies in a
research study in a relatively new branch of psychology called reversal
theory, which was first mentioned in this corner of the FT three weeks ago.
One of its principal observations is that, when taking action, people are in
either of two distinct frames of mind. Moreover, although we can switch (or
'reverse') from one to the other, we can never be in both at the same time.
In one of them, which the theory terms the telic state, the action is
undertaken solely as a means to some pre-set end. In the example I cited
earlier, if the goal of saving the firm and so winning promotion causes you
to concentrate on the problem, you'll be working on it in a telic way as a
task.
The alternative kind of action, called paratelic, consists of things you do
simply because you want to do them. If the problem is offered to you
casually as a puzzle, and you have a try at it because you find it
interesting, you will be operating in a paratelic way. You'll be tackling it
first and foremost for the sake of doing so, even though you also hope to
crack it at the end of the day.
Which of the two mental states is the more conducive to solving complex
problems was examined not long ago in a study led by psychologist Stephen
Barr of the SPSS (UK) software group. The researchers took 30 volunteers of
similar brain-power, 15 in the telic and 15 in the paratelic state, and set
them to work on a veritable mind-boggler: a board game whose various pieces
could be combined in more than 300,000 ways, only one of which was right.
True to form, the telic group focused on it as a task, frequently exhorting
themselves to 'think, think, think' and the like. Their paratelic
counterparts were more casual, one admitting that he'd soon lost thought of
seeking to arrange the pieces correctly, and 'just fancied putting them all
together.'
Given that persistence is important to sorting out such complications, which
of the two groups would readers think proved the more persevering? It was,
in fact, the paratelic set. The telics largely gave up frustrated after
trying, on average, for less than half as long.
More surprising in view of the test's difficulties, however, was that six of
the 30 actually cracked it. And among the victorious half dozen, the
paratelics outnumbered the telic five to one.
N
OW to the table alongside which, as in previous years, is compiled from the
latest survey of executive rewards in the United Kingdom, carried out by the
P-E International management consultancy. The study, which was made in July,
covered more than 8,000 executives of ranks ranging from chair-man to junior
manager employed by nearly 900 organisations of varied kinds.
Any reader who wants the complete report, which contains a wealth of data on
salaries and bonuses of which the table takes no account should contact
Simon McBride of the consultancy at Park House, Wick Road, Egham, Surrey
TW20 0HW; telephone (0)784 434411, fax (0)784 437828 (though he'll be away
at the Institute of Personnel Management's conference in Harrogate until the
weekend). The report's price is Pounds 400.
My extracts are confined to the survey's findings on the fringe benefits
typically awarded in the UK executive ranks. The table takes 13 salary-bands
from Pounds 20,000-Pounds 25,000 upwards, and sets out the percentage of
managers on the various perches of the pay pecking-order who enjoy each type
of perk. The all-ranks figures for 1989 as well as this year at the bottom,
by the way, are for all executives covered by the study, including juniors
on salaries of less than Pounds 20,000 a year.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European sector claws back losses in thin
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets clawed back some of Monday's losses but ended narrowly
mixed in moderate turnover. Flows were thin as investors continued to digest
last week's round of rate cuts, and with little fresh news expected this
week, most markets are expected to continue consolidating.
UK GILTS ended slightly firmer as participants prepared for today's auction
of 6 per cent gilts due 1999, next year's new five-year benchmark.
Despite its Pounds 3.5bn record size, the auction is expected to go
smoothly, supported by firm demand from overseas and domestic investors.
Expectations of near-term easing have caused short to medium-dated paper to
outperform longer maturities in recent weeks and are expected to ensure
strong demand for the new paper.
Analysts are calling for a bid-to-cover ratio of around 1.5 to 2 times and a
tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the average
accepted yield - of around three basis points. Late in the day the bonds
were quoted at 49 1/32 on a when-issued basis, yielding 6.21 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds began the day on a firmer footing after overnight
buying by Far-Eastern accounts, but early gains were eroded by profit-taking
on disappointment over preliminary October inflation data and D-Mark
weakness following last week's  1/2 -point cut in key German rates.
The December bund contract opened at 100.04, rose as high as 100.24 and
closed at 100.13, up 0.05 point on the day.
While some see further downside at the long end, others expect it to remain
well supported. 'I'm pulling in my bear claws,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head
of International Futures and Options at Deutsche Bank, who expects the
technical uptrend to continue. 'While we are in a consolidation phase, I
feel there are bigger chances for a break to the upside than to the
downside.'
ALTHOUGH the French franc strengthened slightly against the D-Mark, French
bonds edged lower on the day, pressured by the announcement of new 5.5 per
cent 10-year bonds to be auctioned next week. The notional bond futures
contract traded on Matif fell 0.14 point to 124.52.
JAPANESE government bonds hit new six-year highs, with the December JGB bond
futures contract rising 0.11 point from Friday to 113.98. The rally was
spurred mainly by investors switching out of stocks into bonds after the
Nikkei stock index fell by 286 points to 20,024 - perilously close to the
psychological 20,000 level.
THREE days of heavy selling at the long end of the US Treasury market ended
yesterday when bond prices posted modest gains in the wake of a weak
consumer confidence report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 103
5/8 , yielding 5.983 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was up  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent.
Treasury prices opened firmer and held their ground in positive territory,
thanks to news of a decline in the Conference Board's consumer confidence
index. The index, which fell from 63.8 in September to 59.4 in October,
indicated that consumers remain concerned about the weakness of the economy,
and cheered bond investors, who had seen prices plummet and yields soar over
the previous three days.
Analysts said that most of the buying was limited to dealers, and that
retail accounts were staying on the sidelines until the afternoon auction of
a record Dollars 16.5bn in two-year notes. The auction turned out to be
something of a disappointment, with demand weaker than expected. This
temporarily unsettled bonds, pushing prices into negative territory, but
they recovered their losses later in the day.
CANADIAN government bonds slid sharply in the wake of Canada's national
elections, but later recovered to trade only slightly lower in midday
dealings.
The strong performance by the separatist Bloc Quebecois sent initial
shudders through Canada's currency and bond markets, but prices stabilised
on remarks by the party's leader Lucien Bouchard that he has no hidden
agenda to disrupt parliament.
According to Mr Brian Hilliard, senior economist with Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull, 'the key thing is that the Liberal Party has an absolute
majority'.
He also said investors should take comfort from the likelihood that monetary
policy will remain unchanged.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Regulation of OTC derivatives
satisfies CFTC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of over-the-counter derivatives is expanding rapidly, but the risks
associated with the transactions are vastly overstated, and there is no need
for fundamental changes in the way they are regulated, the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission concluded in a report delivered to Congress
yesterday.
'After detailed analysis of default and credit risks in these markets we
have concluded there is no cause for concern,' said Ms Shelia Bair, acting
CFTC chairman. 'However, we have identified several areas where greater
co-operation between regulators would be beneficial, particularly for
sharing information,' she said.
The CFTC is the primary US regulator of exchange-traded futures and options,
and last year was given exemptive powers over off-exchange instruments such
as swaps. However, Congress is still contemplating how OTC derivatives
should be regulated. The House banking committee will hold a hearing in
Washington tomorrow to discuss the issue, and the CFTC's recommendations.
Finding that the 'systemic and public policy issues suggested by these
products are not confined to any single market or the province of any one
regulator', the CFTC report recommends an inter-agency council of federal
financial regulators be formed to consider common approaches to OTC
derivatives.
The agency ducked suggestions that its powers be merged with its larger
arch-rival, the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying such a merger
would not address the problems posed by derivatives dealers not governed by
either agency.
In the report the CFTC for the first time said that non-regulated
subsidiaries of broker-dealers might require a second look by the
government. Several broker-dealers, including Salomon Brothers, have set up
separately capitalised subsidiaries to deal in swaps this year. These
affiliates are subject to less regulation than their parent companies or US
banks dealing in swaps.
The CFTC study, conducted with the co-operation of the Federal Reserve and
the SEC, said a top priority for an interagency regulatory council should be
the lack of comprehensive information on the OTC markets.
The absence of standardised disclosure, pricing, and risk valuation was also
cited as a concern, as was the fact that end-users of OTC derivatives may
need to be better versed in managing risks associated with the instruments.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Strong Asian demand for Sweden's
Dollars 1bn FRN offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 1bn offering of global floating rate notes
(FRNs) dominated a busy day of issuance in the international bond market.
Other issuers were reported to be closely watching Sweden's three-year
issue, the first sovereign global FRN offering, with a view to deciding
whether to follow suit.
Joint lead managers Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan said a significant portion
of Sweden's deal had been placed by the end of the day.
Strong demand from Asia and the Middle East compensated for a relatively
disappointing response from Europe. The notes were kept in syndicate
overnight to allow time to place them in the US.
The notes, which were priced at the re-offer to yield nine basis points
below three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), are expected to be
freed to trade today.
Asian investors were also strong buyers of the Dollars 500m five-year
Eurobond offering from Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden, according to lead
manager Nomura. UMB is well-known in Japan as a result of its bond issues in
the Samurai market, the domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers.
The bonds were priced to yield 68 basis points over the when-issued US
Treasury due 1998 and the spread remained unchanged during official trading
hours. However, some traders said the spread widened to 73 basis points in
the after-market.
Treasury Corporation of Victoria tapped the pent-up demand for high-yielding
Canadian dollar paper with its CDollars 250m offering of 10-year Eurobonds.
There has been little new issuance in the EuroCanadian dollar sector in the
run-up to Canada's general election.
TCV was thought to have swapped the proceeds of the issue into Australian
dollars. However, the lack of arbitrage opportunities in the Canadian dollar
market might limit further issuance in this sector, syndicate managers said.
Volatility in the swaps market was also hampering the first Eurobond issue
from Trans Tokyo Bay, the Japanese government-guaranteed agency. The issuer
is thought to be looking to raise Dollars 200m through an issue of 10-year
Eurobonds and swap the proceeds into yen. IBJ is arranging the deal.
Elsewhere, strong international demand enabled Reliance Industries, India's
largest private sector company, to increase its six-year Euroconvertible
bond issue to Dollars 140m from an original Dollars 125m.
Reliance achieved a coupon of 3.50 per cent, at the bottom end of the
indicated range of 3.50 to 4 per cent, and a conversion premium of 12.06 per
cent, at the top end of the indicated range of 8-12 per cent.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the issue had been oversubscribed 10 times.
The bonds were trading at 106 1/2 -107 1/2 yesterday, well above their issue
price of par.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMSTERDAM stock exchange is to lower the threshold for newcomers to the
bourse as part of plans to abolish the exchange's 'parallel market' for
smaller, younger companies in early-1994.
Starting next year, new bourse-listed companies on the main market will need
to ensure that the total value of shares tradeable on the exchange is at
least Fl 10m.
This is well below the bourse's existing threshold of Fl 50m but above the
Fl 5m minimum on the parallel market, a separate market established in 1982
for young companies. The parallel market, similar to the UK's Unlisted
Securities Market, is to be integrated into the main market next year
because it has failed to attract sufficient investors, particularly among
institutions.
Under rules published yesterday, the exchange said existing companies on the
parallel market will be able to move automatically to the main market
provided they agree to comply with the bourse's limits on anti-takeover
devices.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Dai-Ichi Kangyo cuts forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese bank, halved its interim pre-tax
estimates yesterday due to higher-than-expected write-offs for bad loans and
a fall in income due to lower profit margins.
Other banks, which are due to announce their half-year results at the end of
next month, are expected to follow suit, as an increasing number of
corporate borrowers are becoming unable to pay back loan interests amid the
prolonged economic slump. This is forcing the banks to write off the bad
loans.
Combined bad loans at 21 leading banks stood at Y12,770bn at the end of last
March, and industry analysts expect the figure for end-September to have
risen to around Y14,000bn.
At the same time, revenues at the banks have been squeezed by a slump in
lending. For the first six months to September, the outstanding balance of
loans at 11 leading commercial banks fell by 0.5 per cent to Y222,300bn, its
first fall on record.
DKB halved its pre-tax profit for the first half to September from its
original forecast, to total Y20bn (Dollars 184m), down 56.8 per cent from
the year-ago figure.
Ordinary income for the first six months is expected to fall 17.2 per cent
to Y1,290bn, instead of Y1,300bn. The bank's after-tax profits are expected
to fall 44.8 per cent to Y16bn instead of the earlier forecasted Y24bn.
For the full year to March, DKB expects pre-tax profits to plunge 62.1 per
cent to Y40bn on a 15.3 per cent fall in ordinary income to Y2,500bn.
After-tax profits are projected to decline 39.6 per cent to Y32bn.

SA BREWING Holdings, the Australian bewer, it planned to rename the company
Southcorp Holdings and to introduce a new logo, Reuter reports from
Adelaide.
The company said the proposed new name reflected its origins and its
diversification and expansion in Australia and overseas. It began in brewing
and hotel ownership but has since become a wine producer and a manufacturer
of water heaters, appliances and packaging. It sold its brewing and hotel
assets in August.
SA Brewing said it would seek shareholder approval for the name change at
its annual meeting on November 25.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indian inquiry puts reforms to
test - The country's biggest corporate takeover plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission yesterday
started a public examination of the country's biggest corporate takeover
plan in a hearing which is being seen as an important test of the
effectiveness of the government's economic reforms.
The inquiry concerns proposals by Hindustan Lever, the Indian subsidiary of
Unilever, to acquire Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), an affiliate of Tata,
India's largest industrial grouping, and a large producer of soaps and
detergents.
Before Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched the liberalisation
programme in 1991, the monopolies commission was a powerful instrument of
the licence raj - the panoply of economic controls developed in
post-independence India. The inquiry into the Hindustan Lever-Tomco deal is
the commission's first major probe since its powers were curbed by changes
to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act. The handling of the
case will be a significant indication of how reforms are being implemented.
Hindustan Lever's takeover of Tomco was announced in March and approved in
June by shareholders of both companies but it has still to complete its
passage through legal and official reviews. Under Indian law, companies
wishing to make acquisitions must register them in court. Would-be opponents
are given the opportunity to file protests.
Hindustan Lever's plans have been opposed by one of its in-house trade
unions, the Maharashtra Girini Kamgar Union (which represents about 20 per
cent of the employees), and by the Maharashtra Small-Scale Soap
Manufacturers Association, a small-scale employers' organisation.
The trade union is worried about the potential impact of the merger on jobs
and the small-scale manufacturers association is concerned small-scale
producers might be squeezed out of the market.
Both organisations have filed protests against the merger in the Bombay High
Court and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC).
In its case to the MRTPC, the trade union concedes that amendments to the
anti-monopolies act have ended blanket restrictions on large groups carrying
out takeovers or making other investments which would substantially increase
market share. However, the union argues that the proposed acquisition of
Tomco by Hindustan Lever would infringe rules still in force on 'restrictive
trade practices'.
It claims the acquisition would create a group with nearly 80 per cent of
the national market in toilet soaps and 90 per cent in detergent. This would
distort competition with 'disastrous' results for consumers and cuts in
employment in the industry.
Hindustan Lever says the union's figures are exaggerated, claiming that its
market share in soaps and detergents would rise from 25 per cent to 30 per
cent after the merger. It argues that the deal will 'benefit all'.
Hindustan Lever hopes that the commission will finish its deliberations
soon, before December 15, when the Bombay High Court is due to consider the
merger. Hindustan Lever officials believe that a positive verdict from the
commission will help the court to deliver a favourable verdict.

JOHN FAIRFAX Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, has finalised an
ADollars 850m (USDollars 569m) debt refinancing programme which directors
said would significantly lower its interest costs.
A company statement yesterday said the refinancing had been achieved despite
legal action by interests associated with Independent Newspapers, the Irish
media group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, which unsuccessfully bid for Fairfax
in 1991.
The refinancing involves an unsecured five-year amortising facility of
ADollars 800m provided by a syndicate led by National Australia Bank and
including Toronto Dominion Australia and Societe Generale Australia. It also
includes a five-year working capital facility of ADollars 50m provided by
National Australia Bank.
The facilities replace arrangements with Fairfax's previous lenders.

EDGARS, the clothing, footwear and textiles group in the South African
Breweries stable, overcame a difficult operating environment to increase
attributable profit by 22 per cent to R100.3m (Dollars 23.9m) in the six
months to September, compared with R82.4m a year ago.
With the market growing during this period at an estimated 9 per cent,
Edgars gained market share with turnover growing at 18 per cent to reach
R1.65bn, compared with R1.41bn last time.
Selling prices, however, were deliberately reduced to compensate customers
partially for a 40 per cent increase in the rate of value added tax - to 14
per cent from 10 per cent.
As a result, operating profit rose by only 5 per cent to R204.2m, from
R194.4m a year ago. Lower finance charges and a drop in the effective tax
rate helped boost attributable earnings.
The dividend was increased by 18 per cent to 45 cents per share, from 38
cents, on a 20 per cent increase in earnings per share to 195 cents, from
162 cents.
Mr George Beeton, chief executive, said assuming that there was no major
deterioration in the socio-political environment, sales and profit growth
for the full year should match the first half.
A divisional breakdown of earnings shows that Edgars contributed R86.1m,
compared with R68.6m last time, and Sales House R22.9m, compared to R18.1m.
Jet made a R3.2m loss, against one of R4.2m.

SLACK sales of industrial robots to the motor industry were blamed for a
plunge in half-year profits at Fanuc, the world's largest machine tool
manufacturing equipment maker.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell
28.2 per cent to Y11.6bn (Dollars 109.4m) on a 9.7 per cent decline in sales
to Y56.2bn.
After-tax profits fell 29.5 per cent to Y6.5bn.
Sales at the robot division tumbled by 23 per cent to Y14bn. Industrial
robots for the auto industry accounted for 50 per cent of total robot sales,
down from the previous 70 per cent.
Factory automation equipment declined 11.7 per cent to Y33.9bn. However,
exports to Taiwan and South Korea were brisk, pushing Fanuc's export ratio
above 40 per cent for the first time.
During the second half of the year, the company will focus on sales of
plastic injection molding machines, the only item to produce firm profits.
Plant and equipment investments for the second half will fall by 50 per cent
from the previou year, the company said.
For the full year to March, Fanuc expects non-consolidated pre-tax profits
to fall 27.3 per cent to Y21.2bn on a 10.1 per cent decline in sales to
Y105.7bn.

MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial and Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics
companies both report sharp falls in first-half profits .
Matsushita confirmed expectations of a substantial deterioration in its
first-half business by reporting a 43 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y29.7bn (Dollars 280.2m) from Y52.3bn.
The company blamed the continuing weakness of consumer demand, and slow
recovery in its other main markets for the poor parent company results.
Sales for the half year were 6 per cent down to Y2,147bn.
Matsushita was particularly hard hit by an unusually cool summer, which not
only depressed demand for air conditioners but also dampened consumption
overall. Meanwhile, the yen's appreciation against major currencies
including the US dollar, D-Mark and Asian currencies resulted in a
first-half loss of Y9bn.
Domestic sales were down 7 per cent while exports suffered a 5 per cent
decline. Of Matsushita's separate product categories, sales of video
equipment fell 11 per cent and audio products 6 per cent. Home appliances,
including air conditioners, registered the largest fall among product groups
of 17 per cent.
On the other hand, sales of rice cookers which use induction heating and
combined TV/VCR units were buoyant.
Matsushita, which is looking for growing second-half demand for its thin TVs
and wide-screen TVs, is forecasting full-year profits of Y63bn, down 35 per
cent, on sales of Y4,350bn, a 4 per cent fall from the previous year.
Sharp, meanwhile reported a 23 per cent fall in first half pre-tax profits
for many of the same reasons that affected Matsushita. Pre-tax profits came
to Y20.2bn, a decline of 23 per cent on sales of 575.2bn, down 1.4 per cent
from the previous year.
The company, which has been building up expertise in liquid crystal displays
and flash memories, saw its exports rise 1.5 per cent during the period.
Sharp is forecasting stable sales for the full year at Y1,150bn and pre-tax
profits of Y41bn, down 8 per cent. The company does not expect the Japanese
economy to recover easily due to an expected increase in unemployment and
continuing yen strength.

<TEXT>
MALBAK, the industrial conglomerate in the Gencor group, overcame difficult
trading conditions to record a 14 per cent increase in earnings to R374m
(Dollars 89.5m) in the year to August, compared with R329m a year ago.
Turnover rose by 10 per cent to R11bn, and although gross margins were under
considerable pressure, cost reductions and productivity improvements helped
offset these conditions and operating income rose by 7 per cent to R820m.
Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said the results were 'very pleasing' seen
against the difficult operating environment.
He said the group was forecasting a modest increase in earnings for 1994,
but said predictions were extremely difficult given the huge changes which
lay ahead, including South Africa's first multiracial elections.
Reflecting his cautious outlook - Mr Thomas said it was unlikely that there
would be any return to 'sustained economic growth' in the coming year - the
dividend was increased by 4 per cent to 35 cents per share.
Earnings rose by 8 per cent to 122 cents per share from 112 cents.

<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND-based forestry concern Carter Holt Harvey is seeking to convert
its 30.5 per cent indirect ownership in Copec, its Chilean forestry and
fishing associate, into a direct ownership structure, AP-DJ reports from
Wellington.
Carter Holt, which is controlled by a joint venture between US-based
International Paper and New Zealand-based Brierley Investments, said it had
initiated the preliminary legal steps necessary for such a move.
The New Zealand company currently holds its Copec stake through a joint
venture with Angellini Group of Chile.
Copec, formally known as Compania de Petroleos de Chile, is one of Chile's
largest industrial companies, with operations in forestry, fishing, energy
and retailing.
Carter Holt said the current ownership structure for its holding in Copec
limits its involvement with the company.
The New Zealand company sees various opportunities to add value to Copec,
and having a direct stake in the company would allow some of these
opportunities to be realised.
Carter Holt's stake in Copec is worth around NZDollars 1bn (USDollars 555m)
and it wants to manage this investment actively. The group has in the past
talked of selling its Chilean investments, but said this is not now being
considered.
The company declined to say whether it planned to increase its stake in
Copec.
Copec is 61 per cent-owned by Inversiones y Desarrollo Los Andes, which is
in turn 50 per cent owned by Carter Holt and 50 per cent by Angellini, a
family-owned Chilean concern.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: GM halts search for locomotive
partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday called off its two-year search for a strategic
partner for its locomotive group, which it said would remain one of the
company's main businesses.
GM announced in June 1991 that it was looking for a partner for the
business, as part of its plan to concentrate on its core automotive
operations, which are losing money in North America.
The locomotive business makes freight and passenger locomotives and armoured
defence vehicles.
Mr William Hoglund, a GM executive vice-president, said that the company had
been considering stopping its search for a partner for some time.
Since the search began, the group's electro-motive division and its partner,
Siemens of Germany, had had a 'very substantial impact' in the market with
new AC traction technology, leading to the largest locomotive contract in
railway history.
GM, Mr Hoglund added, had high expectations for the business, but this
needed to focus on its objectives without the uncertainties of a search for
a partner.
In a separate development, GM yesterday gave a three-year reprieve to a
Kalamazoo, Michigan, metal-stamping plant earmarked for closure and 10
months of extra life to a New York plant making mini-vans.
The Kalamazoo plant was due to close in 1995 and the New York site the
following year as part of the company's efforts to reduce sharply the size
of its North American operations.
GM said that keeping the Kalamazoo plant open, with about half its current
1,900 workers, would let the company avoid paying workers up to full wages
for being laid off.
A new labour agreement, reached by GM and the United Auto Workers' union
earlier this week, maintains a system whereby GM continues to pay workers
whom it lays off - even though the company is suffering from severe
overcapacity in the US market and losing money.
The New York plant will continue producing mini-vans until a factory in
Georgia begins the manufacture of a new generation of vans.
Lawyers for GM and for owners of 6m pick-up trucks yesterday asked a federal
judge to approve settlement of 36 class action suits brought against the
company over the trucks' controversial side-mounted petrol tanks, which
critics allege are a fire hazard.
Under the proposed settlement, GM would give owners coupons worth Dollars
1,000 towards the purchase of a new truck.

<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Communications, the US entertainment group which is the subject of
a bidding war, yesterday announced a joint venture with television group
Chris-Craft Industries to launch a new US broadcast TV network.
The network, due to come into operation at the start of 1995, would
initially present four hours of original pro gramming over two nights a
week.
Paramount yesterday described the venture as a 'fifth national network',
though its original programming would initially fall far short of the
existing four - ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
The Paramount and Chris-Craft stations which will comprise the core
affiliates of the new network reach some 27 per cent of US television
households.
Wall Street analysts said attempts to establish a fifth network were hardly
new, and Paramount would face an extremely hard task in a very competitive
environment. 'It will be the 15th fifth network,' said one.
Some analysts were also surprised by the timing of the move, in the middle
of a takeover contest.
The deal does not impinge directly on the battle between Viacom, the cable
company making a friendly Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, and QVC Network,
which has launched a hostile offer worth the same amount.
Viacom yesterday welcomed the fifth channel project, which it described as
'one more example of the limitless potential that makes the future for
Paramount-Viacom so exciting'. However, QVC has indicated that it would sell
Paramount's television stations if it took the company over.
The new network would be jointly owned and operated by Paramount and
Chris-Craft, which holds 70 per cent of BHC Communications, owner of a group
of eight TV stations.
Paramount's television group is a leading producer of programmes for the
existing television networks and for first-run syndication. It also owns
seven television stations.
The network's four hours of original material would feature 'Star Trek:
Voyager', a new series developing Paramount's 'Star Trek' science fiction
programme.
It would acquire additional original programmes from Paramount and other
producers, but has yet to decide on news programming.
Paramount said affiliated stations carrying the introductory, prime-time
blocks of programming would include the six Chris-Craft stations which are
independent of the existing networks and Paramount's four independent
stations.
The Chris-Craft stations include WWOR, which serves the large New York
market, and KCOP in Los Angeles.

HOOGOVENS, the Dutch metals group, is negotiating the sale of six small
companies representing half its industrial supply division, as part of plans
to concentrate on its main steel and aluminium businesses.
The six companies, with combined annual sales of Fl 250m (Dollars 138m) and
a workforce of 1,000 people, are to be sold as a group to three Dutch
venture capital companies - Albif, Alpinvest and Nederlandse Participatie
Maatschappij.
The rest of the companies in the industrial supply division are to be
distributed among Hoogovens' other four divisions but they may be sold later
if buyers can be found.
Hoogovens, which is struggling to reduce losses and debts, announced this
year that it planned to start divesting non-core businesses.
The six companies are Bihca Precision, Gieterij Nunspeet, Nederlandse
Draadindustrie, Achilles, Thibo Draad and El-o-Matic Holding, in which
Hoogovens owns a 46.6 per cent stake.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: US-Japanese diesel engine deal
revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and Komatsu, the biggest Japanese construction
equipment group, yesterday announced details of their collaboration plans in
diesel engines. The deal was originally revealed in February.
The companies will be forming two joint ventures, one of which will be named
Komatsu Cummins Engine and located at Komatsu's Oyama plant in Japan. It
will produce Cummins' small B-series, used by Komatsu in construction
equipment and sold by Cummins in Japan and Asia. This will allow the US
company to increase its presence in the growing Asia-Pacific region.
The second venture, Cummins Komatsu Engine, will be sited in Cummins' plant
at Seymour, Indiana, and produce Komatsu's large 30-litre engines for
Cummins to sell worldwide.
Production at both ventures will begin by 1996, with annual output expected
to reach 40,000 engines at Oyama and 2,000 engines at Seymour by the end of
the decade.
The link-up between the two companies is one of the most important in the
world diesel engine industry. It allows both companies to extend their
product ranges and cut costs by sharing R&amp;D and eliminating areas of
duplication.

NATIONAL Semiconductor of the US has entered a technical and marketing
partnership with Novell, the US software group, Reuter reports.
National, a leading computer chip maker, said that it was going into the
end-user networking market with a set of products which had just been
launched.
Earlier, Microsoft and Cisco Systems of the US announced a similar alliance
to expand networking options for end-users.
Mr Ray Noorda, Novell's chief executive, said that Novell and National would
provide customers with network solutions that set new standards for
technical innovation, compatibility, ease of use, and price.

Dollars 20m

<TEXT>
INLAND Steel of the US is to take a pre-tax charge of about Dollars 20m in
the fourth quarter due to the closure of four coking batteries at the No 2
Coke Plant at the Indiana Harbour Works, Reuter reports.
The batteries' coke ovens, used to bake coal into fuel for ironmaking blast
furnaces, will be shut in December. About 461 hourly workers and 38 salaried
employees will lose their jobs, and the company said they would be eligible
for support services, certain benefits and retirement options.
The four batteries are Inland's only remaining coking facilities. All the
coke battery shutdowns are due to the same combinations of circumstances,
including the inability to meet existing and future environmental
regulations and the decline of the oven performance.
Phillips-Van Heusen, the US clothing and shoes group, will incur a one-time
charge, net of tax, of Dollars 12.2m, or 45 cents per share, for its fourth
quarter ending January 31, as part of its plan to redeem senior debt, Reuter
reports.
The group said it planned to issue Dollars 100m of debentures, due 2023, and
use the proceeds to redeem the company's outstanding 11.2 per cent Senior
Note, due 2002. The note was issued to the Prudential Insurance Company of
America.
With cash from working capital, the proceeds will also go towards redeeming
outstanding 9.93 per cent Senior notes due 1997, issued to Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the company said.
Goldman, Sachs and Company and BT Securities Corporation will be the
underwriters.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: US bank advances to Dollars
48.5m
</HEADLINE>

   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARINE Midland Banks, the US bank which is an indirectly-held, wholly-owned
subsidiary of London-based HSBC Holdings, yesterday reported an increase in
net income in the third quarter, agencies report.
Income for the period advanced to USDollars 48.5m and to Dollars 127.8m for
the year to date. This compares with net income of Dollars 29.9m and Dollars
73.5m for the corresponding periods in 1992.
The bank lifted net interest income to Dollars 189.2m for the quarter, from
Dollars 173.7m last time, mainly because of favourable margins and increased
credit card assets.
Other operating income for the quarter declined to Dollars 50.5m, compared
with Dollars 82m for the same period in 1992.
'This decline is primarily attributable to a one-time gain from the sale of
mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter of 1992, and decreasing
amounts of fee income from securitised credit card assets and mortgage
servicing,' the bank said.
Marine's tier one risk-weighted asset ratio increased to 9.85 per cent for
the third quarter, compared with 9.29 per cent for the third quarter of
1992.
The bank's total risk-based capital ratio was 16.76 per cent in the third
quarter, compared with 17.09 per cent for the third quarter of 1992.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: General Motors to take Dollars
950m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors is to take a Dollars 950m pre-tax charge against
third-quarter earnings to cover additional costs from its programme to close
21 redundant manufacturing plants in North America.
The news came shortly after GM reached a new three-year labour agreement
with the United Auto Workers union which will sharply push up the company's
pension costs, while allowing it more freedom to relocate laid-off workers
to new plants.
The company, which is to report third-quarter figures tomorrow, said the
charge resulted mainly from greater productivity gains than had been
expected when it first made a provision for the plant closing programme.
This meant fewer jobs would be available within the group for workers from
plants that GM was closing, which in turn would push up its job security
costs. Under a long-standing job security programme, GM continues paying its
workers even after they have been laid off.
However, the company said that even with the charge it believed it could
attain its 1993 financial goal for its North American automotive operations
 -to break even before interest, taxes and non-cash healthcare expenses.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, said it had revised its
rating outlook for GM to negative from stable because of the new labour
pact.
It said the reported provisions of the agreement would not bolster the
company's cost-cutting efforts in North America, as had been anticipated.
GM's market share performance had been disappointing in recent quarters, S&amp;P
said.
These factors heightened uncertainty about the company's ability to achieve
meaningful profits in North America, it added.
GM has ended a 28-month search for a strategic partner for its locomotive
group. It said that it could not find potential partners able to offer the
kind of investment needed to enhance the unit, Reuter adds.
The locomotive group, which includes the electro-motive and diesel
divisions, is based in Ontario, Canada, and manufactures locomotives and
defence-related products.
GM first announced that it was looking for a partner for the unit in June
1991.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Battle is joined for HK's
dailies - A report on a new daily paper in Hong Kong, planning to challenge
the South China Morning Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST weeks after millionaire Mr Robert Kuok paid Dollars 349m to Mr Rupert
Murdoch for control of the South China Morning Post (the Post), Hong Kong's
leading English language newspaper, its effective monopoly is to be
challenged. Oriental Press, the most profitable Chinese language publisher
in Hong Kong, is to launch a new English language newspaper, the first in
more than a decade.
Mr Herman Hui, executive director of Oriental Press, said the group would be
able to launch a newspaper by the end of December, but would not proceed
unless it was confident it could break even within 'a few months'. It has
already poached a significant number of journalists from the Post and
appointed an editor.
The launch is linked to the Post's change of ownership, which was seen as a
political move. Mr Kuok is a major investor in China and an appointed
adviser to Beijing on Hong Kong affairs; few believed he would not change
the editorial policy.
By comparison, Oriental Press Group's main newspaper, the Oriental Daily, is
firmly pro-Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten. Its move has been encouraged
by some government officials as a means of encouraging a free press in Hong
Kong.
The group's image as a saviour of free speech is somewhat tainted, however,
by the fact that its founder, Ma Sik-chun and his brother 'White Powder' Ma
Sik-yu, fled the colony for Taiwan in 1977 and 1978, to escape heroin
trafficking charges. The Ma family owns 70 per cent of Oriental Press.
Competition is seen as positive for readers, advertisers and the freedom of
the Hong Kong press, but it could be costly for the shareholders of both
companies.
Stakes are high. South China Morning Post (Holdings) made net profit of
HKDollars 494m (USDollars 63.9m) in the year to June 1993, almost
exclusively from the Post. The daily paper has a readership of only 238,000,
but advertising rates reflect the spending power of its top-flight
readership.
Oriental Press Group made HKDollars 420m in the year to March 1993, and
boasts 1.63m readers - one-third of the entire Hong Kong newspaper market.
Despite supporting Mr Patten's democratic reform programme, the paper is
generally more interested in gossip on the local film industry's starlets.
Most likely victim of the battle is the existing 'second paper', the Hong
Kong Standard. It has failed to break the Post's arm-lock on advertising -
despite under-cutting prices - and it seems unlikely the small market for
English language newspapers can bear three products.
However, it is the Post's readership and advertisers that Oriental is
targeting. The Post has promised a round of pay rises to counter further
staff defections and the new management is keen to counter suggestions that
a change of tack towards Beijing may antagonise existing readers. Mr Kuok
said that the editorial policy would not change and the Post would remain 'a
Hong Kong newspaper dedicated to Hong Kong's best interests'.
Oriental Press would not reveal how expensive its gamble will be. It has the
spare printing and office capacity to operate another newspaper at little
extra cost. It also has a net cash position of around HKDollars 500m, more
than enough to fund the salaries and the enormous launch campaign.
But they are facing a formidable adversary. In the mid-1970s there were four
English language newspapers, but they did little to damage the Post's
earnings stream. It has emerged as one of the world's most profitable
newspapers.
Mr Kuok can afford to be relatively sanguine. His enormous influence in the
local business community will ensure continued patronage for his new
project, whatever the support for the new competitor.
In addition, after 1997 he could expect to be recompensed by the government
for any adverse favouritism shown in Hong Kong's dying days as a British
colony.

THE TURNROUND at American Express engineered by Mr Harvey Golub, chairman,
continued in the third quarter as the financial services group's core
travel-related services business maintained the earnings momentum of the
previous three months.
The group also benefited from Wall Street's strong performance. Its Lehman
Brothers investment banking unit recorded a rise in net income, to Dollars
114m from Dollars 95m the previous quarter, driven by a 77 per cent increase
in its income from making markets and other principal transactions.
Net income at American Express for the three months to the end of September
reached Dollars 430m, or 83 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars
204.7m (after a one-off restructuring charge of Dollars 492m) a year ago.
The figures were lifted by a net benefit of Dollars 23m from the rise in the
US corporation tax rate, which led to a one-off adjustment to deferred
taxes. It said this benefit was offset by costs from the early repayment of
some debt.
Net income in travel-related services rose to Dollars 236m, from Dollars
234m the previous quarter and a loss of Dollars 187m the year before.
Gross revenues fell 2 per cent over the year to Dollars 2.16bn, due to a
fall in the discounts charged to merchants for accepting American Express
cards and a decline in card fees.
However, provisions for credit losses fell by nearly 30 per cent, to Dollars
375m. The number of cards in force continued to fall, to 34.2m from 35.1m a
year before, though the amount of business billed to cardholders during the
period, at Dollars 30.8bn, was up 4 per cent.
Gross revenues (net of interest costs) at Lehman Brothers rose by a third,
to Dollars 885m, as income from principal trading jumped sharply to Dollars
421m.
Investment banking revenues advanced by 34 per cent to Dollars 186m, while
commissions grew by a fifth to Dollars 126m.
Other businesses continued to show improvements in operating performance.
Net income at IDS, the investment management and advisory arm, rose to
Dollars 96m from Dollars 80m on higher fee income, while after-tax profits
at American Express Bank climbed to Dollars 27m from a loss of Dollars 30m
the year before.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shares in JR East soar 57.8% on
debut

<TEXT>
SHARES in East Japan Railway (JR East) soared 57.8 per cent above their
initial offer price when half the company's shares were floated on the Tokyo
stock exchange yesterday.
The stock was finally traded at Y600,000 (Dollars 5,535) a share, after
remaining bid-only all day.
The listing of JR East is the biggest offering of a semi-privatised company
since the Dollars 160bn flotation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1986.
It is a crucial test of the market's strength ahead of flotations for other
government-held companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining six
regional railways.
Brokers hope that the success of JR East will help restore confidence among
retail investors, who have been discouraged by last year's sharp drop in the
price of NTT shares.
Traders said that the rush of buy orders clogged the Tokyo stock exchange's
computers, disrupting the processing of orders.
Two million of the 4m JR East shares held by state-owned Japan National
Railway Settlement were listed yesterday.
TSE officials said that JNR Settlement had to inject more than 500,000 of
its remaining shares into the market to deal with the lack of sellers amid a
torrent of buyers.
Mr Masatake Matsuda, president of JR East, rejected suggestions that the
initial traded price was too high.
He said that he believed the market price had been formed in a fair manner,
based on proper information.
Mr Matsuda said that JR East would maintain an annual dividend of Y5,000.
However, he raised the possibility of a dividend increase, adding that he
would need to compare the company's payout ratio and dividend rate with
those of other listed companies.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco income falls 58%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, manufacturer of Winston and Camel cigarettes, yesterday
unveiled a 58 per cent drop in third-quarter net income.
The sharp decline reflects the impact of price wars with its main rival
Philip Morris, but Wall Street was prepared for the downturn and shares held
steady at Dollars 5 3/8 in early trading.
Net income in the quarter was Dollars 76m, including a one-time gain of
Dollars 2m on sales which fell 11 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. A year earlier,
RJR earned Dollars 175m, including one-time charges of Dollars 70m, on sales
of Dollars 4bn.
RJR's earnings per share tumbled to 4 cents from 13 cents, while operating
income eased 44 per cent to Dollars 431m from Dollars 763m.
The company warned it would take significant charges in the fourth quarter
to cover cost-cutting and other performance improvement measures.
RJR had warned of a 43 per cent shortfall in operating income from US
tobacco operations for the whole of 1993 and the third-quarter results were
exactly as most analysts had predicted.
Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said the company's earnings
showed the direct impact of lower tobacco prices in the US.
Stripping out domestic tobacco results, RJR's third-quarter operating income
from continuing businesses rose 15 per cent.
Overall, the group's tobacco business posted sales of Dollars 1.87bn, down
20 per cent from the Dollars 2.33bn reported in the same period of last
year.
Operating income before amortisation of trademarks and goodwill dropped 46
per cent to Dollars 382m from Dollars 712m.
Internationally, operating income before amortisation of trademarks and
goodwill rose 14 per cent on sales which edged 2 per cent higher.
Gains overseas were more than offset by a 64 per cent plunge in domestic
operating income before amortisation of trademarks and goodwill.
US sales fell 29 per cent. The company blamed a less favourable product mix
and lower overall volume for the erosion, in addition to discounted prices.
The company's food group saw sales rise 6 per cent to Dollars 1.73bn and
operating income for continuing businesses before amortisation of trademarks
and goodwill advance 10 per cent to Dollars 230m.
For the first nine months, RJR earned Dollars 316m, or 23 cents a share,
against Dollars 254m, or 20 cents a year earlier. There were one-time
charges of Dollars 110m in the 1993 period and charges of Dollars 351m in
the same period of 1992.
Sales eased to Dollars 11.1bn from Dollars 11.65bn.

Northern Telecom into loss
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEAK DEMAND and fierce competition in the North American telephone switch
market contributed to a third-quarter loss at Northern Telecom, the Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker.
The Toronto-based company continued to predict, however, that it would
return to the black in the fourth quarter.
Earlier this year Northern announced a reorganisation, including the loss of
about 5,000 jobs. The third-quarter loss of Dollars 33.7m, or 13 cents a
share, compared with earnings of Dollars 116.2m, or 46 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenues slipped to Dollars 1.88bn from Dollars 2.02bn.
Revenues from central-office switches, cable and transmission products all
declined. They were partly offset by 'good growth' in multimedia
communications systems. Order input for the quarter of Dollars 2.34bn was 3
per cent higher, while orders on hand rose by almost a third to Dollars
4.41bn on September 30.
Northern broke a tradition yesterday by not making its chief executive
available to comment on the results. However, Mr Jean Monty said in a press
release that the company was encouraged by growth in its international
business and by strong revenue gains from its fledgling wireless products.
Costs associated with the restructuring, which were taken in the second
quarter, drove the company to a Dollars 984.5m loss in the first nine months
of 1993, compared with earnings of Dollars 283.3m last year.
The third-quarter results were in line with analysts' expectations, and
Northern's share price rose 62 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday
to CDollars 35.50 at midday.

DOMINION Textile, the Canadian-based integrated textile group, improved
profits in the first quarter ended September 30.
The group is also planning to expand globally in denim, interlinings and
non-wovens, its three largest business sectors.
Domtex is completing a USDollars 150m 10-year note issue which, together
with a USDollars 200m standby credit, will bring its debt-equity ratio down
to near its target of 40:60. Later it plans a US equity issue and a
quotation on a US stock exchange.
First-quarter net profit was CDollars 4.5m (USDollars 3.4m), or 8 cents a
share, up from CDollars 3.6m, or 6 cents, on sales of CDollars 301m,
compared with CDollars 295m.
Industrial fabrics did well while interlinings declined slightly. European
industrial non-wovens performed better and the Klopman workwear unit posted
an 11 per cent sales gain, although margins tightened.

BAXTER International, the US heathcare group, and American Healthcare
Systems have signed a five-year agreement expected to be worth more than
Dollars 4bn in Baxter supplies and services for American Healthcare member
hospitals, AP-DJ reports.
The agreement renews a five-and-a-half-year agreement signed in August 1988
and represents an increase of about 60 per cent over the Dollars 2.5bn
purchases of Baxter products made by American Health Systems hospitals
during the previous five years.
American Healthcare, based in San Diego, California, represents more than
1,000 healthcare facilities in 47 states. The new deal covers a wide range
of products, including Baxter's entire range of medical and surgical
supplies, cardiovascular devices, and diagnostic instruments and reagents.
Baxter provides intravenous fluids and related products under a separate
five-year agreement signed in 1991. That is expected to result in purchases
of up to Dollars 500m in Baxter intravenous products over the course of the
contract.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Price rises help reinforce
recovery at US Steel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of US steel makers in pushing through price rises this year,
together with stronger demand for their products, helped reinforce the
recovery at US Steel, the country's largest producer, in the third quarter.
The company reported net income of Dollars 36m, or 44 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 28m, or 48 cents, a year ago.
Continuing turnround at US Steel helped parent company USX report after-tax
profits for the period of Dollars 66m, compared with a Dollars 4m loss in
the same period in 1992.
Raw steel production rose by 8 per cent to 2.8m tons. At this level, US
Steel said it was operating at 95 per cent of capacity, compared with 88 per
cent a year before.
With higher prices, sales rose by 12 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.4bn.
The figures were flattered by the change in the US corporate tax rate, which
led to a one-off addition to income of Dollars 20m.
This was largely offset by a further Dollars 14m charge for interest expense
relating to a litigation judgment made earlier this year and against which
the company is appealing.
USX also benefited from a 25 per cent rise in net income at Marathon Group,
its oil subsidiary, to Dollars 30m or 10 cents a share. The figures were
held back by one-off charges, in part to reflect the lower market values of
the company's inventory.
Lower oil prices and higher margins in refining led to a sharp increase in
operating income in the company's downstream operations from Dollars 24m to
Dollars 146m.
Exploration and production activities recorded an operating loss of Dollars
9m, compared with a profit of Dollars 43m as a result of Dollars 4 fall in
oil prices over the year.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: P&amp;G posts earnings of Dollars
670m
</HEADLINE>

   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, yesterday reported a 10
per cent increase in first-quarter net earnings, with volume growth and cost
cutting outweighing lower prices and unfavourable exchange rate movements.
The group reported net earnings of Dollars 670m, or 95 cents a share, on net
sales of Dollars 7.56bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 610m, or 86
cents, on sales of Dollars 7.88bn in the same period of last year, excluding
special 1992 items. The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street
expectations.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said that 'despite challenging market conditions
in many parts of the world, the quarter produced broadly-based volume growth
by sector and geography, with good balance between established and new
brands.
'Efforts to improve value for consumers are receiving good response, and
several new brand initiatives have been productive.'
The company said important factors contributing to the rise in earnings were
strong unit volume growth in the US and international markets, lower costs
that more than offset the impact of lower pricing, and lower interest costs.
Unit volume was up 6 per cent, excluding the company's discontinued juice
and pulp operations.
On a constant exchange rate basis, net earnings would have been up 17 per
cent on a year ago. Excluding exchange rate changes and divestitures, sales
revenues would have been up 5 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Chevron operating profit up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OIL price fall helped boost operating profits at Chevron in the third
quarter, as higher margins on refined products more than offset the impact
of lower prices on exploration and production activities.
One-off charges of Dollars 145m - mainly related to the rise in the US
corporate tax rate - led to a fall in net income to Dollars 420m, or Dollars
1.29 a share, from Dollars 467m or Dollars 1.37 a share the year before.
Before special items, net income in both periods jumped to Dollars 565m from
Dollars 410m.
US refining and marketing income climbed to Dollars 164m, from Dollars 69m,
while earnings overseas were up from Dollars 19m to Dollars 50m.
Lower oil prices accounted for most of the improvement. Mr Ken Derr,
chairman and chief operating officer, said the company had cut operating
expenses by 14 per cent over the past two years, equivalent to a saving of
Dollars 1 a barrel.
US exploration and production income fell to Dollars 125m from Dollars 251m
as higher natural gas prices failed to make up for a Dollars 3.94 fall in
the price realised for a barrel of oil.
Unocal, the Los Angeles-based energy group, lifted its third-quarter
earnings to Dollars 70m or 25 cents a share from Dollars 11m or 1 cent a
year ago, boosted by improved West Coast refining and marketing operations,
Reuter reports.
Higher domestic natural gas prices, lower worldwide exploration expense and
lower interest expense contributed to the improved results.
The quarter included a Dollars 14m charge on the effect of the higher
federal tax rate on deferred taxes. The 1992 quarter included a Dollars 32m
restructuring charge. Third-quarter operating earnings from petroleum
exploration and production fell to Dollars 101m from Dollars 121m in 1992,
reflecting lower worldwide crude oil prices and production. Higher domestic
natural gas prices and production and lower exploration expense partially
offset the drop.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Missile merger plan on target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA, the French defence company, yesterday confirmed the claim by Mr Dick
Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace (BAe), that the two companies
were on target to merge their missile businesses by the end of this year.
BAe also confirmed the report, saying that talks between the two companies
had made 'significant progress' and that a deal by the end of the year was
possible.
In an interview published yesterday in Les Echos, the French economic daily,
Mr Evans said that 'we have agreed on the structure of the business and the
range of products' of the planned joint venture.
The aim is for Matra, the defence wing of Matra-Hachette, the
missiles-to-magazines group, to merge with BAe's missile division, in a
joint venture.
Voting rights would be split 50-50, but the ratio of share capital and
management control would reflect a valuation exercise.
This should be completed by the end of this year, Mr Evans said yesterday.
The valuation involves the two companies revealing the state of their
respective order books to each other.
Mr Evans added that the eventual aim of the merger was to create 'a big
European missile group', with other companies like the UK's GEC-Marconi
possibly joining in later.
However, it was only possible to have two founder companies, BAe and Matra,
he said.
Talks by Matra and BAe on merging their missile activities started before
Thomson, the rival French defence electronics group, linked with Shorts, the
Belfast-based aerospace group.

ALLIEDSIGNAL, the US high-technology group, yesterday reported a 24 per cent
rise in third-quarter net income, helped by productivity improvements.
The company posted net income of Dollars 168m, or Dollars 1.19 a share,

<TEXT>
ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, saw profits after financial
items fall 19 per cent to SKr205m (Dollars 25.6m) in the first nine months
as weak conditions continued to affect important markets.
Group sales were up 18 per cent at SKr8.6bn, but excluding currency effects,
they were down by 4 per cent from last year. The rise in third-quarter
profits to SKr67m from SKr55m as well as the weak result in the last quarter
of 1992 led the group to predict a better full-year result, in spite of poor
demand and restructuring costs. It expects a 1993 profit of about SKr300m,
which will be SKr41m higher than last year.
The group said the market had been particularly weak in Spain, Belgium,
Italy, France and Japan in the first nine months.
However, there was some improvement in the UK, Norway and Finland, and a
patchy recovery in the US.
The group is restructuring its Pendaflex and Bensons divisions which both
fell into the red during the period.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swedish opposition to
Volvo-Renault merger mounts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition mounted in Sweden yesterday to Volvo's planned merger of its
vehicle manufacturing with Renault of France in spite of a detailed defence
of its plans published by the company.
For the first time, united trade union support for the deal cracked as 900
civil engineers within Volvo called for the merger to be postponed until
Renault is privatised and a committee representing more than 5,000 white
collar workers decided to use their small shareholding to vote against the
accord at the November 9 extraordinary general meeting on the issue.
At the same time, two influential newspapers voiced their opposition. Mr
Mats Svegfors, editor of Svenska Dagbladet, the respected conservative
daily, wrote that if necessary the government should step in to prevent
Volvo, the country's leading manufacturing group, falling under French
control.
Dagens Industri, Sweden's financial daily, said the merger should be delayed
until 1996, after Renault had been freed from state control. Volvo said
momentum was building up against the merger, but said it was not clear Volvo
shareholders shared this view.
The company circulated a 66-page document to shareholders saying the merger
was a 'logical and necessary extension' of a three-year old alliance between
Volvo and Renault.
It said Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company would be 'an
important cornerstone' in a radically restructured Volvo which would broaden
its interests to include a 100 per cent share in the cash-rich Branded
Consumer Products, part of Procordia, a food and pharmaceutical group
jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish state.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, insisted Volvo would retain a large
influence in the merged Renault-Volvo company in spite of the 65 per cent
weighting in favour of French interests. He said Mr Lennart Jeansson, head
of Volvo cars, and Mr Karl-Erling Trogen, head of Volvo Heavy Trucks, would
respectively become chief financial officer and head of trucks and buses in
Renault-Volvo on a five-man management board headed by Mr Louis Schweitzer,
the Renault chief executive. Mr Gyllenhammar said Renault was making the
biggest foreign investment in Sweden, and was hardly likely to damage this
by running down Volvo's Swedish base.
In a typically stirring evocation, he said Volvo would be contributing to
the process of building Europe. 'We have to realise that such work requires
both giving and taking,' he said.
Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders association, which has led
opposition to the merger, dismissed the Volvo leaflet, saying it gave no
clearer picture of the valuation of Volvo's assets in the merger. It
repeated its view that Volvo had no guarantees that Renault would be
privatised.
'There is no certainty that there will be any privatisation before the next
(French) election,' said Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, head of Aktiespararna.
Analysts in Stockholm said that Volvo had not laid to rest the main concerns
over the merger. But they continued to doubted whether the large
institutional shareholders, who will decide the issue at the EGM, would see
any viable alternative.

MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, is to inject FFr2bn
(Dollars 357m) of capital into its French manufacturing division before the
end of the year.
The capital increase will be achieved through a restructuring of
shareholding arrangements between the group's financial and French
manufacturing divisions and will not involve the raising of capital from
outside the group.
The proceeds will be used to reduce debt at the manufacturing operation
which has suffered from a sharp decline in demand in the European tyre
market. The group as a whole, which had a first-half net loss of FFr3.19bn,
has net debts of about FFr30bn.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, yesterday announced a
deeper loss for the first nine months but it signalled that a turnround was
imminent.
Losses after financial items widened to SKr709m (Dollars 88.6m) from SKr361m
as weak demand continued to restrain sales growth.
For the second quarter running the group's underlying performance improved.
Excluding a SKr110m charge for future staff cuts, the group's deficit was
SKr130m in the latest three months compared with SKr167m in the same 1992
period.
The company hopes to be back in the black at the operating level in the
fourth quarter or in the first quarter of next year. It said Germany was its
only market where demand was still falling. The UK, Italy and Sweden were
picking up and other European markets stabilising. Conditions in the US and
other markets were improving, it noted.
The more optimistic picture has prompted the group to raise its production
rate.
Sales expanded to SKr21.5bn from SKr20.0bn in the first nine months.
However, after allowing for currency factors and disposal of a unit, they
were down 7 per cent.
Operating losses fell to SKr99m from SKr114m, but the weaker krona helped
push up net financial expenses to SKr610m from SKr247m.
At the group's main bearings and seals unit, sales rose to SKr20bn from
SKr17bn, but the division recorded a loss after financial income of SKr422m,
compared with a SKr119m profit.

<TEXT>
DEN norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday returned its best result
since it was formed out of a merger in 1990 between Den norske Creditbank
and Bergen Bank. The nine-month net profit of NKr699m (Dollars 99.6m)
compared with a NKr2.46bn loss in the same period last year. The group
forecast a net profit of at least NKr1bn for the year.
The turnround was due mainly to a fall in domestic interest rates which
pushed up net interest income by NKr593m to NKr4.01bn due to a fall of
NKr2.81bn to NKr7.77bn in interest expenses. Other operating income - gains
on securities, foreign exchange and other financial instruments - doubled to
NKr2.65bn as operating expenses were cut by NKr241m to NKr3.36bn.
Mr Ole Lund, DnB's chairman, said the crisis had passed for the bank but
that loan losses and the level of non-performing loans remained
unacceptable. Losses on loans and guarantees fell by NKr754m to NKr2.53bn as
the volume of non-performing loans declined by NKr500m to NKr11.6bn.
In the third quarter, loan losses declined to NKr820m from NKr1.17bn in the
second quarter.
The bank aims to lift its core capital through a share issue by the second
quarter of 1994 from a current NKr6.3bn, or 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted
assets, to 5 per cent and then to 6 per cent. The company gave no details of
the planned issue.
The board intends to seek the authority to increase the bank's foreign
ownership quota to a maximum 33.3 per cent under domestic regulations from a
restricted level of 12.5 per cent.
The state has injected about NKr1.68bn in fresh share capital in DnB in the
last three years and holds a 69 per cent stake. The state has supplied
NKr3.5bn in preference capital which could be converted to share capital,
bringing its ownership in the bank to over 80 per cent. The state has
written off an injection of preference capital of NKr1.25bn.
Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, said the market valuation of
the bank indicated the government would be able to recover all of the
capital provided to DnB, 'and possibly more', depending on the bank's share
price when the state offers its DnB shareholding to the public.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Manifesto appeals for revolution
 -Volvo's 66-page document offers a radical restructuring that goes beyond
the proposed merger with Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo seems undeterred by the growing clamour in Sweden over the proposed
merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault. Yesterday, the
group said it was asking its shareholders to approve revolutionary changes
in the shape of the country's biggest and most famous manufacturing group.
The 66-page information leaflet circulated to shareholders contained much
about the Renault deal.
However, it also amounted to the clearest exposition to date of Volvo's
strategy involving a radical restructuring in which the proposed Renault
merger is a vital, but not exclusive element.
When shareholders gather in Gothenburg on November 9 to vote on the Renault
agreement, they will also vote to approve Volvo's terms for acquiring 100
per cent control of Branded Consumer Products, the food and drinks
operations of Procordia, a conglomerate jointly controlled by Volvo and the
Swedish government.
Under a complex deal struck earlier this year with the state, Volvo will
become the sole owner of BCP and hold a minimum 25 per cent interest in
Pharmacia, Procordia's big pharmaceutical operations, after the Swedish
government sells off its Procordia holdings.
If these transactions go ahead, Volvo's profile will be transformed.
Its traditional role as a car, truck and engineering group will become, in
effect, an arms-length investment and its biggest direct involvement will be
in the production of beer and soft drinks, food products and matches.
'A new Volvo group, with considerably improved dividend capacity, will be
formed,' wrote Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, in the leaflet.
'The competitiveness of the automotive operations will increase. Volvo will
gain control over a large, profitable consumer products operation with
development potential, a favourable cash flow and a moderate investment
requirement,' Mr Gyll wrote.
Cash flow and investment costs are two of the important factors behind the
restructuring. Volvo says securing a stand-alone future in vehicle
production would cost up to SKr8bn (Dollars 1bn) in capital investment.
Meanwhile, Volvo has estimated, on a pro forma basis, that in the first six
months of the year the inclusion of BCP would have produced positive cash
flow of SKr400m, compared with a negative SKr200m if only the Renault merger
was envisaged.
However, these arguments have not persuaded those Swedish sceptics who doubt
the strategy of Volvo increasing its role in food and pharmaceuticals and
who remain unconvinced at least by the terms of the proposed merger with
Renault.
Pro-forma income statements in yesterday's leaflet for the merged
Renault-Volvo company show some short-term reasons for this.
Volvo estimated that in the first six months of 1993, Renault-Volvo would
have produced pre-tax profits of FFr320m (Dollars 56.5m) on sales of
FFr119.2bn, scarcely more than the SKr380m in profits Volvo produced on
sales of a little more than one quarter of the merged company.
Volvo quoted a less-than-enthusiastic opinion from Credit Suisse First
Boston that the Renault merger was 'financially reasonable' from the point
of view of Volvo shareholders.
Critics continue to suggest that, in effect, an improving Volvo, which will
have a 35 per cent share in the new company, has been undervalued in the
merger with Renault, which has suffered a sharp decline in profits. They
complained that the information leaflet gave no indication of what values
were put on Volvo's and Renault's respective assets when the deal was
negotiated.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, wrote only: 'It is important to
recognise that short-term fluctuations in results have had little impact on
agreed values.'
The leaflet said Volvo would initially value its 35 per cent holding in the
merged company at SKr22.6bn, but it gave no estimate of the present value
within the existing Volvo structure of the car and truck operations.
Mr Gyllenhammar insisted the share structure meant Volvo 'should have a
major influence on the shaping and destiny of the new company'. But he
offered nothing new on the other important Swedish concern - the present and
future role of the French state in the merged company - beyond repeating his
faith in the French government's commitment to privatise Renault soon.

FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sharp drop at GBL in first half
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF net consolidated profits at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's
second-largest holding company, dropped by 21 per cent because of lower
capital gains.
Net profit was BFr3.99bn (Dollars 114m) for the six months to June, against
BFr5.03bn in the equivalent 1992 period, and BFr6.01bn in the first six
months of 1991.
GBL said there was an increase in income from all its principal holdings,
except for its 20.5 per cent stake in Petrofina, the Belgian oil company.
Consolidated profit before exceptional items and capital gains rose from
BFr2.98bn to BFr3.42bn. Capital gains fell from BFr2.05bn to BFr562m.
The company, headed by Mr Albert Frere, said full-year consolidated profit -
excluding capital gains - should be greater than 1992's BFr6.34bn, of which
capital gains accounted for BFr1.76bn.
GBL's 11.2 per cent stake in Tractebel, the Belgian utility company, is
still the biggest contributor to profit, bringing in net income of BFr557m
(BFr515m) in the first half of 1993.
Biggest increases in income came from indirect holdings in Royale Belge, the
Belgian insurer, which contributed BFr462m (BFr318m), and CLT, the
Luxembourg audiovisual group, which contributed LFr488m (LFr359m).

<TEXT>
PRESSAC Holdings yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in annual profits and
said it was 'reasonably close' to winning a breakthrough order from a
Japanese car manufacturer in the US for its instrument cluster circuit
boards.
The Nottingham-based manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications and
lighting products lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.95m
in the year ended July 31, after an exceptional charge of Pounds 147,000
(Pounds 177,000) relating to redundancies. This was despite a slight fall in
turnover from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 33m.
Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 4.86p.
The final dividend is increased 10 per cent to 1.82p, making a total of
2.57p (2.4p) for the year.
Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said increased demand for cars in the UK had
been more than negated by a severe decline in the rest of Europe.
Excepting telecommunications and specialist engineering, demand fell during
the year.
Pressac has spent more than Pounds 10.3m over the past three years to
improve its production facilities, which increased efficiency and helped
improve market share. Mr Geoff White, chief executive, said it had also
helped the company win new business.
The completion of the instrument cluster circuitry plant in Alabama would
allow the company to penetrate the important Japanese transplant market in
the US.
Pressac was also looking to expand its recently-acquired automotive heated

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hawtal in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT upturn in activity enabled Hawtal Whiting, the Essex-based
automotive design engineer, to move from losses of Pounds 1.38m to profits
of Pounds 402,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30.
Turnover at Pounds 34.5m was 26 per cent ahead of last time's Pounds 27.3m.
The main contributors to the recovery were the North American and German
operations.
The UK, however, remained difficult and was so far showing little signs of
recovery.
The results also benefited from a Pounds 122,000 reduction in interest
charges to Pounds 545,000.
There was a swing from losses of 22.9p to earnings per share of 0.08p.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Betterware's 21% rise fails to impress City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Betterware yesterday fell 23p to 192p, despite the home shopping
company reporting a 21 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, put down his glass and wailed: 'I don't
understand the stock market and I don't suppose I ever will.'
The board, which brought forward publication of the results in a bid to halt
a share price drop from its high for the year of 280p, declared an interim
dividend of 0.65p (0.5p), payable from earnings of 5p (4.29p) per share.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.3m) in the 28 weeks to
September 11 on turnover of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 29.4m), including
door-to-door sales of household products up at Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 23m).
The company's sales force, which now reaches 45 per cent of the population
once every eight weeks, increased by 1,000 to an average of 10,000 with
revenue steady at roughly Pounds 8 per order.
Mr Cohen said he had failed to reassure some in the City about the company's
ambitious plans to expand in continental Europe, although half year sales in
the French operations - launched in 1991 - had exceeded Pounds 1m, giving
trading profits of Pounds 100,000.
Betterware has recently started selling in Spain and is set to move into
Germany in its next financial year.
'We don't seem to be able to reassure them. I am so bloody frustrated,' Mr
Cohen said, crumpling up his napkin.
He was unrepentant about the sale of 13 per cent of his family's then 63 per
cent stake in June which precipitated the fall in the share price.
Yesterday he said firmly: 'I am in the business of owning Betterware shares
in the long term. If the shares continue to drop I will buy them back.'
Operating profits from the main direct selling division expanded 20 per cent
to Pounds 6.99m (Pounds 5.86m), a slower rate than the 23 per cent rise in
sales.
Its other division, a miscellany of consumer products manufacture and coffee
shops held for sale, returned operating profits of Pounds 151,000 (Pounds
140,000) on sales down at Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 6.37m).
COMMENT
Betterware's expansion into Europe comes too late to compensate for a
slowdown in UK sales growth, dropping from 25 per cent year-on-year in the
first quarter to July to 19 per cent for the first half. The Cohen family's
unhappily handled share sale, which opened the way for a bear raid, and
results just below best expectations left the City expecting more than
yesterday's business-as-usual presentation. Analysts shaved pre-tax profit
forecasts to about Pounds 16m from a maximum of Pounds 18m which puts the
company on a multiple of 18.8, roughly in line with the stores sector.

<TEXT>
PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced that it was
preparing a US flotation of some 6,677 US apartments owned by Laing
Properties, a 50:50 joint venture between it and Chelsfield.
P&amp;O said it would next week file a notice with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission for the flotation of the portfolio as a real estate
investment trust.
Analysts estimate the REIT could be worth some Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m).
If Laing retained a 25 per stake as planned, P&amp;O would raise about Pounds
125m to help reduce its net debt. It stood at Pounds 1.9bn for gearing of 84
per cent at last December but it had been cut to around 70 per cent in
September.
The sale would raise funds at a time when cash generation by its other
operations was being hampered by recession.
P&amp;O said Laing Properties Inc would continue to own some 2.7m sq ft of
commercial property, which was part of the dealing portfolio.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Multimedia seeks to raise up to Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MULTIMEDIA Investments, a small Sheffied-based company set up to finance the
production of interactive compact discs for the consumer market by
independent producers, is seeking to raise up to Pounds 3.5m from investors
through a share and loan stock issue.
Mr Michael Mallett, chairman, said 'the market for multimedia products is an
exploding one with very considerable potential. It exists and it is growing
fast.'
Initially the company plans to fund the production discs based on the
Philips CD-i format which enables home users to play interactive games or
retrieve information from a CD-i player plugged into a television set.
The first disc funded by Multimedia Investments is already in production and
is a CD-i version of Cluedo, the popular board game which is being produced
under licence from Waddington Games. Options have also been taken on the
Granada television series, 'Disappearing World' and on the book 'An
Illustrated History of the World.'
While warning that it is not possible to produce accurate predictions in a
market growing at over 40 per cent a year, the company has provided
illustrative financial projections showing pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in
1997.
Investors are being invited to subscribe for units, each consisting of 20
ordinary shares, 80 preference shares and Pounds 900 unsecured loan stock
priced at Pounds 1,000 per unit and the offer is conditional upon the
minimum subscription of 660 units.
The prospectus is available from Multimedia Investments 0742-722272.

In telecommunications, Mr White said opportunities for Pressac's connectors
were starting to materialise in the cable TV market.
In lighting, Mr White said the Masonlite neon component subsidiary was
working with General Motors to develop neon for automotive in-car lighting
and rear lights. This would take Masonlite into the automotive industry for
the first time.
The increase in stocks required to cover the opening of the Alabama factory
was the main reason behind a rise in net borrowings from Pounds 2.9m to
Pounds 5.9m over the year for gearing of 41 per cent.
However, group borrowings related to trading activities are expected to fall
during the current year.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Monarch Resources placing raises Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Monarch Resources fell 8p to 159p after the London-quoted gold
company with operations in Venezuela announced a placing of 2m new shares to
raise Pounds 3m net and a slight increase in interim pre-tax losses from
Dollars 1.87m to Dollars 1.93m (Pounds 1.27m).
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said the losses for the six months to June 30,
equivalent to 0.13 cents (0.128 cents) a share, were attributable to the
Revemin plant, which recorded losses of Dollars 473,000 (Dollars 437,000)
and to 'somewhat higher overhead costs'.
Turnover was Dollars 3.2m (Dollars 3.93m).
The share placing gives Monarch more flexibility to continue its heavy
exploration programme while working on the La Camorra gold mine project.
Carl von Rohrer, a Munich-based fund management group which was also a
sub-underwriter of Monarch's Pounds 19m rights issue in June 1992, is
subscribing for the new shares at 116 1/2 p each.
Mr Beckett said the shares represented about 4.5 per cent of the enlarged
capital but would be spread through various funds.
In spite of unexpected water problems during recent development work, La
Camorra was on budget and on schedule to start operations in June 1994. Mr
Beckett recalled that La Camorra was expected to be one of the world's
lowest-cost gold mines with cash costs of about Dollars 115 a troy ounce.
Mr Anthony Ciali, president, said Revemin's performance had improved
compared with the second half of 1992 when it recorded a Dollars 1.41m loss.
Drilling at the Canaima concession had resulted in indicated resources of
163,000 ounces of gold with 69,000 ounces in the 'inferred resource'
category.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Treaty that may spark a Dutch exodus -
Netherlands investors face a tax threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'half-Dutch' sandwich is going stale; the heady 'mixers' are losing
their fizz. Some of the favourite nourishments in the cupboard of the tax
practitioner are under threat as the process of ratifying a new US-Dutch tax
treaty gathers speed.
The lower house of the Dutch parliament earlier this month approved the
treaty; the upper house will consider it shortly. So too will the Senate
foreign relations committee in Washington DC. Any day an interpretation of
the treaty for senators will be circulated by the US Treasury.
Many British companies will be among those watching the details closely.
'Everybody you speak to now is very nervous,' says Mr Bruce Lassman, head of
the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young in London. 'A large number of
companies may be restructuring after this year.'
Those businesses ceasing to be eligible under the revised treaty will face
increases in US withholding taxes on dividends from 5 per cent to 30 per
cent, and on interest payments from zero to 30 per cent.
The new arrangements are likely to threaten many UK companies which use
Dutch holding companies as what tax advisers call 'mixers'.
They reduce tax payments by offseting tax liabilities from operations in
high-tax and low-tax countries before repatriating it to the UK, since
British tax law does not allow this to take place onshore.
They will be particularly affected by provisions in a protocol agreed last
month between the two governments on Swiss branches of Dutch companies,
which are used for financing.
It permits the US to impose a 15 per cent withholding tax unless income from
Swiss branches is taxed at more than 17.5 per cent.
Currently, finance companies in Switzerland pay only 4 per cent tax on the
income remitted to a Netherlands company, which can then be repatriated to
the UK without any further tax being levied.
Among other companies and individuals affected by the treaty will be those
who have invested in the US through Dutch companies because they have no tax
treaty of their own, such as those from Hong Kong, the Middle East, South
Africa and Latin America.
They have typically invested in the US via a Dutch company, in turn owned by
a Netherlands Antilles company - an arrangement known as a half-Dutch
sandwich. If they invested directly, the US would levy a 30 per cent
withholding tax. The US-Dutch tax treaty reduces that to 5 per cent, and a
Dutch-Antilles arrangement levies just a further 5 per cent, saving them 20
per cent.
The significance of the Netherlands to the international tax industry is
undeniable.
Every year, the country emerges as the third largest investor in the US,
closely behind its much bigger competitors, Japan and Britain. For a country
the size of the US state of Maryland, that would be quite a feat - except
that it includes substantial investments through Dutch subsidiaries as well
as indigenous Dutch companies.
The Netherlands' attraction as a springboard for activities in the US stems
from its 1948 double taxation treaty with the United States, which is among
the oldest still in effect between the world's industrialised countries.
Dutch readiness to forgo taxes on profits, royalties and interest generated
outside the country has attracted many foreign companies.
Now this position is under threat. The treaty has long been a thorn in the
side of US tax authorities, who have spent the last 11 years negotiating a
new document with their Dutch counterparts. The result was initially signed
just before Christmas last year.
The indications are that both the Dutch and the US are keen to press ahead
rapidly with ratification, partly reflecting the tougher line on foreign
corporations voiced by President Clinton. If both governments approve the
treaty by December 1 this year, it could be in force by January 1 1995.
The original 100-page treaty and the related documents released since are
highly complex. 'The question is whether it is twice as long as the next
longest treaty,' says Mr Lassman.
Under the existing treaty, companies merely had to be registered in the
Netherlands to be eligible. Now they will have to meet stringent tests to
prove that they are economically 'rooted' in the country. That means
financing subsidiaries and mailbox companies will almost certainly be
stripped of their benefits.
In general, to remain under the terms of the new treaty companies will have
to show that they are rooted in the Netherlands through one of four
principal justifications:
Ownership. The company must be 30 per cent Dutch owned.
Active trader. It must be a significant trader, through a test such as being
at least a tenth the size of the US business by an average of assets, gross
income and payroll.
Headquarters. It must demonstrate a substantial portion of the overall
supervision and administration of the group, have discretionary authority to
take decisions or have subsidiaries in at least five countries, each
contributing at least 10 per cent of gross income.
Ruling. If it meets none of these tests, the company can still appeal for a
discretionary ruling if it can argue that it was created to obtain benefits
allowed under the treaty.
One way for UK companies to remain within the bounds of the treaty is to
reorganise or restructure by 1995.
'It might seem a long time, but for an entire reorganisation it's actually
quite short,' says Mr Andre Boekhoudt, a tax partner at KPMG Meijburg.
Possible options for UK companies would be to transfer more staff or assets
to the Netherlands, to seek a Stock Exchange listing for their Dutch-based
sub-holding or to acquire industrial or business activities in the
Netherlands and embed them in the existing company.
Mr Lassman says a number of companies have talked about relocating in
Ireland, but that this has little benefit for UK companies. He hears many
others talking about obtaining approval for their existing structures by the
Internal Revenue Service in the US - which cannot take place until after
ratification.
Mr Nicholas Dee, tax director of SmithKline Beecham, views the new treaty
bleakly, even though his Dutch 'mixer' companies do not exploit the existing
treaty with the US. 'It is part of a wider trend of the US attitude to
international tax,' he says. 'If they override these treaties, there is a
real risk of double taxation. Our concern is that this is an example of US
imperialism.'
The effects are not all negative. Dutch companies may face some extra red
tape in establishing their right to invoke the treaty in the first place.
But the US has thrown out at least one important concession in appeasement.
Dutch pension funds may be able to receive dividend and interest income with
no withholding tax, against 5 per cent at present.
ABP, the big Dutch civil servants' pension fund, said the treaty 'could
certainly be beneficial for us', but stressed it was still trying to
understand the details.
For the Dutch economy, the implications are less clear cut. Lawyers,
accountants, banks and trust companies have done a lively business in
advising foreign companies on how to use the Netherlands as a tax-efficient
base.
In the short-term, that activity is likely to increase as companies seek
advice in untangling the implications of the new treaty.
In the long-term, many will remain because of the Netherlands' extensive
network of double-taxation treaties. But there may well also be an exodus of
clients.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O plans flotation of US properties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced that it was
preparing a market flotation of some 6,677 US garden apartments.
The apartments are part of Laing Properties Inc, a 50:50 joint venture
between P&amp;O and Chelsfield.
They were acquired when the two companies staged a Pounds 495m takeover of
Laing Properties in 1990.
The takeover was effected through an investment vehicle - Pall Mall - and in
March 1992 Laing's worldwide portfolio, with the exception of the US
properties, was divid-ed between P&amp;O and Chels-field.
P&amp;O said it would next week file a notice with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission for the flotation of the portfolio as a real estate
investment trust.
REITs, property companies with management, acquisition and development
capabilities, offer investors the opportunity to participate in diversified
portfolios.
Analysts estimate it could be worth some Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m).
P&amp;O said Laing Properties Inc would continue to own some 2.7m sq ft of
commercial property, which was part of the dealing portfolio, and was
expected to hold some 25 per cent of the REIT.
Analysts have said property sales would help P&amp;O to reduce gearing - which
stood at 70 per cent in September - and raise funds at a time when cash
generation by its other operations was being hampered by recessionary
mar-kets.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind rise to Pounds 1.1m at
GBE Intl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GBE International, the engineering equipment company formerly known as
Downiebrae, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.08m for the half year to
June 30, against Pounds 803,000.
The results were the first since the acquisition of GBE in June and were
prepared on a merger accounting basis.
Turnover totalled Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 15m) with acquisitions putting in
Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 14.2m). Earnings per share emerged at 1.37p (1.03p).
Mr Gerald Edwards, chairman, said the outlook for the remainder of the year
was encouraging and he expected further progress to be made. The results of
the enlarged group are biased towards the second half.
The process engineering companies, which were part of the acquisition, had a
good first half and were well ahead of the previous year, the company said.
However, the old Downiebrae divisions incurred losses. Mr Edwards said that
an improvement in trading had recently been experienced.
Operating profits of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 990,000) were struck after losses
from continuing activities of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 42,000). Interest
payable fell to Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 187,000).

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Roxboro to float with Pounds 80.5m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Roxboro, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic
components which is coming to market through a placing and offer for sale,
were priced at 230p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 80.5m.
The issue, which is fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, involves 21.7m
ordinary shares of which 14.1m (65 per cent) are expected to be placed with
institutions; the balance of 7.61m will be offered to the public.
The group will raise about Pounds 11.9m net of expenses from the issue. The
proceeds will be used to repay debt and fund expansion.
Roxboro has forecast sharply higher trading and pre-tax profits for the
current year. Trading profits after central costs, but before exceptional
costs of Pounds 500,000, are forecast to more than double to Pounds 6.5m in
the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 3.1m last year and Pounds 1.8m
in 1991.
Earnings are expected to total 11.6p this year (or 13.3p before exceptional
items). The notional dividend for the current year is forecast at 1.9p.
Dealings are expected to begin on November 9.
COMMENT
Since the management buy-out from Cambridge Electronic Industries Roxboro
has been restructured and refocused away from low-margin commodity
components. The restructuring is now complete and the benefits should begin
to show through next year. Profits will also benefit from the elimination of
interest costs and the growth in sales of new products. Based on current
year forecasts the shares are priced at a multiple of 17.3 - a substantial
discount to others in the sector. This is a solid stock in a growth market
at a reasonable price.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Declining fortunes of Ferranti - The
softly, softly approach to a former force in the defence industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUYER of Ferranti International would be acquiring a mixed bag of
businesses. Today the company is a software house and systems integrator
with a staff of 3,700.
It has a Pounds 200m order book, a pensions surplus of more than Pounds
100m, and shareholders funds of roughly Pounds 55m. It has large accumulated
losses that could be offset against taxation.
Net debt is Pounds 85m.
Perhaps its most successful business is the 50:50 joint venture in sonar
with French company Thomson-CSF, which has a contract to supply sonar for
the UK's Trident nuclear submarine programme.
Ferranti also has an installed base of customers for naval command and
control equipment. Customers include the Royal Navy and the navies of Brazil
and South Korea.
In systems integration, it has a business that has worked on Saudi Arabia's
air defence system and is still awaiting confirmation of a Pounds 100m order
for a similar system for Bahrain.
Finally, it has a series of small suppliers of training services and
components such as fuses for munition.
The dismantling of Ferranti was precipitated in 1989 by the discovery of
huge fraud in International Signal and Control, the US subsidiary which it
bought in 1987.
The bulk of the activities of ISC, a secretive dedence group, had
traditionally been in supplying bombs and security systems in the Middle
East.
Ferranti's merger with ISC in 1987 was hailed as a natural marriage, even if
its motivation for Ferranti was basically defensive. Both companies were
military electronics contractors, but seemed to overlap very little. With 59
per cent of the combined group, Ferranti's control of it was assured.
A new group thus came into being with a market value of Pounds 1bn. It was
hailed as a major force in global defence industries, with 26,000 employees
in a dozen countries and an order book worth more than Pounds 1.5bn.
Two years later, Ferranti revealed it had been the victim of a cleverly
orchestrated fraud. The UK company had paid Pounds 420m for a company which
it later said had zero net worth at the time of the purchase and made no net
profits in the five years before the merger.
Mr James Guerin, ISC's founder, had become deputy chairman of Ferranti. He
is now serving a 15-year sentence for financial fraud and illegal arms
sales.
Discovery of the fraud blew a hole in Ferranti's balance sheet which it has
since been desperately struggling to repair by selling bits of itself -
including parts that were its pride and soul.
GEC picked the prize fruit of the Ferranti empire after the ISC debacle. In
1990, it paid Pounds 310m for Ferranti's radar division.
The business dated back to the Second World War and included the project
leadership for the radar to equip the European Fighter Aircraft.
Last year, GEC-Marconi bought the company's missile business for Pounds 38m.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest accountancy firm, paid Pounds 40m
to Ferranti to settle litigation over the acquisition of ISC, a former Peat
Marwick audit client.
However, when Mr Eugene Anderson became chairman of Ferranti in 1990, it
became clear that the ISC fraud was only part of Ferranti's problem: the
rest of the business was not particularly well-managed either.
For Ferranti, which had been demoralised by government retrenchment, the
1987 merger had been meant to cushion the group against its former
dependency on the UK Ministry of Defence and possible future failure to win
important contracts such as the European Fighter Aircraft radar contract and
the Type 23 frigate command and control system.
Mr Anderson would not criticise his predecessor, Sir Derek Alun-Jones.
Nevertheless, it was clear that he did not think highly of the group's
organisation, the role played by head office, or the supervision of
contracts.
Earlier this month Mr Anderson warned shareholders that Ferranti's
first-half losses were likely to be higher than deficit of Pounds 10.9m in
the corresponding period last year.
He said the company would continue to focus on its priorities of
strengthening the balance sheet by equity injection or through strategic
partnership while seeking to win new orders.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Caird Pounds 25m in the red after
write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRD, the waste management company which has been crippled by a flurry of
acquisitions in the late 1980s, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds
25.1m for the first half of 1993, after exceptional debits of Pounds 22.9m
including a Pounds 17.6m write-down of assets.
The write-down followed a review by Mr David Weir, who replaced Mr Peter
Linacre as chief executive earlier this year.
Caird said a number of the landfill sites bought between 1988 and 1990 were
no longer considered 'commercially viable or capable of development'.
Slower than anticipated disposal of aggregate stocks and non-core assets had
also led to a re-appraisal of market values.
In June Caird said it would not make a payment that month of the dividend on
its convertible preference shares. The group said yesterday it did not
expect to pay a preference dividend on December 31 either.
Caird's ordinary shares fell 4 1/2 p to 7 1/2 p and its preference shares
from 37p to 28p.
Mr Christopher Parker, finance director, said the group would be
concentrating further on its core businesses. Caird now defines this as the
management of landfill sites capable of taking a wide range of domestic and
industrial waste rather than its current portfolio which includes some sites
only licensed to take dry waste.
'The fact is we have spent too much on development of landfill sites in the
last few years some of which we are now going to sell,' said Mr Parker.
The group will also be reviewing plans to develop its incineration projects,
including Renfrew in Scotland where the company is in dispute with the local
authority.
Sales on continuing business fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 8.8m and the
group reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 3.83m profits).
Losses per share worked through at 45.55p (1.81p earnings).
As a result of the write-off, shareholders' funds have fallen to about
Pounds 21m, leaving the company close to 100 per cent geared.
Caird said its strategy had the support of its bankers but that with its
advisers it was seeking ways of strengthing its balance sheet.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies pathfinder forecasts jump to
Pounds 4.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITHO Supplies, which claims to be the UK's largest independent distributor
of printing products, is coming to the market through a placing and
intermediaries offer likely to value the company at about Pounds 50m.
The pathfinder prospectus published yesterday forecasts pre-tax profits
ahead by 27 per cent to Pounds 4.33m, compared with Pounds 3.35m for 1992,
on sales of Pounds 54.7m.
Litho hopes the proceeds will break down into Pounds 15m of new money and
Pounds 12m from sales by existing shareholders. Of the Pounds 12m, some
Pounds 3m should go to the board and employees with Pounds 9m to
institutions led by 3i.
The flotation is likely to reduce both the 53 per cent stake of existing
institutional shareholders and the 47 per cent stake held by the board and
employees, beyond the diluting effect of the new issue.
Mr John Byford, joint managing director and deputy chairman, said the
proceeds would reduce borrowings of Pounds 9.5m.
Litho was formed during a 1991 management buy-out from Pembridge Investments
which acquired various Litho businesses as part of its hostile takeover of
DRG, the printing and publishing group, in 1980.
The company estimated the market for consumable products, the bulk of its
turnover, at Pounds 250m a year and 50 per cent of this is supplied directly
by manufacturers. Litho claims a 40 per cent share of the balance and a
10,000-strong customer base.
The highest paid director will this year receive a salary of just Pounds
34,900, excluding a profit - related bonus of Pounds 62,555.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recession in France curbs Le Creuset
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Le Creuset, the France-based but London-listed maker of cast iron cookware,
announced almost static pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.16m for the six months
to June 30.
Mr Paul van Zuydam, chairman, said progress had been held back by depressed
conditions in France allied to high French interest rates and a relatively
strong franc.
Although turnover advanced to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 17.8m), volumes on cast
iron products were down, particularly in France. However, volumes of
Screwpull wine accessories continued to increase.
Le Creuset recently acquired Germany-based Wolo, which will distribute Le
Creuset and Screwpull products as well as Weber Kettle barbecue grills and
Zyliss kitchen helpers in Germany.
Earnings per share improved to 4.8p (4.6p).

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Income rise at Marine Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARINE MIDLAND, the US retail banking subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, yesterday
reported a 62 per cent rise in net income for the third quarter of the year
to Dollars 48.5m (Pounds 32.1m) against Dollars 29.9m.
The bank made no provisions for loan losses in the quarter after its
non-accruing loans fell to Dollars 430m (Dollars 759.8m). Despite making no
provisions, its ratio of reserves to non-accruing loans increased to 87.3
per cent (74.1 per cent).
Net interest income rose to Dollars 189.2m (Dollars 173.7m), helped by a
rise in credit card assets. Total assets rose by 2.7 per cent to Dollars
16.8bn, and net yield on interest earning assets rose to 4.99 per cent (4.79
per cent).
Other operating income fell to Dollars 50.5m (Dollars 82m) because of a
one-off gain from the sale of mortgage backed securities last time and a
drop in fee income.
The tier one ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets, an important measure
of capital strength, rose to 9.85 per cent (9.29 per cent).

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sunset + Vine shows decline to Pounds
505,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Sunset + Vine, the independent television production company,
declined from Pounds 687,000 to Pounds 505,000 pre-tax over the 12 months to
June 30.
Mr Colin Frewin, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'the continuing state
of flux in the UK television industry.'
He added: 'The impact of the first six months of the new independent
television era, complicated by the new commissioning structure of the ITV
network . . . together with the weakness of the economy had combined to make
growth in the television business a very difficult task.'
Turnover fell from Pounds 4.51m to Pounds 4.13m. Earnings were 6.1p (8.8p).
A proposed final dividend of 2p makes a maintained 3.5p total.
Mr Noel Healy has been appointed managing director. He was formerly a
director with Financiere Indosuez.

17.5m, for the six months to October 5.
Yesterday the shares closed 8p ahead at 226p.

25,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridgend Group blamed a downturn in turnover at its wholesale distribution
offshoot for a fall in profits from Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 25,000 before
tax for the six months to end-June.
The division's sales fell from Pounds 6.32m to Pounds 5.6m leaving group
turnover from continuing operations some 7 per cent lower at Pounds 7.6m.
Operating profits of the sector declined from Pounds 661,00 to Pounds
317,000.
The group has interests in distribution and leisure. It said its investment
programme had 'paid off' and that it had received 'indicative offers' for
certain of its businesses.
As a result, the company expected significant sales in the second half.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.06p (0.7p) and the interim dividend is
reduced from 0.2p to 0.1p.

FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: European Leisure plans debt conversion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Leisure, the disco and snooker hall operator, is planning to
convert some of its debt into a combination of new ordinary and preference
shares, writes David Blackwell.
Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said that negotiations with banks were at an
advanced stage. Details would be announced, along with full-year results,
'sometime next month.'
The group last March reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54,000 on turnover
of Pounds 35.3m for the six months to end-December. Net debt was Pounds
76.6m, giving gearing of 227 per cent. Distributable reserves were
inadequate to pay dividends.
Mr Rock said that the restructuring proposals were not a crisis move. The
group already had in place banking facilities to the end of next July.

FT  27 OCT 93 / On derivatives, conjurors and rocket scientists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When derivatives come out of the rocket scientist lab into the domestic
retail market journalists start to get edgy. We do not believe in magic,
although we do know there are some clever conjurors around.
A few weeks ago I expressed reservations about the promises attached to some
of the high income retail savings products being launched in the UK to
attract income-starved investors. One of them, the Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial
Higher Income Plan, yielding 10 per cent, has attracted about Pounds 400m
since March.
Its success has triggered the arrival of a similarly structured rival from
Morgan Grenfell. Briefly, this scheme works by leveraging its income through
writing options. Just over half the assets are invested in UK blue chip
equities, the rest in loans. On top of the resulting overall 5 per cent
yield, the fund can generate 6 or 7 per cent a year by taking in premium
from over-the-counter options - puts and calls - against its portfolio. It
thus loses much of any capital growth, but buys other options to protect
itself against general market falls.
This is an ingenious arrangement, but it looks more like a trading operation
than an investment portfolio. What are the risks? Even if they are well
designed, derivatives trading programmes can fall foul of poor liquidity or
counterparty risk. I asked Morgan Grenfell the source of the OTC options,
and was told that the fund managers had signed a confidentiality agreement.
So much for transparency.
In fact there need be no secret. The options are being created by the equity
derivatives unit of Swiss Bank Corporation in London; effectively, this
bank's wholesale market services are being turned into retail products by
Hypo F &amp; C, Morgan Grenfell and others.
An earlier range of retail products focused on guarantees of various kinds -
for instance, that the FT-SE 100 Index would be at least matched at some
date in the future - but falling interest rates have made it more difficult
to design attractive guaranteed products, which have relied on using income
to buy derivatives contracts. At the same time, however, an opportunity to
launch high income products has arisen, using derivatives to generate the
kind of yield now so sorely missed by savers in deposit-taking institutions.
Innovation may only just be beginning. On the wholesale market SBC lists 15
varieties of equity option contracts, including as-you-like options,
exploding options and deferred strike options. But how reliable is all this?
Extensive backtesting investigations are conducted into how products such as
the Hypo F &amp; C fund would have performed historically. Apparently it would
have sailed through the 1987 crash quite happily. But the future will always
spring more surprises than the past.
The doomsters are easy enough to find. The Bundesbank last week reflected
gloomily on the possibility of a chain reaction leading to disaster if
problems in derivatives were to lead to a collapse of liquidity in the cash
markets. Earlier in the month Mr Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street analyst,
warned about poor standards of regulation and unwarranted complacency about
the real level of risks in derivatives. European central banks, he pointed
out, have been generating vast profits for private sector participants in
the derivatives markets through their clumsy mistakes in the foreign
exchange markets, especially in 1992, but just suppose it had been the other
way around?
In practical terms, investors in innovative retail products are scarcely
exposed to apocalyptic risks, merely to the possibility that the income may
turn out to be less than expected, or the danger that allegedly 'unusual'
conditions may cause a few points of loss of capital.
The derivative markets are now vast, but are still quite immature. Their
complexity invalidates the old adage that you should only put your money in
(or report on) investments you understand. Moreover the proprietary nature
of the product designs based upon OTC contracts means the propositions are
becoming increasingly opaque, even to experts.
We just hope that the rocket scientists will not reinvent the nuclear bomb
by accident.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Lamont joins Philippine trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer and recent arrival
on the board of NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, is expanding his list
of non-executive directorships in an unexpected direction.
Mr Lamont is joining the board of the First Philippine Investment Trust, one
of the stock market's most successful trusts last year but capitalised at
only Pounds 32m.
He is joined as non-executive director at First Philippine by another
ex-finance minister, Mr Ramon del Rosario of the Philippines, who also had a
rough ride before retiring.
Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall that manages the trust, called
Mr Lamont's decision 'enterprising' and based on the former chancellor's
view that the Philippines would enjoy a rapid rate of growth.
Mr Lamont had identified the Philippines as a market that would 'catch up'
with other south-east Asian markets, Mr Duffield said. The First Philippine
Investment Trust was the eighth-best performing trust in the London market
last year.
Before pursuing a political career full-time, Mr Lamont worked in the
investment side of NM Rothschild where Mr John Craig, who is now
vice-chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, was then head of banking.
Mr del Rosario was chosen as finance minister by President Fidel Ramos and
served for more than a year, but his appointment was rejected by Congress as
some claimed he slavishly followed the International Monetary Fund's
prescription for the country's economic ills.
Mr Andres Soriano, chairman of the First Philippine Investment Trust will
resign as part of the board reshuffle. Also resigning are Mr Craig, Mr Peter
Chesterfield of joint investment manager, Abbey Life Investment Services,
and Mr Francisco Dizon of AB Capital and Investment Corp.
Mr Soriano heads San Miguel Corporation, the Philippines' largest
conglomerate with interests from beer to food.

MR TONY RYAN's compensation could total Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) for loss of
office from GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company being rescued from
bankruptcy by GE Capital, of the US.
The proposed pay-off so outraged some GPA shareholders that they threatened
to veto the deal. In response Mr Ryan agreed the payment should go to
arbitration by a Queen's Counsel.
He is leaving the Shannon-based company he founded in 1975 to become
chairman of the GE Capital subsidiary, GE Capital Aviation Services, which
will manage GPA's assets.
His contract as chairman and chief executive of GPA, which runs until the
July 1996, provides for an annual salary of not less than IPounds 250,000
(Pounds 240,380). Pension contributions and compensation for loss of office
are understood to take the total package to Dollars 2m.
However, some shareholders, threatened to withhold their support from the GE
agreement unless Mr Ryan's compensation was settled by a third party. GPA,
saddled with debts of Dollars 5.8bn, has seen the value of its shares
collapse from a high of Dollars 32 to less than Dollars 1.
The pension fund of the teachers of the state of Pennsylvania - the Public
School Employees' Retirement system (Psers) - which two years ago subscribed
to a preference share with a conversion price of Dollars 36, was
particularly incensed.
Mr John Lane, Psers' chief investment officer, yesterday said 'it remains to
be seen' whether Mr Ryan would get his Dollars 2m.
However, many of the group's banks are resigned to Mr Ryan receiving the
whole amount. One banker said: 'The question of Mr Ryan's compensation
caused a lot of unease among shareholders but his contract clearly
stipulates that he is owed Dollars 2m.'
A GPA spokesman said: 'The matter is still being decided by arbitration.'
Two other GPA directors, Mr Colm Barrington and Mr James King, are
transferring to equivalent jobs at GECAS, but will not receive compensation.
Mr Ryan's pay-off is no longer threatening the GE deal, which GPA hopes will
be signed by the end of the month.

FT  27 OCT 93 / IBM cost-cutting checks losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at International Business Machines were lower than expected in the
third quarter, as revenues stabilised and cost-cutting began to take effect.
Nonetheless, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The
company's cost and expense structure remain uncompetitive. During the third
quarter, aggressive internal taskforce work took place to identify
additional areas where our costs can be reduced.'
IBM could return to profitability 'as our gross margins increasingly match
those of the rest of our industry. I am confident IBM is on the right
track,' he said.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 48m (Pounds 32.4m), or 12 cents per
share, better than analysts' predictions. Earnings were boosted by a Dollars
34m tax benefit. In the period last year IBM reported a net profit of
Dollars 86m, or 15 cents a share, before restructuring charges, but a loss
of Dollars 2.8bn, or Dollars 4.87 per share, after them.
The decline in revenues was halted with the company making Dollars 14.7bn,
similar to the second quarter. IBM said strong personal computer sales and a
slower rate of decline in mainframe computer sales had helped stabilise the
figure. 'Although our overall results are clearly unsatisfactory, the third
quarter included some encouraging signs,' Mr Gerstner said.
Sales of computer hardware fell just 1 per cent on last year's third quarter
at Dollars 6.96bn. Analysts had predicted a decline of about 10 per cent.
But revenues from rentals and financing fell 14.2 per cent to Dollars 1bn,
and software revenues also declined. These trends reflected the impact of
declining mainframe computer sales on IBM's business. Service revenues rose
26.5 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn.
IBM's third-quarter gross profit margin was 38 per cent, down from 46.1 per
cent. 'We believe our gross margins will continue to be under pressure,' Mr
Gerstner said. The squeeze was felt in both personal computers and services,
two high revenue growth segments.
Similar trends have taken their toll on other US computer makers. Last week
Digital Equipment reported heavy losses and Amdahl expects a substantial
loss. Apple Computer also saw gross margins fall sharply.
IBM's operating expenses fell 11.8 per cent as the company continued to shed
workers. The staff totalled about 267,000 at the end of the quarter, down
41,000 from a year earlier. By the year-end the company plans to cut back to
255,000 workers.
Revenue for the first nine months was Dollars 43.3bn, down 3.7 per cent from
Dollars 45bn. Net losses before restructuring charges were Dollars 373m, or
70 cents per share. After charges the loss was Dollars 8.4bn. In the same
period last year, IBM reported net earnings, before charges, of Dollars
1.5bn or Dollars 2.56. After charges, losses were Dollars 1.4bn or Dollars
2.46.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Thames Water hit by Pounds 25m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Water yesterday surprised the market with lower than expected interim
profits, depressed by Pounds 25m of charges to cover two long-standing
contractual disputes.
The group, which had brought the announcement forward by a week, reported a
10 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112m for the six months to
September 30. Excluding the provisions, profits were 10 per cent up on sales
of Pounds 539m, a 7 per cent advance.
While the market was surprised by the charges, marking the shares down 13p
to 561p, analysts warned against taking them out of context in a company
with sales of Pounds 539m. 'The core business is excellent,' said one
analyst. 'Today's shenanigans have masked that.'
Next week's review of pricing in the water sector by Ofwat, the industry
regulator, would be more crucial for the market.
The charges, a small proportion of which applied to restructuring in the US,
are believed to cover two water treatment plants in Egypt. Thames acquired
the contracts when it purchased PWT in 1989 as part of its diversification
away from regulated utilities.
Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive, admitted that PWT's contract management
had been deficient. About six employees had since left the company.
Mr Hoffman was unapologetic about Thames's diversification strategy, on
which it had spent some Pounds 120m. 'If we had sat back and stayed with
utilities we would be heroes,' he said, 'but there would be no growth. This
is for the longer term.'
During the half-year, Thames cut Pounds 2m in staff costs helping utilities
show an 18 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 159m, on sales 9
per cent higher at Pounds 432m.
However, the non-regulated activities were less buoyant. Contracting and
international businesses incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 29m, after the
Pounds 25m charge, partly due to tough trading in Germany and the US.
Products and services slid to a Pounds 1.8m loss from a Pounds 400,000
profit, while environmental services lost Pounds 300,000. Property and
insurance profits rose from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.8m.
Earnings per share fell 11 per cent to 26.8p. The dividend was increased 7
per cent to 7.4p.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Clarke faces cabinet battle over planned spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was braced last night for a full-scale battle over public
spending at tomorrow's cabinet meeting after a committee of senior ministers
recommended deep cuts in Whitehall budgets for local authorities, defence,
housing and transport.
A partial retreat by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, over cuts in the
armed services appeared to defuse a threat by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, to demand a fundamental review of Britain's security
commitments. But Mr Rifkind will take to full cabinet his opposition to the
cuts still being demanded by the chancellor.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has resisted demands for
means-testing child benefit, but has accepted tougher rules for invalidity
benefit, a squeeze on housing benefit and cuts in mortgage interest payments
to unemployed homeowners.
He is also battling Mr Clarke over compensation for the elderly and poor to
offset the impact of value added tax on domestic fuel. The chancellor has
rejected proposals for a generous package and wants to limit compensation to
those below income support levels.
Mr Clarke finalised yesterday the recommendations of EDX, the cabinet
committee charged with reconciling the competing claims for resources from
Whitehall departments with a commitment for a freeze on overall spending in
real terms. The EDX report meets the remit set in July of an effective
freeze in real terms in overall spending for the next three years.
Mr Clarke wants an agreement to undershoot the Pounds 253.6bn ceiling for
1994-95 by up to Pounds 1bn. The aim would be to convince backbench Tory MPs
that tax increases in next month's Budget were not a substitute for harsh
decisions on public spending. But senior ministers said yesterday that two
months of discussions within EDX had failed to achieve anything resembling a
firm settlement. The final deal will have to be hammered out by tomorrow's
cabinet and, possibly, in a second session next week.
Mr Rifkind will be joined in a call for more favourable treatment by Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, and Mr David Hunt,
the employment secretary.
But whatever the outcome, local authorities cannot expect any real increase
in the Pounds 41bn they should spend this financial year, while housing
associations will be the main victim of large cuts in the Pounds 8bn a year
housing budget. Mr MacGregor faces a sharp reduction in both his
road-building and rail budgets. Mr Rifkind is resigned to cuts of around
Pounds 1bn by 1996-97 in the Pounds 23bn defence budget.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Chretien vows to untie Canada's rival factions:
Conservatives banished to political wilderness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean Chretien, Canada's incoming prime minister, pledged yesterday to
work for national unity in the wake of stunning gains by two fledgling and
potentially divisive regional parties in Monday's general election.
The election transformed Canada's political landscape like no other in its
126-year history. Mr Chretien's Liberal party won a landslide victory,
gaining 178 out of 295 seats in the House of Commons. But the strong
performance by the two regional parties - the separatist Bloc Quebecois, and
the Reform party, whose main strength is in western Canada - could increase
strains between English and French-speaking Canadians.
Two of Canada's traditional three national parties suffered devastating
setbacks at the polls, as voters sought a change from the tough economic
times of recent years. One political organiser estimated that at least 40
per cent of the electorate voted for a party which they had never before
supported.
The Progressive Conservatives, who have held office since 1984, won only two
seats in the new parliament, in spite of gaining 16 per cent of the popular
vote. The Tory vote was split in many constituencies by Reform, allowing the
Liberal candidate to come up the middle.
Ms Kim Campbell, who took over as Conservative leader and prime minister
four months ago, was defeated in her Vancouver constituency. Under party
rules, a new leadership convention must take place within a year. Ms
Campbell is not expected to stand for re-election.
The BQ, which won 54 seats, will form the official opposition. Mr Lucien
Bouchard, its leader, said in his victory speech that 'the Bloc will be
positive and responsible in parliament, while vigorously pursuing
sovereignty for Quebec'.
The Reform party, which opposes official bilingualism and other concessions
to Quebec, gained 52 seats, the bulk in Alberta and British Columbia. The
left-of-centre New Democratic party held only eight of its 44 seats.
Mr Chretien said he understood the frustrations which led voters to support
the BQ and Reform. He pledged to 'try to bring us together by appealing not
to what divides us, but what unites us'. The Liberals won seats in all 10
provinces.
When Ms Campbell took office the public initially warmed to her, but her
intelligence and glamour were offset by political inexperience. While Ms
Campbell emphasised the painful message of deficit reduction on the campaign
stump, the experienced Mr Chretien brought a more reassuring message of job
creation.
Mr Chretien promised that one of his first acts on taking office would be to
cancel a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.8bn) order for 50 military helicopters
built by the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy. The UK-Italian
consortium, its local contractors and the Canadian military are lobbying to
include the purchase in a wider review of defence policy.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Israel to sign energy contracts with Arab neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL says it is in the process of agreeing multi-billion dollar energy
projects with Arab partners which will revolutionise its domestic energy
sector.
It claims that the agreements will mark a turning point in economic
relations between Israel and the Arab world.
Israeli officials and businessmen say Israel will sign an agreement with
Qatar within the next six weeks to start work on a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds
1.2bn) natural gas project which involves the supply of natural gas to
Israel, and the use of Israel as an export terminal for Qatari gas across
the Mediterranean to Europe.
The project was said to have been agreed during secret talks in New York and
Qatar in August and September followed by three meetings in Israel.
Qatar, which has not confirmed the deal, could face regional hostility to
any such agreement, in particular from Iran. Ten days ago, the two countries
formed a joint committee to liaise on the development of oil and gas
projects. Iran remains bitterly opposed to Israel and to the peace deal
struck with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
At the same time, the Israeli Merhav group of companies, owned by Mr Yossi
Maimon, said it had agreed a Dollars 950m joint venture with a private
Egyptian company - the biggest Israeli-Arab joint venture by far - to build
an oil refinery at the Egyptian free trade zone of Alexandria. The project
is said to have been authorised by the Egyptian national investment
authority.
Both projects, which are dependent on favourable feasibility studies, have
been the subject of secret negotiations for months but were accelerated by
the Israeli-Palestinian outline peace agreement signed in Washington last
month.
Israeli officials and businessmen say the two projects mark the beginning of
a 'New Middle East' where Israel will emerge as a main business partner and
a regional centre for Arab trade to Europe.
According to Israel, Qatar has pledged to supply the Israeli market with
natural gas for 25 years. Israel needs 6.7m tonnes of oil equivalent a year
to convert its electricity generation from coal and oil to gas. Israel is
also looking for cheaper sources of energy to supply its petrochemicals
industry in the Negev desert.
Qatar is said to have agreed to pay Dollars 1m for a feasibility study which
would look at a number of options. One is to build a gas pipeline from Qatar
to the Israeli port of Ashkelon, where Qatar will also construct a gas
liquefaction plant. Another possibility would be to ship gas to the Israeli
Red Sea port of Eilat and then by pipeline to Ashkelon.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect, Ferranti's fate was sealed when it signed the deal with
International Signal in 1987, though the end of the cold war and low oil
prices have delivered the coup de grace. So why should anyone be prepared to
take on the company's substantial debts at this stage? There are some
businesses within Ferranti which are worth having - notably the naval sonar
operation. That is worse than buying a shop to get a can of baked beans.
Perhaps GEC or Thomson might wish to curry favour with the Ministry of
Defence by rescuing one of its contractors, which looks like an expensive
favour unless Ferranti's tax losses or pension fund surplus can be made to
work for the bidder.

The Arthur Daley character employed in the Leeds' commercials has, it seems,
been stung by National &amp; Provincial's bee. The differences in culture
between the two building societies proved irreconcilable. Given the proposed
merger was born of desire rather than desperation, it was wise to call a
halt before it grew too serious. The merger's rationale depended on some
painful rationalisation, which could only have worked had there been
complete harmony of purpose. Leeds will resume its search for a chief
executive and, perhaps, for a new merger partner. It seems likely to settle
for a more conventional manager than Mr David O'Brien and a less risky
partner than N&amp;P.

FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The relationship between Volvo and Renault was originally conceived as an
equal partnership, so the irritation of some of Volvo's small shareholders
at getting a mere 35 per cent of the merged company is understandable. The
intervening three years may have seen Volvo's position deteriorate, but the
benefits of cost cutting and krona devaluation are just starting to show.
Meanwhile, Renault is hurtling headlong into the continental car pile up.
Volvo's management may argue that Renault's recent poor profit figures
should not determine the shape of the merger, but at least part of Volvo's
misfortune is equally short term.
For all their ire, Volvo's small shareholders are unlikely to force better
terms. This far, Volvo has had the better of the deal, since it has reaped
Renault's economies of scale in car component sourcing. Nor, given the
astronomical cost of model development, is it credible for Volvo to continue
alone forever. The merger is Volvo's least bad alternative.
Whether the expanded group can be made to work is, however, another
question. Most of the planned cost savings would have been achieved without
merger. Now they must be carried through at the same time as the
organisations are combined and pruned. There is justified suspicion that
deeper cuts and more rationalisation will follow if Renault-Volvo is to
avoid dis-economies of scale. Handling that integration is a real management
challenge, and the history of automotive mergers from British Leyland
through Fiat Lancia to Peugeot Talbot can hardly encourage the newlyweds.

FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Thames Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames's concern for speedy disclosure of provisions at its PWT contracting
arm rings a little hollow. True, its interim results were bought forward by
a week, but it has taken four years to uncover the extent of the problem.
The last annual report contained a passing reference to a contract which
remained in dispute. Before that, investors were offered assurances that
difficult contracts acquired with PWT in 1989 had been sorted out. The
acquisition looked of doubtful merit even before yesterday's provisions.
With contract losses added back, Thames has paid more than Pounds 40m for a
business with sales of Pounds 150m, peak margins of under 5 per cent and
considerable risks.
Red ink on a lesser scale in Thames' other unregulated businesses does not
inspire confidence in management's ability to turn the contracting side
around. The comfort is that Thames' regulated water business is performing
well. Demand for water from industry remains depressed by recession, but
costs look well under control. In theory, losses outside the core water
business should not worry Ofwat, the water industry regulator, so long as
capital to finance building sewerage works is ring-fenced.
Yet losses anywhere in the group will increase the cost of equity capital -
as yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Thames' shares underlines. The long-run
impact is difficult to measure, but one wonders whether the episode will
encourage Ofwat to look again at the handsome payments made by the regulated
utility businesses to the quoted parent companies which help finance such
diversification.

FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Declarations of interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest CBI figures suggesting the manufacturing recovery is faltering
may not be as worrying as they seem. It is understandable that orders and
output have flattened now that the initial benefits of sterling's
devaluation, interest rate cuts and stock replenishment have run their
course. Growth is still likely to prove more robust this year than most
forecast at its outset.
Still, fears that the downturn in mainland Europe would take the spring out
of the step of UK manufacturers have proved well founded. That suggests
there is room for further interest rate cuts, and there seems little in the
inflation outlook to prevent it, as the CBI was quick to point out.
Growth in unit costs has all but ground to a halt while output prices
continue to fall. Domestic markets have remained highly competitive,
maintaining the squeeze on margins. But then, inflationary pressures are not
proving as subdued outside the manufacturing sector. Yet it is doubtful
whether a cut in UK interest rates and a lower pound would do much to
improve manufacturing prospects. Given the problem largely lies in mainland
Europe, further cuts from the Bundesbank would surely be more efficacious.
It therefore seems ever more likely that the Chancellor will plump for the
do-little option in the November Budget. A shaving of interest rates and
modest tax rises would appear to represent the line of least resistance -
uncomfortable though this stance may be for such a habitual political
bruiser.

Among the improvements it has instituted as a result of 'patient/user' feed
back is the re-introduction of the title Matron. And what was the incumbent
called before? 'Director of nursing services and quality' says a hospital
spokesman. All that award-winning work notwithstanding, 'lots of patients
hadn't realised what that was'.

The demise of brand-name consumer goods at the hands of generic brands may
be on every marketing guru's lips these days, but the response by Kellogg's
and Coca Cola to the Toronto Blue Jays' victory in the World Series baseball
championship shows that the old brand-name giants have not altogether lost
their touch.
Within minutes of the Blue Jays hitting the winning home run at midnight
last Saturday, the two companies' Canadian subsidiaries were pulling out the
stops to bring out special 'commemorative' versions of Rice Krispies packets
and Coca Cola cans.
Kellogg's plant in London, Ontario, worked all day Sunday to print special
Rice Krispies boxes with a congratulatory message to the Blue Jays,
embellished with highlights and statistics of the 1993 season. The first of
120,000 cartons were on supermarket shelves soon after lunchtime on Monday.
Coca-Cola had designed its special World Series cans long before the final
game. All that remained was to emboss the score, together with those of the
previous five World Series games, on the side. The first of 3m cans was
filled on Sunday.
Both companies expect their 'limited editions' to sell out within a week or
two. But how many cereal eaters or cola drinkers will transfer from rival
brands?

Spotting that the London Stock Exchange news service, which the Financial
Times receives via a direct feed to its Reuters terminal, was offering
unusual opportunities for insider trading, Observer rang the exchange.
The fact that announcements timed 11.15 am were arriving at 10.15 am was not
the market's fault, sniffed an official who confirmed that its electronic
clocks had most certainly been wound back to Greenwich Mean Time over the
weekend. The query was referred to Reuters.
'The time codes on your terminal are user-configurable,' the global
information services company pointed out helpfully, which roughly translated
means that you are supposed to twiddle a knob to tune in with whichever of
the world's 24 time zones you happen to be in. 'People forget we are not
just in the business of supplying systems to Surbiton,' an unsympathetic
Reuters spokesman added.

It seems that time is not healing the wounds inflicted when John Major
sacked his former chancellor Norman Lamont.
Last night the prime minister hosted a farewell dinner at No 10 for the
recently retired Bank of England governor Lord Kingsdown and his wife. Among
those invited, naturally enough, were the full complement of former
chancellors with whom the then Robin Leigh- Pemberton worked during the
1980s.
Lord Howe accepted gracefully, while Lord Lawson conveyed his apologies,
explaining he would be travelling in South Africa. Lamont, according to
Downing Street, simply made it clear that under no circumstances would he
sup at Major's table.

Is Silvio Berlusconi about to form a political party? Judging by Italy's
media, or that part which he does not control, Berlusconi has already taken
the decision to enter the fray. Proof, if anything so mundane were required,
has been seen in a string of speeches offering prescriptions on the state of
the nation. More titillating were two interviews in his publications, one
with Berlusconi himself, the other with Mario Segni, the leader of the
referendum movement. Both appeared to voice identical views on the need to
modernise politics, shape up the bureaucracy and privatise furiously.
Yesterday Berlusconi was trying to pour cold water on his political
ambitions; they merely existed in the pages of newspapers, he averred. But
seeing he controls 85 per cent of commercial television, he is certainly in
an excellent position to back whomever he pleases at the next elections.

Suspicions that the Balladur government is cooking up a sternly
protectionist policy towards the Uruguay trade round were only confirmed at
Chatham House yesterday when Alain Lamassoure, French European Affairs
Minister, who was due to address the foreign policy think-tank on the future
of the European Community, failed to appear. It fell to the French
ambassador, Jean Guiguinou, to read out the text on his behalf.
Full of the die-hard protectionism of the old days, the speech was all the
more astonishing because Lamassoure is not merely not a Gaullist - he
belongs to the centre-right UDF group - but is generally known for his
modern, liberal views. Yet the audience learnt how the single market had
unfairly 'benefited companies from outside countries more than European
firms'.
'Europe alone can uphold the rules of fair competition that world trade
needs, and which the so-called free traders of America and Japan oppose.' No
wonder Lamassoure preferred not to deliver all this in person.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Taking no liberties: A nationwide identity card scheme in
the UK need not discriminate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of a limited identity card scheme, now being considered by the UK
government as a possible way of combating social security fraud, has
provoked a chorus of protests from the civil liberties lobby. It argues,
quite rightly, that any such scheme would be discriminatory. Moreover, if
such a scheme were to have any chance of being effective in defeating social
security fraud, it would have to intrude on the freedom and the privacy of
the individual on a horrendous scale.
But the libertarians make a mistake when they go on to argue that the case
against this particular scheme is only a limited version of the much larger
case against a generalised system of national identity cards. On the
contrary, the libertarians grossly overstate the threat to individual
liberty which would necessarily be posed by a national identity card, and
understate the offsetting benefits that it might confer.
Above all, it seems slightly eccentric to attribute so much virtue to the
absence of a system of documentary identification, when there are so many,
much larger, defects in our political system which limit the rights of the
individual, starting with an unrepresentative electoral system.
The discriminatory nature of the scheme being considered by the government
is obviously its biggest drawback. But even if it were limited to the
original purpose of fighting social security fraud, its administration would
be immensely cumbersome; not just because many millions of people would have
to be issued with cards, but because the scheme would have to take account
of the fact that a significant proportion of them would be constantly
floating in and out of the social security net.
Even if these practical problems were overcome, a simple iden-tity card
would not solve the problem. Much of the Pounds 5bn reportedly being
defrauded from the social security system is not the result of mistaken
identity, but derives from the fact that claimants tell lies about their
circumstances.
Any identity card which was likely to be useful in preventing that kind of
fraud, therefore, would have to be a smart card, which has large amounts of
updateable information about the private circumstances of beneficiaries,
including their work, income and family. Such a card would obviously
constitute an outrageous intrusion on the privacy of the individual.
Moreover, the political inspiration of the idea rests at least in part on
the illiberal sentiments of the right-wing of the Conservative party. The
law-and-order mob within the party cannot be counted on to defend other
people's liberty.
The second half of the libertarians' argument holds a good deal less water
than the first. It is not at all obvious that the absence of an identity
card system provides the British subject with civil protections that are not
available to the citizens of France or Germany. On the contrary, it seems
obvious that these protections lie elsewhere, in the political system, in
the civil society, in the framework and application of law. If our liberties
are threatened, it is primarily because these other facets of the social
fabric are defective.
The absence of any recognised form of identity is an anachronism which harks
back to some mythical, bygone era when society was purely composed of
private individuals. The reality today is a mass society where everybody has
frequent, multiple and almost unavoidable transactions with different parts
of the state system, and in which both sides of those transactions have an
interest in being able to establish the identity of the individual. The
libertarians try to scare us with the danger that a menacing police force
would constantly be stopping people to check their identity cards, but this
is just a trumped up bogey. In five years in France I was not once stopped
on the street for an identity check, and I never met anyone who was.
In place of this bogey, there may be other cases where an identity card
system might actually improve the quality of civil society. Young blacks who
could easily prove that they were born in Britain and were not illegal
immigrants might be better protected against police harassment; and the rest
of us might be better off if Irish terrorists found it more difficult to
remain underground. For either of these benefits, I should gladly be
prepared for the trivial inconvenience of being required to admit to my
identity.
A discriminatory identity card should be unacceptable on civil liberty
grounds. But a national identity card system is much less objectionable, and
might even offer compensating advantages.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Mid-life crisis in the North Sea: Oil groups are launching
costly schemes to refurbish their ageing offshore platforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rob Holland is a superintendent with AOC International, an offshore
construction company. He and his work crew recently spent a month dangling
on scaffolding beneath the Brent Bravo oil platform in the North Sea,
welding a 100ft steel beam to its underside. The beam was so heavy that it
had to be split into five sections and manhandled into position with block
and tackle.
The work was the start of what is likely to be one of the most ambitious
engineering projects undertaken in the North Sea.
Shell and Esso, joint owners of the 17-year-old Brent field, the largest in
the UK sector, are trying to extend its life beyond its 1998 expiry date
with a Pounds 1.3bn project to re-pressurise the wells and modernise three
of its four production platforms.
According to Mr Walter van der Vijver, manager of the Brent fields in
Aberdeen, this plan - if it works - should add 10 years to Brent's life and
enable it to produce additional oil and gas equivalent to the output of a
small to medium-sized North Sea field. He describes it as 'mid-life crisis
work'.
The Brent project is a striking example of what many see as a new stage of
life for the North Sea. With more than a quarter of a century of production
behind it, its installations are showing their age and forcing oil companies
to decide whether to invest in extending their lives. Mr David Black, who
analyses North Sea developments for Wood Mackenzie, the stockbroker, says:
'There is a realisation now that some fields which have been around for some
time still have useful life left.'
Decisions are being influenced by a number of factors. The most pressing is
the weak oil price, now close to its lowest point in real terms since North
Sea production started, which is prompting greater financial rigour.
In spite of the substantial cost of redeveloping Brent, Shell believes that
it will yield significant gains in efficiency: manpower offshore will be
reduced by up to a half which, in turn, will sharply reduce the cost of
servicing and supporting platforms. Shell calculates offshore labour costs
at Pounds 60 an hour. According to Mr Van de Vijver, the Brent plan has been
successfully tested against oil at Dollars 15 a barrel, compared with its
current price of Dollars 16.30. 'And even if it fell to Dollars 12, we'd go
ahead,' he says.
Unfortunately, the characteristics of Brent oil are unique, so other fields
cannot be given the identical treatment. But rapid advances in technology
and greater cost-awareness have opened up other prospects.
A different technological approach was adopted at Scott, a new field which
came into production earlier this year. Cost savings were achieved by
pre-drilling the wells and locating as much wellhead plant as possible on
the sea floor rather than on the platform. This enabled Amerada Hess, the US
operator, to complete in only four months start-up work that would normally
have taken more than a year, and will lead to reduced manning, according to
Mr Rex Gaisford, director of projects.
In some fields, manning reductions are being taken much further. Shell is
planning to reduce the number of men at its giant Leman gas field in the
southern sector of the North Sea from more than 100 to only a handful by
1996. It has also commissioned a study from Kvaerner, the Norwegian offshore
constructors, for a new type of platform that would be unmanned, and would
only need to be visited by a support vessel once a year.
Although new seismic techniques and sophisticated drilling and oil recovery
technology tend to attract the most attention, one of the most significant
advances offshore was the development of floating cranes, capable of lifting
loads of more than 10,000 tonnes in one go, compared with 1,000 tonnes
previously. Thanks to floating cranes, installations containing complex
plant and machinery can now be assembled onshore where costs are a fraction
of those offshore, and then floated out and lifted onto the platform.
Cost consciousness has even forced changes in the relationship between North
Sea platform operators and their contractors - traditionally an area where
the oil companies kept the benefits of greater efficiency to themselves,
excluding others from sharing in them.
In what is likely to be a pioneering change, the operators and contractors
in the newly opened Hyde gas field formed a partnership where any savings in
development costs were shared out among the five members. Normally, the
operators would hire the contractors at a fixed rate, which gave them an
incentive to make a high-priced tender for the work.
Mr Chris Rhodes of BP, one of the two oil companies involved (the other
being Statoil of Norway), says: 'We felt there was something to be gained
from a different relationship with the contractors, one that would take
costs out rather than take them in.' There was scepticism in the industry
that the experiment would work, but Hyde came in 25 per cent below its
Pounds 50m budget, and Mr Rhodes estimates that three-quarters of these
savings were due to the arrangement.
According to estimates by Wood Mackenzie, new technology and organisational
methods have halved production costs in the North Sea. At old platforms
these range between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 5.50 a barrel, at new ones only
Pounds 2.50.
Shifting patterns in energy use, particularly the growing popularity of
natural gas, have also played a part. Once flared off as a useless
by-product, gas is now making marginal fields viable, and is likely to
overtake oil as the North Sea's leading product within the next 10 years.
The other factor shaping developments is the attention to safety since the
Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, in which 167 men died. This greater focus on
safety is reflected at the newly opened Piper B platform, which stands less
than half a mile from the yellow buoy marking the site of its ill-fated
predecessor.
Compared with the untidy jumble of older platforms, Piper B has a sleek,
space-age look. Its most dramatic features are the eight aluminium lifeboats
jutting out of the side, ready to nosedive 80ft into the sea in an
emergency. The platform lay-out puts personal living quarters at the
opposite end from the oil and gas facilities - and shielded by
fire-resistant walls.
The platform cost Pounds 1.5bn. But its sophisticated controls mean that
operating costs will be lower than Piper Alpha's - as little as Pounds 2.50
a barrel, according to Mr Michel Romieu, chairman of Elf Enterprise
Caledonia, the operator.
But this willingness to invest large sums of money in order to achieve
long-term savings is relatively new to the North Sea. Dr Chris Fay, managing
director of Shell UK, says: 'We used to measure things by their capital
cost; now it's by their lifetime cost.' This change has had a profound
influence on planning, and means that new equipment in the North Sea is of
higher quality - the extra cost being justified by the fact that it should
last longer.
A further stimulus to this growth was the government's decision in the last
Budget to change the way North Sea oil is taxed so as to give greater
incentives to production rather than exploration, reflecting the view that
all the big fields have now been found. Although much of the redevelopment
work, including Brent, was launched before the change was announced, there
is now a stronger incentive for the owners of the largest fields to invest
in extending their lives.
According to the latest estimate from Scottish Enterprise, the economic
development agency, some Pounds 40bn is likely to be invested in UK North
Sea oil production over the next four years, including the development of 70
new wells. This will help output from the sector to rise to a peak of 2.48m
barrels a day in 1995, up from some 2m this year, although after that it
will start tailing off as fields dry up.
Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP's exploration division, told the
Offshore Europe exhibition in Aberdeen last month that BP would be raising
its investment by 10 per cent over the next three years. He expects to see
his own company's UK production rise by more than 6 per cent as a result.
Mr Browne forecast that new technology and cost reduction could increase
North Sea oil recovery by as much as 25 per cent, from 60bn barrels to 75bn
(to date some 12bn have been extracted). Other oil executives found those
figures over-optimistic. But they do not disagree with the implication that
the North Sea should manage to stave off old age for some years yet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPOSE THE UK chancellor decides that a further fiscal adjustment, beyond
that left behind by Mr Norman Lamont, is indeed required. How should he go
about it? How far, in particular, can he rely on cuts in public spending,
rather than increased taxation?
The answer is that he will be forced to rely on taxation. As the Green
Budget from the Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrates, the government
would be doing well even to keep to its announced targets for public
spending. This is so for three reasons.
First, on the government's forecast of inflation, the real growth of the new
control total, which covers supposedly non-cyclical public spending, is set
at less than 2 per cent in each of the next four financial years. This is
less than the growth of total public spending in the recovery years of the
last cycle, even though Mrs Margaret Thatcher was then in charge and the
government's majority was much larger.
Second, most of the programmes that were easy to cut have already been
severely trimmed. Thus 72 per cent of general government expenditure is now
accounted for by social security (29 per cent), health (15 per cent),
education (12 per cent), defence (9 per cent) and debt interest (7 per
cent). Debt interest is bound to rise. Defence spending is already set to
fall to just over 3 per cent of GDP by 1995, well below previous levels. Any
'cuts' elsewhere are likely to be absorbed in those self-same programmes. In
the case of health, for example, present plans are for increases in real
spending of 1 per cent a year. Such a low rate of increase is virtually
inconceivable.
Manifesto commitments
Finally, some important programmes are protected by manifesto commitments:
to increase the level of real resources in the National Health Service year
by year, for example, and to preserve child benefit.
This does not mean that it would be impossible to cut public spending, even
drastically. But it would be possible only if the government were to make
radical changes in politically sensitive areas. With Mr Major as prime
minister and Mr Clarke as chancellor, that will not happen, bar the far from
inconceivable onset of an overwhelming fiscal crisis.
For the moment at least, adjustment will have to come on the side of
taxation. This 'political' chancellor is likely to see the desirability of
announcing the bad news now, even if additional taxes are once more to come
into effect in future years. He will want to introduce measures that are
neither too visible nor too inflationary. He will also want measures that
can be presented as part of a desirable fiscal reform (though Mr Lamont's
attempt to portray VAT on fuel as an environmental measure was notably
unsuccessful). Ideally, the chancellor would in fact have radical reform in
mind, though there is little reason to suppose he does.
Splashy ways
If good performance of the economy were to allow announced tax increases to
be 'given back' in subsequent years, the chancellor could always oblige. He
would want to do that in splashy ways. What would be most undesirable would
be for increases in distorting, but less visible taxes, such as national
insurance contributions, once again to be used to finance cuts in less
distorting, but more visible taxes, such as income tax.
The Green Budget notes many ways of raising revenue. The tax value of
personal allowances could, for example, be restricted to the 20 per cent
rate, which would raise Pounds 5.7bn; allowances and thresholds could be
frozen at current real levels, which would raise Pounds 1bn; mortgage
interest relief could be phased out, which would raise Pounds 3bn-Pounds
4bn; advance corporation tax and the tax repayable to tax-exempt
shareholders could be reduced from 20 per cent to zero, which would raise
Pounds 3bn; and standard rate VAT could be imposed on zero-rated goods
(excluding housing), which would raise Pounds 10.7bn (but increase consumer
prices by 3.7 per cent), while a 5 per cent VAT would raise Pounds 3.1bn.
None of these options would be popular. Some would be both unpopular and
retrograde. Restrictions on allowances and thresholds would probably be the
least painful and the least damaging.
Whatever Mr Clarke does, the geese will hiss. But he has no prudent
alternative. They will have to be plucked once again.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Canada's election landslide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'first-past-the-post' electoral system can produce bizarre results when
more than two parties get significant shares of the vote, especially if some
of them have supporters scattered throughout the country while others have
solid regional strongholds. Witness the fate of the Progressive Conservative
party, which until yesterday formed the government of Canada but now finds
itself reduced to a mere two seats in the House of Commons.
Unquestionably, the Conservatives would have lost the election under any
system. Yet they actually won a larger share of the total vote than the Bloc
Quebecois, which with 54 seats will now form the official opposition, and
about the same share as the Reform party which won 53 seats, almost all in
the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
It would therefore be wrong to take the apparent annihilation of the Tories
at face value, or to assume that it will be permanent. They retain control
of two provincial governments and half the seats in the upper house. They
remain the natural political home of Canada's business elite, and the only
party which can credibly present itself as a nationwide alternative.
Ms Kim Campbell, the outgoing prime minister, who lost her own seat, cannot
escape responsibility for her party's debacle. No doubt the main factor was
Canada's floundering economy, with unemployment at 11.2 per cent. But Ms
Campbell succeeded by an inept campaign in turning defeat into headlong
rout. Since one of her main blunders was to warn that unemployment would
stay high until the end of the century, the sad lesson is that democracies
do not reward leaders who tell them unpalatable truths.
Familiar dilemma
The incoming Liberals present themselves as economic 'pragmatists' somewhat
in the Clinton mould. Mr Chretien is pledged to create jobs by pumping money
into the economy, but his room for manoeuvre is limited by the markets. The
federal deficit is already large, and if the new government risks increasing
it by any significant fiscal stimulus it will either have to increase
interest rates or let the dollar slide. It is a familiar dilemma, which will
probably make for less spectacular changes in economic policy than electoral
rhetoric suggested.
Similarly, not too much should be made of the danger to the North American
Free Trade Agreement. There is a strong free-trade wing within the Liberal
party, which would not be happy if Mr Chretien risked scuppering the treaty
with unrealistic demands for renegotiation. He will no doubt ask for
'clarification' on certain issues such as anti-dumping and dispute
resolution. Perhaps he will even take a leaf out of Mr Clinton's book and
ask for one or two symbolic 'side agreements'. But the fate of the treaty as
a whole will be decided not in Canada but in the US Congress.
Firmly committed
Most interest will focus on the constitutional consequences of Monday's
vote. It is certainly not an outright victory for separatism. The Liberal
party, which won seats in all 10 provinces, is if anything even more firmly
committed to the federation than were the Conservatives; and the victory of
Mr Lucien Bouchard's Bloc Quebecois (BQ) in Quebec should be seen as an
expression of protest rather than a settled determination to secede.
More ominous, perhaps, is the victory of the Reform party in the west,
reflecting in part a mood of exasperation with Quebec's insistence on
special treatment. The Liberals may feel they have to cater for this mood by
a more rigid federalism, which in turn would provide the BQ with new
grievances to play on. Mr Bouchard could yet be propelled into independence
on a wave of English-speaking impatience.
All in all the result reflects the worldwide reassertion of national or
communal identities in the face of globalising economic and cultural trends.
The Liberal victory is in part an expression of Canadian nationalism, faced
with the economic dominance of the US, while the BQ represents a
French-speaking particularism that would rather deal directly with
Washington or New York than have to work through Ottawa. European spectators
should feel at home.

   From Mr RICHARD THOMAS

<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman ('Welfare versus wealth of nations', October 25) is right
to identify the challenge to policymakers of an ageing population. But he
seems to have fallen into the same trap as many governments, which think
washing their hands of the problem - by reducing state provision - will mean
it goes away. Pensioners will still be there, even if they do not all appear
on government accounts.
I am agnostic on the public/private divide. Ends are more important than
means. Pension provision should be efficient, equitable, comprehensive and
secure, and whichever mechanisms serve these objectives best should be
employed.
But, whatever their role in terms of actual provision, governments must
ensure these objectives are met. New mechanisms are to be encouraged.
Abandoning the principle of public responsibility is not.

<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER

<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd should be pleased. For months the British foreign secretary
has been trying to persuade the world to forget about Bosnia. While
brilliantly exploiting the presence of British troops 'on the ground' to
dissuade anyone else from trying to help the Bosnian government defend
itself and its people, he has made it clear that in his view sending troops
there at all was a rash policy, forced on the government by the media.
Visibly irritated by pressure to take a less neutral line, Mr Hurd has
repeatedly mused aloud on the arbitrary spotlight that the media shine on
some conflicts while neglecting others. He seems to take a morbid pleasure
in enumerating all the other places in the world where wars are going on.
'Why bother me with Bosnia,' is his implicit message, 'when this sort of
unpleasantness is really quite normal? Tell us more about Tajikistan, or
Georgia, or Angola, where things just as horrible are happening.'
Mr Hurd should be pleased now because, in terms of media attention, the war
in Bosnia is almost over. We hear about it mainly in the past tense, as an
episode which poisoned relations between Europe and the US during the
summer, and which both sides are now trying to put behind them.
But it is not over. It is as bad as ever. Sarajevo is still being
remorselessly pounded by Serb shells. Its people are down to two or three
hundred grammes of food a day (less than half what the UN considers a
minimum). Winter is nearly here, but they have no fuel left and precious
little shelter. The situation in other supposedly UN-protected 'safe areas'
is even worse. Thousands will freeze to death before they starve, though in
many cases it may be a moot point.
In early August, Nato threatened air strikes if the 'strangulation' and
shelling of Sarajevo and other 'safe areas' continued. But last week Nato
defence ministers met, and air strikes were not even on the agenda. At least
they had the honesty not to utter any more empty threats. They did not have
to, because Bosnia is no longer headline news.
The precedent for Bosnia was Kurdistan. Television pictures of the exodus
from northern Iraq triggered western military intervention in April 1991,
just as film of Bosnian Moslems in Serb concentration camps triggered the
'humanitarian' UN operation in Bosnia last year. But the latter has been a
feeble affair compared with the former. Saddam Hussein has by and large left
the Kurds alone, because military action has taught him to take western
warnings seriously. The Serbs and Croats in Bosnia have learnt the exact
opposite.
Even the Kurdish 'safe haven' is still subjected, absurdly, to UN sanctions
directed against Saddam's regime. But the Kurds are not Saddam's only
victims. What he has done to the Shia population in the south, especially
since the abortive uprising that immediately followed the Gulf war, is just
as bad. But Hurd's Law applied. There were no TV cameras in southern Iraq
during the uprising, and therefore no serious pressure on western
governments to intervene.
Very late in the day, that omission was partially rectified last night, with
the screening on British independent television of a documentary, Saddam's
Killing Fields, made by historian Michael Wood. It included amateur video of
the holy city of Kerbala, as Saddam's tanks moved in on it, and showed the
more recent draining of the marshes into which the refugees fled. This has
destroyed hundreds of villages and the entire way of life of the Marsh
Arabs. Saddam used all his usual methods, including, it now appears,
chemical weapons.
Mr Hurd is right. Atrocities are not unique to Bosnia, or even Iraq. But
what makes Bosnia and Iraq unique is the specific, undischarged
responsibility of western powers, including the UK in both cases.
The Shia uprising in Iraq was a direct consequence of the Gulf war. It
happened virtually within sight of the victorious coalition forces, but they
did not lift a finger, nor did their political leaders utter a word, to
deter Saddam's forces from suppressing it. Much later, a 'no fly zone' was
proclaimed in southern Iraq, but Saddam has been able to continue his
ruthless work without using air power. Only the threat of allied action
against his ground forces could create a 'safe haven' in the south
comparable with that in the north. Then a provisional government for both
north and south could be established and recognised, which would be a big
step towards the liberation of the whole country.
As for Bosnia, it was virtually obliged to declare independence by the EC's
recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. But the EC - with Britain in the lead
organising peace conferences and supplying their chairmen - has prevented it
from obtaining weapons to defend itself and has extracted concession after
concession from its leaders as the supposed price of an imaginary peace. Now
there is talk of reconvening the London conference, which last year reached
'agreement' on various principles. None have been acted upon.
No doubt a peace conference will be needed eventually, but right now the
Bosnians need a massive airlift of food, fuel and shelter materials to
Sarajevo, and convoys that get through to the smaller enclaves. That in turn
means that those who want to help must be prepared to use force, from the
air or on the ground, against those who themselves use force to prevent
supplies getting through.
But the west, including Britain, now seems resigned to leaving southern Iraq
in the grip of Saddam Hussein, while Bosnia freezes and starves to death. No
wonder Mr Hurd is relieved when the media turn their attention elsewhere.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM STRINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having injured Manchester by withdrawing the assisted area status so
vital for gaining investment, Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, has
added insult by suggesting to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities
that cities should stop promoting themselves abroad. He wants them to
subjugate themselves to regional development organisations.
He wrote to the association on July 19, saying: 'It is far better for local
interests to concentrate on getting the product right, by the provision of
suitable sites and infrastructure, so that they can convert investor
inquiries into local success, and to contribute to the overall regional
message put out by the RDO.'
This would be an outrageous limitation, particularly when the government's
inward investment campaign is under fire for stressing Britain's low wages
rather than the positive advantages of our main cities.
Most of Manchester's foreign investment flows from local strengths and local
enterprise. US cinema giant UCI, for example, has taken office space in
Manchester because of the city's airport link to Los Angeles. And no doubt
cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham could cite similar cases.
Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau
is not bringing home much bacon. Not one of the hundreds of cases handled by
the bureau last year resulted directly in a company coming to Manchester.
Mancester City Council runs its own Manchester Campaign with Manchester
Airport and the Central Manchester Development Corporation, and its business
promotion brochure has already sparked investment interest in Japan, the US
and Europe. These same investors find it bizarre that the government's
promotion machine has nothing to say about Manchester.
Britain's great cities need to advertise their strengths abroad. And until
the government understands the importance of these cities to the nation's
economy, that economy will remain weak. As weak as Mr Sainsbury's ideas on
the subject.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Time to retune for Emu harmony: Sir Leon Brittan argues that
EC convergence can be achieved without narrow ERM bands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir LEON BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The special European Council meets on Friday to mark the entry into force of
the Maastricht treaty on November 1. Some people would have us believe that
this should be more of a wake than a christening. They would argue that the
crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, resulting in August in fluctuation
bands of plus or minus 15 per cent, has set back the cause of exchange rate
co-operation and the single currency by many years, if not indefinitely.
Such a view overlooks the strong commitment most governments still have to
European monetary union. The extent of this commitment can be seen in the
absence of any moves by European governments to 'make the most' of the wider
bands by cutting interest rates and letting their exchange rates depreciate.
The temptation to do this at a time of recession is obviously considerable.
So why have they not done so? The only credible explanation is that they are
still determined to proceed to stage three of Emu and the creation of a
single currency, and that this approach is indivisibly associated in the
minds of governments with maintaining priorities as close as possible to
their old, narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation bands.
There are, however, dangers in sticking to this policy. The longer that
monetary policies remain too tight for domestic economic recovery to take
place, the more damaging the effects on the economy. In turn, the longer
recession lasts, the greater the reduction in demand for currencies of
stagnating economies. Moreover, in most European countries, budget deficits
are high, leaving governments little room to manoeuvre their economies out
of recession by stimulating demand.
The time is therefore right for some policy rebalancing towards looser
monetary and tighter fiscal policy, with two crucial provisos. First,
monetary policy should only be loosened in those countries where it is so
tight, in relation to underlying economic circumstances, that it can be
loosened without any risk of fuelling inflation. Second, policy moves in
this direction should take place in the context of a European consensus on
the extent and manner in which it could be done. It would, of course, still
be up to each country to decide whether and how it wished to take such
action.
For governments to adopt such an approach, they will have to be persuaded
that attaining Emu does not depend on sticking as closely as possible to the
former narrow bands. They will have to be persuaded that it is possible to
have a sound monetary policy without relying exclusively on the external
anchor. It will also mean overcoming the fears in many quarters about the
dangers of excessive volatility if member states decide to use their new
freedom to permit substantial movement in exchange rates. This could damage
the single market in manufactured and agricultural goods as well as economic
co-operation between member states. This is why any greater flexibility must
be exercised within an agreed framework, which would not encourage
competitive devaluations but only permit interest rates to be lowered where
domestic monetary conditions justified it.
Friday's Council meeting provides an opportunity for such a framework to be
put in place, and for the road to Emu to be redefined in a way that takes
account of changing circumstances and that will also help a number of
economies to move out of recession.
As a minimum, the Council must agree on the site of the European Monetary
Institute, which will oversee stage two of Emu, and appoint its head. But
this is not enough: it would enable Europe to comply only with the letter of
the treaty, not with the spirit, and would not represent a move closer to a
single currency in itself. Heads of government therefore also need to
encourage the sort of changes in European economic management, which I have
outlined, to take place.
They should not just restate their commitment to Emu, but take action to
make it more likely. They should use the fact that stage two of Emu begins
in January to strengthen policy co-ordination in compensation for the wider
bands. The Maastricht treaty establishes that it is a key task of the EMI in
stage two 'to strengthen the co-ordination of the monetary policies of
member states with the aim of ensuring price stability'. It also says that
member states shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common
concern and should co-ordinate them.
The European Council should therefore commission from EC economic and
finance ministers (Ecofin), for the December summit, an outline economic
strategy for member states and the Community as a whole, which provides
enough flexibility to allow member states to rebalance their policies as
necessary, while also reinforcing their co-operative nature.
Ecofin could help this to happen by agreeing an overall target inflation
range. Member states could then express this in terms of individual money
supply growth limits which would act as an intermediate target in place of
the exchange rate. ERM participants will then find in many cases that their
present rate of monetary growth will justify much-needed interest rate cuts,
without injecting inflationary pressures into the economy.
This regime has a number of advantages, notably flexibility, since each
member state will be able to follow the monetary targets it considers most
appropriate, within the agreed overall discipline. Additional discipline
will stem from the fact that the EMI, alongside the council, could provide a
forum for discussion which would help to add further credibility to the
pre-announced targets. In many ways this sort of scrutiny would be a natural
extension of existing arrangements for submitting convergence programmes.
Nonetheless, fears about exchange rate volatility and the impact that could
have on intra-EC trade are not to be discounted. It is understandable that
member states should not want to trigger such volatility by interest rate
cuts, but it is far from clear that exchange rates will move more
erratically as a result of looser but informally co-ordinated monetary
policy. Interest rate actions would once again be taken on the basis of a
publicly announced anchor. And the maintenance of the present informal
policy of sticking close to the old narrow bands is not likely to be a
permanently viable option.
This alternative that I suggest would mean that there would probably be
changes in the current central parities within the ERM. But, quite apart
from the fact that that would help some countries to move out of recession,
it would paradoxically bring Emu nearer, rather than push it further into
the distance. In the first place this approach would promote closer monetary
and economic policy co-ordination, which is an essential prerequisite for
the move to Emu. But in addition the new parities that would emerge from
such a policy would be more firmly based on economic fundamentals than the
present ones. As such, they could be more stable and realistic.
They would also lend themselves to an earlier return to narrow bands if that
is desired, although a return to the narrow bands should no longer be seen
as a necessary precondition for the final move to a single currency.
Before the recent upheavals it seemed reasonable to regard the gradual
freezing of ERM parities as the best way of achieving Emu. But the principal
lesson to be derived from the upheavals is that we were putting greater
weight on the ERM than it was ever intended to bear or was capable of
bearing. The ERM was intended by its founders to bring about greater
stability but not to prevent realignments when changes in economic
circumstances rendered this necessary. The use of an ever more rigid ERM as
a way of forcing convergence was tempting but in retrospect doomed to
failure.
Convergence must be attained by other means. This will in time lead to more
stable exchange rates, based on economic fundamentals and, in due course,
for those countries that are ready, the move to a single currency can be
decided and implemented directly, without the artificial prop of years of a
narrow-band ERM.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Relief of poverty should determine
aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The distorting impact of foreign policy on Britain's aid ('Logic was no
match for foreign policy', October 22) comes as no surprise to those of us
who recall the government's explicit intention in 1980 to 'give greater
weight in the allocation of our aid' to political considerations.
In the Reality of Aid report earlier this year, NGOs working with the
world's poorest communities noted the World Bank estimate that 40 per cent
of world aid was diverted from poverty reduction to middle and high-income
countries 'largely for political purposes'.
The Overseas Development Administration has recently taken a number of
important steps to increase its focus on poverty. The forthcoming European
Community council of development ministers will consider a proposal to
increase the poverty focus of EC aid, initiated during the British
presidency.
The record shows that, when the ODA is able to make poverty the priority,
British aid can be very effective in areas such as humanitarian relief. The
strong and consistent support of the public for UK aid targeted on poverty
reduction was echoed in a June 1983 Actionaid/Gallup Survey, which found 87
per cent of MPs wanted more attention to be given in this category of
spending to aid for basic needs.
The National Audit Office report shows that the diversion of British aid for
foreign policy purposes serves neither the interests of the poorest nor the
taxpayer, nor indeed Britain's long-term commercial and political security.
The government should end competition between the developmental, political
and commercial interests in aid by stating explicitly (in line with the
World Bank) that sustainable poverty reduction must be the primary
determinant of British aid spending and the benchmark against which its
success is evaluated.

Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY MCCALL-JUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's assessment of the South African scene displayed some
familiarity with the subject. But his lofty assertion that the newly formed
Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner
Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats
cannot pass without comment.
I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art,
western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa
correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and
political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic
organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party
alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which
of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had
the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism.
Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing
'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe
Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or
President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They
are both good public relations men, not democrats.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Peter Maxwell Davies's Violin Concerto - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME seven years ago, Isaac Stern gave the premiere of Peter Maxwell
Davies's Violin Concerto at the composer's St Magnus Festival in the
Orkneys. Then he introduced it to some larger centres, and in due course
recorded it for CBS.
It was the first time that Maxwell Davies had composed a work expressly for
a soloist of international renown; in the event, however, the great
violinist sounded neither very sympathetic nor very well-practised in the
piece.
The prospect of hearing Gyorgy Pauk take it in hand on Sunday, with the
original orchestra - the Royal Philharmonic - conducted now by the composer
instead of Andre Previn, was full of promise. Pauk is a prince among senior
musician-violinists. Again and again, he has put his superlative technique,
his sterling musicianship, his pellucid address and his Strad at the service
of new music, when he might be devoting an easier life to the Classical /
Romantic repertoire.
This time, however, Pauk's unstinting devotion set Sir Peter's Concerto in
an unflattering light. He illuminated the solo role with grace and searching
finesse, especially in the soberly beautiful two-part writing in his
extended cadenzas ' but what was the orchestra doing? Nothing like enough.
The brief moments of vivid exposition got no energetic follow-up. The
ruminative first movement, denied the recapitulation it wants, instead
declined sidewise into a mild Adagio; that, in turn, swung into a pallid
'Scottish' rondo with a deflated coda.
Perhaps the RPO had had too little time to find its feet with the piece; or
again, Davies as conductor may have been too intent upon cultivating his
trees at the cost of any wider view of the woods. The effect was of a
luminous solo voice bobbing over subfusc, under-argued support. It may be
relevant that this concerto was a transition, a prelude to Davies's
continuing series of 'Strathclyde' Concerti for various principals of the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which are mostly introspective studies. The
Violin Concerto may mark an uncertain juncture between Davies' old lust for
violent solo expression, and his newer interest in neo-classical form.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the time of his neo-Expressionist fame,
his dramatic progressions were spelt out with lurid clarity. Now, Davies
strives after 'symphonic development' of a more traditional kind; but his
ears remain atonal and serialist, and the old 'development' procedures
(essentially tonal) do not ring true. We can barely hear them.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Feckless talent - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOUG Elkins is a wacky klutz with a fabulous talent and no sense of
structure. This American dance-maker first brought his work to Dance
Umbrella in 1991; last weekend he and his company returned. Watching his
work is bewildering. Two years ago, I suspected that he was the most
marvellous young dance-maker to have come along since Mark Morris; now I am
sure that he is. I am also sure, however, that he never bothers to turn his
dances into choreography.
Almost any phrase in Elkins's work is a hilarious but thrilling fusion of
contrasting traditions. Sometimes, he adds yet another layer of contrast by
setting these dances to music from another culture (eg Indian) or era (eg
Handel). His dancers are a complete mix - skinny or plump, short or tall,
long-haired or bald - and the dances he gives them may be straight, gay,
neither or both. Ironies abound; campness too. Yet the image he sets onstage
is one of happy consensus, in lively harmony with the music.
In these respects, Elkins is a classical artist. His work places itself at
the ends of several traditions, and occasionally suggests that he knows his
own kinship to George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Twyla
Tharp, Mark Morris, and others. The resemblances occur in fleeting
references that enrich his work. Much more obvious and important are the
basic virtues that his dances often show: seamless phrasing, steady current,
rhythmic pulse. His dancers look like folk having a good time in a bisexual
New York club and like artists attending to niceties of musical detail and
dance style.
I like best his suite of Latin dances, A Cerca de la Escuelita. What rare
bliss to find a choreographer alert to the metres of the cha-cha, the mambo
and more. None of these dances were pure Latin, but all of them were much
closer to true Latin style than any of what is practised on the professional
ballroom circuit. More Wine for Polyphemus, though the programme dates it as
new this year, incorporates material we saw two years back. Now, as then, my
jaw drops at the impudent musical wit with which Elkins mixes charleston,
the twist, breakdance and ballet to Joan Sutherland's recordings of Handel
arias.
You watch these ingredients being so uncannily assembled, your senses
ravished by first impressions, you tingle with anticipation - and then you
watch this young chef pour his cooking down the drain.
In 1991, I hoped that Elkins's feckless failures of construction simply
suggested that he had not yet got round to addressing larger matters of
choreographic craft. In 1993, it is but all too plain that Elkins thinks
that not being organised is cute. His ordering of them is full of
oh-gee-is-this-a-live-show attempts at simulated clumsiness. Though his
dances are no end of fun to watch moment by moment, they win only a
spattering of final applause. Too flip.
His work has made me blink tears of sudden wonder, and laugh aloud with
incredulous joy. Of the rare calibre of his talent, I have no doubt.
Ultimately, however, it filled me with despair.
*****
Shobana Jeyasingh is an Indian choreographer who lives and works in Britain.
Her dancers employ the traditional Indian vocabulary of the Bharata Natyam
style, but she uses modern Western music and many structural features of
modern Western choreography. This season has invited Richard Alston to make
a piece for her six dancers.
Alston is the finest maker of sheer dances in Britain today, and watching
his Delicious Arbour, choreographed to Purcell music, is a marvellously
ironic experience. For these dances both revitalise Bharata Nyatyam - and
yet are clearly not Bharata Natyam. They feel utterly Alston - while looking
utterly unlike anything he has made before.
The ironies of Delicious Arbour lie mainly in its rhythms and its
musicality. Alston has applied features of Indian dance metre to the radiant
baroque measures of Purcell, sometimes moving slow against a faster beat, or
in rapid embellishments around a slower beat, but always revealing its inner
processes. Its beauty is that Jeyasingh's six dancers seem to claim Purcell
as their inheritance.
Jeyasingh herself has choreographed Romance - with footnotes. But her
refined and clever organisation of traditional dance material seldom takes
off as sheer dance, or creates a stage world of its own. When Alston uses
her dancers, they look girlish, shy, but sharply individual. In Jeyasingh's
material, they look like studious, inhibited acolytes.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Saddam's unseen victims - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIEWPOINT 93; Saddam's Killing Fields (Tuesday, ITV) was a poignant reminder
that what the lens does not see the heart does not grieve over. It showed
how different have been the experiences of two groups of Saddam Hussein's
opponents, the Kurds and the Shia of southern Iraq.
The luck of the Kurds began to turn when the cameras focused on the poison
gas victims in the streets of Halabja. The cameras were back in force to
film the Kurds' exodus to the mountains, stumbling through the mud and snow.
Those pictures struck a chord in the outside world; emotion was translated
into action and the Kurds - at least in the short term - are safe.
The documentary, filmed in Free Kurdistan and Iran but not Iraq, pieced
together evidence of the scale and viciousness of the Iraqi army's
reprisals, said by the Kurds to have claimed 300,000 Shi-ite victims in the
intifida 1991 alone. The colossal bad luck of the Shias is that since the
crushing of their intifada, they have been hidden from the world's sight.
The programme examined the genocidal Iraqi policy towards the Marsh Arabs
and argued that the idea of a safe haven in the south must be resurrected.
The Marsh Arabs, said to number 70,000, face the extinction of their unique
way of life as their villages are rocketed, the waterways are poisoned, and
the buffaloes, fish and reed-beds die. The chief external witness to the
Marsh Arabs' destruction have been satellite photographs of land which is
now brown and lifeless, the effect of Iraq's notorious drainage project. It
was presented to the UN as an agricultural improvement scheme, but human
rights observers are convinced it is an instrument of genocide.
An amateur video made six months ago showed Marsh Arabs appealing to the UN
and US for help, above all for the canals to be bombed so that the water
returns. The hopelessness of these people was eloquently expressed by the
bitter words of one refugee: 'They come to film us and set us to music like
the TV comedy they think we are.'
The UK's foreign Office minister Douglas Hogg explained with wondrous
suavity that there was no possibility of external intervention although
''the process' will probably take some time. It is at least possible that
within the time-frame Saddam may fall.' To hear genocide described as 'a
process' gave a small chill. My mind jumped back to last Wednesday and the
first part of Thatcher: The Downing Street Years (BBC2), in which that lady
lambasted the Foreign Office and its 'whole culture' based on negotiation.
The Thatcher documentary is guinea-a-minute stuff. With the second
instalment screened tonight and such reams of comment already written, I
will not dwell on episode one except to say that the gender aspect was
particularly interesting. During her time in office Lady Thatcher showed
little interest in women's causes. Accepting membership of the single-sex
Carlton Club was just one example of her lack of solidarity. Even so, I
thought Lady Thatcher's observations about the prejudice she encountered for
being 'that woman' was telling.
Mrs Thatcher used sex as a weapon in her rise, but it also helped others to
belittle her and it played a part in her downfall. There is meat there for
every woman who operates in a male environment, however hostile she is to
Thatcher's political values, to ponder.
The Foreign Office came in for a pounding in Dispatches (Wednesday, C4), a
gripping dramatisation of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms for
Iraq scandal. The programme had actors impersonating figures such as David
Gore-Booth and William Waldegrave at the most uncomfortable moments of their
grilling by Scott and Presilly Baxendale. It made compulsive watching and
whetted the appetite for what is to come when Lady Thatcher and the Prime
Minister appear.
At some time I have been asked (possibly by my credit card company) for my
mother's maiden name as a way of ascertaining my credentials over the
telephone. Panorama; Secrets for Sale (BBC1, Monday) showed that no
question, however arcane (dog's name, favourite pudding), could protect
personal data.
Panorama filmed a ferrety character called Robert Hemphill using a lens
concealed in a rolled umbrella. His company is one of many which offer to
obtain details of bank accounts, credit cards, police records, National
Insurance and National Health records. Panorama set Hemphill to penetrate
the private details of four people, among them trade union secretary Rodney
Bickerstaff and Lord Parkinson's former lover, Sarah Keays.
The four were amazed to discover the speed with which secret information
could be produced. Hemphill, unaware of the umbrella lens, explained that he
could gain access to the police computer at Hendon which holds criminal
records. He told his Panorama contact: 'It's literally bribing a police
contact; it is that simple'
The scam revealed, Hemphill high-tailed out of the office pursued by his
Panorama interviewer. Some aspects of this kind of intelligence gathering
come close to criminality, but many are beyond the reach of the Data
Protection Act or any other legislation. Is the open society in one respect
effectively already here?
What a relief to turn to more rarified matters: the fate of vanished
civilisations, examined on Equinox; Out of the Past (C4, Sunday). Who could
envy the modern archaeologists after a programme in which we saw them
spending years counting pine seeds and measuring microscopic variations in
the cutting edge of obsidian knives? The end result, however, is an
important jolt to the old chronology of the collapse of Mayan civilisation
in Central America.
It now seems that the Mayans did not suddenly vanish. Their kings departed
but the ordinary folk carried on, planting their maize for two centuries.
But when the end came, in the 12th century AD, it was over-population,
salination, and soil exhaustion which put paid to a brilliant, cruel
civilisation.
The moral is one that archaeology is increasingly coming to realise. Pace
New Age romantics, many an ancient peasant civilisation did not live in
joyous harmony with its environment. This was a brilliant documentary,
untricksy, even old-fashioned, and there was no presenter but only bearded
archaeologists with a far away look in their eyes. Yet for sheer cerebral
excitement, it was quite the best thing I have seen in a long month supine
in front of the TV.

THE Falklands and the Westland Affair provide the keenest points of interest
in the second part of Thatcher: the Downing Street Years (BBC1, 9.30). It is
preceded by one of the more sensible offerings in the weird Thatcherfest on
our screens. In The Thatcher Experience (BBC2 8.00), Peter Jay mulls over
the financial and economic aspects of those years.
With government playing so large a part in the schedules, it is pleasant to
turn instead to the breezy climate of Skye and Iona. In Screenplay: Boswell
and Johnson's Tour of the Western islands (BBC2, 9.25), Robbie Coltrane is
the choleric lexicographer in a play by John 'Tutti Frutti' Byrne.
The opposition fields its own heavyweight comic line-up with Stephen Fry in
Stalag Luft (ITV, 8.00). This daringly long play about a compulsively
escapologist POW is written by David Nobbs, author of 'The Fall and Rise of
Reginald Perrin'.
Quite a droll series is The Almost Complete History of the 20th Century (C4,
9.45) which dubs old film footage with historical issues. Tonight, post-war
rationing.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Assured Beauty - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH National Ballet has just gained a new staging of The Sleeping
Beauty. Produced by Ronald Hynd, it is essentially - and wisely - the
traditional text which he knew as a premier danseur with the Royal Ballet.
There is little innovation - Carabosse flies in and out, with no little
panache, on wires; the trick is somewhat minimised by having the Lilac Fairy
(in 'anything you can do, I can do better' mood) joining the Prince in a
similar lift-off at the end of the Vision Scene  - and much sensible
conservation. Petipa, as I never cease repeating, Knew Best. I would query
Hynd's need to bring in an extra Fairy at the Christening, in the cause of
symmetry I'd guess, but also of musical crassness, because Tchaikovsky also
Knew Best. In much else we recognise the rule of good sense, and affection
for a work that is a central truth about ballet itself. The score was very
decently played by ENB's orchestra on Monday night in Southampton, where I
saw Beauty at the Mayflower Theatre, and most significantly, the
choreography was set out with commendable clarity by ENB's dancers.
It is some comment upon the work - and the weeding-out - already undertaken
by Derek Deane, ENB's new artistic director, that the lacklustre troupe we
have been watching during the past few years has been so transformed. There
is brightness and assurance to the work of the corps de ballet, and the
Prologue's fairy variations were far more secure as expositions of classic
style than anything the company showed us under the previous regime. If
Deane can thus inspire his artists after a few months, we have much to look
forward to. Such a masterpiece as Beauty will either enhance or utterly
destroy its interpreters, but Hynd's love for the ballet, and Deane's sense
of performance standards, have put the company on its mettle.
The design is by Peter Docherty. He has provided a setting of soaring
pillars set against sky-scapes that suggest seasonal moods, with
golden-leafed branches which feature significantly and beautifully in the
action. The visual effect is most poetic in the Hunting scene and the
Awakening: autumnal magic is potent.
About his costumes I have certain reservations, more to do with fabric than
cut or shape, for he follows the correct historical progress from Louis XIII
to Louis XIV, and the Watteau-esque designs for the Hunt are splendid. But
modern artificial fibres have an unnatural sheen, unvarying and unresponsive
to light. They blare, and the solid blocks of courtiers in blue and acid
aniline green in the Prologue, the lurking presence of lurex in gleaming
bodices, do not give that feeling of impossible luxury and Versailles'
elegance vital to Beauty's power.
The company performances are commendable because testimony to serious work
and serious coaching. Hynd has made a charming trio for the third act
jewels, well done by Josephine Jewkes, Graham Rowe, Stephen Sherriff, and I
saw very neat Bluebirds from Yet Sen Chang and Ambra Vallo. Carabosse was
well and malevolently played by Kevin Richmond.
Aurora and her prince were taken by two new recruits: Cecilia Kerche from
Brazil, and the Frenchman, Cyril Pierre. Miss Kerche is a secure performer,
but I did not think her physique or her temperament revealed her as one of
nature's Auroras. The ultimate and glorious demands of the role - the
ballerina as incarnation of a classic ideal - have yet to be met in a
reading I found un-nuanced. M. Pierre is a handsome figure and an admirable
partner, but he did not show that princely dignity in dancing which makes
the last act duet a portrait of a nobleman. The most satisfying performance
of the evening came from Evelyne DeSutter, returned to the company after
several years, as the Lilac Fairy. Her delicate physique, the elegance of
her style are a delight.
English National Ballet plays Beauty in Southampton this week; then visits
Manchester (week of November 1), Liverpool (Nov 8), Bristol (Nov 16), Leeds
(Nov 22).

FT  27 OCT 93 / Management: The unions step on board - The US steel industry
is taking part in an experiment in employee involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 years of losses, lay-offs and falling market share, the US's
biggest steel companies have come up with a new way to improve their
competitiveness: allow union representatives on to their boards.
Five of the six big integrated steel companies have already concluded
agreements with the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) in a move which
amounts to one of the most far-reaching experiments in employee involvement
undertaken in any US industry. US Steel, the country's biggest producer,
could follow suit later this week, if company and union negotiators meet
their deadline of reaching a new labour agreement by Friday.
No other US industry has ever experimented with union involvement on this
scale. Individual companies, most notably Chrysler, have conceded board
seats to their unions in the past, but the practice has never taken root
across an entire industry before.
The agreements also provide for union involvement in committees at all
levels of management.
Yet the benefits of worker participation on this scale remain unproven. Will
it make any difference to the flagging fortunes of the big steel companies,
which are struggling to catch up with newer, un-unionised competitors?
And will the changes turn out to be anything more than temporary, just
another phase in 'Big Steel's' long decline?
The US's six big integrated steel companies (those involved in every step of
steel production, from making the coke for use in their furnaces, to rolling
out and coating finished steel sheets) have already cut their combined
workforce from 270,000 at the start of the 1980s to fewer than 100,000 now.
They have invested more than Dollars 13bn (Pounds 9.2bn) between them in the
past decade to become more efficient.
However, with overcapacity in the worldwide steel industry and the inroads
made by the small 'mini-mills' and reconstituted mills at home, a return to
sustained profitability remains elusive.
In new six-year accords struck with the USWA this summer, four companies -
Inland, followed by Bethlehem, National and Armco - agreed to appoint union
representatives to their boards and to adopt extensive co-management
arrangements. A fifth, LTV, has activated a similar plan since coming out of
bankruptcy protection at the end of June.
There are two ways to explain the development. One - espoused publicly by
the companies and the union - is that giving workers more of a say will lead
to more efficient production methods and make the companies more
competitive. 'It's kind of an unorthodox way of dealing with the problem,'
says John Jacobson of Wefa Group, an economic research company. 'But they
haven't been very successful with anything else they've tried.'
The other, more cynical, view is that companies find it easier to lay off
workers or overhaul their working practices if they adopt a less
confrontational approach to labour relations: it is difficult for union
leaders to oppose big changes if they have been closely involved in their
origin.
According to some labour relations experts, this motivation may lie behind
many of the attempts in the US at employee participation since the
mid-1980s.
'When companies have excess capacity, this could be a way of making the
cutbacks more palatable,' says John Dunlop, a former US labour secretary and
chairman of a commission set up by the Clinton administration in March to
look at the legal framework for labour relations in the US.
Either way, the agreements should have an indirect benefit for the steel
companies in the short term. In return for the promises of greater
participation in management and a guarantee that there will be no compulsory
redundancies, steelworkers have agreed to a freeze in basic pay for the next
two years and to greater job flexibility.
But it is less clear whether the participation agreements will yield the
sort of sustained productivity improvements their supporters claim. There
are at least two reasons why some of the hoped-for productivity gains could
prove elusive.
First, and perhaps most important, old attitudes on both sides of the
union/management divide die hard. Labour relations in the industry have
traditionally been adversarial, says John Goodwin, manager of US Steel's
Gary, Indiana, plant, the biggest in the US. 'We've got a long way to go -
we've got 80 years of history to overcome.'
Second, there are very different perceptions of what closer union
involvement in management actually means. Will the union's representatives
have an influence over strategic and other decisions taken by the big steel
companies, or are they simply being invited into the executive suite to
observe?
Both sides talk glibly of a new-style 'partnering' approach to management,
preferring to hide behind this piece of management-school jargon rather than
face up to the real question: does the new approach amount to a form of
co-management, or simply as an extended exercise in worker communication?
'What they (the union) want is to see what's happening and why decisions are
made, rather than trying to take decisions themselves,' says Joseph Emig,
manager of Bethlehem Steel's plant at Burns Harbour in northern Indiana,
which is now the home of the US steel industry.
Some union officials appear to agree. Jack Parton, director of the USWA's
East Chicago district, says: 'I can't run a steel mill. I didn't go to
business school, and I don't intend to go to business school now.'
He and other officials have recently been invited to attend the regular
fortnightly meeting of senior Inland Steel executives, called to review
progress against the company's plans. They are not there to second-guess the
line managers whose responsibility it is to meet certain targets, he says.
But other union representatives talk of more positive involvement and it
seems unlikely that they would sit passively as decisions were taken that
would harm their members' interests.
The difference of perception is most acute when it comes to the question of
board-level representation. The steel companies point to the legal
responsibilities the union's directors will face.
'The first, foremost and only obligation of every director is to represent
the interests of shareholders,' says an official at Inland Steel.
Union members, though, cling to the idea that the directors they nominate
will represent their interests, not those of the shareholders. To some, it
seems like an opportunity to fight the old union/management battle from the
inside. 'Boards give their management people golden handcuffs - we hope we
will now be able to put a stop to things like that,' says Andy Hopkins, a
tractor driver at Bethlehem's Burns Harbour plant and a part-time union
official.
Doug Frazer, a former head of the United Auto Workers, agrees. In the 1970s,
he became the first union leader to sit on the board of a leading US company
when he was appointed a director of Chrysler. Union-appointed directors are
there to fight for the interests of workers, he says. They also have a right
to tell their members everything their boards do.
'I said that as far as I was concerned, nothing was confidential. There's
not enough openness in these large organisations.'
Such comments send shudders through secrecy minded executives. But, in
practice, the union-nominated directors are likely to be able to exert
little direct influence, even if they wanted to.
'It will not make a difference to the way the company operates. But if it
makes all our employees understand better why decisions are taken, it will
help,' says Curtis Barnette, chairman of Bethlehem.
It is also questionable whether the new arrangements will stand the test of
time. The history of US labour relations is littered with similar examples
of experiments at employee involvement that did not last.
It takes a crisis to encourage companies to let workers on to their boards,
says Frazer. When Chrysler had returned from the brink, the union seat was
quietly dropped. 'I think they stole that seat from us,' says Frazer.
If all the big steel companies agree to let union representatives on to
their boards, the experiment this time could at least prove longer lasting.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Management: Personnel crisis? what crisis? - David Goodhart
explains why the role is becoming less pigeon-holed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has been rather kind to Britain's personnel practitioners. The
annual conference of the Institute of Personnel Managers, which opens today
in Harrogate, is the biggest yet staged.
The IPM is expecting 1,800 delegates and now claims 52,000 members out of a
total number of personnel managers estimated at 100,000. And the latest
issue of Personnel Today reports that personnel vacancies are on the rise
again.
On the face of it this seems strange. Larger companies might have
temporarily boosted their personnel function to cope with the large
redundancy packages of the recession years, but the longer term outlook for
the traditional personnel function is supposed to be poor.
The conventional view of decline states that as the importance of human
resource management has been recognised, so large parts of the personnel
function have been devolved to line managers.
Geoff Armstrong, now head of the IPM and a veteran of industrial disputes in
the car industry, recalls: 'In the 1960s and 1970s we had constant
bargaining about change and line managers abdicated the personnel function
to big, centralised personnel departments.'
Most of those big departments have been slimmed down or even closed. And not
always because of a belief in the virtues of decentralisation. When
hard-nosed conglomerates such as Hanson Trust took over a company in the
late 1980s one of the first things they did was to close the central
personnel department.
In smaller companies, too, the specialist personnel function has often
disappeared completely, creating more work for employment lawyers.
'A lot of companies have lost all internal expertise on employment law
matters which law firms have capitalised on,' says Paul Nicholls of Dibb,
Lupton and Broomhead which has increased its employment law staff from four
to 14 over the past two years.
Privately, many senior personnel managers admit these changes have led to an
identity crisis for the personnel function.
'Personnel often has a rather dated 1970s image, still trying to find a
balance between labour and management,' says one. 'The personnel function is
being pulled in so many different directions but it really has got to prove
its hard-edged business advantage,' says another.
Sometimes this identity crisis is played out in the conflict between 'soft'
personnel people trying to balance interests, and 'hard' human resource
managers trying to improve efficiency, often in a non-union environment.
It also seems to be afflicting the government-appointed lead body which is
having trouble defining what personnel managers actually do in order to
establish National Vocational Qualifications for them.
John Hougham, now head of Acas and former head of personnel at Ford, is
suspicious of the hard-liners and fears the decline of the more traditional
personnel function.
'The personnel function is showing some signs of losing its organisational
status in some quarters,' he warns.
But even if the traditional, 'collectivist' personnel manager is
disappearing, the personnel function is adapting to survive, as the
continuing growth of the IPM seems to show.
Peter Reid, head of employment affairs at the Engineering Employers
Federation, says that personnel is now less pigeon-holed than it used to be
and that a spell in personnel is increasingly useful for a board-level
director.
Indeed, if board-level representation is an indicator of the status of the
personnel function then there is little to worry about.
According to the Cranfield School of Management, 49 per cent of all private
and public organisations employing more than 200 people have a personnel
representative on the board, up from only 40 per cent at the start of the
1980s.

FT  27 OCT 93 / People: Pavia to quit Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Pavia, finance director of Lasmo, the independent oil exploration
and production company, is to leave the company at the end of the year - the
latest in a series of moves among senior executives as the company searches
for a strategy to see it through a troubled period of weak oil prices.
The future of Pavia, who has been with Lasmo for 14 years, had been the
subject of much market speculation since the middle of last week. Joe Darby,
chief executive, says his departure was 'one of several changes . . .
following a thorough review of the company's strategy and management'.
Earlier this year, John Hogan was appointed chief operating officer and
Peter Nolan took over as head of exploration, while Darby himself only
joined the company in February.
City sentiment towards Lasmo has been decidedly gloomy of late, in large
part because of its vulnerability to low oil prices, and the prospect of
growing debt to finance new production.
Darby yesterday denied that any additional moves were being planned,
although at least one non-executive post will open up next year.
Pavia's departure comes after a particularly active year, in which he helped
Lasmo to raise Dollars 600m on the US capital markets. He also recently
completed the financing of Lasmo's Pounds 350m share of the development
costs for the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field, one of the projects which the
company is hoping will boost its fortunes in coming years.
Lasmo says there are several internal candidates for finance director, but
executive search consultants will also be used.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Assault on pesticides - US
plans to minimise the use of high-risk insecticides have spawned a new
generation of safer products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's new proposals to encourage reduced-risk
pesticides represent a comprehensive reform package which is likely to alter
radically the way pesticides are used in the US.
In response to increased pressure for new rules by environmental and health
activists, the new law would impose a tough, uniform standard for all foods.
The proposal would scrap the 35-year-old Delaney Clause, which poses
stricter rules on the use of pesticides in processed foods than in fresh
foods. In its place, the proposed new law would:
Extend the current standard of a 'reasonable certainty of no harm' from
canned goods to raw fruits and vegetables.
Establish goals for the reduction of pesticide use by 2000.
Eliminate the consideration of 'economic benefits' in the pesticide approval
process.
Enhance enforcement.
Give greater priority to safer and reduced-risk pesticides.
Require high-risk pesticides to meet the safety standard within three years
and all other pesticides within seven years.
The package was put together against a background of growing evidence that
pesticide levels in the US are too high for the safety of infants and
children. It was also a response to increasing concern about the ecological
impact of toxic pesticides.
However, the proposed regulations are worrying for farmers since a number of
existing pesticides would be rendered illegal. In response, farmers would be
forced to find alternatives to keep their crops insect- and disease-free.
Propitiously, a new generation of pesticides is beginning to make its way on
to the market. A number of companies are investing heavily in the
development of low-risk pesticides, which range from genetically-altered
plants and bacteria to wider use of naturally-occuring pesticides.
'We need to consider alternatives to traditional pesticides,' says Frederick
Betz, a senior biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency.
'Fortunately, there's a lot already on the market and a lot which will soon
become available. I think the production of reduced-risk pesticides will
boom over the next few years.'
The Food and Drug Administration has promised speedy review of pesticides
which fall into the reduced risk category, in an attempt to move products
quickly from the research laboratories into farmers' fields. As a result, a
flood of new, alternative pesticides may be approved in the next few years.
One of the most novel areas of research is in pheromones, chemicals which
influence the sexual behaviour of insects. Pheromones, which are harmless to
humans, can be used to lure insects into traps, or can be released in
concentrations large enough to disturb mating patterns. 'If we put out
enough, the insects can no longer use the pheromone as a signal to find
their mate,' says Betz.
One US pesticide manufacturer, Ecogen, has identified more than 200
insect-specific sexual hormones and is searching for ways to use them
effectively in the field. 'We like to put them in a form in which they can
be sprayed, so they'll be more practical,' says David Olson, Ecogen's
director of regulatory affairs. 'We also need to have them vaporise slowly,
so they'll be effective over the course of a few weeks.' As a possible
solution, Ecogen has designed plastic microcapsules which can be used in a
spray form and dissolve slowly over time.
Another important development is the cultivation of plants which are
genetically engineered to resist pests. A number of companies are conducting
research in this area and several hope to offer genetically engineered seeds
for sale within the next few years.
'Nature produces chemicals which are poisonous to certain insects, but not
to humans or beneficial pests,' says Mike Sund, spokesman for Cibaseeds.
'We're trying to create plants which produce these chemicals themselves.'
Cibaseeds, part of the Swiss Ciba group, is working jointly with Micogen to
develop a maize plant which is resistant to the common and destructive pest,
the European corn borer. Monsanto has programmes in place for cotton and
potatoes as well as maize and believes this method, besides being good for
the environment, will be extremely effective.
'Using traditional, exterior insecticides can be a hit or miss thing,' says
Frank Serdy, regulatory affairs director for Monsanto. 'But if the plant
itself is excreting the chemicals, the insect gets a load of toxins with
every bite. Genetically engineered plants are the wave of the future in pest
control.'
Manufacturers are also using genetic engineering to alter naturally
occurring bacteria, or microbials, which act as toxins to certain insects.
'These bacteria are well-established as safe pesticides,' says Janet
Overholt, manager of regulatory affairs for Novo Nordisk. 'But there is a
lot of room to improve their efficacy.'
Many of the bacteria, for instance, lack stability in the field. They are
often sensitive to light, and may last no more than a few hours. Others are
not as target-specific as desirable. The pesticide companies are seeking to
enhance their effectiveness.
However, not all groups are convinced that genetic engineering is the
solution. Despite strong support for these programmes from the Clinton
administration, activists are already organising consumer boycotts against
genetically engineered food products. Ironically, the new, reduced-risk
pesticides may encounter more opposition than the high-risk products they
will replace.
The solution, according to the pesticide group EcoScience, is to stick with
natural pesticides. The company researches naturally occurring pesticides in
the field and packages them as pesticides. One product, a fungus which was
originally found in Iowa, sticks to roaches, eventually causing death.
Another bacteria is effective in eliminating post-harvest disease in apples
and other tree fruit.
Micogen has also discovered a native maize species which is resistant to the
corn borer and is using cross-breeding methods to enhance the resistance of
cultivated plants.
But these solutions are limited. Moreover, because insects tend to build up
resistance to pesticides, a wide range of products is needed. 'The key is to
use one insecticide for a while and then switch to another, rotating them,'
says Serdy. 'No single pesticide will provide the final solution. That's why
we need to look at all the alternatives available.'

board. The CAA board comprises a selection of full and part-time members
with financial, aviation, air safety and other appropriate qualifications
and experience. It is responsible for civil aviation policy in the UK,
including air traffic control and safety regulations. Its chairman is the Rt
Hon Christopher Chataway, the former government minister.
Lynch is currently managing director of resources, engineering and services
at the British Broadcasting Corporation, having joined the BBC from Forte
Hotels - where he was sales and marketing director - in May this year.
But Lynch can offer the CAA more than guidance as to improvements in its

FT  27 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Signs of order spring from
chaos - Argentina is starting to take green issues seriously, but progress
is slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When seven people died last month in a working-class suburb of Buenos Aires,
overcome by highly toxic fumes from industrial waste which a company had
dumped into drains near their homes, the tragedy featured nightly on
television news programmes.
But within days, judges, politicians and regulators began squabbling over
who was responsible for the disaster and who should be hunting down the
owners of the waste disposal company blamed for the incident.
Meanwhile, the government felt compelled to 'do something' and dusted off a
requirement - never previously enforced - that companies handling hazardous
waste must register with the Natural Resources and Human Environment
Secretariat.
However, after a few weeks, both the media and the government had forgotten
about the incident.
Sadly, nothing about this event was unique. Every time an environmental
accident hits the headlines, as frequently happens, competing bureaucracies
start rival investigations and issue a blizzard of rules and regulations
which are soon forgotten.
Argentina's most important body of environmental laws was born under similar
circumstances. Reports in 1991 that industrial waste from developed
countries was being dumped in Argentina led to a new toxic waste law in
January 1992. The government also included environmental offences in the
civil and criminal codes.
Basically, the law established a cradle-to-grave rule making companies
responsible for the safe disposal of waste. But it took the Environment
Secretariat 17 months to publish detailed regulations making the law
enforceable. Until then, companies were in legal limbo.
The law is contradictory and confusing. Jenny Valdirio, an environmental
consultant, said it 'is practically a copy of US legislation, but conditions
(here) are not similar. There is less technology and there are fewer
treatment possibilities'. And its definition of toxic waste is so broad that
anyone with an open oil can in their garage is violating the law.
Until recently, none of this mattered much. Argentines were too busy coping
with military repression and economic instability to worry about the
environment. Advanced legislation introduced during the turbulent 1970s,
such as the clean air law of 1975 and a decree establishing the 'polluter
pays principle', were rarely enforced.
Now, with democracy and economic stability more firmly established, people
are demanding a halt to environmental degradation, particularly of water
sources.
In Buenos Aires, untreated sewage is poured into tributaries of the River
Plate. In the city's industrial belt, factories, slaughterhouses and
tanneries dump waste ranging from animal blood to heavy metals into the
rivers. Environmentalists claim companies often have waste treatment units
but do not use them. People who live in the industrial belt suffer from
dysentery, gastroenteritis, hepatitis and worms. The water table is
contaminated.
Raymond Florin, executive director in Argentina of the Business Council for
Sustainable Development, the body created by the environmentally-conscious
Swiss businessman Stephan Schmidheiny, says demand for change 'is coming
from all over the place - people, politicians, judges, NGOs, the state, the
media - and very quickly. Great changes are taking place (so rapidly) that
people don't know what to do'.
Companies are struggling to adapt. 'Six or seven months ago nobody talked
about the environment. Now you talk to any manager and he'll have something
to say about it,' says Florin. However, he admits that even large companies
are still unwilling to set up environmental control departments.
The government is changing slowly. Its Environment Secretariat is staffed
with political appointees who have little understanding of environmental
policy. The secretariat's 1993 budget of Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.5m) is half
the sports budget. Even the government admits the courts are slow,
inefficient and corrupt. Thus offenders are rarely punished. Amid this
chaos, however, order is beginning to emerge. More rational economic
organisation is a big part of this.
The government has privatised environmentally sensitive steel, chemical,
energy, water and petrochemical industries. Before, these companies were run
by authoritarian bureaucracies which disregarded the law and were not
publicly accountable.
Privatised utilities are now charging consumers the real cost of water,
electricity and gas - which the state once provided at artificially low
prices that discouraged conservation.
As well as buying state assets, private companies also took on the state's
environmental liabilities. Independent government regulators are starting to
enforce environmental and quality standards that were once ignored. Some
business people admit that if they had realised the size of these
liabilities, their privatisation bids would have been much lower.
Pedro Tarak, executive director of Fundacion ARN, a Buenos Aires
environmental foundation, says individuals, associations, local government
and congress are demanding greater participation in policy-making and
enforcement. Even the much-criticised Environment Secretariat is reforming
and hiring professionals.
Argentina has a long way to go. Accidents like the one that cost those seven
lives will recur. Tarak says 'unfortunately we still need more situations
(like that) so we all understand the need to get organised'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / People: Quarta springs into action
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gaping tear left in the management structure of motor
components-to-aerospace group BBA by the forced resignation through illness
of group chief executive John White in August is about to be mended.
Roberto Quarta, 44, American-born son of an Italian tailor, is to move from
his main board directorship at BTR to take over White's job from November 1.
Quarta, who had been seen as one of the main rivals for BTR chief executive
Alan Jackson's job as and when the latter retires, is expected to continue
White's strategy of increasing BBA's growth around its core businesses of
motor components, industrial materials, aerospace equipment and electrical
equipment.
Some BBA watchers who have been expecting BBA's acquisition rate to slow
could still be in for a surprise. Quarta, said to rejoice in the nickname CS
 -for coiled spring - among some colleagues, is unlikely to allow the group
to mark time for long after getting his feet under White's desk.
Apart from a four-year stint with motor and aircraft components group
Hitchener in the US, Quarta has been a BTR man since 1978, when BTR took
over the Massachusetts controls company of which he was then a
vice-president.
In addition to his main board role - undertaken at the start of this year -
he has been chief executive of a number of BTR divisions, including
automotive, construction services and electronics.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Vehicle makers to expand: Nissan is investing Pounds 26m in
its Sunderland plant and Land Rover is recruiting 300 more workers to boost
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO VEHICLE makers announced expansion plans yesterday, underlining the
resurgent competitiveness of the industry in the face of slumping
continental car demand and output.
Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is proposing a Pounds 26m expansion of its
Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, even though it is temporarily halving output
from the site because of the market downturn in continental Europe.
Land Rover is recruiting a further 300 workers to increase production of its
four-wheel-drive vehicles. This will bring to 600 the total recruited since
September by Land Rover, which is based in Solihull, West Midlands. The
company is part of British Aerospace's Rover vehicles group.
Nissan's new investment at Sunderland has been prompted partly by the
strength of the Japanese yen. The expansion includes a Pounds 16m rear axle
sub-assembly plant, replacing imported axles made by Nissan in Japan.
Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK yesterday declined, on grounds of commercial
confidentiality, to say what reduction would result in the production costs
of Sunderland-made cars. Nor would the company, which has cut Sunderland's
1993 output from 270,000 cars to 246,000, specify the planned capacity of
the axle plant, due to begin operating in early 1996.
At present Nissan is shedding jobs at Sunderland by non-replacement, so new
axle plant posts may be filled from the existing workforce.
The company plans to continue importing transmissions and engine blocks, the
most expensive components, from Japan. More than 80 per cent of components
by value come from European suppliers.
Nissan is suspending night-shifts for its 2,400 production workers from
November 8 until the end of December. Output next year may be below 246,000
cars, but the company says it is still investing for the future.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director and chief executive, said: 'The proposed
new developments will broaden our manufacturing base and strengthen our
ability to respond to the forecast long-term market growth in Europe
following the current recession.'
The Pounds 26m expansion includes a Pounds 10m extension to the existing
plastic parts paint shop to cater for increasing demand for colour
co-ordination. Nissan says it will introduce the latest environmentally
friendly paint technologies.
Its planning application will be considered by Sunderland City councillors
next month. Approval looks assured as the expansion is within Nissan's
existing site. The company said the proposals had no bearing on its row with
Sunderland Football Club over the club's plan for a Pounds 70m sport and
entertainment complex on land beside the car plant.
At Land Rover, the latest recruitment campaign will lift the company's total
employment to 8,700 and put it on course to achieve record production levels
by a large margin - mainly reflecting soaring demand in the UK and overseas
for its Discovery model.
Combined output of the Discovery, the Defender military/utility vehicle and
the up-market Range Rover will be running at an annualised rate of 83,000
units when the latest additions to the workforce are fully operative from
November 8.
As a result, the company expects this year to exceed substantially not only
last year's production of 57,000 units but the record output of 66,000
achieved in 1990.
Much of this expectation is fuelled by a 46.8 per cent increase in UK sales
of Discoveries in the first three quarters of this year, lifting Land
Rover's total UK sales by one-third - to 20,291 - compared with the same
period last year.
Honda is preparing to market the Discovery, badged as the Honda Crossroad,
in Japan. The model is also to be launched early next year in North America,
where Land Rover plans to quadruple total sales to 16,000 units annually
over the next five years.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Thatcher believes government has failed to honour debt to
the UDM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADY THATCHER believes the government has failed to honour its debt to the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers, which opposed the National Union of
Mineworkers' strike of 1985, Roland Rudd writes.
In tonight's episode of the BBC TV programme Thatcher: The Downing Street
Years, she says: 'I understand now that those marvellous working miners, the
Democratic Union, feel a sense of betrayal.
'Things have happened since I left, to the coal mines and those working
miners, that I would never have countenanced had I been there.'
The threat of further coal closures will be discussed today during a Commons
debate on the industry.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday said the 10
coal mines most at risk are financially viable.
Evidence from British Coal sources confirmed that 10 of the pits the
government claimed to have reprieved last March were down for closure or
mothballing, he said.
The 10 were: Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear; Prince of Wales, W Yorks; Bentley,
Frickley, Hatfield and Kiveton Park, all S Yorks; Point of Ayr, N Wales;
Bilsthorpe and Calverton, Notts; and Silverdale, Staffs.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Danish contract boosts British Coal's exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has won its biggest overseas order since it began testing the
market for extra sales in March, and is on course to increase exports by
more than 50 per cent this year.
The deal for 100,000 tonnes, concluded with a Danish electricity generator,
was achieved against intense international competition.
It will help British Coal counter arguments from MPs, including Mrs
Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for Batley and Spen, that it has been
sluggish in winning extra sales. Such criticisms may resurface today in a
Commons debate.
The agreement, disclosed by International Coal Report, a Financial Times
publication, will also test how far the government is prepared to go in
subsidising coal sales.
In its white paper in March the government said it would provide subsidies
for sales to UK electricity generators and indicated that up to Pounds 500m
was available. Since then the generators have shown a marked unwillingness
to buy additional tonnages this financial year at least.
But the government said last week it would subsidise a British Coal deal to
sell 1.2m tonnes to Alcan, the aluminium company, in the north-east of
England.
The Department of Trade and Industry is considering British Coal's request
for a subsidy for the Danish contract, which is with SK Power for its
Copenhagen plant.
British Coal refused to say yesterday what price it had agreed for the
Danish contract, but it is likely to be significantly below the Pounds 35 a
tonne of British Coal's existing contracts with the UK generators.
ICR said Danish companies had recently bought coal for as little as Dollars
30 (Pounds 19.80) a tonne.
The contract means British Coal will sell about 1m tonnes of coal overseas
this year, compared with 600,000 tonnes last year. However, imports have
also increased from 400,000 tonnes to about 800,000 tonnes, according to
British Coal.
The order provides a fillip for the north-east of England, where the coal
will be produced. However, some of the coal will come from opencast
operations, which are not able to claim government subsidies.
The order will not affect significantly the decline in jobs in the deep-mine
coal industry. Shipments began this week.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Tarmac consortium aims to build second Forth bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of European construction companies has been formed by Tarmac
Construction to tender for the building of the second Forth road bridge. It
is the fourth consortium known to have registered an interest in the
project, which could cost Pounds 275m.
The government is expected to announce early next year whether it wants to
proceed with the new bridge. By next month it will have received feasibility
studies on the project, which would be privately funded and operated, and
earn revenue from tolls on the new and the existing bridges.
The Scottish Office will draw up a shortlist of three consortia to tender
for the project after the deadline for expressions of interest closes next
Tuesday. The project will involve building Pounds 100m worth of new roads.
Scottish Office ministers have already said they believe a new bridge will
be needed early next century because of the volume of peak-time traffic on
the existing bridge, which opened in 1964. Labour MPs have accused ministers
of having already decided to build a new bridge, while environmental groups
argue that it is not needed.
The consortium led by Tarmac includes the construction companies Bilfinger
and Berger of Germany, Bouygues of France, and HBM (Civil Engineering) of
The Netherlands, as well as Transroute, a French toll-road operator. It is
advised by Morgan Grenfell with lending to be led by NatWest Markets and
Banque National de Paris. The grouping is called E15, after the European
number of the road that crosses the Forth.
Other consortia to have declared their bids for the contract are: Forthspan,
led by Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, advised by Kleinwort Benson;
Forth Link, consisting of Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine, John Mowlem
and Morrison Construction, together with Dragados of Spain and Monberg and
Thorsen of Denmark, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and John Laing,
GTM-Entrepose of France and Miller Group of Edinburgh, advised by Bank of
America.
The Scottish Office says that if the project proceeds the winning consortium
should be announced late next year or early in 1995. The project would then
have parliamentary procedures to go through, and possibly a public inquiry.
Construction could begin in 1996 or 1997 and could take four to six years.
Tarmac and Bouygues are partners in the Channel tunnel project, while
Bouygues is a leading partner in the Pont de Normandie in northern France,
which will be the world's longest cable-stay bridge.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Edmonds in plea for job security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES can combine job security for employees with the ability to adjust
overall employee numbers as markets change, says one of Britain's leading
trade unionists.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, cited Rover and
National Power as companies which had non-compulsory redundancy agreements
with their unions but had also shed large numbers of staff in the past two
years.
Mr Edmonds, in an interview with the Human Resource Management Journal, also
said that he had no problems 'in principle' with performance-related pay.
He said: 'It has to be fair, acceptable to those involved, and transparent.
If it really means 'your manager will decide your pay', then that will be
demotivating and will not work.'
On employment security he said that unions should demand it as their share
of the 'spoils' from more effective management.
Mr Edmonds said: 'Employers want guarantees of all kinds from us. People's
time, ingenuity and commitment will only be forthcoming if the giving of
these is not going to put them out of work.'
He added: 'Admittedly, the line between voluntary and compulsory can be
thin. But management will have to come to accept that redundancy is a
failure in the same way that passing the dividend is a failure.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Changes to audit liability considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE accountancy profession has established a group to present proposals to
the government early next year on changes to the law on professional
liability.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has set up a
steering group to consider the options for reform in response to growing
concerns over legal actions against auditors.
The initiative builds on work conducted by the institute's business law
committee and on a campaign for change launched by the largest six
accounting firms earlier this year.
It represents a widening of interest in the subject by the profession, and
echoes support from the Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Graham Ward, chairman of the new group and a partner with accountants
Price Waterhouse, said the options included the introduction of a cap on
liability; removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which prevents
auditors from limiting their liability; or amending the law that makes
auditors jointly and severally liable in litigation.
His group will prepare a paper for approval by the council of the institute
at the end of this year or the beginning of 1994.
The government has asked for more information about precisely how many firms
are affected by large-scale lawsuits, and crucially whether the problem is
likely to persist or is merely related to the recession.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Detection is 'best way' to hit crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S view that prison acts as a deterrent was further undermined
yesterday after Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, said the
rate of detection was far more important in combating crime.
His comment in a Lords debate on the report of the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice comes after criticism by Lord Justice Woolf, a law lord, of
government proposals to crack down on crime.
Lord Woolf recently dismissed the policy of imprisoning greater numbers of
people as having a 'miserable record of failure'.
Mr John Major has given his public backing to his home secretary Mr Michael
Howard, who said prison works as a deterrent against crime.
Lord Taylor told peers: 'I am strongly of the view that the most important
deterrent to criminals is the likelihood of detection rather than the nature
or length of sentences. 'Will I get caught' is uppermost in the villain's
mind, not 'will I get three years or five'.
'Public interest at present is that the level of detection is low and, even
when detected, many offenders are not prosecuted. I hope that in its avowed
aim to give law and order high priority, the government will lay emphasis on
detecting and preventing crime and that all the resources necessary to that
emphasis will be made available.'
Lord Taylor's comments are an indication of the extent to which the legal
profession is at odds with the government's view of prison.
He yesterday repeated his opposition to removal of the right to elect for
jury trial in certain cases.
Referring to the planned review authority to deal with alleged miscarriages
of justice, he said it was important 'we should not proceed too fast'. It
was vital that it be properly set up.

FT  27 OCT 93 / BR may win right to bid: Compromise considered to halt Tory
rebellion on railway sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering a compromise over its railway privatisation
proposals which would allow British Rail to bid for some franchises under
certain conditions.
The potential compromise is designed to win over Conservative rail rebels
who support a Lords amendment giving BR the right to become a franchisee.
Ministers believe the Lords amendment would negate the effect of its
proposals because BR would have an in-built advantage in bidding against the
private sector.
Under the terms of the possible compromise discussed with some backbench
Conservative MPs, regarded as potential rebels, BR would have the right to
bid for some franchises - but less than half of the total.
The successful BR franchisees would have to operate as single units,
publishing separate and transparent accounts.
That condition would be designed to prevent BR submitting artificially low
bids for routes by cross-subsidising them with revenues from other services.
Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman in the Lords, recently
argued that allowing BR to bid for the franchises would 'undermine the whole
franchising process'.
BR's inside knowledge of the financial performance and potential of its
passenger services would give it an unfair advantage over the private sector
in pitching its bid, he said.
Supporters of railway privatisation fear that, irrespective of proposals to
stop cross-subsidising, BR would still win all the franchises if it were
allowed to take part. Putting a ceiling on the total number of franchises BR
could bid for would guarantee an element of competition from the private
sector.
At a meeting of the Conservative backbench committee on transport Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday declined to say whether he would
consider a compromise.
The Railways Bill is due to go back to the Commons from the Lords for its
third and final reading on Monday. If the cabinet decides to put forward new
proposals, they would take the form of a clause seeking to amend the Lords
amendment.
Mr MacGregor has been meeting Conservative MPs during the past few days and
privately brought up the possibility of a compromise.
One MP close to the minister said: 'The government will press ahead with its
rail privatisation proposals. But politics is the art of compromise and
ministers are confident they have a formula which will receive the support
of all Conservative backbenchers.'
The transport secretary has already climbed down twice over aspects of his
rail privatisation proposals. He agreed to commit the new rail regime to
maintaining concessionary railcards, and to write pensions guarantees into
the bill.
However, the concession over the industry's pension fund gained a frosty
response from the fund's trustees.
Mr Derek Fowler, trustee chairman, said in a letter to Mr MacGregor that he
is still concerned by the government's plans, which seek to water down its
obligations on Treasury contributions to the fund.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Thames signs Pounds 90m deal with ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION, the independent television production company that lost
its ITV franchise, announced yesterday that it had signed a deal to make
programmes worth more than Pounds 90m for the ITV Network Centre, the ITV
programme commissioning organisation.
The deal, which is spread over the next three years, is for The Bill, Des
O'Connor Tonight, Wish You Were Here and a range of other documentary, light
entertainment, comedy and children's programmes. Thames said the agreement
was the largest ever made in the UK with an independent producer and
confirmed the company's position as the leading independent studio.
Thames, which in April was bought by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
signed a deal in the summer with the BBC worth more than Pounds 20m over
three years. At the centre of that deal was This Is Your Life - originally a
BBC programme that later moved to ITV and will move back to the BBC next
autumn.
Under the deal with the ITV Network Centre, Thames will continue to produce
three weekly episodes of The Bill until the end of 1996. It has also been
asked to produce two more series of Des O'Connor Tonight for transmission in
1994 and 1995. The holiday programme Wish You Were Here is also being
prepared for transmission later this year, and will also be renewed for 1994
and 1995.
Mr Marcus Plantin, ITV Network director, said Thames' top programmes were
big audience winners. 'I'm delighted they are now guaranteed to remain on
ITV,' he said.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Campaigners opposed to rail privatisation descend on
Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 campaigners opposed to rail privatisation descended on
Westminster yesterday to lobby MPs, while union leaders described the
sell-off plans as 'utterly destructive and sheer lunacy'.
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs urged Tory MPs to join them in trying to
wreck the government's rail privatisation legislation currently going
through parliament.
The Save Our Railways group, which organised the action, produced a survey
of rail commuters showing that one in five could switch to cars if fares
increased under privatisation.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the largest rail union, the RMT, said:
'There is a deep and growing anger about the sheer lunacy of the
government's proposals.'
Other unions backed calls for Tory MPs to rebel and force through an
amendment to the railways bill which would allow BR to bid for franchises in
a privatised network.
Labour warned Tory MPs with small majorities: 'Save our railways or lose
your seats.'
Shadow employment secretary Mr John Prescott - Labour's former transport
spokesman - forecast two weeks of acrimonious debate in the Lords and
Commons.
'The bill is in a total mess, the Lords have torpedoed it below the water
line, and we will try to make it totally unworkable,' he said.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Motorcycle crowds hide declining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 140,000 visitors are expected at the six-day Motor Cycle Show which
opened at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre yesterday. That is about
three times the number of motorcycles the industry expects to sell in the
whole year.
While new car sales continue to recover, executives in the powered
two-wheeler market believe that at best their sector is bottoming out after
more than a decade of decline.
In 1980, Britons bought 315,000 motorcycles, scooters and mopeds. By last
year sales were down to 52,000 and Mr Graham Sanderson, spokesman for the
British Motorcycling Federation and an executive of market leader Honda,
yesterday said that sales were likely to fall further, to about 45,000 units
this year.
Mr Sanderson said the market would be doing well if this level was sustained
next year.
One consolation for importers, which control most of the market, and for the
resurgent Triumph Motorcycles, now the UK's only producer of any
significance, is that the value of machines sold has risen sharply.
Industry estimates find that more than two-thirds of all machines sold are
of 250cc and above, with many buyers being prepared to pay upwards of Pounds
6,000.
NEC show spokesman Mr Dennis Bates said that the majority of sales were made
to affluent over-35-year-olds who use motorcycles for leisure rather than
for essential transport. However, there is growing concern that young
people, on whom the market once relied, are no longer entering the sector
via mopeds and low-powered machines.
Honda, the world's biggest motorcycle maker which has about 30 per cent of
the UK market, has just returned to profitability in the UK after years of
losses obscured by its expanding cars business.
Midlands property entrepreneur Mr John Bloor remains confident about the
future of Triumph, the Leicestershire-based company he controls, which has
been making motorcycles with the Triumph badge for three years. Triumph has
already captured 13 per cent of the UK market for machines over 750cc.

FT  27 OCT 93 / End to ITV company ownership rules could lead to a power
struggle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN END to the ITV company ownership rules would lead to a power struggle of
'Scramble for Africa' proportions, the Independent Television Commission
told MPs yesterday.
It called for the moratorium on hostile takeovers and the ban on nine large
ITV companies merging to be extended for at least a year.
The moratorium, which effectively blocks foreign takeovers of ITV companies,
is due to end by January, and the government is still considering the issue.
Small ITV companies, such as HTV and Channel Television, told the Commons
national heritage committee that they wanted even longer extensions of the
restrictions, to give a period of stability.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Justice chief says detection is best crime deterrent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISK of being caught is a greater deterrent to criminals than the length
of the jail sentence, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, said
last night.
His comment in a Lords debate on the report of the Royal Commission on
Criminal Justice comes after criticism by Lord Justice Woolf, a law lord, of
government proposals to get tough on crime.
Lord Taylor told peers: 'I am strongly of the view that the most important
deterrent to criminals is the likelihood of detection rather than the nature
or length of sentences. 'Will I get caught' is uppermost in the villain's
mind, not 'will I get three years or five'.
'Public interest at present is that the level of detection is low and, even
when detected, many offenders are not prosecuted. I hope that in its avowed
aim to give law and order high priority, the government will lay emphasis on
detecting and preventing crime and that all the resources necessary to that
emphasis will be made available.'
The Lord Chief Justice repeated his opposition to removal of the right to
elect for jury trial in certain cases.
Referring to the planned review authority to deal with alleged miscarriages
of justice, he said it was important 'we should not proceed too fast'. It
was vital that it be properly set up.
Royal commission chairman Viscount Runciman of Doxford said: 'I hope that I
and others are wrong in expressing fears that some of the recommendations
may find favour at the expense of others, when the chances of their success
once implemented will to a very large degree depend on their being treated
as integrated parts of a coherent whole.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / PM defends record on unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major, the prime minister, yesterday resisted strong criticism from
Labour MPs about the level of joblessness, saying that the unemployment
total had stabilised and was far better in Britain than in Europe.
Despite new indications that confidence in the UK economy is weakening, Mr
Major said recent reductions in the jobless figures 'confirm the underlying
strength of the economy'.
'Unemployment fell last month amongst both men and women in every region in
every part of the country,' he told the Commons at Question Time.
'Unemployment is falling in this country whereas it is not falling in other
countries.' He said that opposition MPs who had forecast that unemployment
was at 3.5m would now have to admit that it was 'under 3m and falling'.
The prime minister also stressed the need for a speedy resolution to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. European Community heads of
government are due to meet in Brussels on Friday, when the deadlock between
France and its EC partners over Gatt issues will be high on the agenda.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Scottish industry more confident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in Scotland painted a markedly more positive picture of their
situation in the Confederation of British Industry's industrial trends
survey than that depicted by the UK-wide survey.
Whereas a balance of only 1 per cent of respondents in the UK survey said
they were more optimistic about the business situation than they were four
months ago, in Scotland the margin was 21 per cent.
That reflected a stronger trend in new orders both from the domestic and the
export markets, although both areas did less well than expected. Output was
higher, though less than expected, and stocks of finished goods were higher.
For the first time since January 1990 Scottish manufacturers reported an
increase in numbers employed, while those in the rest of the UK recorded
another sharp drop.
A 24 per cent positive balance of Scottish companies said they intended to
increase investment spending in the next year, compared with a negative
balance of 1 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The planned increase in spending on plant and machinery was the greatest
since 1988.
The CBI's Scottish industrial trends survey analysed replies from 119
companies that are surveyed regularly.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Manufacturing sales hopes dashed, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER OPTIMISM among manufacturers for buoyant orders and output has not
lived up to expectations, the latest industrial trends survey from the
Confederation of British Industry has found.
Its results, consistent with recent fears that the pace of recovery is
slowing, showed that orders and output were both flat during the past four
months, while export orders declined. The rise in business confidence was
the weakest so far this year.
But the survey should calm fears that inflation is gaining momentum. For the
first time since the survey began in 1958, slightly more companies expect
unit costs to fall than to rise over the next four months.
The survey, which covered more than 1,300 companies in 50 different
industries, found that the number of manufacturers reporting a rise in new
orders during the past four months equalled those reporting a drop. The
balance was also flat for output.
In spite of the disappointing results, companies still hope to see a modest
improvement in demand and production during the rest of the year.
The drop in exports was not surprising as CBI members are suffering from the
recession in continental Europe, to which they export more than half their
goods. The number of companies reporting a drop in export orders outweighed
those reporting an increase by 8 percentage points. The outlook for exports
over the next four months remains positive with a balance of 6 per cent
expecting a rise in orders.
The CBI said small businesses had fared better during the past four months
than big manufacturers.
Other highlights of the survey were:
Prices - unit costs barely increased in the past four months, suggesting
that inflationary pressures remain subdued. The CBI said profit margins were
still being squeezed.
Employment - the fall in manufacturing employment has eased slightly since
summer. Job losses are expected to continue at the same rate over the next
four months. Big companies - employing more than 5,000 people  - have shed
jobs at a much faster rate than their smaller counterparts. The CBI pointed
out that employment has continued to fall while output has remained flat,
implying that productivity is still improving.
Investment - intentions to invest remain weak. Companies planning to cut
spending on buildings and machinery in the next year continue to outweigh
those which intend to spend, although the balance is the lowest since the
start of the year. Optimism - business optimism rose for the fourth
successive quarter, but the increase was the weakest so far this year.
A positive balance of 1 per cent of companies said they were more optimistic
about the general business situation than they were four months ago,
compared with a positive balance of 11 per cent in the last survey.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Smaller businesses 'maintain upturn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC recovery among smaller businesses remains robust, says a survey
published today.
The survey by the Association of British Factors and Discounters, whose
members provide cash for companies against unpaid invoices, found that
export sales grew by a third in the latest quarter in spite of mounting
concern about the effects of recession in continental markets.
'The recovery of Britain's smaller businesses is still intact,' said Mr Ben
Allen, association chairman.
Sales by clients of the association's members - 9,500 mainly small and
medium-sized companies - rose 22 per cent in the third quarter of the year
compared with the corresponding period last year. Although the annual rate
was slightly down on the 25 per cent achieved in the previous quarter, it is
the second-best figure recorded by the association in the past six years.
Mr Allen added: 'In contrast to other economic indicators in recent weeks,
our figures suggest that smaller firms paused for breath but did not drop
out of the race over the late summer.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Watchdog misinformed by MoD: Arms-for-Iraq inquiry told of
'ambiguous' status of ministry official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence misinformed a Whitehall watchdog about links between
one of its officials and the proposed Pounds 1bn sale of Hawk trainer jets
to Iraq, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday.
The official, Mr David Hastie, was appointed by the MoD in April 1988 as
'business development adviser' on secondment from British Aerospace where he
was a marketing executive.
Documents made available to the inquiry show that Mr Hastie was recruited
primarily because of his links to the Hawk sale, which was actively pursued
by BAe and MoD officials until the summer of 1989. The sale was stopped on
the insistence of Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister.
In a letter written by the ministry to the Civil Service Commission in April
1989, asking to extend his contract, Mr Hastie was described as being
involved in the development of the European Fighter Aircraft and in helping
small businesses. No mention was made of the Hawk contract.
The commission supervises Whitehall recruitment, particularly non-advertised
appointments from the private sector.
Mr Ian McDonald, a senior MoD official, told the Scott inquiry yesterday
that Mr Hastie's appointment was judged by the ministry to be 'for the good
of HMG as well as for the company'.
Mr McDonald was questioned about previously secret government papers that
show Mr Hastie's appointment became the subject of controversy within
Whitehall.
Foreign Office officials vetoed a visit by Mr Hastie to the Baghdad
International Military Fair in April 1989 as an MoD official attached to the
ministry's defence export sales organisation.
They judged that Mr Hastie's status as an MoD official was 'ambiguous' and
risked being misinterpreted at a time when the government was bound by
guidelines restricting defence sales to Baghdad.
Subsequently Mr Hastie was allowed to be present at the fair without
official status but as a member of the BAe team.
Lord Justice Scott said that the documents made available to the inquiry
suggested a situation of 'conflicting duties'.
Subsequent answers to parliamentary questions about Mr Hastie, which were
prepared by Mr McDonald, were neither informative nor complete but amounted
to a 'fobbing off', the judge said.
The hearing continues tomorrow.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Gloom forecast for finance sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHRINKING financial services industry in the south-east is leading to
fewer jobs and changing working patterns for employees, says a report
published yesterday.
The study by Hull and Bristol universities warns that the industry could be
facing a long-term decline after the shake-out in jobs and companies during
the past two years.
The report, published by the South East Economic Development Strategy, calls
for local authorities to take more interest in the provision of financial
services and for training and enterprise councils to develop training
programmes geared to the needs of local financial services employers.
Financial services was the key growth sector during the 1980s, says the
report. While overall employment in the UK remained constant in the 1970s
and 1980s, financial services doubled to nearly 2m people in the same
period.
Between 1990 and 1992 financial services employment fell by 11 per cent in
the south-east as companies retrenched and changed employment practices
under increased competitive pressures. 'At best, these changes will serve to
restrict the growth of financial services employment. At worst, employment
in the industry will experience a long-term decline,' says the report.
The report says the introduction of more part-time working as companies
reorganised has led to fewer opportunities for promotion among part-timers.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Unit trusts exceed record despite dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET SALES of unit trusts were Pounds 668.6m in September, down from Pounds
981.2m in August.
But the figure still took net sales for the year to date to Pounds 6.91bn,
more than in the whole of 1987, the previous record for a calendar year.
The popularity of personal equity plans, which offer tax-free returns, has
been a significant factor behind sales of unit trust. Of net unit trust
sales of Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter, Pounds 612m was in Pep form.
Funds invested in unit trust Peps now amount to Pounds 6.5bn out of a unit
trust total of Pounds 84.1bn.
Gross sales of unit trusts in September were Pounds 1.38bn and repurchases
Pounds 711.6m. The slight dip in sales from August's total may have been
resulted from the weaker performance of stock markets in September, although
the markets have rebounded to new highs this month. Compared with August,
sales to both private and institutional investors were slightly down.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which produced the
figures, said the most popular funds in September were UK Balanced funds,
which invest in a mixture of bonds and equities and can offer a higher
income. The least popular were Japan funds.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Lenders warn on mortgage relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE interest tax relief should be increased for first-time buyers and
remain unchanged for other home owners if the housing market's fragile
recovery is not to be jeopardised, the Council of Mortgage Lenders told the
government yesterday.
In its pre-Budget advice to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, the council,
which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks,
warned that the housing market was on a knife-edge.
Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said: 'There is really very
little sign of the market recovering, despite a year of low interest rates
since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism.'
The council also called for an interest rate cut and a successor to the
Business Expansion Scheme to bring repossessed houses back into use.
Mortgage interest available through income support to people who have lost
their jobs should not see further restrictions, it said.
Under its proposals, new buyers would be eligible for tax relief on loans up
to Pounds 60,000 in the first year, with that figure falling during the
first five years of the loan to the present limit of Pounds 30,000.
Any expansion of mortgage tax relief would be a severe change of direction
for the government, given the government's moves in recent Budgets to
restrict its scope.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Petrol retailers contest contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT petrol station owners yesterday demanded big changes to their
contracts with leading oil companies because of growing competition from
discount outlets, particularly those at supermarkets.
The Petrol Retailers Association said failure to reach an agreement on new
terms could lead it to call for an investigation by the Office of Fair
Trading or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Phil Richardson, association president, said the problem stemmed from the
fact that, under current contracts, large oil companies exercised a high
degree of control over the prices retailers can set for branded petrol.
He said some oil companies had responded quickly to fierce competition from
supermarkets by lowering prices. In most cases the effect of lower margins
for retailers had been lessened or offset by higher volumes. But other
companies had maintained margins at individual retailers, even though nearby
discount outlets might have been selling petrol at 5p per litre less, Mr
Richardson said.
In such circumstances retailers had reported sales volumes falling by as
much as 40 per cent, he said, meaning that they could only 'go out of
business quickly or go bust slowly'.
Mr Bruce Petter, association director, said big oil companies had listened
to their complaints with 'sympathy'. But if 'no remedies emerge we would
very reluctantly' have to look for relief from the competition authorities.
The retailers want a force majeure clause added to supply contracts enabling
them to buy petrol from oil companies other than the one to which they are
contracted if the original supplier was 'unable or unwilling to supply at
competitive rates'.
Shell UK last night expressed sympathy for retailers, but 'categorically
denied' that its pricing policy was 'a form of pump price controls'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Short-term attitude of banks denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL system has been unfairly blamed for short-term attitudes among
UK companies, Professor Harold Rose of London Business School said last
night in a memorial lecture for Harold Wincott, the former Financial Times
journalist, John Gapper writes.
Prof Rose argued that finance had been 'more scapegoat than villain' in
limiting Britain's economic growth. Many traditional criticisms of banks and
securities markets were contradictory, and lacked supporting evidence.
In the 23rd annual Wincott Lecture, Prof Rose said that while banks were
criticised for their short-term view, 'it is the large British corporate
customers rather than the banker who is reluctant to enter into the
marriage'.
He said that British companies preferred to take advantage of wide access to
different forms of finance. 'I submit that the real fault in the British
capital market is not that good firms cannot raise enough finance but that
it is too easy for badly managed firms to do so.'
However, he said he 'would not completely absolve' bankers whose training
was 'short of education in the principles of portfolio risk management'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Three 'household name' insurers may face Lautro charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUTRO, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, is
considering charges of widespread mis-selling against at least three of
Britain's largest and best known life insurance companies.
Lautro has not named the three companies, which are all publicly quoted. In
at least one of the cases, thousands of investors may be eligible for
compensation.
Charges against the companies centre around their failure to control
hard-sell sales tactics used by tied agents - those who sell a company's
products exclusively, but are not directly employed by the company.
The companies are accused of failure to monitor the sales agents to ensure
that they were giving best advice to investors. They are also accused of
failing to exercise due care in the recruitment and training of sales
agents.
While several 'household name' insurance companies have been the subject of
Lautro disciplinary actions, most actions have involved smaller, less
well-known insurers.
Lautro, which yesterday released its report on its enforcement activities
for the 12 months to June 30, said that in the latest year it had seen signs
of improving compliance with its rules on selling. But it noted 'that a
small number of the largest and most serious cases to occupy the Monitoring
Committee recently involved 'household name' life offices.'
Nevertheless, there were signs of improvement in the industry in the extent
to which it complied with Lautro rules on selling insurance. 'Members
performance appears better overall, though there is clearly still further
room for improvement,' the report said.
For instance, only 13 per cent to 16 per cent of life offices inspected
showed serious compliance shortcomings - down from 35 per cent during the
first round of inspection visits. Since Lautro began levying fines in 1992
for breaches of its rules, it has collected nearly Pounds 1m from companies.
Complaints from the public continued to grow, rising 35 per cent in the
period to 2,774. But Lautro noted that the rate of growth was lower than the
50 per cent recorded the year before.
Lautro's Monitoring Committee concluded in its report 'that the overall
improvement in standards needs to proceed further before Lautro can begin to
feel any real satisfaction at the success of its efforts'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Pounds 1.5m bribes for MoD man alleged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Ministry of Defence official took backhanders totalling Pounds 1.5m
in exchange for contracts placed with three foreign ammunition suppliers, a
court heard yesterday.
For nearly five years Mr Gordon Foxley, the MoD's ammunitions procurement
director, arranged for sums to be channelled into Swiss bank accounts,
Snaresbrook Crown Court in London was told.
Mr Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, told the jury the money came from three
companies, Fratelli Bortelli, of Milan, Italy; Gubruder Junghans, based in
Schramberg, Germany; and AS Raufoss, with offices in Gjovik, Norway.
He alleged that Mr Foxley, now 69, entered into 'corrupt arrangements' with
each one. 'It was agreed that he would receive secret commissions from these
companies based on the value of orders he placed or caused to be placed with
the companies.'
Mr Foxley, now retired, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, denies 12 charges
of corruption. Mr Temple claimed the payments - between December 1979 and
August 1984 - were based on 5 per cent of the contracts he arranged.
The case is expected to last two weeks.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Blow to women lawyers' prospects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE career prospects of women solicitors have been damaged by the recession,
a Law Society report says.
The economic crisis has made it even more difficult for women to become
partners, while their average annual earnings of Pounds 24,872 still lag
behind the Pounds 32,339 average for men.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Water body urges compensation rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER companies should increase compensation for poor service rather than
their directors' salaries, according to the Ofwat National Customer Council,
the industry watchdog.
The council said that the water companies were slow to handle complaints and
offer compensation. The council urged the industry to produce a code of
practice on compensation and demanded that companies be brought within the
scope of the Sale of Goods Act.
The water companies rejected the council's criticisms.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Value of fraud charges at Pounds 632m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of fraud charges brought in the UK courts was Pounds 632m in 33
separate cases during the first eight months of this year, figures in the
Fraud Barometer produced by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show. That
compares with Pounds 671m in charges from 84 cases for all of last year.
The firm said that fraud sentencing was inconsistent, with
disproportionately harsher sentences going to professional advisers who
abuse positions of trust, and to defendants aged under 40.

PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, electricity regulator, said yesterday he
would investigate concerns about regional power companies' profits as he
launched a review of their distribution businesses.
Distribution accounts for more than Pounds 4bn of the regional companies'
turnover. Charges relating to it represent about a quarter of electricity
bills.
Prof Littlechild invited public comment on issues including the relative
merits of price and profit controls, valuation of assets, costs of capital,
standing charges and energy efficiency measures.
Comments from the public and small businesses are being invited by the end
of December. They should be sent to the Office of Electricity Regulation,
Hagley House, Hagley Road, Birmingham B16 8QG.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Record year for unit trust sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NET SALES of unit trusts were Pounds 668.6m in September, down from Pounds
981.2m in August, Philip Coggan writes.
But the figure still took net sales for the year to date to Pounds 6.91bn,
more than in the whole of 1987, the previous record for a calendar year.
The popularity of personal equity plans, which offer tax-free returns, has
been a significant factor behind sales of unit trusts. Of net unit trust
sales of Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter, Pounds 612m was in Pep form.
Funds invested in unit trust Peps now amount to Pounds 6.5bn out of a unit
trust total of Pounds 84.1bn.
The slight dip in sales from August's total may have resulted from the
weaker performance of stock markets in September, although the markets have
rebounded to new highs this month.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Major to discuss Ulster peace move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hume-Adams proposals for peace in Northern Ireland will be discussed on
Friday by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish premier, it emerged yesterday.
The meeting was confirmed against a background of rising violence in Belfast
in the wake of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Protestant Shankill Road, which
killed 10 people.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he expected both prime
ministers to give the Hume-Adams initiative 'very serious attention on
Friday to see where the process can go from here'.
But Mr Major's determination not to alienate the Ulster Unionist party was
last night reflected by signs at Westminster that the government was now
ready to back unionist demands for the establishment of a Northern Ireland
select committee. The prime minister has denied that he did a deal with the
Ulster Unionists to avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the
Maastricht treaty earlier this year.
But with the tacit backing of Downing Street, the Commons procedure
committee is expected today to give a positive response to demands for a
select committee. Such a move would represent a clear signal of the
government's commitment to ensure that any settlement in the province would
have to secure the whole-hearted backing of the protestant community.
Extra troops and police were moved to Belfast from elsewhere in Northern
Ireland yesterday after two Roman Catholics were killed and six wounded in
two separate incidents.
Mr Major told the Commons the perpetrators of this week's terrorist attacks
would be 'hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law'.
However, the government ruled out the reintroduction of internment. Sir John
Wheeler, the Northern Ireland security minister, said there were 'no simple,
easy solutions'.
Downing Street continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put
forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political arm of the IRA.
Officials said Mr Major was willing to talk to Mr Reynolds, but was more
interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices
of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary.
In an indication of the sensitivity with which the issue is regarded in
London, Downing Street said neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds had asked for a
bilateral meeting in Brussels. British officials said the Brussels summit
offered a 'useful opportunity' for a meeting, but stressed that there was no
formal agenda.
Downing Street also continued to maintain that Mr Major had not seen the
Hume-Adams proposals, and was unaware of the details of the initiative.
Irish officials said the Shankill Road bombing had 'seriously damaged' the
Hume-Adams initiative, but Dublin appeared keen to keep the proposals alive.
Mr Spring said the two governments had an 'obligation' to look at 'any
opportunities' to bring about peace in Northern Ireland 'despite the (IRA)
atrocity of last weekend'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Smith appoints Quin to key post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday appointed Ms Joyce Quin, a
pro-EC moderate, to the key European affairs job on Labour's front bench.
Ms Quin, 49, replaces Mr George Robertson, the highly regarded rightwinger
who masterminded Labour's effective parliamentary campaign against the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Robertson, 47, who was elected to the shadow cabinet in last week's
elections, was promoted to shadow Scottish secretary in an earlier round of
appointments.
Ms Quin, who was a member of the European parliament for 10 years from 1979,
will be expected to exploit the government's continuing difficulties over
Europe.
Her first challenge will come early in the next session of parliament, when
the government must legislate to increase British contributions to the EC.
Rightwing Conservative backbenchers are already threatening to block the
bill.
Ms Quin will also deputise for Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign
secretary, who retained his high-profile job in spite of a lacklustre
reputation and a poor performance in the shadow cabinet elections.
The full list of appointments, which completes Mr Smith's front bench team,
includes four newcomers, and four MPs who served Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
leader.
The newcomers are Mr Nick Raynsford, who becomes a spokesman on London, Mr
Kim Howells (overseas development), Mr Bryan Davies (education), and Mr Adam
Ingram, (social security). Mr Ingram was Mr Kinnock's parliamentary private
secretary.
The MPs returning to the front bench are Mr George Howarth (environmental
protection), Mr John Garrett (Citizen's Charter), Mr Kevin Barron
(employment), and Mr Donald Anderson (defence).

FT  27 OCT 93 / Civil servants agree day of action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE civil service trade unions have voted for a one-day strike to protest
at the government's market testing and privatisation policies.
The unions, which represent about 300,000 staff, said the day of action on
November 5 would be the biggest seen in the civil service since 1981.
The action is likely to disrupt, but unlikely to halt, a wide range of
activities, from unemployment benefit offices to Customs checks.
Unions said yesterday that the objective was not so much to disrupt services
as to draw the public's attention to market testing.
The unions claim market testing, which compares the cost of services
provided by the public and private sectors, is the first step towards full
privatisation and a central part of the government's plans to 'sell off as
much of the civil and public services as it can'.
Leaders of the unions - the CPSA, NUCPS, the Inland Revenue Staff
Federation, the Northern Ireland Public Services Alliance and the Scottish
Prison Officers Association - described the vote in favour of action as
'overwhelming'. The combined total was 105,560 in favour and 64,987 against.
The Treasury, which is responsible for civil service pay and management,
said: 'We would regret any decision by the unions to proceed with this
unnecessary action.'

<TEXT>
TWO business deals were unveiled yesterday between South Africa and Japan,
indicating closer ties between the two in a post-sanctions environment.
A joint venture was unveiled between two of the world's leading ferrochrome
producers, Samancor and Nippon Denko - the first large investment by a
Japanese company since the lifting of sanctions - while the fuel and
chemicals group Sasol and Mitsui have formed a marketing and distribution
alliance for the handling of Sasol Chemical's hexene and pentene in Japan
and South Korea.
Sasol will supplement the current hexene production to meet the growing
demand in these markets and Mitsui will handle the marketing and
distribution.
Pentene is to be supplied by Sasol for production of polyethylene plastics.
Mitsui will work with a Japanese supplier on developing a market for this
product and other speciality chemical products in Japan and Korea.
Samancor and Nippon Denko, meanwhile, have formed a joint venture, NST
Ferrochrome, that produces charge chrome for the Japanese market at a 60,000
tonne per annum furnace located within Samancor's Tubatse ferrochrome plant.
NST uses the Tubatse infrastructure, and chrome from Samancor's nearby mine,
under a long-term agreement.
Samancor executives said the fact that Nippon Denko had ceased production of
charge chrome at its Hoporiku plant was a measure of their commitment to the
new deal.
Mr Kazuzo Kobayashi, president of Nippon Denko, said collaboration with
Samancor, who had the world's largest mineral and production resources in
its field, would ensure a stable and competitive supply of Ferrochrome to
Nippon Steel and other major Japanese stainless steel producers.

The Asian Development Bank yesterday approved a Dollars 76.5m (Pounds 50.6m)
soft loan for Vietnam, the ADB's first credit to the country since the end
of the Vietnam war in 1975, writes Victor Mallet from Bangkok.
The ADB's announcement from its headquarters in Manila was the latest move
by a multilateral institution to resume aid to Vietnam. The US decided in
July to stop opposing international assistance for Hanoi, allowing the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the ADB to finance the
country's economic reform programme and help repair its run-down
infrastructure.
The ADB's first loan, which is interest-free and repayable over 40 years
with a 10-year grace period, is to finance irrigation projects. The bank has
granted a further Dollars 1.8m for technical assistance to help develop
water resources.

A military coup in Burundi appeared to be faltering yesterday after army
generals asked the prime minister to come out of hiding and form a new
civilian government, writes Leslie Crawford from Nairobi.
But there were doubts about the army's true intentions and surviving members
of the former government did not abandon their refuge in the French embassy
in Bujumbura.
Speaking from the embassy, Ms Sylvie Kinigi, the prime minister, called on
Burundi's military to return to their barracks. Her address, broadcast on
state radio, announced an end to the dusk-to-dawn curfew. She said the
borders and international airport would re-open soon.
Army generals on Monday asked her to form a new government, blaming the coup
and the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye on a handful of mutinous
soldiers. But diplomats abroad said they believed that those now disowning
the coup had been its architects.

<TEXT>
A GUNMAN opened fire in the restaurant of a luxury tourist hotel in Cairo
last night, killing three people and severely wounding four others, writes
Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The attack is the worst on foreigners in Egypt in
the past 18 months, which has seen sporadic violence against tourists by
Islamic extremists.
Police said the gunman, who had been sitting in the Felucca restaurant of
the Semiramis Intercontinental Hotel, suddenly stood up and fired on diners
with a revolver.
The shooting is likely to be a devastating blow to Egypt's tourism industry,
already crippled by earlier attacks.
It happened on the same day as President Hosni Mubarak sought to assure his
US hosts in Washington that Egypt's recent security problems were resolved.
His confidence was based on a lull in attacks after security operations
against suspected militants.
An American, an Italian and a third person of unknown origin died in the
shooting, doctors said. The injured included another American, a Syrian and
a French citizen. The gunman and two others were arrested.
Last year an English woman was shot by extremists in Upper Egypt, while a
Turk and a Swede died in the bombing of a Cairo cafe in February.

<TEXT>
PALESTINIAN negotiators yesterday pressed Israel for a more rapid and
extensive release of prisoners as the two sides resumed peace talks at the
Egyptian resort of Taba. The talks, centring on the transfer of limited
powers to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of
Jericho, are due to be completed by mid-December.
The Palestinians, while welcoming this week's release of 617 prisoners,
stressed that many more of the estimated 11,000 still held had to be freed
to win greater popular support. They insisted that prisoners from factions
other than Fatah, headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, had to be included.
'We are not happy,' Palestinian delegate Ziad Abu Ziad said. 'We are trying
to make peace between Palestinians and Israelis, not between Israel and a
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. If peace has a broader
base it will have wider support.'
Israel has so far refused to free prisoners belonging to radical Islamic
groups, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Premier Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said yesterday that the agreement with the
PLO provided only for the release of a limited number of prisoners at this
stage. How many more could be freed would depend on progress made in the
peace talks.
In Damascus, one of the radical Palestinian groups opposed to the outline
peace agreement said it had agreed with Fatah to end clashes in the Gaza
strip. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said the agreement
was reached during talks between representatives of both groups.

IT WAS no roll call of honour. Indeed, some commentators called it an unholy
alliance of apartheid's children, the five leaders of South Africa's new
conservative Freedom Alliance facing the press together for the first time.
They posed for their team photo earlier this month in a nondescript Pretoria
hotel, in front the three black leaders, chief minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi
of Kwazulu, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei, President Lucas Mangope of
Bophuthatswana, and behind them the two Afrikaner leaders, Mr Ferdie
Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, and General Constand Viljoen
of the Afrikaner Volksfront. Many wrote it off disparagingly as stricken at
birth by internally contradictory policies.
When, however, only a few days after the alliance's formation, President F W
de Klerk told the Cape congress of the National party that a referendum
might be necessary to break an impending constitutional impasse, this
strange union began to appear in a different light.
Taken together the two events have brought into focus the key constitutional
conundrum facing South Africa: how to reconcile the power of the majority
with the fears of minorities.
This issue has always been at the heart of the constitutional debate. What
is now clearer than ever is that, despite nearly two years of negotiations,
it remains fundamentally unresolved.
The most obvious symptom of this is the alliance itself, representing a
considerable body of conservative opinion, which stands outside and wholly
opposed to the Multi-Party Negotiating Forum (MPNF) where the country's
constitutional talks are being held.
As President de Klerk said, the negotiating process has become bogged down
and needs to be revived. 'It cannot continue like this. Our country cannot
afford that negotiations lose their momentum. There is no question of
turning around.'
What recent events have made clear is that there are only two real options.
Either the government and the ANC, the dominant players at the
constitutional talks, are going to have to make significant concessions in
this next few weeks on the issue of a more federal system - which the
Freedom Alliance has made a central plank of its demands - to bring the
alliance back on board; or the government and the ANC are going to press
ahead without them.
The problem with the latter course is that it would require a referendum, in
which the MPNF obtained commanding public support, to legitimise it.
The ANC, after initially making supportive noises, has said it does not
support a referendum, apparently believing that for the ANC and Mr de
Klerk's NP to be seen supporting the same issue would be to lend the NP
undeserved credibility in the run-up to elections.
How to keep negotiations moving, preferably with, but possibly without, the
alliance is sure to be the main subject of discussion at the two-day retreat
where government and ANC negotiators are currently locked away.
To date the government has laid more stress on trying to accommodate the
alliance, while the ANC has been uncompromising in its commitment to
honouring existing timetables, in terms of which all outstanding
constitutional issues must be resolved by November 5. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,
ANC secretary general, said on Monday that if the Freedom Alliance was not
on board by then, the boat would leave without them.
Those commentators who believe the current draft constitution is still far
from federal, and who take the disruptive potential of the alliance more
seriously, take a more conciliatory line.
Among them is Professor Lawrence Schlemmer of the Human Sciences Research
Council and South Africa's pre-eminent pollster. He says the Freedom
Alliance probably now enjoys about the same level of support as the NP,
giving it a claim as the country's second-largest political grouping after
the ANC.
Recent polling data suggests the ANC would win 50-67 per cent of a popular
vote, while the NP is in the 12-17 per cent range.
Prof Schlemmer believes the Freedom Alliance needs to be taken seriously
because its decision to negotiate as a single bloc gives it considerable
leverage compared with when most or all of its constituents were negotiating
on an individual basis and were susceptible to being played off against each
other.
He says it is a much more formidable grouping than in its earlier
incarnations when it was little more than a loose assortment of parties that
had something to lose. Now, argues Professor Schlemmer, South Africa has
seen the emergence of a 'minority-based political position'.
He disagrees with those who say the alliance is an artificial construct. 'It
has a very, very coherent position. It is the minority rights position.'
There are many who caution against premature efforts to bludgeon the
alliance into line through a referendum. The newspaper Business Day argued
recently: 'A referendum majority, however large, will not shield the winners
from the violence that an exclusive settlement will bring.'
The same, of course, applies for efforts to proceed without the Alliance.
There is considerable support for the view that the current draft
constitution is not adequately federal in its nature. Professor Mervyn Frost
of Natal University argues that the various pretexts - minimum standards,
maintenance of economic unity, unreasonableness - whereby the central state
can interfere in the affairs of a region are inimical to federalism.
Political analysts are having increasingly to resort to the poker analogy
with the ANC and Freedom Alliance seemingly determined to go right down to
the wire before revealing whether they are prepared to make any compromises.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Japan takes the lead in resumption of aid to Kenya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JAPAN yesterday became the first donor government to resume financial
assistance to Kenya following an international freeze on aid of almost two
years.
The Japanese embassy in Nairobi said the Y8.25bn (Pounds 51.5m) loan was for
export development and balance of payments support.
The resumption of Japanese aid comes at a critical time for Kenya, which is
expected to present its case for financial rehabilitation at a consultative
group meeting of international donors in Paris next month.
World Bank and International Monetary Fund teams are currently in Nairobi
assessing the government's commitment to reform. But negotiations on a
medium-term economic programme, acceptable to the Kenyan government and the
IMF, are reportedly bogged down on the issue of para-statal reform and
corruption in the state sector.
The donor community suspended balance of payments support in November 1991,
citing President Daniel arap Moi government's poor record on human rights,
political freedom and economic mismanagement.
Japan's decision will be seen by Kenya as a reward for its progress with
reforms but it has placed Japan, Kenya's largest creditor, in an awkward
position in relation to the rest of the donor community.
Mr Masaki Koito, economic attache at the Japanese embassy, said the export
development credit, co-financed with the World Bank, had been negotiated
before the 1991 aid freeze. The World Bank had disbursed its Dollars 85m
share of the loan earlier this year, and Japan was doing so now because
Kenya had met all the 'technical conditions' of the programme, he said.
'This does not mean that we are fully satisfied with Kenya's economic
progress,' the Japanese diplomat added. 'Kenya still has to tackle
considerable reforms.'

FT  27 OCT 93 / Japan's economic indicators point to continued stagnation
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN'S economy is hovering between recovery and decline, the government's
official forecasting agency said yesterday.
The latest monthly report from the Economic Planning Agency showed that the
diffusion index of economic indicators stood at 50 last month, exactly the
dividing line between growth and contraction.
This is a slight improvement from July, when the index stood at 40, the
third consecutive month for which it had fallen below 50. The index measures
the economic outlook for the coming six months, but can be unreliable, since
it had indicated a recovery in the first four months of this year.
Among the index's components, money supply, machinery orders and housing
starts continued to rise in August, as in previous months. The main changes
in trend were job offers, which increased for the first time in five months,
and industrial stocks, which started to decline for the first time in six
months. Overall construction orders were down, however.
The agency's other two main indices showed a slight improvement in August.
The index of coincident indicators, which measures current economic
conditions, stood at 50.0 last month, against zero in July, while the index
of lagging indicators, which traces economic trends in the past, was at 42.9
in August, against a 21.4 a month earlier.
Agency officials warned that weak industrial production could pull the
coincident index back below 50 in September and October. Their fears were
reinforced yesterday by an announcement from Mazda, the car producer, that
it aims to make all its 25,000 staff take two extra days off in November on
reduced pay, to adjust production in line with reduced demand.
NKK, the steel group, will meanwhile cut managers' winter bonuses and senior
executives' salaries from November because of a fall in profits.
Japan will find it difficult to meet its target of 3.3 per cent growth in
gross national product this year, admitted Ms Manae Kubota, the economic
planning agency minister.
The EPA's forecast is generally seen, even by other government departments,
as optimistic. Most independent economists believe the economy will shrink
slightly or stagnate this year. The Industrial Bank of Japan yesterday
became the latest to downgrade its forecasts, from 0.6 per cent growth for
the year to next March, to a 0.3 per cent decline for the same period,
followed by a 0.3 per cent rise in 1994.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Bank moves in support of Canadian
Dollars - Market Reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Canada intervened to support the Canadian dollar yesterday as it
fell sharply following the results of the general election and worries about
a resurgence of separatism.
The central bank was seen selling US dollars and buying a volatile Canadian
currency as the latter initially fell more than 2 cents against its US
counterpart to hit a low of CDollars 1.326.
The Canadian dollar had weakened on electoral uncertainty but picked up just
before the result on the belief that a strong Liberal government was better
than a weak conservative one.
The Canadian currency steadied later to close in Toronto at CDollars 1.3118
to the US dollar. In contrast equities were less volatile with the TSE 300
index gaining 31.9 at 4,187.1 in moderate trading.
On Wall Street, economists were surprised by the extent of the Conservative
defeat. 'The joke around here is that it was the greatest defeat of any
standing government in the post-Babylonian era,' said Mr Bruce Kasman,
senior international economist with Morgan Stanley in New York.
'This wasn't just a defeat for the Conservatives,' said another analyst. 'It
was a total disappearance.' But opinions differed on the impact of the
Liberal victory on Canadian financial markets, mainly because of uncertainty
about the new Liberal government's economy policy.
Mr William Sterling, international economist with Merrill Lynch, said that
if Liberal leader Mr Jean Chretien 'goes for growth' with some form of
fiscal stimulus, Canadian bond and currency markets could suffer because of
the implications such a policy would have for the CDollars 35.5bn federal
deficit.
Economists say a lot depends on whether ratings agencies downgrade Canadian
government debt at the first sign of an expansionary fiscal policy. 'The
view in the markets is that the rating agencies are going to have quite a
bit of influence on how much latitude the incoming government has,' said Mr
Sterling.
As for US investors' view of Canadian markets, Mr Kasman said: 'Investors
here like the high yields relative to the US, but there is concern about the
role of the Bloc Quebecois in parliament, and concern about regional
framgmentation of the Canadian political scene.'
Mr Kasman believes the main risk in terms of financial markets is a
declining Canadian dollar. 'Investors know the Bank of Canada is already in
the mode of trying to ease interest rates, and is willing to accept the
price.'
That price is a further depreciation in the Canadian dollar.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Clinton seeks Dollars 10bn in cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton sent to Congress yesterday an additional Dollars 10bn
in spending cuts over the next five years and unveiled a simplified
government procurement programme that officials said could save as much as
Dollars 22.5bn over the same period.
Both proposals and their claimed economies are likely to meet stiff
challenges in Congress. A bipartisan group under Congressman Tim Penny, the
Minnesota Democrat, is pressing for an extra Dollars 100bn spending cuts,
while Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, conceded congressional experts
believed the changes in purchasing rules might yield only Dollars
3bn-Dollars 5bn.
Under the Clinton proposal, Dollars 1.5bn would be saved by cutting existing
programmes, such as ending federal subsidies for wool, mohair and honey
production. The rest would come from assorted savings across government,
most notably in the Department of Agriculture, brought about under the
auspices of the National Performance Review directed by Vice-President Al
Gore.
The first part of yesterday's package is incomplete, officials said, because
Congress has yet to finalise four appropriations bills for the current
fiscal year, which began this month. Further cuts of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn
will be sent to Congress when the bills have passed.
Mr Clinton sounded defensive on the size of the spending cuts, saying: 'If
they aren't passed, I'll come back with more.' But he waxed more eloquent on
efficiency savings, claiming they could free funds for greater law and
narcotics enforcement.
He signed an executive order under which federal agencies will begin
accepting contract bids by computer, with the ultimate goal that this will
apply to all the estimated 20m contracts worth a total Dollars 200bn the
government signs each year. It is also intended that all federal salary and
pension payments be made by electronic transfer.
Changed purchasing rules would also increase to Dollars 100,000 from Dollars
25,000 the size of contracts that can awarded without extensive auditing
procedures. This, the president claimed, would open up many opportunities to
small businesses.
But the main target was simplifying defence procurement, with the aim of
obliging the military to buy supplies off-the-shelf at best prices.

THE European Community is to join the US push to make Asian and Latin
American countries open their financial services markets more widely as the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks comes to a climax.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary in charge of
international affairs, said yesterday the EC had agreed to follow the US
example by sending high-level officials to several emerging markets in an
effort to 'help unblock the Geneva logjam.'
Mr Summers said the Clinton administration's decision to back legislation
authorising restrictions on the expansion of banks and financial service
companies from countries which do not allow equal access to US businesses
would serve as a lever to secure additional concessions in the sector before
the conclusion of the Uruguay round.
'The offers from many of the participants in the negotiations are simply not
good enough,' he said.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Prospects rise for steady growth - There
have been productivity improvements / The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Liberal party inherits a domestic economy in vastly better shape
than the one it left when it was last in office in the early 1980s.
After more than two years of severe recession, a gradual economic recovery
has begun. The Conference Board of Canada recently predicted GDP will rise
by 2.4 per cent in real terms this year, accelerating to 3 per cent growth
in 1994 and 3.5 per cent in 1995.
Inflation is below 2 per cent, well ahead of the targets set by the outgoing
Progressive Conservative government two years ago. Meanwhile interest rates
have tumbled to their lowest levels in two decades.
While the recession and free trade with the US have brought pain to many
Canadian businesses and their workers, they have also encouraged significant
improvements in productivity.
Mr William Macdonald, Toronto lawyer and economic consultant, says Canada is
4-5 years into a 12-year restructuring which, if successful, could give it
one of the best combinations in the industrial world of mutually reinforcing
monetary, fiscal, exchange rate and trade policies.
The Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief
executives of the country's biggest companies, said yesterday that its
judgment of the Liberals would depend on their handling of four issues:
government spending, free trade with the US and Mexico, tax reform and
monetary policy.
All major parties promised in the election campaign to contain or cut the
federal government's CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn) budget deficit.
The Liberals said they would bring the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP,
from its present level of 5.2 per cent. However, economists are nervous that
with two regional parties on opposition benches and the threat of Quebec
secession, the Liberals will be hard-pressed to resist demands to loosen the
purse-strings.
One of the most crucial decisions facing the new government is whether to
reappoint Mr John Crow, Bank of Canada governor, to a second seven-year
term. Mr Crow's first term expires early next year.
Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader, suggested before the campaign began that
Mr Crow, whom many Canadians blame for the recent tough times, would have to
go, but party officials have showed an appreciation recently of Mr Crow's
value in bolstering foreign investor confidence.
The Liberals are more pragmatic and business-oriented than they were under
Mr Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s and early 80s. But the party also still
contains an interventionist and nationalist wing.
The degree to which the new government will be willing to accommodate
business's - and especially foreign investors' - preferences in economic
policy will become clear when it tables its first budget and decides on Mr
Crow's future.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Hopes fade for UK-Italian helicopter
purchase - Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES were fading yesterday in the UK and Canadian aerospace industries over
the fate of a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.85bn) Canadian order for helicopters
from a UK-Italian consortium.
Mr Jean Chretien, the leader of the triumphant Liberal party, promised
during his campaign that an incoming Liberal government's first acts would
include cancelling the order for the EH-101 helicopters, which was placed in
October 1992 by the outgoing Progressive Conservative government.
Westland, the UK partner in the EH101, said yesterday that it would 'wait
and see' how Mr Chretien acted. But it is clearly bracing itself for the
loss of the order, which would cut Pounds 400m off its Pounds 1.9bn order
book.
The original order was for 35 sea patrol helicopters and 15 search and
rescue variants. However, a cut to 43 in total was mooted as part of the
government's budget reduction programme.
The main contractors for the helicopter are EH Industries, a joint venture
between the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy, and Paramax, a Canadian
company controlled by Unisys of the US.
EH Industries would have supplied the basic aircraft, while on-board systems
would be provided by Paramax.
Opponents of the deal argue that such a large order for essentially defence
aircraft used, for example, in submarine hunting, was inappropriate to a
post-cold war defence policy.
The deal's supporters argue that the Canadian forces urgently need to
replace their ageing fleet of Sea King and Labrador helicopters.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Quebec 'headed towards freedom'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, was in no doubt
as to the import of his party's strong showing in Monday's poll. 'This
election is a pivotal point in the process towards sovereignty. Independence
is the only remaining option after Canadians twice failed to amend the
constitution to accommodate Quebec nationalism,' he said.
The new parliament would reflect the real nature of Canada. 'There are two
countries in Canada. Starting today these two countries must begin talking
together more frankly right in parliament.'
A former member of Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet, Mr
Bouchard walked out in 1990 over the Meech Lake constitutional accord, on
the grounds that Quebec did not get enough out of the plan.
In the three years since he has built the BQ into the most popular party in
the province and the legitimate voice in parliament of most of its
French-speaking majority.
Yet despite the BQ's impressive sweep of 54 of the province's 75 seats,
federalists in Quebec have far from given up the fight. Mr Bernard Roy,
former chief of Cabinet for Premier Brian Mulroney and head of the Montreal
Chamber of Commerce, said: 'English Canada will never tolerate a separatist
party in the Commons forming the official Opposition.' How can the Bloc
represent all Canada? The Bloc got two-thirds of the Quebec seats with only
half the vote. We've see primarily a protest vote.'
Mr Bouchard was careful to preserve a conciliatory tone when he addressed
party workers in his campaign headquarters in Alma, Quebec. 'We're not out
to destroy federal institutions and Canada, but to win a better deal for
Quebec,' he said in English.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Tradition of give and take is swept away
 -A virtual revolution in Canadian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a full-blooded revolution could have matched the upheaval in Canadian
politics caused by the general election on Monday.
Canada's diverse cultures and regions have until now accommodated themselves
within two or three national parties. The Liberals, the Progressive
Conservatives and most recently the New Democrats have deep differences on
economic and social policies. But they have shared a commitment to a united
and stable country where each linguistic group and region gives a little and
gets a little.
That tradition will be severely tested in the new parliament. Only the
Liberals, who swept to victory on Monday with 178 out of 295 seats, remain
as a force dedicated to keeping the country in one piece through compromise
rather than confrontation.
The Conservatives and the New Democrats suffered such devastating setbacks
that they have lost their status as official parties, losing some of their
parliamentary privileges.
Despite winning about one-seventh of the popular vote, the Tories' presence
in the House of Commons has been slashed from 157 to two. The left-leaning
NDP's representation has shrunk from 44 to 8.
In their place will be two unashamedly regional groups: the Bloc Quebecois,
which will form the official opposition, and the Reform party, the
right-of-centre group based in western Canada.
The Bloc's leader, Mr Lucien Bouchard, has given notice that he will use its
substantial representation in Ottawa to further the cause of Quebec
independence. In particular, the Bloc is likely to try to build support for
its provincial wing, the Parti Quebecois, which faces a provincial election
towards the end of next year. The separatists have promised to hold an
independence referendum within a year, if the PQ comes to office.
The 53 Reform party MPs, almost all of them from Alberta and British
Columbia, could be among Mr Bouchard's most effective weapons in his
struggle for independence.
While Reform leader Mr Preston Manning insists that he wants to keep Canada
in one piece, his conditions for 'renewing the federation' - in particular
his insistence that Quebec be given exactly the same constitutional
treatment as the other nine provinces - are totally unacceptable to Quebec.
Reform also opposes official bilingualism. Whatever the party's official
position, many of its supporters would shed no tears if Quebec went its own
way.
Containing these centrifugal forces will be one of the biggest challenges
facing the new Liberal government under Mr Jean Chretien. However, few
Canadian politicians are better suited to the task. Mr Chretien, aged 59, is
a Quebecois but believes passionately in a united Canada.
He is a veteran of almost every constitutional debate of the past three
decades. Having entered parliament for the first time 30 years ago, Mr
Chretien held almost every major portfolio under former prime minister
Pierre Trudeau.
Mr Chretien has been widely reviled in Quebec in recent years for, among
other things, opposing the 1987 Meech Lake accord, which would have given
the province significant extra powers. But his ability to make a comeback
was demonstrated by his unexpectedly large victory on Monday in his home
constituency of Saint-Maurice in the eastern part of the province.
There were other crumbs of consolation for federalists from the election
result. One was that the Liberal landslide stretched across the country. The
Liberals won seats in all 10 provinces, and Mr Chretien's cabinet is likely
to reflect that diversity.
Furthermore, one of the two Conservatives to retain their seats was Mr Jean
Charest, the youthful deputy prime minister who was beaten by Ms Kim
Campbell last June for the party leadership.
Mr Charest is a bilingual and personable Quebecois who demonstrated during
the leadership campaign that he also has a substantial following outside the
province. It would be surprising if he did not play a leading role in the
coming constitutional wrangle.
Reform and BQ will be sending a large contingent of neophyte MPs to Ottawa.
Reform's unity, in particular, will be tested by the contrast between Mr
Manning's autocratic style, and the party platform's promise of looser
parliamentary discipline and greater accountability by MPs to their
constituents.
However, the two parties have yet to prove that they are more than
short-lived wonders likely to end up as fractious protest groups. Both owe
much of their support to voters' deep-rooted desire for change after the
tough years of Tory rule, rather than loyalty to their respective platforms.
Their support may drift away once the economy picks up.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Liberal party softens its approach to
freer trade - Trade Pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Liberal party has substantially softened its stand on North
American free trade since the last general election in 1988. During that
election, which they lost, the Liberals made abrogation of the US-Canada
free trade pact a key plank of their policy platform.
By this year's campaign, however, the Liberals had pledged only to seek
renegotiation of some elements of the 1989 accord, the FTA, and the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico. 'Abrogating trade
agreements should only be a last resort if satisfactory changes cannot be
negotiated,' the Liberals' campaign platform said.
Nafta is due to come into force on January 1 1994. Diplomats and political
observers predict that, with a little help from President Bill Clinton, the
US Congress and the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the Liberals
will eventually sign on to Nafta in time to meet the implementation date.
The outgoing Progressive Conservative government pushed Nafta enabling
legislation through Parliament last summer. Only formal promulgation is
required to put it into law.
The Liberals pledged in the campaign to seek four specific 'improvements' to
the FTA and Nafta: a subsidies code, an anti-dumping code, a more effective
dispute settlement mechanism, and the same protection for Canadian energy
producers as is envisaged for Mexico.
Some Liberal concerns would be addressed if the Uruguay Round is
successfully wrapped up this year. The previous Conservative government
tried but failed to negotiate a subsidies package in the 1989 FTA.
Anti-Nafta pressure on Mr Chretien would also be eased if the US Congress
ratifies Nafta. Votes are scheduled in the Senate and the House of
Representatives next month.
On other issues, diplomats predict that Ottawa and Washington will find a
face-saving formula which will enable Mr Chretien to point out that his
concerns are being met, and allow him to proceed with implementation of
Nafta. A visit to Washington will be among the new prime minister's early
priorities.
President Clinton said yesterday he did not expect the election to have an
impact on Nafta.
The results of the election should also make it easier for Mr Chretien to
press ahead with Nafta. The left-leaning New Democratic Party, the only
parliamentary group unambiguously opposed to Nafta, ended up with only eight
seats in the House of Commons. The two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois
and the Reform party, which will form the bulk of the opposition, generally
favour the free trade agreements.
Even within the Liberal party itself, support for free trade is more vocal
and opposition more muted than it was five years ago.

<TEXT>
THE US yesterday postponed the imposition of economic sanctions against
Japan after Tokyo announced plans to inject fresh competition into its
scandal-ridden public sector construction market.
This is the first tangible sign of improved US-Japanese relations since the
arrival in August of the coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, which
has pleased the Clinton administration by promising to scrap restrictive
practices and to cut red tape generally.
It comes against a backdrop of continuing serious differences between Tokyo
and Washington on foreign access to all Japan's markets. But it indicates
that Japan and the US are on the way to resolving differences on public
procurement in construction, which had threatened to provide another
stumbling block to completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade
liberalisation talks.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would recommend to
President Bill Clinton a delay until January 20 in the sanctions against
Japan which had been due to go into effect on November 1. In the meantime,
the US will monitor Japanese reform efforts.
The Japanese proposals would make it easier for foreign companies to tender
for construction projects by national and regional government and agencies,
worth Y8,527bn (Pounds 53.2bn) this year, according to the finance ministry.
That is, however, a small fraction of the total private and public sector
construction market, estimated to be worth at least Y100,000bn by Mr
Etsusuke Masuda, director of equity research at Salomon Brothers Asia.
Tougher penalties against companies caught bribing officials or rigging bids
are also proposed. This is a response to the widening net of construction
industry scandals, involving Japan's top six construction companies,
uncovered by public prosecutors over the past few months.
The plan proposes that open bidding will be allowed for projects above
specific thresholds, in contrast to the present system in which only
companies designated by procurement authorities can tender, a prime source
of corruption.
The plan does not specify the threshold above which projects will be
available for open bidding, expected to be set at around Y700m, say
officials. Until now, Japan has insisted on a threshold of Y1.5bn. The new
proposal would bring Japan closer to the Dollars 4.5m per contract threshold
preferred by most Gatt members.
Foreign bidders would be assessed on technical merit, rather than, as now,
on their inevitably skimpy record in Japan.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Foreigners will still face uphill task to
win orders - It will take more than official good intentions to break open
the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese government's proposals to open up the construction market to
foreign companies may appease US government officials and help to avert
sanctions. But it is likely to take more than the formal blessings of
Japanese officials for foreign companies to win a greater share of Japan's
public procurement construction market.
'If a foreign company really wants to participate in the market they will
benefit from the new proposals,' says Mr Akira Rokuhara, executive director
of the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private institute.
He believes they will be able to win contracts in these areas.
For a foreign construction company keen to do business as a general
contractor in Japan, recruiting the large numbers of experts they would need
to undertake general contracting work is no easy task.
Such experts are only available at the established Japanese construction
companies and without such a skilled workforce with knowledge of the
Japanese industry, foreign companies are likely to find it extremely
difficult to carry out general contracting work.
Meanwhile, the options of acquiring a Japanese company or forming a joint
venture with one, providing foreign companies with access to a skilled
workforce, are also limited, says Mr Peter Hedges, chief representative of
Trafalgar House Corporate Development Tokyo.
'There is a natural inertia and unwillingness to change; unless these
companies are being pushed hard by price and political pressure,' they are
generally unwilling to enter joint ventures meaningful for the foreign
partner, he points out.
If the experience of foreign companies in other Japanese markets are any
guide, it will also take foreign companies considerable time to build up a
reputation for reliability which, in Japan, often counts for more than price
competitiveness in winning business.
'Since we use taxpayers' money we must be sure the company is reliable,' an
official at the Ministry of Construction explains, in defending the Japanese
system of awarding contracts to designated bidders. 'If bids are opened to
any company, the danger exists that the work will be of bad quality. There
is a trade-off between transparency and reliability.'
Mr Rokuhara points out that 'in construction it is not possible easily to
compare the end products, as it is in electronics. So a lot depends on
whether or not a company is reliable.'
But while the government's new guidelines call for 'objective, transparent
and publicly stated criteria' in determining a company's reliability, in
Japan reliability is more often judged by local reputation than objective
standards.
US computer companies, for example, in spite of pre-eminence in world
markets, face an uphill struggle in the Japanese public procurement market.
Japan's construction market, like many others the target of US criticism, is
built on a network of relationships developed over a long time.
Trafalgar House, for one, is not counting on the new proposals to help it
win greater business in Japan. Although the UK company has won large public
works contracts internationally, it is not looking to enter the Japanese
market as a general contractor. 'We're more concerned with establishing the
relationships that will help us build up business,' Mr Hedges says.

FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US demands could hurt rival exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is pressing Japan to make firm commitments to boost imports of US
goods, potentially discriminating against European and other exporters to
Japan.
The US request, in the form of a written proposal, was given to the Japanese
government last week in bilateral trade talks. It calls for the agreement
between the two countries of what amounts to targets in increasing purchases
of US cars and car parts.
The nature of the proposal calls into question persistent US claims that it
is neither setting targets, nor pressing US interests at the expense of
other countries, as it seeks to prise open Japan's market.
The proposals made by each side in the talks have not been revealed
publicly. The US has indicated that it was only trying to pursuade Japan to
bring the level of its market openness to the standard of other G7
countries.
However, while the US proposal does not use the word target, it uses the
same wording as the bilateral semiconductor arrangement which forced Japan
to meet the market share for foreign semiconductor manufacturers targetted
by the agreement.
Furthermore, while the US also calls for agreeing effective targets for the
sale of non-Japanese motor vehicles and vehicle parts, by attempting to set
a separate target for US and non-US products, the US proposal as it stands
in effect puts pressure on Japanese companies to purchase US products rather
than those of other non-Japanese motor parts makers, including European
companies.
The distinction between non-Japanese motor and motor parts makers in the US
proposal also discriminates against sales by foreign car makers with
Japanese capital. This would include Rover, the UK company in which Honda
has a stake, as well as Japanese transplants in the UK.
Japan has repeatedly opposed targets for foreign product sales on the
grounds this would lead to managed trade.

THE European Community yesterday warned the US that it must improve its
offer on market access if there is to be any chance of meeting the December
15 deadline for resolving the Uruguay Round talks on world trade reform.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, after briefing EC foreign
ministers on the talks, said the deadline was 'within our reach, but not yet
within our grasp'.
Sir Leon will give a written account of the talks when EC foreign ministers
meet in Brussels on November 8 - a meeting at which France and its allies
are expected to press their misgivings about the Uruguay Round. The
ministers had shown 'overwhelming support for the view that the American
response on market access. . . was inadequate,' he said.
At July's Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations, the Quad
group - the US, Japan, Canada and the EC - agreed to cut 'peak tariffs' of
over 15 per cent by half. The EC has lodged an 'illustrative offer' along
these lines at the Geneva talks, and is challenging the US and Japan to
'respond to what we are doing,' as Sir Leon put it.
The commissioner said that the EC had 101 peak tariffs covering Ecu1.1bn
(Pounds 855m) in imports, whereas the US had 683 covering Ecu17.3bn, and
Japan 495 covering Ecu2.7bn. 'It is of course the high tariffs which are the
real obstacle' on market access, he said.
On the Blair House farm trade agreement between the EC and the US, to which
the EC, driven by French threats to scupper the Uruguay Round, is seeking
additions, Sir Leon declared: 'It is not for the French to move on Blair
House; the ball is in the American court.'
He implied that the US refusal to discuss Blair House or farm trade was
linked to Washington's current absorption in getting the North American Free
Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico through Congress on November 17.
Sir Leon nevertheless signalled further progress on talks with the US for a
special regime for audio-visual, cinema and broadcasting trade to protect
European cultural interests, and said other negotiations with the US were
continuing quietly.

SUPPORT for a swift and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks came yesterday from consumer organisations and the
Czech Republic, amid rising anxiety in Geneva over slippage in the
negotiating timetable.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, has called a meeting of the
top-level Trade Negotiations Committee for November 1, where he is likely to
urge renewed efforts to thrash out a tariff-cutting deal.
This month's failure by the US, EC, Japan and Canada to agree on lower trade
barriers for farm and industrial goods means a comprehensive market access
package for all 116 participants cannot be completed by November 15 as had
been hoped.
But Mr Sutherland is still pressing for most of the package to be settled by
then, minimising the number of unresolved issues for the 'end-game' in the
final month before the Round's December 15 deadline.
The International Organisation of Consumers Unions yesterday told Mr
Sutherland that while the package on the table was not perfect, it promised
a big improvement, and was 'incomparably better' than the chaos that would
follow a breakdown in the talks.
IOCU, which represents 180 consumer organisations in 70 countries, urged
Round negotiators to ignore the calls of protectionists and put the
interests of consumers first. Mr James Firebrace, IOCU director-general,
said all consumers suffered because of protectionism.
Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, trade minister of the Czech Republic, who also saw Mr
Sutherland yesterday, said a successful Uruguay Round conclusion was
essential to combat protectionist pressures and provide the increased access
to foreign markets his country needed for future growth.
Poland, Hungary and Slovakia shared this view, he added. The casualties of a
Uruguay Round failure would be, in the short term, trade, in the medium
term, world economic growth, and long term, perhaps global political
stability. If strong regionalism and protectionist barriers were allowed to
flourish, 'you could end up with a war, after a decade, in different parts
of the world'.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Doubts over German nuclear industry: SPD rejects plans for
new generation of extra-safe reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats yesterday rejected plans to allow
development of a new generation of extra-safe nuclear reactors in the
country, throwing into doubt the future of the German nuclear industry.
The decision by the national executive of the SPD was immediately condemned
by leaders of the governing coalition as undermining the fundamental
development prospects of the German economy.
It throws into doubt the year-long efforts to negotiate a cross-party
'energy consensus' intended to provide a clear framework for the investment
plans of the energy industry, including both domestic coal mining and
nuclear power.
It also calls into question the long-term future of the German coal
industry, which has survived so far on a mixture of direct subsidy paid by
electricity consumers and cross-subsidies from nuclear power paid by the
electricity generators.
The SPD, which controls the governments of several key states in the federal
republic where nuclear plants operate, also declared its determination to
switch from reprocessing nuclear waste - in Britain and France - to direct
disposal.
However, the party leadership has left open the question of how long the
present generation of nuclear plants may be allowed to operate, thus giving
Germany's electricity generators a chance to plan the gradual abandonment of
nuclear energy. It also set no timescale for the switch from reprocessing to
direct disposal, for which there are no sites currently available in
Germany.
In spite of its decision, the SPD remains divided on the nuclear issue.
While the environmental wing of the party is fiercely opposed, those who
come from coal-mining areas, like the Ruhr, are sympathetic. They believe
that Germany's expensive domestic coal industry can only be guaranteed a
long-term future if its high cost can be offset by the much cheaper supply
of nuclear-generated power.
The SPD decision was announced after the party's national executive rejected
a compromise put forward by Mr Gerhard Schroder, the prime minister of the
state of Lower Saxony, allowing a continuing 'nuclear option'.
The decision amounts to a severe blow to Germany's nuclear power plant
manufacturers, led by Siemens KWU, but a compromise with which the two main
electricity generators, RWE and Veba, can live.
The third main power generator, the Munich-based Bayernwerk, is heavily
committed to nuclear energy, and therefore strongly opposed to any
non-nuclear option. Without a cross-party compromise on energy, the power
generators say they have no clear framework for their long-term power
station planning.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, who negotiated the compromise
with Mr Schroder, expressed his regret at the SPD decision. 'I cannot see
how, under these circumstances, a energy consensus can still be achieved,'
he said. Negotiations scheduled for tonight will still go ahead, he said.
'Failure of the talks would be a bitter setback for Germany's economic base,
for which the SPD would be responsible.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 16 leading industrial organisations in Germany, headed by the employers'
federation, yesterday pledged their support for the government's campaign to
revive German industrial competitiveness.
In a joint declaration issued from the Petersberg guest house outside Bonn,
they admitted that far too many German enterprises had failed to invest in
cost control measures and new technologies, to prepare for the downturn in
the German and world economies. 'We have the responsibility for introducing
new products and using new production techniques,' they said. 'It is up to
us to ensure and reinforce the position of research and development within
our enterprises.'
The declaration pledged the employers' support for measures to open new
markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific area, and to improve the level of
training of their workforces.
At the same time they warned that cutting production costs meant reducing
capacity to the level of market demand, and often job cuts were inevitable.
As far as national wage-bargaining is concerned, they promised support for
the maintenance of industry-wide contracts, while urging that they should be
more flexible, and more in tune with the needs of individual enterprises.
The industrial leaders held a meeting at the Petersberg with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and government ministers to seal their declaration, seen as an
important gesture of reconciliation in a government-business relationship
which has frequently been uneasy.
For his part, Mr Kohl urged both sides of industry to concentrate on
introducing more flexible working times and regulations, to expand the use
of part-time working greatly, and to slow the trend towards early
retirement.
He warned that Germany's education system had become too extended and too
academic, leaving the small business sector without the necessary recruits
to maintain its traditional strength.

MR Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister defeated by the
socialists in this month's general election, resigned yesterday as leader of
the conservative New Democracy party.
Mr Mitsotakis, 75, is the first of Greece's veteran political leaders
collectively dubbed the 'dinosaurs' to make way for a younger successor.
Four former cabinet ministers have declared themselves candidates for the
leadership. Mr Mitsotakis announced he would step down two weeks ago, when
Mr Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement won the election by a
larger margin than had been expected.
Frontrunner in the leadership contest is Mr Miltiades Evert, 54, who has
opposed the conservatives' privatisation policy. The new party leader will
be elected next week.

   NIZHNY NOVOGOROD, RUSSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR YEVGENY Mikheyev, director of the Niva farm near Nizhny Novogorod, flung
open the door of a cowshed and declared: 'We need reform to make this farm
work] We have to get rid of the layabouts and the drunks]' It is a sentiment
that could prove important, not just around Nizhny Novogorod, but across
Russia.
Yesterday in Moscow, Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, together
with the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector
arm, unveiled an agricultural reform programme designed to break up Russia's
vast state system.
And as Niva is one of six farms to pilot the scheme, the fate of its reforms
is likely to be a crucial test, as Russia tackles the sector of its economy
most resistant to change.
Mr Gaidar said a policy to redistribute agricultural land should be
introduced across Russia, supported by a decree - expected to be signed this
week by President Boris Yeltsin -
revoking an effective ban on the sale of land, paving the way for mortgages,
leasing and trading. The moratorium on sales or leases has been a key factor
blocking real change.
The Russian government has introduced some reforms in the past two years,
creating a new class of 'private' farmers, and forcing the state farms to
register as independent 'companies', but the impact has been limited.
Private farmers still control less than 4 per cent of registered farm land
and the 'reorganisation' of the state farms, which control more than 90 per
cent of land, has largely been theoretical.
But though the need for market reforms is clear, the strong collective
traditions of the Russian farmers have left the reformers facing a serious
logistical problem: how do you break up huge farms in a manner that seems
equitable, without creating unworkably small plots of land?
The solution that the IFC and Nizhny Novogorod leaders proposed to the
villagers in Niva last weekend is based around two key concepts.
The first is a land and property certificate, an elegant piece of paper
awarding each member of the farm a share of the land and property. Although
the land is divided equally the property shares are graded by job and age.
The second key concept is an 'auction', which determines which farmers get
which pieces of land. Although the IFC hopes that in most cases this will be
decided by mutual agreement, competing demands will be decided by an
auction, using the property certificates to 'bid' for disputed pieces of
land.
Mr Viktor Khlystun, agriculture minister, stressed yesterday that there
would be some limits on the sales. Outsiders - and by implication,
foreigners - would not be allowed to buy land at the expense of local
villagers, since 'it would be wrong for a citizen to acquire land to hire
labour', he said.
The type of farm which will emerge from this scheme is deliberately left
unclear. The crucial aspect is that the scheme allows farmers to trade, sell
or lease their certificates. Thus they can farm alone, join together in a
collective, or even 'sell' their land to a individual in the village.
As Mr Boris Nemtsov, reformist governor of Nizhny Novogorod, explains: 'The
essence of this is choice.' Whether the villagers themselves want it is
unclear. At the meeting in Niva to hand out certificates, opinions varied
sharply. Although Mr Mikheyev is enthusiastic and some villagers are vowing
to go it alone, others angrily supported the old system; many more seemed
simply confused.
Ultimately, the scheme's success will depend on how many other farm
directors like Mr Mikheyev can be found, and how far they can persuade the
rest of the farmers to follow them.

<TEXT>
MR ARKADY VOLSKY, head of Russia's Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, announced yesterday he would head a revived 'centrist'
alliance in the country's parliamentary elections.
The party, to be called Civic Union for Stability, Justice and Progress,
represents a powerful new force to challenge the main government-sponsored
alliance, Russia's Choice.
It is promising both to promote free enterprise and to increase the
'manageability' of the state-owned economy.
Other candidates on the party's electoral list include leading
industrialists such as Mr Nikolai Bekh, head of Kamaz, the country's biggest
truck manufacturer.
According to the party's programme released yesterday, Russia's problems
stem not from enemies within, but from 'stupidity, incompetence and
dishonesty' at the top,
For this reason, Mr Volsky said, it could co-operate with forces as varied
as the Agrarian party, which represents the state farm lobby, and Mr Grigory
Yevlinsky, the prominent economist, who wants more effective economic reform
and a strong federal state.
He suggested that his group might even endorse Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, who was being shunned by radicals in Russia's Choice.
Meanwhile, in a further attempt to distance himself from the cabinet, Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and head of the Russian Unity and
Accord party, said yesterday he was giving up his government salary. He also
attacked the government's privatisation programme.
Mr Volsky's new party title, replacing the shorter Civic Union, is an
attempt to shake off previous associations with disgraced former
vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, one of the leaders of the recent
parliamentary rebellion.

The attack on the failure of management to improve results after a shake-up
two years ago represents a significant toughening in the authorities'
attitudes towards financial instititutions in which the state has stakes.
The Treasury has 14 per cent of Banco di Sicilia, the remainder being held
by a foundation controlled by the regional government. The bank is
understood to have just balanced its books in 1992 but risks a loss this
year. Some L3,000bn (Pounds 1.24bn) of bad loans are reported.

SALARIED workers in Italy declare higher average earnings and pay more taxes
than businessmen, writes Robert Graham in Rome. This trend, long suspected
by the tax authorities, has been confirmed by finance ministry research.
It is based on 1990 returns of 28.6m Italians and was undertaken following
the discovery by tax inspectors on random assessments that employers were on
occasions declaring earnings three times less than that of their employees.
Analysis of returns also produced the extraordinary finding that almost 40
percent of the 340,000 businesses subject to corporation tax had avoided
payment. This was because they either declared earnings below the taxable
minimum or reported losses.

THE United Nations yesterday suspended delivery of emergency aid to more
than 1m people stranded in central Bosnia until warring Croat and Moslem
forces guarantee the safety of relief workers.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, took the decision after UN
convoys on Monday were hit by machine gun and mortar fire, killing a Danish
lorry driver and wounding nine workers.
Lord Owen, the European Community's peace mediator, told EC foreign
ministers in Luxembourg yesterday he was sceptical about using force to get
supplies through to people as winter approached.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday that the area under
suspension included Mostar in the south-west, and towns in central Bosnia
where Croats and Moslems were fighting. Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UNHCR, said
operations would start once the parties gave credible guarantees for safe
passage.
The decision to suspend some aid convoys would make it extremely difficult
for people in some areas such as Mostar, although others would still get
help, Lord Owen said. The idea of creating a 'safe route' from the Adriatic
coast to Sarajevo was being considered, but he pointed to enormous problems
with using force.
President Francois Mitterrand called on Monday for help, including US
military protection, to force open the road to Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, a renegade Bosnian army commander accused of running a criminal
gang surrendered to Moslem-led government troops in Sarajevo yesterday after
a day of gunbattles in the centre of the city, Bosnian state radio said.
Ramiz Delalic, commander of the army's Ninth Brigade and better known as
'Celo', gave himself up to troops ringing his headquarters. Twenty five
civilian hostages were freed.
The radio said troops were still pursuing a more powerful alleged army crime
kingpin, Musan Topalovic, commander of the 10th Mountain Brigade.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD TAPIE, the controversial French politician and businessman,
yesterday announced that he plans soon to resign as chairman of
Olympique-Marseille (O-M), the scandal-scarred football club.
He broke the news in an interview with L'Equipe, the sports newspaper,
adding that his position at O-M was incompatible with his political
ambitions.
Mr Tapie, who has a seat in parliament as an independent Socialist and had a
short stint as urban affairs minister in the last Socialist government,
plans to lead a group of left-wing radicals in next June's European
elections. He is also expected to stand as mayor of Marseilles in the next
general election.
However, Mr Tapie, who took over O-M in 1986 and has since invested around
FFr130m (Pounds 15m) in the club to turn it into France's top team, said he
had not yet finalised plans for his departure.
He told L'Equipe he had already 'made contact' with prospective investors in
the Marseilles team. He had received inquiries from 'a big furniture
manufacturer, an upmarket jeweller and a department store chain'.
O-M is struggling to stabilise its finances following its ban from this
season's European Cup, which it won last spring - the first French club to
do so. It has since been sullied by the scandal over allegations that its
officials tried to bribe players from another French team to rig one of last
season's league games.

FT  27 OCT 93 / High flier takes control of grounded airline: Air France's
new chief has plenty of experience of militant opposition at home and abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christian Blanc, due to be officially confirmed today as the head of Air
France, has clashed with striking workers on the Paris underground and dealt
with militant separatists in an overseas colony. But he may still be
forgiven for having qualms about his new challenge.
He takes over the loss-making airline when it is mired in a bitter
industrial dispute. His predecessor, Mr Bernard Attali, was undermined by
the French government which decided to scrap a recovery plan he deemed
essential for the airline's survival. Mr Blanc now has three months to draw
up a new package to restore health to the airline and resolve the strikes
which have paralysed the state-owned national carrier.
It is hardly an enticing prospect. The strength of union opposition to
restructuring measures was clearly illustrated yesterday in a show of force,
dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the French press, which saw the airline's
operations halted by co-ordinated action by groundstaff, airport workers,
pilots, cabin staff and union members at Air France's domestic airline
subsidiary.
Mr Blanc, however, has some useful cards up his sleeve. As former head of
RATP, the Paris bus and metro operator, he has experience of managing a
public sector group and of implementing reforms in the face of powerful
union opposition.
During his tenure at RATP, between 1989 and 1992, Mr Blanc succeeded in
decentralising the group's operations, reducing the number of management
layers from seven to three, and rationalising pay scales, a particularly
sensitive issue for the unions.
But he also experienced the risks of reform. In 1992 he was faced with a
strike by workers on the Paris metro as a result of his attempts to
guarantee a minimum level of service during industrial disputes and to
reduce pay for striking employees. After failing to win support from the
Socialist government of Mr Pierre Beregevoy, he resigned.
'The experience of the strike of 1992 shows two things about Mr Blanc,' says
one executive at RATP. 'He is determined to introduce management reforms and
he will not compromise.'
Another former colleague says he is likely to have demanded a free hand in
managing Air France. But this may be a tall order, particularly in the light
of Mr Attali's sudden loss of government support.
If RATP was a turbulent period for Mr Blanc, it was peaceful compared with
his previous challenge in New Caledonia. In 1988, he was appointed by Mr
Michel Rocard, then Socialist prime minister, as head of a mission to
resolve a conflict sparked by an independence movement in the South Pacific
colony. The mission played a large part in the conclusion of the Matignon
Accords which defused the dispute and represented one of the successes of
the Rocard administration.
Mr Blanc's achievement in New Caledonia and his stint at RATP should provide
valuable experience at Air France. So, too should his political contacts.
As a close friend of Mr Rocard, now the leader of the Socialist party, it
may appear curious that he has been picked by Mr Edouard Balladur's
centre-right government to resolve its first serious industrial dispute.
His reputation as a tough negotiator is the most important explanation. His
left-wing credentials might also help in negotiations with the hitherto
implacable strikers.
Mr Blanc should not, however, take this for granted. Mr Louis Viannet,
general secretary of the Confederation Generale du Travail, one of the union
groups spearheading the protests at the national carrier, issued a stern
warning yesterday. 'Mr Blanc should not try to do at Air France what he
sought to do at RATP,' said Mr Viannet in a radio interview. He said the Air
France chief should take into account the 'errors that have been made' at
the airline and should discuss fully with the unions any measures he plans
to take.
That leaves Mr Blanc in a difficult position. The government, despite its
climbdown, still says it wants to implement the 4,000 job cuts envisaged in
Mr Attali's plan, although it has said the cuts can be achieved without
forced redundancies. The airline, which is forecast to lose more than FFr5bn
(Pounds 580m) this year, remains in urgent need of restructuring.
Mr Blanc's first three months - the time the government allowed for a new
recovery plan to be drawn up - are therefore likely to represent the
sternest test of his negotiating skills.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH unions yesterday threatened to extend their industrial action at Air
France to other public sector groups following a show of strength which
paralysed the airline's flights to and from Paris.
Yesterday's protests, dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the press, were the broadest
action yet in the eight-day strike by Air France groundstaff. Air France
pilots and cabin staff, and union members from the national carrier's
domestic airline and the Paris airports authority joined the groundstaff in
a 24-hour protest in spite of government concessions on a controversial
austerity plan for the airline.
Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of Force Ouvriere, one of the union
groups which has spearheaded the protest at Air France, said the
government's decision on Sunday to withdraw an austerity plan for the
airline had set a precedent. Protests would be launched against job cutting
plans at other public sector companies, he said, citing Groupe Bull, the
loss-making computer group.
Mr Louis Viannet, leader of the Confederation Generale du Travail, the
left-wing union federation, said the climbdown at Air France represented a
test case for the public sector.
The trade unionists' comments, however, came amid signs of division over
whether to continue the industrial action at Air France, raising the
prospect that the strike may have reached its peak. Force Ouvriere called on
its members to suspend the strike from today, although it warned it would
not hesitate to call new action if necessary.
A spokesman for the CGT, however, said its members would continue their
protests until they received government guarantees that members would be
fully paid for the period of their strike and a written commitment that
there would be no job cuts.
The austerity package which was withdrawn by the government at the weekend
included 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year and a reduction in overtime
pay and bonuses. Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, has said that the
4,000 job cuts envisaged in the plan are still necessary but that they can
be achieved without sackings.
Yesterday's disputes forced Air France to cancel all flight to and from
Paris, adding to the group's financial problems. The company estimates the
strike is costing it FFr70m (Pounds 8m) a day in lost revenues.

THE EC summit in Brussels on Friday could face disruption from a one-day
strike called by a key section of the country's socialist trade union to
protest against the government's austerity measures, writes Andrew Hill.
The summit could be affected by expected traffic chaos, other work stoppages
and street demonstrations.
Last week, the socialist unions walked out of talks on how to revive the
economy. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, yesterday unveiled
outline measures which the country's centre-left coalition will now try to
push through without the support of the socialist trade unionists.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Nordic and Alpine fresh air: EC can take heart from
enlargement talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THEIR summit in Brussels on Friday, a rather battered collection of EC
leaders will not only be able to cheer themselves that the Maastricht treaty
is now ratified, but take heart too that there are at last signs of progress
on bringing four Nordic and Alpine countries into the Community by 1995.
Amid doubts over the viability of monetary union, the growing jobs crisis
and Europe's failure to bring peace to Bosnia, enlargement to bring in
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway is a comfortingly solid goal for the
Community to set course for.
It has not often seemed that way since the glacially slow negotiations
started with these members of the loose European Free Trade Association
(Efta) in February. The summit is set to force the pace of the talks,
possibly acting on a German proposal made yesterday to hold more regular
ministerial negotiations between the Twelve and the Four.
On Friday, nonetheless, the European Commission should be able to report to
the summit that most of the candidate countries' legislation has been argued
into compatibility with the EC's single market, and that the Twelve and the
Four have taken big strides in aligning health and safety and veterinary
standards and indirect taxation.
What is more important, the Commission can at last point to the first signs
of progress on the make-or-break issues of the enlargement talks: the
compatibility of the (often higher) environmental standards of the
applicants, and how to pay for their (much higher) agricultural and regional
subsidy regimes. All four applicants will hold a referendum on EC accession,
and need to convince their increasingly Euro-sceptical peoples that the
Community represents no threat to the quality of their lives and their very
'green' identities.
Environmental issues, according to an internal Commission document, 'may
prove to be decisive for the successful conclusion of the enlargement
exercise'. All four applicant governments fear a No vote if the EC is seen
to be diluting what they consider higher standards in order to safeguard
border-free trade.
The Brussels enlargement task force has thus evolved a three-tier approach,
so far well-received by the applicants. Where standards are equivalent, if
different, such as on car emission limits, the EC should refuse to budge.
Where the EC has set target dates for raised standards, for example on
safety belts, applicants would get transitional exemptions. On the trickiest
issues, for instance health labelling on products or use of certain
pesticides, the EC is proposing to grant transitional exemptions with a
review after three years, when applicants should be in the EC and taking
part in amending the legislation.
The psychology of this approach is as important as the details, given
attitudes prevalent in applicant countries that entry is all right just so
long as it is the EC which is joining them. 'It is not unintentional,' one
senior Commission negotiator remarks archly, 'that it sounds like they're
pulling us up to their standards.'
But the Commission is adamant that the new member states will not be allowed
to use border controls to keep EC products out for environmental reasons.
Thus the EC insists that Austria can only keep its transit agreement with
the Community limiting EC trucks passing through its Alpine passes if it
operates the same curbs on Austrian and non-EC lorries.
That attitude will be hard to maintain, however, if the Brussels negotiators
lose the argument within the Commission over how to deal with the
applicants' heavily subsidised Arctic and Alpine agriculture, which the Four
are determined to preserve to keep their countries more evenly populated.
In previous enlargements, farm price support differences have been dealt
with by border levies to even them out. The differences to be ironed out in
this case range from farm price subsidies which are 25 per cent higher than
the EC's in Austria to 100 per cent higher in Norway - by because of the
single market there will be no borders at which to do the levying.
Some Commission agriculture and customs regime officials are arguing that
the new member states could keep border controls until their farm prices
move into line with the EC's, what would be a long process.
The issue has not been decided, but the enlargement negotiators view any
such dilution of the single market with horror.
'If you accept border controls for agriculture it's hard to stop them being
used for other purposes,' one senior official says. 'We wouldn't get free
competition in their markets.' The careful compromises emerging on
environment and health and safety standards, moreover, could be unravelled
by border controls, he adds.
The solution he advocates is direct income compensation to farmers in the
four countries, which would cost an estimated Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.7bn) a
year. The net contributions to the EC budget the Four are expected to make
would be around double this.
The next stage of the argument would therefore be how to share out the cost
of the compensation, and how to finance lavish regional subsidies, which in
the Nordic countries are linked to concern for the security of their empty
northern territories.
EC regional policy, geared to helping backward and industrially stricken
areas, does not really measure up to northern Nordic needs. 'They don't need
electricity and roads. Their abattoirs are better than our houses,' says one
negotiator. 'It's better to be a cow up there.' Again, an income support
scheme linked to differences between regions is being looked at.
But even if the way forward is now in view, there is still a lot to
negotiate: Norwegian determination to retain full control over its energy
and fisheries resources; the voting weight and representation these four
small countries would get inside EC institutions, at a time when the UK,
France, Germany and Spain are seeking to increase big countries' influence;
and how the Four, all except Norway formally neutral, would fit into the
Maastricht treaty's foreign and security policy.
On Friday they will be looking for clear signs that the 12 want to find a
way through the thicket.

THE Belgian presidency of the EC, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president,
and European Community employers, yesterday threw their weight behind
existing plans for economic and monetary union.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, said the European Monetary
Institute - forerunner of a European central bank - should play a forceful
role in preparing for a single currency by 1999.
The EMI will begin its work on January 1, 1994, provided EC leaders can
decide on a site for the institution at their summit in Brussels on Friday.
Mr Delors also stressed the importance of the Emu objectives, and the role
of the EMI. In an interview for Belgian television, he said the EMI would
'round up the lost sheep (among EC economies), give new stability to a
relatively fixed exchange rate system, and lead to economic convergence'.
The currency turmoil of the last year has left the European monetary system
in disarray and recession has raised doubts about the original plans for
economic union. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, recently
dismissed the timetable for a single currency as 'folly'.
But Mr Maystadt, one of the EC's longest-serving finance ministers, said
yesterday that the Maastricht deadline of 1999 for monetary union was still
feasible, even if the more ambitious target of 1997 would be difficult to
achieve because of the EC's economic problems.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Maystadt also defended the
nomination of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy as the first president of the EMI. The
choice should be confirmed by EC leaders on Friday. Mr Maystadt said Mr
Lamfalussy, Belgian general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements in Basle, would give a new impetus to the Maastricht aims. 'We
know that Mr Lamfalussy is really convinced of the need for Europe to go to
a single currency: he's a true believer in the single currency and that's
not the case with all the bank governors.'
He said the EMI would be 'a more permanent and more objective supervisory
body for the European monetary system' than existing inter-governmental
bodies like the secretive EC monetary committee. Unice, which represents EC
employers' federations, also called for EC leaders to refocus on the Emu
objectives. 'We think that the single market without a stable monetary
relationship will be very difficult to sustain,' said Mr Carlos Ferrer,
Unice's president.

MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said in Luxembourg
yesterday he was convinced the EC could reduce mass unemployment, which is
'paralysing European societies'.
This would be achieved through a mix of job-sharing, part-time work and wage
flexibility, according to the latest draft of the White Paper on
competitiveness, growth and employment.
The Commission has set a target of creating 20m new jobs by end of this
decade, in its blueprint for tackling mass unemployment in Europe.
The White Paper is being co-ordinated by Mr Delors. It will get its first
real airing at this Friday's Brussels summit, but the final version will be
the centrepiece of December's meeting of EC heads of government.
The creation of 20m jobs, to reduce current EC unemployment rates of 10.4
per cent to 5 per cent by 2000, would match the performance of the US
economy throughout the 1980s. It implies annual growth rates between 3 and
3.5 per cent, levels which are not likely to start until 1995.
The Commission draft calls for a fundamental overhaul of EC labour markets,
and an increase in investment from 19 per cent to 23-24 per cent of
Community GDP, last seen between 1964-74.
Among the chief recommendations are:
New incentives for part-time work. This would reduce the average hours
worked and allow the number of jobs to increase.
Greater wage flexibility, including possible dilution of minimum wage
legislation.
Employment costs. The paper says labour should not be taxed more heavily
than capital, and calls for a progressive reduction in non-wage costs for
lower-skilled jobs.
New taxes on pollution and energy to compensate for revenue losses as a
result of reducing employment costs.
A target of 3 per cent of gross national product to be spent on research and
development; annual spending of Ecu30bn (Pounds 23.3bn) to Ecu35bn on
transport infrastructure; and the creation of a European network of science
parks.

FT  27 OCT 93 / EC growth figure rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE suggestion by Mr Henning Christophersen, the European Community's
economic affairs commissioner, of 2 per cent growth in the EC next year was
branded as over-optimistic by private sector economists yesterday amid signs
that it is incompatible with the latest internal EC commission forecasts.
On Monday, Mr Christophersen told journalists at the EC finance ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg that EC-wide growth could be between 1.5 per cent and
2 per cent next year if the latest German growth forecasts turned out to be
accurate.
However, it emerged while Mr Christophersen was making his prediction that
commission forecasters in Brussels were starting a two-day meeting with
colleagues from EC member states armed with internal commission forecasts
pointing to less than 1 per cent EC-wide growth in 1994.
Mr Christophersen appeared to base his remarks on projections by five of
Germany's six leading economic research institutes forecasting 1.5 per cent
growth in Germany next year. Such a growth rate would boost EC-wide economic
growth by about 0.45 per cent. But, according to EC officials, the
commissioner seemed not to take into account internal commission forecasts
that have downgraded 1994 growth from 1.25 per cent published in June to
less than 1 per cent. While this week's forecasters' meeting might lead to
an upgrading of the commission forecast, past experience suggests that any
change would be small and typically around 0.2 percentage points.
Mr Christophersen's suggestion that growth could reach 2 per cent surprised
EC finance ministries yesterday because he had not mentioned it during
Monday's meeting. Private sector economists also doubted whether his upbeat
forecast was soundly based.
Mr George Magnus, international economist of S G Warburg Securities in
London, said Mr Christophersen's forecast was 'wishful thinking' and that 1
per cent EC growth 'was just about achievable'. Mr Martin Hufner, chief
economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich, said 2 per cent growth
'looked very optimistic'.
The German growth forecasts on which Mr Christophersen based his remarks are
contentious. They were rejected by one of the six German institutes and
criticised by the association of German private banks as being too
optimistic.

FT  27 OCT 93 / CBI survey reveals 'fragile' recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLOOMY survey from the Confederation of British Industry confirmed
yesterday that the pace of economic recovery has slowed since the summer,
strengthening calls for an early cut in interest rates.
Over the last four months, manufacturing orders and output were flat, export
orders fell, more jobs in industry were lost and business confidence
weakened, the CBI reported.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the confederation's economic affairs committee,
said: 'The recovery, while still moving slowly forward, is fragile, with
considerable uncertainty about the prospects for exports.'
He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to take advantage of subdued
inflationary pressures to cut interest rates from the present 6 per cent and
help sustain recovery and investment.
The CBI's message contributed to a sharp drop in share prices as the FT-SE
100 share index closed 19.5 points down at 3,165.3. The pound lost early
gains against the D-Mark to close unchanged, and fell more than half a cent
against the dollar. It closed in London at DM2.4875 and Dollars 1.4795, with
little change in New York.
Although manufacturers still hope for a modest improvement in demand and
production over the next four months, the results of the survey - covering
1,316 companies responsible for 2m employees - will add to a growing
realisation that sluggish demand in continental Europe is holding back
recovery in the UK.
The CBI reported that for the first time since the survey started in 1958,
more companies expect unit costs to fall than to rise. Over the past four
months, more companies cut their output prices than raised them.
Investment in plant and machinery is not expected to rise, while investment
in buildings is expected to fall. Companies report, however, that they
intend to spend money on innovation and training over the next year.
The survey indicated that manufacturers have made further cuts in export
prices. The CBI warned that if expectations of a pick-up in export demand
over the next four months were not met, then 'it is likely that the recovery
could be very sluggish into the new year'.
It also said another 33,000 manufacturing jobs would be lost over the next
three months with large companies planning the biggest cuts.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Arbitrage dealer defies recession to earn Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EYEBROWS may be raised in Downing Street if heads of industry earn more than
Pounds 1m. But in the recession-defying City, at least one man has dwarfed
these sums.
Mr Kaveh Alamouti, a dealer at Tokai Bank's London operation, is believed to
have earned Pounds 9m last year, probably making him the highest paid trader
in Europe.
The sum puts him in the same league as Mr Peter Wood, founder of Royal Bank
of Scotland's Direct Line insurance operation, who earned over Pounds 6m in
the year to September 1992, and is thought to be on course to earn more than
Pounds 10m in the financial year just ended.
As head of arbitrage trading, Mr Alamouti looks for opportunities to make
money across all financial markets, dealing in complex derivative
instruments such as options as well as in bonds and currencies.
Arbitrage trading takes particularly strong nerves: as much as Dollars 50m
of a bank's own money can be pitted on a single trade.
Descriptions of Mr Alamouti among other traders ranged from 'a real poker
player' to 'a walking computer'.
A former academic, Mr Alamouti was lured away from Salomon Brothers, where
he was a top arbitrage trader, in 1990. He joined the US investment bank's
research department in New York in 1983 as an analyst, before becoming a
trader on Salomon's legendary fixed income arbitrage desk there.
Mr Roger Livesey, deputy chairman of Tokai Bank Europe, and Mr Alamouti last
night both declined to comment.
Arbitrage traders are particularly high earners, even by the generally high
standards of the City and Wall Street.
Ms Joan Zimmerman, executive vice-president of GZ Stephens, a Wall Street
headhunter, said: 'Certain US arbitrage traders have been known to have
earned Dollars 23m a year. Their competition in terms of compensation is not
just other investment banks but also hedge funds, so to a great extent they
are paid on a different scale from other traders on Wall Street.'
The bond market rally and currency market volatility of the last two years
have proved extremely favourable for skilful arbitrage traders.
Tokai's annual report for the year to December 31 1992 shows that a director
of Tokai Capital Markets earned Pounds 7.6m and a director of Tokai Bank
Europe earned Pounds 1.4m. It is believed that both these figures refer to
Mr Alamouti, a director of both companies, but Tokai declined to confirm or
deny.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Societies call off merger in conflict over styles: Leeds
Permanent and N&amp;P union fails at eleventh hour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Leeds Permanent and the National &amp; Provincial building societies
yesterday called off their attempt to create the biggest ever society merger
after discovering a clash of management styles.
The decision, which follows two months of negotiations, is a significant
setback for attempts by medium-sized societies to join forces to challenge
the dominance of banks and life insurance companies in retail financial
services.
The merger was called off only days before the managements of both societies
were due to present a joint business plan to their boards. The plan's
abandonment means there are now uncertainties over the direction of several
of the 10 largest societies.
The planned merger, announced in August, would have created the third
largest society, behind Nationwide and Halifax. It would have combined the
Pounds 18.3bn assets of Leeds, the fifth largest, with the Pounds 12bn of
N&amp;P, the eighth largest.
The seriousness of the division over management style was shown by the fact
that the merger foundered in spite of agreement over many difficult issues,
including the name, a head office and who would become chief executive of
the merged society.
The two societies said in a joint statement that they had decided not to try
to reconcile their two 'distinct approaches' to business, and that the
proposal would not be put to the societies' members for approval.
Mr Malcolm Barr, Leeds chairman, and Mr Richard Newton, N&amp;P chairman, said
they thought it would be too difficult to combine the different cultures, on
top of the efforts needed to bring together two complex businesses.
Leeds is seen in the industry as having a more traditional and hierarchical
management structure, while N&amp;P has adopted an approach which is based more
on teamwork, and emphasises a focus on the customer rather than on the
product.
Mr David O'Brien, who has led this management approach as chief executive of
N&amp;P, would have been chief executive of the merged society, and some senior
managers of Leeds were thought to have expressed unease at his appointment.
Mr O'Brien said full agreement would have been needed to bring about the
merger's benefits including a planned loss of 1,600 jobs. 'If you do not
have that, you compromise the ultimate success of the merger,' he said
Mr O'Brien's redesign of the management structure at N&amp;P since he became
chief executive in 1990 has produced a sharp reduction in the number of
management grades.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said that although the
societies would be denied the added strength they would have derived from
being larger, they were both still 'very strong' and could prosper alone.
The Leeds will be under pressure to act swiftly to end uncertainty over who
will be in charge, either by confirming the appointment of Mr Roger Boyes,
acting chief executive, or by appointing a new candidate from outside.
Apart from Leeds and N&amp;P, there has also been speculation over whether
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth largest society, will seek a merger. Its former
chief executive, Mr Tony FitzSimons, departed abruptly a month ago.

FT  27 OCT 93 / Secret bid talks value Ferranti at token 1p a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURTAIN began to fall yesterday on one of the most distinguished names
in British industry. Ferranti, the deeply troubled UK electronics company,
announced it was in talks with an unnamed bidder at a token 1p a share, a
bid which would signal the end of independence for the company and value it
at a mere Pounds 9.7m.
This compares with a peak value of Pounds 845m in early 1989, just before a
disastrous Dollars 1.1bn fraud was uncovered at its US subsidiary
International Signal and Control (ISC).
Founded at the end of the last century by Liverpool-born Sebastian Ziani de
Ferranti, the company became a flagship of UK technology. It was a pioneer
in semiconductors, developing the first European microprocessor in the
1970s. Its computer division, now part of Fujitsu of Japan, developed a
scientific computer which was competitive with the largest IBM machines. In
the early 1960s it was one of the pioneers of numerical control for machine
tools, a field now dominated by Japan, Germany and the US.
Speculation on the unnamed bidder focused yesterday on rival defence
companies, since two-thirds of Ferranti's business consists of defence work.
GEC, which bought large parts of Ferranti's defence business after the ISC
fraud, refused to comment. British Aerospace denied any involvement. Thomson
of France, which has a joint venture with Ferranti in sonar equipment, was
unavailable for comment.
Ferranti emphasised that while it was in discussions, there was no certainty
of an offer being made. Earlier this month it was obliged by law to call an
extraordinary meeting of shareholders, since mounting losses meant its net
worth had fallen to less than half its share capital. Mr Eugene Anderson,
chairman, told shareholders he would seek to strengthen the balance sheet
through equity injection or strategic partnership.
The indicated price of 1p per share took the stock market by surprise
yesterday. The shares had started the day at 9.25p, and closed at 2.5p in
heavy trading.
The company's likely loss of independence is chiefly attributable to the
fraud at ISC, whose head, Mr James Guerin, received a 15-year jail sentence
last year.
However, it had also been criticised for poor management and loss of
direction.
Its chief financial assets now consist of a pension fund surplus of around
Pounds 100m and large unrelieved tax losses, mainly attributable to ISC.

in Svedala, the mineral processing and transport unit, writes Hugh Carnegy
in Stockholm. It would raise a further SKr1.3bn through the pending sale of
a 75 per cent stake in Munksjo, its paper and packaging subsidiary.
The disposals are part of a restructuring to staunch a heavy flow of losses
and pare its SKr10bn debt burden. The group, hit by falling world metals

FT  26 OCT 93 / EC's limit on duty-free gifts doubled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday doubled the value of
duty-free gifts which travellers within the Community will be able to bring
home from the beginning of next year.
The ministers agreed to increase the outdated Ecu45 (Pounds 35) limit on
duty-free purchases of watches, camera equipment and other gifts, to Ecu90.
They also increased the tax-free allowances for gifts bought outside the
Community from Ecu45 to Ecu175.
Yesterday's deal leaves the allowances for duty-free wine, spirits and
tobacco unchanged, but it will provide a consolation for EC duty-free shops
as they wind up their EC activities. Duty-free shopping on journeys within
the Community will end on June 30, 1999.
The European Commission had resisted prolonging duty-free sales within the
EC, because it believed limits would be difficult to enforce once internal
controls on goods were abolished on January 1, 1993. However, ministers
agreed last year that duty-free shops could police the system themselves
until its abolition in 1999.
German objections to an increase in duty-free limits were overcome
yesterday, after ministers agreed that Germany could enforce lower
travellers' allowances at borders with Poland and the Czech Republic to
avoid fraud.
Ministers also discussed ways of harmonising tax on investments and savings
across the Community, although such a system is some way off. In 1989, the
Commission proposed harmonising such taxes at 15 per cent to end the flight
of private savings to EC countries with low or non-existent taxes.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, who chaired the meeting,
said an existing working group would now examine how to build a system which
could include countries where tax is withheld at source, and countries which
oblige banks to declare interest earned on savings.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (18): Clever ways of
using 'ordinary' information technology - The annual IT Awards promote
excellence in applying information technology in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMAN ingenuity can put straightforward office automation products and
services at the forefront of information technology (IT).
This is clear from the increasing numbers of office automation systems among
the finalists in the Annual IT Awards competition run by the British
Computer Society (BCS), the industry's professional body, to promote and
highlight excellence in the application of IT.
The awards celebrate their twenty-first anniversary this year and have drawn
a record number of entries. They are sponsored by such leading IT companies
as BT, Bull, IBM, ICL, Logica, Mercury, Tandem and Unisys, plus the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The 11 finalist medal winners, three of which will be selected for awards,
include some eye-catching high technology projects, such as the Marlboro
McLaren racing car which transmits data during a race to an analysis system
in the pits.
But every-day office automation systems are also there, largely due to
humans' ability to spot clever ways of using ordinary technology, rather
than because the technology is particularly clever in itself.
Trafalgar House group's Engineering Division is among the finalist medal
winners with its Global Office, an international network which handles
voice, data and fax communications, electronic mail and video-conferencing.
The system is claimed to be one of the biggest and sophisticated of its kind
in the world. But the thinking behind the system is at least as significant
as the technology, if not more so.
Mr Jim Noble, the IT director, says the network enables the company's
disparate units to operate as what he calls 'a single virtual company.' This
means it can cope more easily with peaks and troughs and reduce project
schedules.
In addition, Trafalgar House has extended the network to clients, which can
send their designs and ideas electronically for Trafalgar House engineers to
work on: this has 'transformed our competitive advantage,' says Mr Noble.
ANOTHER finalist is using even simpler technology - a standard 3.5 in.
personal computer disc - to potentially change the face of electronic
publishing.
FRAX is a small software company in Aberdeen, formed 18 months ago and now
employing seven people and eight consultants on contract.
Its Smartbook package compresses 100 paces of text and 100 colour images of
photographic quality into a standard disc which also includes software for
cross-referencing any topic with any other.
The package costs Pounds 499. If necessary, FRAX can produce copies from
customers' master discs at Pounds 1.25 each, including a disc: in other
words a full electronic book on disc for little more than the price of the
disc alone.
'CD-Rom has been the only way of distributing such documents, but not many
users have CD-Rom drives,' says managing director Mr Bob Garrioch. 'In
addition, once you go to press with CD-Rom, it's like printing a book: you
can't easily change it.
'Smartbook uses ordinary discs, which can be used with any PC. The text can
be prepared and amended using any word processing package.'
FRAX sees many office applications for Smartbook. They range from training
to distributing fully-illustrated product catalogues which can easily be
updated. Sony recently put out the press pack on the new album by singer
Paul Young on disc, complete with photographs, interviews and other
illustrated information.
Another business application is the production of annual reports, with the
facility for moving data from the report into a spreadsheet package for
analysis or into a library of company information or any other file.
The hypertext facilities mean an electronic book could hold a photograph of,
say, an office complex with different areas numbered: entering a number
could call up information on that area.
Such entries to the BCS Awards competition are certainly welcomed by the
society - 'the ingenuity in the way IT is used is just amazing,' says Mr
Arrick Wilkinson, chairman of the preliminary judging panel for the last
eight years. 'In addition, the range and quality - and the way the systems
are developed these days, using formal methods and project management
disciplines - are all constantly improving.'
But why do companies enter for the BCS Awards? The competition is demanding:
two judges spend at least half a day with each entrant. The only prize is a
trophy or a medal. However, recent finalists say awards are especially
important for office automation projects because they help beat the common
problem of getting end-users to actually use the system.
IT is relatively easy to implement systems - 'the hard part is winning over
the users,' says Jim Noble at Trafalgar House. 'Telling them they've got a
good system, doesn't work: what really makes the difference is when they see
an award and read reports of our success.'
Bridie Collier, IT co-ordinator at the Patent Office, sees the BCS Awards as
important for systems staff, too.
The Patent Office won an award in 1990 with services group Computer Sciences
for a Pounds 13.7m project which put 30m records of patents and trade marks
online to staff.
'People rarely give you good news: it's usually bad news or requests for
enhancements,' she says. 'So although we felt we had a good system, we were
never self-congratulatory about it, because the users were always saying,
'Why doesn't it do such-and-such?'
'This meant we didn't think we had a chance. Winning was a great surprise -
and made us feel we were right to be pleased with the system.'
This reaction is common to many winners.
'This was a recognition of what the whole department was capable of - not
just the people who happened to be in that particular project team at that
time,' says Mr Mark Nonour, a systems manager at British Airways.
The company won a BCS Award in 1991 with a system which works out the most
profitable ways of filling flights with passengers.
Winning a BCS Award might be icing on the cake to some, but to those trying
to 'sell' their systems to their end-users, it can clearly be a key to
success.
THE WINNING TRIO
This year's three BCS Award winners will be announced at London's Waldorf
Hotel on November 15 by Mr William Waldegrave, Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster. All the finalist projects will be on display throughout the
afternoon.
Free tickets are available from Anna Duckworth at the BCS on (0793) 480 269.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (17): High level of
vulnerability - Many companies fail to take basic precautions, despite the
high cost of computer fraud which may exceed Dollars 4bn a year worldwide /
Computer Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY director was visiting his doctor's surgery recently. He noticed
that the receptionist was away from her desk and the computer on the desk
was turned on. He pressed 'enter,' got a menu, chose patient records, and
called one up on screen. He could have amended it or printed it out, and no
one would have known.
The director in question happened to work for government computing
specialist Lynwood Scientific Development, and his intentions were not
malicious: he had in fact, called up his own record. But what if he had been
someone with a grudge against another patient?
Security on computers is becoming more, rather than less of an issue, now
that many organisations are using PCs and PC-networks instead of holding
their data in separate computer centres (see further report on this page on
IT business security issues).
Many companies, as in the above case of the doctor's surgery, do not
recognise the PC as a potential source of security breaches.
In financial terms, computer-based fraud is thought to cost up to Dollars
4bn a year worldwide. But as electronic purchase and payment transfers
increase with the advance of electronic data interchange (EDI) between
businesses, the financial targets for computer 'hackers' may also increase.
'Companies don't seem to have adjusted well to the changing pattern of
corporate computing. There is a feeling out there that 'it's only a personal
computer,'' says Keith Hearnden, lecturer in security management at
Loughborough University.
Mr Hearnden suggests that companies should work out what would happen if
that PC were stolen, or lost in a fire. Replacing it, he says, would not be
as simple as going to the high street and buying a similar model.
'You need the same operating system, configuration, software add-ons, and
communications set-up,' he says.
In addition, the loss of data held on it, could cause more financial damage
than the loss of the actual hardware - unless the precaution had been taken
to keep disk back-ups in another location.
David Cockarill, Lynwood's business development manager, advises that
common-sense measures should be taken in the office as a first line of
action.
A simple precaution that could have been taken in the doctor's surgery, for
example, would have been to use a key which blanks the screen, and turns off
the keyboard. The casual browser cannot read anything. Confidential memos
should be stored on floppy disks and locked away - 'You wouldn't leave a
typescript on the desk, so don't do it with the electronic version,' says Mr
Cockarill.
Mr Hearndon advises that staff should be told about computer security
issues: the best time to do this is on an induction course when they join an
organisation. He recently conducted a survey of 421 UK organisations, which
showed that two-thirds do not bother to take this precaution.
It is common for staff to write their password on yellow stickers, posted on
their screen. Anyone - clients or suppliers - visiting the office could see
it, and use it later to hack into the network to access files. Training
should include basics such as why staff should not reveal their password,
and how viruses can be introduced to a computer, as well as proper
procedures for taking disk-back-ups.
The best protection against viruses is simply to ban people from using any
disk other than one that has been checked by the systems department  -
computer games, brought in by staff to play on their perosnal computers at
lunch time, are a common hazard. Another sensible precaution is to forbid
the uploading software from bulletin boards.
ONE simple course of action against hacking is to be more strict on the
choice of passwords. According to Geof Soulsby, marketing manager at Racal
Datacom, 80 per cent of all passwords are contained in 100 known names or
words - 'it isn't difficult for a hacker to guess those 100 words,' he says.
They include the 10 most popular boys and girls names, a few swear words,
and several four-to-six letter words. 'Dog' and 'cat' are the third and
fourth most popular passwords.
David Clark, partner specialising in computer security at management
consultants Touche Ross, says that there are no statistics on the extent of
the problem of hacking, because few organisations will admit to it. But he
added: 'Fifteen per cent of the organisations I deal with have a concern
about hacking. They may either have experienced it or they are worried about
it.'
It therefore follows that where a computer system or network is carrying
information of high value to the organisation or its clients, something more
than a password is needed.
Encryption of the data is not necessarily the answer. Encryption makes it
impossible to read the data while it is travelling along the lines, but does
not prevent unauthorised access. Normally, encryption is part of a package
of measures which utilise other cryptographical techniques to protect
against and to authenticate the message.
Unauthorised access can be prevented by a 'challenge and response' system.
Staff are given an electronic gadget that looks similar to a calculator.
When someone logs on to the system, it sends back a challenge which appears
on the screen. The challenge is entered into the gadget, which uses
complicated mathematical algorithms to calculate a response, which must be
entered into the system. If the gadget has obtained the correct response,
the user is permitted to access the system.
Challenge and response systems make life difficult for hackers because the
codes are different every time.
Even if a hacker obtained one code, they would not be able to use it to get
in to the system. The algorithms used - known as DES - is licenced by the US
Department of State, and its use is strictly controlled.
Challenge and response systems are used by Barclays and Natwest banks, as
well as other commercial organisations, to protect sensitive payment and
order data.
They are also used where people are regularly dialling in to a system from
remote locations.
But the cost is not cheap. According to Mr Soulsby, the 'calculator' gadget
costs around Pounds 50, but a large organisation such as a bank might buy
10,000.
Authentication of messages is done using a digital signature - an indication
to the recipient that they have not been tampered with.
Mathematical algorithms scramble the characters in a message, and produce a
64-digit message string, which is then appended to the original text. The
recipient uses the same algorithms to decode the string. If the message has
been tampered with a different string would be produced.
Mr Clark recommends that a digital signature is used 'where it is vital that
the recipient is assured of the source of the transaction.'
Typically, this would be in a banking environment, where large sums of money
are involved.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (19): Serious conflict of
priorities - Business protection and IT risk management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS protection now offers some of the highest growth rates in the
information technology sector. In the next five years to 1997, companies in
the UK will spend Pounds 2.5bn on protection, representing a compound annual
growth rate of almost 30 per cent,
Research by the International Data Corporation shows that 40 per cent of
this IT business protection will be 'outsourced.' The report examines four
areas: database recovery, access control, contingency planning and disaster
recovery in sectors ranging from banking and insurance to retailing and
manufacturing.
One phenomenon that emerges from the IDC survey is that while, alarmingly,
only 12 per cent of organisations were 'totally confident' in their ability
to recover from a serious IT incident leading to business disruption, more
than 20 per cent considered IT security to be 'a prime concern' and a
significant item for IRT expenditure.
This apparent conflict in priorities provides a measure of the level of
opportunity available to computer services vendors. Even though companies
are becoming increasingly dependent on information technology, more than 35
per cent do not consider IT security to be a 'major priority,' according to
the survey.
Finance directors, who are generally beginning to view IT strategy and
expenditure more critically, still tend to consider IT business protection
as 'more of a technical issue than a commercial necessity.'
With UK commercial losses due to computer security lapses now running at
well over Pounds 1bn a year, 'awareness of the problem is the first stage
for treatment - and recognition has to come from the top of an
organisation,' says the new Director's Guide to Business Security, produced
by the Institute of Directors and Digital Equipment.
Having been through its own worldwide review of internal security, Digital
advises companies on security strategies and then helping the customers to
implement them. Consultancy begins with a 'threat assessment' to identify
risk areas and their impact on the business. The risks evaluated include
theft, industrial espionage and even bomb attacks.
Digital's approach to network security has been learned in the harsh light
of experience: in 1990, a fire destroyed one its UK office complexes -
although only 18 months old, the structure which also housed a large Digital
computing facility, was 80 per cent destroyed in less than an hour.
The IOD/Digital survey suggests a range of sources of advice on IT security.
These include:
The Confederation of British Industry which has two relevant groups: the
Computer Security Working Group and the Computer Misuse Working Group.
Details from Wendy Rainbow at the CBI on 071 379 7400.
The British Computer Society which has a committee on data security. Details
from the BCS on 0793 480 269.
The Computer Crime Unit of the Metropolitan and City Police - described as
the only police unit in the UK which specialises in the investigation of
computer-related crime. Details on 071 230 1189.
The European Security Forum: an independent, non-profit group dedicated to
resolving issues of IT security. Details on 071 583 1745.
International Information Integrity Institute (I4): formed in 1986 by SRI
International; member-companies include both suppliers and advanced users of
information technology. Details from Ken Lindup on 081 685 5555.
In the aftermath of the bomb disaster at Bishopsgate in the City, Safetynet,
a leading supplier of business continuity services, has made an extensive
report listing 20 areas of 'lessons learned' regarding contingency planning.
Among the findings in the report are:***
A bad plan is worse than no plan at all.
Business continuity budgets are often inadequate - and 'business as usual'
is a myth.
Third party involvement is critical to success in contingency planning.
Weekend 'disasters' are easier to survive.
Supplier goodwill is not enough.
Off-site storage must be comprehensive.
Insurance alone does not usually cover losses.
Multi-site organisations recover more quickly.
As an example of the the new awareness of IT security in the City of London,
AST Trans-Act - a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada - has won five
contracts worth Pounds 3.5m - just three months after launching its business
recovery facility. This is one of the first 'shared subscription' facilities
for City businesses wanting contingency plans for serious trading
disruptions.
Following a disaster, clients have the use of an office complex and dealing
room for 180 staff. The facility is guarded around the clock and has an
uninterruptable power supply

THE European facsimile market is holding its own, according to market
research company BIS Strategic Decisions, with unit sales forecast to rise
to over 2.5m in 1995, which represents an 8 per cent CAGR over the 1991-95
period. However, the market value is expected to decline as a result of
lowering prices to USDollars 2.5bn in 1995 from the Dollars 2.8bn high in
1991.
There is no decline in revenues for the network operators, though. The 1993
Pitney Bowes/Gallup survey of UK FT 1000 companies shows a jump of 61 per
cent in the number of outgoing faxes in the past year, with the daily
average per business rising from 40.3 documents of 3.6 pages to 65.1
documents of 5.1 pages.
The survey also found that the number of fax machines in FT 1000 companies
has almost doubled, from an average of 6.5 units per company in 1992 to 14.5
in 1993.
All surveys note the trend towards more sophisticated features and plain
paper fax (PPF), with BIS estimating that the PPF share of the European fax
market was 9 per cent in 1991 (19 per cent by value) but will be 45 per cent
(72 per cent in value) by 1996.
According to Dataquest research, 53,000 PPF units were shipped in the UK
last year, with the figure set to rise to 177,000 by 1997, an annual growth
of 35 per cent. A Pounds 5m order placed by British Gas for a new fleet of
Rank Xerox plain paper fax machines would appear to add weight to the
prediction. Inkjet technology will, however, experience the strongest
growth, with unit sales expected to grow from 20,000 units a year now to
75,000 by 1997. The early success of the Canon B200, which came in at under
Pounds 900, appears to prove the point.
Gunning for the same market seven months later is Olivetti with the OFX2100,
a sub-Pounds 900 unit which has the added advantage of a PC interface.
Those launching inkjets at around Pounds 1,285, Infotec, Panasonic and Ricoh
among them, tend to be targeting the business rather than the mass market,
where fast response after sales service is considered a more important
criterion than price per se.
Increased competition from new technologies should mean that toner-based PPF
fax will either come down in price or will boast more sophisticated features
designed to save operating costs or improve image quality at the same price.
These include faster speeds, higher resolutions, larger memories, dual or
multi-access facilities and, like the newer inkjets, PC or network
interfaces. As one might expect from a company that commissioned the Gallup
research, epitomising the trend is the new Model 9640 PPF machine from
Pitney Bowes which is priced at Pounds 2,795 plus Vat, and comes with a fast
14.4Kbps modem, 620K memory, extra fine resolution and RS232 interface.
COMPUTER FAX
Users are still cautious about PC fax, it seems. Dataquest says less than 5
per cent of PCs and LANs have on-board fax facilities. The Pitney
Bowes/Gallup survey show a rosier picture for FT 1000 companies, with 24 per
cent of users sending faxes direct from their computers, although 38 per
cent do use a computer equipped with a modem.
Peter Champion, market development manager, Ascom Data Networks, an
established supplier of computer fax, believes that the slow take-up is
largely due to a lack of user-friendly software applications and ignorance
on the part of business users.
The software developers are getting there, slowly, with the help of
Windows-based software. Current favourite among the fax/modem suppliers such
as Dataflex and US Robotics who supply a total package is Delrina Winfax.
Word-processing users would much prefer faxing to be as easy as printing
from within the application; hopefully the inclusion of fax communications
in the new 6.0 versions of WordPerfect, due out soon, will set a trend and
encourage greater use in offices where the large number of fax messages are
generated.
Dataquest believes that the one the networked PC community should watch for
is Microsoft at Work which, although at least a year away, will make fax,
copying, printing and voice a standard combination on all desktop systems.
PORTABLE FAX
Although Ricoh and NEC are winning sales for their mobile fax machines, and
Canon has a baby mobile fax in the wings, it still appears to be a niche
market. However, portable PC fax looks set for take-off, with an informal
Dataquest survey finding that a LAN-adapter is the top priority for users,
facsimile second.
The spur to market growth is likely to be the advent of PCMCIA (Personal
Computer Memory Card Industry Association) standard fax/modems which are
credit-card sized.
With the market forecast to grow six-fold and 400 hardware and software
suppliers committed to the standard, we can expect a flurry of activity
soon. But first on the market with PCMCIA fax/modems for mobile cellular and
public phone networks are US Robotics and, soon, Nokia/AT&amp;T.
MULTIFUNCTION FAX
Ownership of fax devices in the home jumped dramatically last year,
according to BIS, with over 47 per cent of home office and 89 per cent of
work-at-home users purchasing devices in the past year.
Main suppliers in this market are Muratec, Ricoh, Samsung and Toshiba.
Innovations such as large memories, polling from remote machines and paging
with phone-answering, as found on the new under-Pounds 500 Brother 360DT,
should boost the market further.
Those on a budget looking for a page printer, a plain paper fax, PC fax and
scanner may well look to combination products. Typifying the genre, the
Muratec F-75/Laserfax which can be used as a hard copy fax (Pounds 1,995) or
as an image scanner and as a DOSor Windows compatible PC system.
GROUP 4 FAX
The arguments about the relative merits of the Group 4 standard versus Group
3 continue, although little if anything has been heard of Group 3bis, the
64K fast fax contender.
Suppliers such as Infotec and Ricoh claim that this is not surprising since
the uptake of ISDN digital lines from BT and Mercury for head office to
branch communications is resulting in steady, though not euphoric, sales of
Group 4 machines.
With approximately 2,000 companies using ISDN channels (300 per cent up on
last year), the potential savings in time, and thus in transmission costs,
are being recognised. In the UK, HM Customs &amp; Excise, for example, has
placed an order for ten Canon L3300i Group 4 fax machines for its regional
offices.
Companies who want to benefit from the savings in transmission costs between
the UK and US but do not have the constant volumes to justify purchasing the
equipment can now benefit from the first G4 fax service which has been set
up by Infotec for Ocean Group, whereby users can end faxes via the fast
London-Manhattan link with documents transferred to G3 machines at local
country rates.
The advent of ISDN also opens up the market to colour fax.
SERVICES
While the high-margin end of the market is still struggling, the suppliers
of low-cost consumer fax machines will continue to win the lion's share of
unit sales, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, with the market driven by
automated fax-on-demand services.
Government departments were among the first to embrace the technology with
Statfax which provides economic statistics, with Weatherfax among the more
popular.
It is being used increasingly by customer support departments to save time
and improves customer service response levels. An example is copier supplier
Konica which has introduced Flashfax, a computer to fax information
retrieval service which enables engineers to get immediate help in
fault-finding when out on service calls.
The fact that fax services can be set up very quickly and run for a
specified period is a big bonus. In March, for example, Hambros Bank used
Mercury Communications' Surefax service to launch Budgetline, a financial
information broadcasting service designed to provide all clients
simultaneously with accurate, up to the minute information about changes
introduced in the budget and their implications.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (15): Surge of new
products - Many of today's photocopiers and printers act as one - at the
touch of a button / Printers and Copiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT

<TEXT>
The transition to the all-digital office is gathering apace. Not, as we were
once led to expect, to get rid of paperwork but to produce better-looking
documents, faster and cheaper, on demand at the point of need.
It is not such a long leap into the dark unknown for the modern copier as
some may think, for it already uses 10 or more microprocessors and software
programs wisely and well to make an amazing array of facilities available at
the touch of a button.
Fast scanning, infinitely variable zoom, automatic double-sided copying at
full engine speed, job programming with memory retention and
self-diagnostics are just some of the state-of-the-art features that can be
accessed via graphical displaysor touch-sensitive screens.
In fact, the technology has advanced to the stage where every office junior
in the land could take a set of originals and, with a modicum of training,
produce reports, booklets or manuals, stapled complete with colour covers
and dividers, in less time than it takes to place an order with a printshop.
No wonder suppliers such as Canon, Infotec, Konica, Lanier, Minolta, Mita,
Nashuatec, Oce, Olivetti, Panasonic, Rank Xerox, Ricoh, Sharp and
Triumph-Adler have all recently launched medium-speed systems machines for
the office market.
The digital print room
Questions are being raised in centralised print departments about the need
to produce intermediates, which is both time-consuming and wasteful. If the
majority of originals are created on a computer, users argue, would it not
make economic sense to send the images direct to the copier electronically?
According to Kodak research, 70 percent of UK business and public sector
organisations believe that, where the key requirements arelow cost, fast
turnaround times, dependability of time-sensitive information and efficient
use of space, a copier to computer or network link is important. Hence the
company's decision to ad thenew Kodak 1580 copier-printer to its Lionheart
programme in the first quarter of 1994.
Oce is also moving towards the Digital Repro Centre ideal with a software
solution that integrates existing analogue copiers, laser printers,
scanners, computers and applications to providean interchangeable and
updateable package that will enable the repro department to grow from
present hard copy reproduction to the benefits of fully-digital working
methods at their own paceand within what might be very right budgets.
Commercial Union can already testify to the benefits of digital technology
when compared with traditional offset presses. Ray Thorn, manager of group
supply, says: 'Using the Xerox DocuTech to produce 500 prints will see the
job printed and finished beforethe press would have been ready to start.'
To CU's marketing department it is image quality that is crucial, so they
have been chosen to run a pilot where they will be able to eliminate
intermediates by linking their desk-top PCs or Macs to the MediaServer via a
modem for direct input.
Digital offset
The offset press is not dead yet, though; and for long-run colour-work at a
low cost per copy it still has no equal. The launch ofthe Indigo E-Print
100, the world's first digital offset colour printer which combines the
performance and image quality of liquid ink with digital imaging and
electronic paper handling, proves that it, too, is being given a new lease
of life.
The digital duplicator
The duplicator, too, is alive and well and embracing digital technology to
eliminate messy manual processes. With costs per copy on print runs of
24-4000 copies per original at less than one-third of a penny, the economics
speak for themselves in schools and colleges where electronic
copier-duplicators from Gestetner, Infotec, Ricoh and Riso are finding
favour. The ability to link the machines directly to a PC or MAC for direct
image input further enhances their value in terms of investment futures.
Multifunction desk-top
Integrated digital solutions for general office use have been hovering in
the wings for several years but the high cost when compared with the
products they replace have not made economic sense to purchasers. Marketing
directors at Canon, Konica, Ricoh, Sharp and Toshiba have all commented on
the fact that although 35 percent of the Japanese copier market is already
digital, it will represent no more than 5-10 percent of the UK market for
atleast two years.
Richard Norton, vice president, Worldwide Document Management Group,
Dataquest, the market research company, agrees with that view, but cites
several new developments that will help to makethe all-digital office a
reality. One is the Oki DOC-IT, a small desk-top unit for personal use
costing from Pounds 3,000 that combines image scanning, plain paper fax,
copying and page printing. A network version is planned. Mid-range
multifunction devices worth noting, he says, include the Ricoh 5330 and the
Canon GP55.
Digital colour
Could 1993 be the year that colour takes off? Perhaps. European research
carried out by BIS Strategic Decisions shows that unit sales of colour
copiers, now at just under 35,000 units, will grow at the rate 20 per cent
(CAGR) through to 1997. Canon was the first to break the price barrier with
the launch of a digital colour copier-printer based on bubblejet technology
at under Pounds 4,000. Olivetti, too, has entered the market with the Colour
8000 at Pounds 3,795 which divisional manager Alistair Booth believes will
be used primarily as a PC printer.
Colour laser printers, says BIS, will grow much faster than colour copier,
with unit sales rising from 130 units in 1992 to 32,500 in 1997 (104 per
cent CAGR 1993-1997). It could be higher if the QMS ColourScript Laser 1000
and the Oce 6460 desk-top machines (priced at around Pounds 10,00-Pounds
11,000) are joined by lower cost units from suppliers such as Canon and
Hewlett Packard.
But because of much lower prices of colour inkjet and the ability of the
technology to be adapted for printer and copier use, sales across Europe are
likely to outstrip any other product type, BIS predicts, with units shipped
rising from 442,000 in 1992 to 3.35m in 1997.
COLOUR inkjet printer-only devices that have broken the mould interms of
price and capability include Hewlett Packard DeskJet 1200C and 1200C/PS,
which came in at around Pounds 1,400, followed more recently by the Canon
BJC-600 at Pounds 599, plus Vat, both bringing to the masses the essential
combination of affordable plain paper full-colour and true black.
Competing in this market are four-colour thermal units, and here the
innovations possible are epitomised by the Star SJ-144, a three-page per
minute printer offering zoom magnification priced at a low Pounds 569 and
which won the Best of Comdex award this year.
At the higher end of the market where the quest for perfectcolour matching
and colour registration is crucial, one of the most important developments
is the range of EFI (Electronics for Imaging) colour management products
which can turn a digitalcolour copier, such as the Canon CLC, Kodak
ColorEdge Plus, AgfaXC305, Minolta CD-80 and the Rank Xerox 5775, into a
multifunction copier-printer capable of producing very high quality colour
output. The need to develop anti-counterfeiting technology, however,
naturally adds to the cost.
The colour copier-printer market certainly look set for some excitement as
innovative products like the Rank Xerox MajestiK, with its auto colour
sensing capabilities, stretch the technology barriers. Capable of accepting
images from a variety of sources, including computers, scanners and photo CD
systems and due to be launched in the first half of 1994, it has already
created a storm in Japan by capturing 42 per cent of the digital colour
market.
Developments in copier and printer technology are, then, still growing
apace, with computer networking, PC interfaces, digital imaging and
electronic paper handling enabling users to tap into any one of the
technologies available on the network, choice only depending on their
current application.
Users today do not even have to worry about configuring a printer to suit
their requirements. Automatic interface switching enables printers to accept
data from multiple sources without manualintervention. Automatic emulation
avoids the user having to specify a particular computer language.
Simultaneous processing of multiple jobs increases throughput.
But what if, as a computer user, you have to work from otherlocations and
your print jobs are particularly complex? Does itmean that you have to spend
ages to reconfigure each printer you use?
What if you use a multifunction copier-printer that has tobe physically
switched from one function to another and need to access it from a remote
location?
No problem, says Bob Anderson, director of the Xerox Research Centre at
Cambridge Laboratory. In future, you will only have to configure your
digital copier or printer once. After that, wherever you are located, be it
home, a branch office or overseas subsidiary, as soon as you log on to the
network, your printer configuration will automatically search you out
without youhaving to do a thing. That, says Anderson, is what printing on
demand at the point of need is about. Do you have the feeling that business
equipment is getting too clever for its own good? Have no fear, sales of
copiers and printers proves that paper is here to stay for many years yet.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (14): Small is beautiful
 -Almost one in five of all personal computers sold last year was a portable
 -and the trend is accelerating / Portable Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the early days of portable computing, strong arms and a large dose of
determination were required. Machines were heavy, cumbersome and generally
slow and unexciting.
But, since then, silicon integration and other technological developments
have enabled portable computer-makers to pack real processing power into
ever smaller and less costly packages.
Although portable computing is little more than a decade old it has changed
dramatically in recent years. The 'clam-shell' notebook computer has become
the de facto standard for portable computing and the fastest growing segment
of the world computer market. Almost one in every five PCs sold last year
was a portable and the trend is accelerating.
Dataquest, the market research organisation, estimates that worldwide
notebook computer shipments, led by manufacturers such as Toshiba, Apple,
NEC and Compaq, more than doubled last year to 4.35m units. By 1997,
Dataquest expects portables and the new generation of personal digital
assistants (PDAs) to account for more than 45 per cent of unit sales.
Although portable machines still command a price premium over their desktop
counterparts fierce competition is eroding the difference and providing
consumers with an ever widening choice. Almost every serious PC manufacture
and most of the 'clone' makers now supplies at least one range of notebook
computers - many have high and low-end ranges - and as a consequence prices
have been falling rapidly.
Today, many models boast high resolution colour displays, large 120Mb-plus
hard disks for data storage, integrated trackerballs for mouse-style
pointing under Microsoft Windows and at least one PCMIA card slot to connect
peripherals like modems for data communications. While machines based on
Intel's 386 processor are still dominate the market a growing number of new
machines are based on the more powerful 486 processor.
Low-power chips, like Intel's SL range, together with advances in screen and
battery technology have enabled designers to build machines with brighter
displays and longer battery lives while new lightweight components have
enabled manufacturers to deliver most if not all the functionality of
desktop systems in much smaller boxes.
Generally notebook computers are used in addition to desktop machines, and
sometimes as replacements. That means most corporate users want machines
which offer similar facilities to desktops and are able to run the same
software. However, despite significant advances in screen technology, few
portables can compete with the displays found on most desktops.
One increasingly popular solution to this issue is the 'docking station'
which enables the portable to take advantage of facilities like full size
screens and keyboards and to connect to an office local area network which
then provides access to databases and peripherals like printers.
Several large manufacturers now produce docking systems including Compaq and
Apple whose Duo system combines a lightweight 4.2 lb notebook computer for
use on the road with a docking station which turns the machine into a
sophisticated desktop, linked into the office network.
For many users, notebook computers are now an important element in the
'mobile office' although most studies show that portable computers are only
rarely used while actually travelling. Equipped with a fax-modem and perhaps
a portable printer they can be used to send and retrieve data, electronic
mail and facsimiles from a hotel room or local office.
Some manufacturers have begun to design in specific features for the
travelling businessman. For example, Cannon's BN22 BJ incorporate a
bubblejet printer; meanwhile, Toshiba has recently launched the T6600C which
includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo speakers, detachable keyboard and other
facilities to make multimedia presentations while travelling. At 13 lbs, it
is heavy in comparison with today's notebooks, but actually weighs less than
Toshiba's top of the range laptops of just a few years ago.
Other innovative machines to appear on the market recently have included
modular designed systems from Elonex, the North London-based computer group,
Japan's NEC, Acer with the Acernote 750c and Italy's Olivetti with the
recently launched Philos. Manufacturers argue that these modular designs
enable customer to keep up with future technologies and provide users
sharing machines with additional flexibility.
Most new portables feature integrated tracker-balls introduced by Apple
which has had achieved considerable success with its PowerBook systems which
were among the first notebooks with an integrated trackerball - a feature
which is increasingly common. Apple sold over 500,000 PowerBooks, worth more
than Dollars 1bn last year.
Another innovation in portable computing over the past couple of years has
been the arrival of pen-based 'notepad' systems which are now available from
a growing number of notebook manufacturers.
To date, pen-based systems, including smaller handheld devices, have mostly
been used for niche applications, for example by insurance assessors and
engineers completing customised forms on site, warehousemen checking stock
or for data collection. Often these machines are linked by radio data
communications back to head office so that data can be transferred to and
from the main database.
Some manufacturers have sought to combine the benefits of pen systems with
the attractions of the conventional keyboard. For example the Grid
Convertible, now supplied by AST alongside its new ranges of high and
budget-priced note-book systems has both keyboard and penpad. Most recently,
Compaq has launched the Concerto, a high performance notebook with a
detachable screen which doubles as a pen pad and costs around Pounds 2,000.
For some business users, size and weight will be the main criterion when
choosing a portable. For them, the sub-notebook category of devices
pioneered by Olivetti with the Quaderno, now in its second generation, and
Hewlett Packard with the Omnibook could prove attractive.
Significantly, Hewlett Packard has acknowledged that most notebook users
also have access to a desktop PC so the Omnibook is designed to be used in
conjunction with a PC rather than as a replacement.
However, despite initial high hopes, the sub-notebook market has so far
failed to live up to expectations. Mr Jeff Goldberg, European industry
analyst with Dataquest in London, believes this is because to date they have
generally been overpriced and viewed as similar too, but more costly than,
electronic organisers.
Mr Goldberg is equally dubious about the short-term market potential for
PDAs, arguing that the first machines from manufacturers like Apple, Casio
and Sharp are generally too expensive and do not offer many advantages over
cheaper handheld computers and pen-operated electronic organisers.
Even when prices fall, most analysts question whether PDA's will sell in
sufficient volumes to generate significant revenues for their manufacturers.
Nevertheless, machines like the innovative Apple Newton MessagePad could
still represent a significant development in portable computing. In
particular, the next generation of PDAs are likely to feature much more
sophisticated telecom facilities - highlighting one important trend - the
move towards integrating portable computing and telecoms.
Combining the processing power of the latest generation of chips with the
rapid development of digital telecoms like Mercury's One-2-One in the UK,
GSM services throughout Europe or perhaps satellite-based systems, could
turn PDA's in to important business tools with a real role in the office of
the future.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (13): A chance to reduce
the paperwork / A look at ways to cut back on printed documentation and
reduce costs in the electronic office by using new software packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT HALLIDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the biggest myths of the early years of the information technology
revolution was that the use of computers would lead to the end of the use of
paper for communications and the start of the 'paperless office.'
It is now clear that this paperless society is, at least so far, a myth. New
technology has actually led to an explosion in the use of paper: the page
design tools on personal computers allow anyone to create good looking
documents, but the urge to get the design just right by tweaking tiny
details mean that several draft copies may be printed where one typed memo
would have sufficed.
Then, once finalised, the document may be faxed or posted to different
sites, where it will be copied several more times for distribution and
filing.
The disadvantages of this system are quite obvious: firstly, contrary to
current ecologically-friendly trends, a large amount of paper is used.
Secondly, the costs of copying and transmitting the document can be huge
and, despite the care taken with the design, the quality of the received
document (once it has been faxed, then photocopied, then comments added,
then faxed back) can be unpredictable.
Thirdly, though by no means finally, if the recipient wants to take sections
from a document to incorporate into another document, they cannot do so
without re-entering the data into their computer.
Yet while distributing such documents as computer files, either down
telephone lines or on disc, clearly solves many of these problems, this
method has never become popular. This is mainly attributable to the
difficulties caused by the different data formats which each computer and
program uses.
Transferring plain text, the lowest common denominator of the different
machines, has always been possible, but sending complex documents,
containing text in different sizes and fonts placed around pictures is very
difficult unless the sender and recipient have exactly the same software
packages and fonts installed on their machines.
In some organisations this has led to packages being copied illegally just
so that everyone could read electronically-distributed documents.
Two new software packages aim to solve this problem. Both 'Common Ground'
from No Hands Software and 'Acrobat' from Adobe Systems claim to allow
documents created with any application program, and incorporating any
combination of fonts, graphics and colour, to be sent electronically to
other users' computers and viewed on-screen.
The sender and recipients need not have the same applications or fonts
installed, nor even be using the same type of computer - both products allow
documents created on Apple Macintoshes to be viewed on personal computers
running Windows, and vice versa. Adobe is also working to bring users of DOS
PCs and Unix machines into the Acrobat world.
Both systems appear to operate in the same way. Once installed, they add an
option to the print command to output the document as a special format file,
called 'digital paper' (dp) in Common Ground and 'portable document fortmat'
(pdf) in Acrobat.
The files, which preserve the look of the original document, can be
distributed on disk or by modem, and be read on-screen using a viewer
program - Common Ground even allows a mini-viewer to be included with a
document, so that anyone can read it.
Once opened, the document can be searched for words or phrases, and sections
of text can be copied to other documents.
Acrobat adds further facilities like 'sticky notes,' the electronic version
or the familiar Post-It note, and hot links where selecting a phrase like
'see the attached graph' would take you directly to that graph, and will
eventually support the standard SGML document structure system. If
green-consciousness permits, both systems allow documents to be printed.
Beneath the surface, however, the two systems differ greatly, in ways which
affect both the quality of the documents when printed and their file size.
Common Ground files contain a bitmap image of the document - a 'dot by dot'
copy of the on-screen image.
When creating the digital paper file, the resolution can be selected to be
72 dots-per-inch (about the same resolution as appears on computer monitors)
or 300 dots-per-inch (standard laser printer resolution).
The 72 dpi files are smaller, but appear ragged when printed or enlarged on
screen; the larger 300 dpi flies give much clearer results.
The technology behind Acrobat is much more complex. The portable document
format is an extension of Adobe's established PostScript page description
language most familiar from high-quality laser printers.
Rather than creating a bitmap copy of the document, Acrobat stores the
'metrics' of the fonts used.
Using the company's 'Multiple Masters' font format a system where one font
can be stretched and distorted to give many variations of the design the
receiving system. generates close copies of the original fonts.
Though it has problems with highly decorative typefaces, the advantage is
that the resulting fonts are resolution independent if you print them on a
high quality laser printer they will appear at the resolution of the
printer, whereas those from Common Ground would be stuck at 300 dpi.
Acrobat also offers a number of compression systems to reduce the size of
pdf documents, which is advantageous since it reduces both telephone
transmission times and storage requirements; in some cases, 2Mb files can be
reduced to around 100K.
However, documents cannot have a view included - to read a document you need
an Acrobat Reader, and these are only currently available in minimum
quantities of fifty, priced at Pounds 36 a copy.
'Exchange,' the program which creates pdf files, costs Pounds 140 per copy;
and 'Distiller,' which takes existing PostScript files and turns them into
pdf format, costs Pounds 500.
'Common Ground,' in contrast, costs just Pounds 149 for the Maker/Viewer.
The two system will however, find favour with different markets, Common
Ground being ideal for distributing small-scale documents while Acrobat is
more adept at large works containing extensive cross-referencing or full
colour images.
Providing recipients avoid the urge to simply print-out documents, both
systems will reduce costs and paper usage greatly. And while neither is yet
perfect, both give the 'paperless office' concept a new chance.
Acrobat is from Adobe Systems, distributed by Principal Systems
(0706.831.831); Common Ground is from No Hands Software, distributed by
Gomark (071.731.7930).

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (12): Smarter ways to
store documents - Document image processing and data storage
</HEADLINE>

THE financial services industry churns out endless reams of paperwork,
particularly in the insurance and mortgage sectors.
These are the areas, however, where the bulk of applications can be found
for document image processing (DIP).
Apart from improving customer-service efficiency, the industry is also
beginning to use DIP technology to cut staffing, according Geoff Bedser,
consultant at the finance division of the Computer Management Group (CMG).
'If you talk to financial organisations, they will mention the two points in
the same breath. In practice, the emphasis tends to be on improved
efficiency,' he says.
Unlike the computer industry which is increasingly moving towards standards,
DIP is still a jungle of proprietary systems.
There are some standards at the lower levels of DIP technology, such as the
fax format used for the images, but when it comes to the software that does
clever things like indexing, it is still a case of 'everybody for
themselves.'
So when customers choose a particular supplier, they have to be sure from
the outset that they will not want to switch suppliers later because they
will be well 'locked in' to an original supplier.
Most imaging systems now store images using the Group 4 fax standard from
the Consultative Committee for International Telephony and Telegraphy
(CCITT), which provides better image compression than its Group 3
predecessor.
'That is really all a fax does - like an imaging system, it turns a document
into a series of digits,' explains Mr Bedser.
'The main problem with standards is how you actually 'reference' an image on
a disk. Every supplier has a different indexing approach. In principle, it
would be quite simple for somebody to convert images from one system to
another by turning them into faxes - say, through a PC fax card.'
Most DIP systems scan images at a resolution of 200 dots per inch (200 dpi).
An A4-page scanned at this resolution in monochrome generates about 4m
pixels, occupying four megabits of storage, equivalent to half a megabyte of
data.
When it was first designed, Group 3 offered a line-by-line compression
algorithm. Group 4 compares the second scan line with the first, thereby
achieving a higher level of compression, particularly on certain characters
with uprights that do not alter from one line to the next. It effectively
represents the second scan line with how it differs from the first one.
Group 4 is more efficient, but requires better error-correction because if a
line is lost in transmission, so is the whole document, whereas because
Group 3 corrects itself at the end of every line, the worst that can happen
is one bad line.
Another commonly adopted standard for DIP is Aldus's Tag Image Format (TIF),
which allows users to move image files from one system to another. TIF can
be used to store images compressed in ways other than the fax standard, like
colour and greyscale images, for example.
TIF also allows users to scan images in at any resolution. However, doubling
the scan resolution from 200 dpi to 400 dpi, the print resolution offered by
most laser printers, quadruples the storage required in theory, although the
more data is captured the more redundancy it contains, so the compression
algorithm tends to be more efficient. In practice, therefore, the storage
requirement would only double.
'TIF in itself is still only effectively an image format,' says Tony
Hendley, technical director of Cimtech. 'You still need to describe your
definition of a document within the system. That's where you get into the
realms of document architecture standards.'
The large computer manufacturers such as IBM and Digital Equipment (DEC)
have defined a standard called Open Document Architecture (ODA). This allows
users to manage documents in a range of formats.
Most word-processors use IBM's Document Content Architecture (DCA) as an
interchange format for exporting documents to other word-processors. ODA is
the counterpart to DCA for document imaging, but still has some way to go
before being universally adopted as a standard to replace proprietary
architectures in DIP systems.
THE move to client-server computer architectures means that DIP systems can
now have one server managing the index database and another managing
document contents, be they images or text files. This will improve
performance because the types of searches done on the index database are
different from those done on the storage server.
'The best analogy is that of a hat-check system where you give your coat to
a cloakroom attendant and you get a ticket with a number on it. The
attendant does not know what the coat is or anything about it, and they
store it as they see fit,' explains Mr Hendley.
'The storage server operates on that principle. At any point in time, the
index database will deliver a series of tickets as a result of a search, and
the storage server will deliver the file.
'The benefit of having them as separate devices is that you can have many
companies who specialise in making storage management systems which optimise
the trade-off between storage cost and speed of retrieval.'
He recommends that users carry out some form of data modelling exercise in
advance or use free text indexing systems. Alternatively, they can create an
abstract of the document.
If the document is held as a text file, the user can search on any word in
the document itself. Whether the user has come through a structured search
or a free text search, the principle is the same - the result is a hit-list
of unique numbers from which to retrieve files.
'Most imaging systems use a standard database such as Oracle to hold their
indexes,' says CMG's Mr Bedser.
'The fact that it is pointing to an image is where the clever software comes
into play. Image is a technology which appeals to users, rather than IT
buffs, but ironically users see it as something which enables them to
automate their processes and bypass traditional IT professionals.'
Optical character recognition is now becoming more prevalent because the
system can then recognise part of the image as being characteristic of the
document, providing automatic indexing - this is particularly useful in
legal documents, for example.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): An aid to teamwork
for PC-users - The price of groupware has put off many companies, but
increasing competition will bring the cost down / Groupware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BORIS SEDACCA

<TEXT>
THERE was a time when companies avoided making any significant investment in
a new technology until IBM entered the market to 'legitimise' it. Today,
nobody waits for IBM anymore and this is particularly evident in the
workgroup computing/groupware market.
This is not to say that IBM does not have groupware products, because the
company announced a number of product enhancements in the groupware area,
earlier this month. However, IBM is unlikely to emerge as market leader in
groupware as it has done in the past with products like the PC.
Groupware is a software environment that aims to make teams of PC-users work
together more efficiently. It updates colleagues on new developments, and is
similar to a central 'hold' for information, where files, diaries, memos and
other office documents are stored, easily amended and accessible to anyone.
With groupware, work is not held up because someone else has the file, or
has forgotten to add new information.
Lotus was first to enter the groupware market with its Notes package, but
initial take-up of the technology was relatively slow because it involved
large-scale investment and required an IBM OS/2-based server system.
Although Lotus makes most of the running in the market, there are numerous
disparate products which, it could be argued, already fall into the
groupware category.
Apart from Lotus and Microsoft, two other leading PC software vendors -
WordPerfect and Borland - have jointly announced groupware products,
although the forthcoming WordPerfect Office 4 looks set to compete
independently. ESP is another company specifically targeting the groupware
market with a range of third party software products.
Most products centre on a mail engine. Novell, for example, is talking about
workgroup computing in terms of its global messaging service. A 'mail
engine' is essential for people to work effectively in teams together.
Alan Harris, associate partner at Andersen Consulting believes there is
still room for an outsider to come into the groupware market and then play a
dominant role by establishing the rules of play.
'It is going to be somebody who comes up with a framework to understand how
groups can interact,' he says.
'The biggest gap is in the lack of a telecoms infrastructure. If you really
want to get groups working together, they have to be free to do it from
wherever they are. At the moment, there are too many compromises made
because of the lack of a telecoms capability.
'You cannot really participate if you are on the move,' he says. Most
applications are designed to provide good performance in a local area
networks (LAN) but do not work well on anything slower - 'groupware is an
application idea that is waiting for the data highway to come along.'
For businesses to succeed with the new way of working with groupware, they
need to be able to create groups across dispersed geographical locations
throughout the enterprise.
Alan Harris believes that telecommunications suppliers will emerge as
contenders by teaming up with software vendors.
PA Consulting recently completed a survey on groupware and information
sharing. John Kay, director of management and professional systems at PA
Consulting, says: 'We were concerned that although groupware has been much
touted, the chasm between IT and the business is not narrowing.'
THE survey sample consisted of around 100 senior managers in IT,
finance/accounting and marketing in large private sector companies. Eighty
per cent acknowledged the importance of information sharing, while 65 per
cent did not like the way IT presented its solutions to the business.
Eighty-six per cent did not think the time was right to act on information
sharing and groupware. Some responses included comments like: 'Groupware is
a fad,' and 'I'm not interested in groupware - I always get my IT people to
deal with it.'
Only 13 per cent thought they were getting any benefit from what they had
done in the groupware area.
'Groupware is another packaging of technology concepts which have been
around for a long time,' John Kay adds.
Business managers do not naturally think of IT as a solution to their work
problems at the tactical level, he says - 'there is no doubt that they all
have an IT strategy and know how important it is to link it to the business,
but when sales or marketing managers run into problems, they do not
naturally turn to groupware for a solution.'
The price of groupware also puts many companies off, although increasing
competition will bring the cost down. Lotus Notes Version 2 had 'a hefty
price tag,' comments Niels Jaeckel, manager of the desktop consulting group
at Hoskyns.
'Version 3, which has now been released in part, will be cheaper. One of
Notes's problems in the past is that it required OS/2, whereas the majority
of sites have Microsoft Windows,' he says.
Lotus has only recently released a Version 3 Windows development server
product, he adds, 'but it not entirely suitable for services because Windows
is not a pre-emptive multi-tasking environment like OS/2.
'What that means is that it does not switch from one task to the other
mechanically but through something called co-operative multi-tasking, which
means that the application has to release control to the operating system.'
A pre-emptive environment means that the server gets a specific amount of
time to do its job.
Under Windows, if anything else is running, then the server may not get its
fair share of work, and performance will suffer.
However, the forthcoming release of Windows NT will probably solve that
problem as it uses a pre-emptive approach to sharing out processing time.
According to Niels Jaeckel, Microsoft has a more powerful set of language
tools in its groupware products than Lotus which uses a macro scripting
language in Notes.
He comments: 'The edge that Microsoft has is that those language tools will
be embedded into Windows 4.0, the next release of Windows for PC clients,
which is also a 32-bit pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system.'
The transition to Windows NT server will be very clear, he believes, 'unlike
the transition from Release 3 to Release 4 of Novell Netware which has
totally confused users, or from Lotus Notes 2 to Notes 3 where substantial
changes were made.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (10):  Electronic data
interchange and electronic mail - The paperless office is almost as much a
tantalising dream today as it was a decade ago. But in some areas, including
the exchange of routine business documentation such as orders and invoices
and electronic mail, some significant progress has been made / Valuable
boost for efficiency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC data interchange (EDI) is a value-added network service which
enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange
business documents using standard electronic forms and their own computers
linked through a service provider.
It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging
information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can
play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain. EDI also
automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables an organisation to
check and validate electronic documentation. These benefits have spurred
growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and in the UK and
the Netherlands which lead Europe in EDI usage.
Ovum, the technology consultancy, expects the EDI market in Europe,
including customer software and support, to grow from about Ecu 196m in 1992
to about Ecu 590m in 1997, a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent.
'The EDI market in Europe continues to grow steadily,' Ovum noted in its
latest report on the European Vans market, 'most large organisations are now
using, implementing or trialing EDI.' However the report also notes that
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are showing much more resistance
than was expected to the adoption of EDI.
Nevertheless, as an increasing number of smaller suppliers have discovered,
big companies are beginning to demand EDI links with their trading partners.
This, in turn, fuels the growth in EDI trading as more organisations gain
direct experience of the benefits.
Ovum notes that the majority of EDI traffic today is based on industry
specific application protocols. However, the report forecasts that
'virtually all new user-communities are basing their services on Edifact (an
international standard) - and many existing communities using proprietary
application protocols are moving towards Edifact.'
By 1997, Ovum predicts that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be
based on the Edifact standard.
The UK and the Netherlands are by far the most mature EDI markets in Europe
followed by France, Sweden, Switzerland and Belgium which are 12 to 24
months behind, then Germany, Italy and Spain which are about three years
behind according to Ovum.
Among the service providers the market leaders in Europe are IBM and Geis
which have pan-European networks and services and International Network
Services (INS - jointly owned by Geis, the US-based network services
company, and ICL) which dominates the market in the UK with an estimated 55
per cent market share.
Other service-providers in Europe include Unisource, a joint venture between
the Dutch,Swiss and Swedish telephone network operators, BT Global Network
Services and France Telcom/Transpac which are aiming to build up a
European-wide presence, AT&amp;T Easylink which has a significant position in
the UK and is now expanding across Europe. Intesa, a joint venture between
Fiat and IBM, has an important position in Italy while Silgos is the market
leader in France.
In the UK, competition between the three main service supplier is
intensifying and last year IBM, AT&amp;T and BT announced inter-working between
their networks in an attempt to isolate INS which provides three main EDI
'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service for retailers and their
suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and Fleetnet for the fleet
leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet, handles more than 6m
documents a month.
Companies use these EDI service suppliers because they provide a central
'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate
recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different
computers or message standards.
About 10,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are estimated to
be using electronic trading and the number is growing by between 20 and 30
per cent a year. But there is still much room for growth. Some recent
estimates have suggested that less than 5 per cent of business transactions
in the UK are handled by EDI. Of the top 1,000 companies, roughly 300 use
EDI.
As Sir John Harvey-Jones noted at the Electronic Business Exchange
conference held in London earlier this year, that 'against the potential of
both the number of firms and the uses that could be made of electronic
trading, we are barely scratching the surface.'
Tesco, one of the pioneers of EDI use in the UK, has automated its entire
transaction chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock records,
re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making payments. The
benefits of EDI have been so great over the last six years that the
supermarket chain has stopped measuring them against the costs.
Tesco now trades electronically with over 1,200 companies of all sizes,
representing more than 95 per cent of products on its shelves. Half these
suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. Other big EDI users in the UK
include ICL, the computer group, Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive.
EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI
tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and
invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has
the range of information transmitted over EDI links.
Tesco now exchanges 13-week sales forecasts with a quarter of the 1,200
suppliers which trade with it electronically to help them schedule
production and reduce stocks - thus keeping their own costs and prices down.
EDI is also being integrated with existing internal electronic mail systems
and other computer applications. Using EDI in this way enables a customer to
link two or more incompatible e-mail systems, for example in different
departments or divisions of the same company, or to build an 'electronic
bridge' between e-mail systems following a merger or acquisition.
Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending
computer originated messages across a telecommunications network. In Europe,
electronic mail is already a significant and fast expanding Vans market.
Ovum estimates that service providers earned Ecu 176m from e-mail services
last year and will earn almost Ecu 1.5bn by 1997.
The largest share of the market (8 per cent) is held by BT GNS, followed by
IBM, Unisource and Geis. Ovum has identified seven other smaller market
players including AT&amp;T Easylink, Mercury and Sprint which are earning at
least Ecu 5m from e-mail services in Europe.
According to Ovum, single terminals connected directly to public services
account for almost 90 per cent of current e-mail traffic but by 1997 Ovum
estimates this will have dropped to 20 per cent with the remainder accounted
for by gateways to private e-mail systems.
In the UK, e-mail usage is growing rapidly partly reflecting the
introduction of new value-added services like Mercury's Multimessage
facility which provides an integrated approach to sending a single message
to any combinations of fax, telex and electronic mail addresses together
with other special features like automatic re-dial and deferred
transmission.
Taken together with EDI, electronic mail is helping to redefine the way
businesses trade and communicate with each other, and the office is at the
centre of this new system of 'electronic commerce.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (9): The high cost of
'downtime' / PC Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computer network technology today is a mature technology, which is
well-understood by the technical experts. It has also become so
sophisticated that it is deceptively easy to install and look after. The
truth, however, is far from that, as some organisations are discovering to
their cost.
One City of London law firm recently had its entire network crash in the
middle of a working day. The network - comprising desktop PCs for more than
200 staff - ran its client files, as well as accounting and word processing.
The crash meant the 150 solicitors employed could do no work.
The firm's IT consultants found that a piece of faulty applications software
on one of the network server machines had been the cause. When the software
was removed, the system began to function again. Nevertheless, the
consultants spent most of the day trying to get everyone back on-line.
In another case, a leading bank in London put all the PCs on its trading
floor onto two fault-tolerant server machines, and relied on these machines
to keep the network running. No-one managed it on a daily basis, and neither
did anyone realise that one of the servers have fallen over until the second
one also developed a problem. The entire trading floor was out action for
two working days.
According to John Godden, principal consultant with network specialist
Azlan, the cost of the 'downtime' in such situations can be much larger than
the simple cost of fixing the system. These networks, in common with most
that are being installed today, are commercially driven. They are used to
support the day to day business functions, in a way that did not used to be
the case even two or three years ago.
The old-style PC networks were 'device sharing' facilities, giving people
access to a departmental printer or fax. If they went down, people could
carry on working. Today they cannot. People use their PC to log on to the
network for all their software, from wordprocessing through to databases.
They also use the network to get information from software held elsewhere in
the organisation - 'the true cost is the cost per hour in lost business for
every hour the network is down,' says Godden.
Networks need to be planned differently to support the new applications,
says Andy Rolfe, technical director of Logical Networks. The design should
be sufficiently resilient and robust to properly support the new business
applications, and the increased traffic volumes which they create - 'many
companies under-estimate the complexity of the system they want,' he adds.
Technically, a network consists of several 'layers' of equipment and
software. The bottom layer is the wiring. The comes the 'pipe' - ethernet,
token ring, or FDDI (fibre distributed data interface).
On top of that is the transport protocol which determines how the data will
be transported. Next is the operating system, such as Novell Netware or
Banyan Vines, which manages what goes where, and finally there is the
applications software held on the server. To complicate matters, there are
other pieces of equipment known as routers, bridges, hubs and switches,
which play a part in sending the data traffic around the wires.
Some problems happen because the 'pipes' installed do not have sufficient
capacity, as one insurance company found out to its cost. It had tried to
stretch the ethernet pipe beyonds its technical limit, and wondered why
'protocol error' messages kept appearing on the screens.
In other cases, the network has just grown organically, and gets to a point
where it is simply over-stretched. Re-assessing the applications software
may solve the problem.
One such case was the British Airports Authority resource management system.
It supported 150 PCs, which log faults which occur at UK airports, including
London Heathrow. It ran a PC database system, but the application was
drowning the network with too much data traffic. Consultants ACT business
Systems solved the problem by redesigning the applications software to use a
client-server architecture, cutting down the volume of traffic on the
network.
Mike Long, principal consultant at Hoskyns, stresses that a sound network
infrastructure does not come cheaply, but the long term benefits can
outweigh the cost - 'it must be flexible, and easy to add more people. That
is a heavy commitment. For a large building, of say 180,000 square feet, and
five or six storeys, the cost could come to between Pounds 500,000 and
Pounds 750,000,' he says.
But even a well-designed robust network is not trouble-free. An issue that
many large organisations are now wrestling with is data management. As
networks, the number of servers increases in proportion, and that creates
problems for users. They do not know where files are stored, or find that
duplicate file copies do not match.
'If you have 250 users, you would have to think about controlling the data.
Problems arise such as who has a copy of this document, what did they file
it under, on which server,' says Andy Mulholland of network services
company, BISS.
Difficulties arise when two copies of the same file are held on different
servers, but one has been altered. Anyone calling up the unaltered file
could unknowingly be working with out of date information.
At BISS, they have first-hand experience. The company's 200 employees all
have a PC, connected to 10 servers, with 500 Mbytes of storage each.
Documents transferred from one department to another are regularly re-filed
on a different server under another name. The copy in the originating
department does not get updated. BISS is hoping to solve the problem by
replacing its 10 500Megabytes servers with two 3Gigabyte 'super-servers.'
These 'super-servers' also have other advantages. It is easier to keep them
in a single physical location, where they can be protected not only against
theft, but against spilled drinks and other hazards of the office
environment.
An alternative way to improve the management of the network might be to use
new operating software, such as Novell's Netware 4. This has been designed
to provide sophisticated data management facilities, in particular to make
file access simpler. However, the software was only launched this year, and
most consultants are advising people to wait until it has proved itself
before they embark on a substantial installation.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Dollars 50bn world
market in turmoil / Desk-Top Personal Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE more than a decade after the first IBM PCs began to appear on
desktops, the Dollars 50bn-a-year world personal computer market is in
turmoil.
Prices are falling, new and more powerful microprocessors are arriving,
distribution channels are changing and the industry's customers face an
unprecedented range of choices.
Meanwhile, technological advances have continued to accelerate shortening
product cycles and putting tremendous computing power on the desktop -
Digital Equipment's new Alpha PC claims to deliver 99 per cent of the
performance of a Cray-1 supercomputer.
In the office, most PCs and desktop workstations are now hooked together in
local area networks enabling them to share data and peripherals like
high-speed printers and other sophisticated equipment including network fax
machines, scanners and optical storage devices.
The rapid growth of PC 'clone' manufactures in the late 1980s and a wide
range of second-tier or 'no-name' players on both sides of the Atlantic
selling even cheaper hardware using commodity components bought in South
East Asia and the Far East has shaken the PC industry to its foundations.
The new competition coupled with the general move away from proprietary
hardware towards open systems and the associated trend towards 'downsizing,'
eventually forced even the older established computer manufacturers to
re-assess their PC strategies and go head-to-head with their new rivals.
Over the past two years all the large PC manufacturers including IBM,
Compaq, ICL and Olivetti have hit back at the clone makers with new
low-price machines of their own. The result has been wave upon wave of
price-cutting as manufacturers have sought to boost market share to offset
dwindling margins.
But tumbling prices, slim margins and the disappearance of customer loyalty
have taken their toll. A steady stream of small and not-so-small clone
makers on both sides of the Atlantic have failed or been forced to pull out
of the PC market leading to speculation that the market will be dominated by
a handful of super-efficient players by the turn of the century.
Even Dell, one of the most successful of the new breed of PC manufacturers,
has stumbled and been forced to adjust its strategy and undertake a
significant restructuring following 10 years of explosive growth. Many other
big manufacturers including Olivetti in Europe admit they do not make money
on their PC business.
Some manufacturers have responded to these competitive challenges by
developing their systems integration and computer services businesses,
aiming to deliver to customers what Mark Churchward, divisional manager for
Olivetti's UK document management division, describes as a 'business process
engineering approach.'
Others computer groups have built strategic alliances to share costs and
minimise the risks. Nevertheless it is difficult to remain a serious player
in the data processing industry and ignore the PC sector. According to
Dataquest, the information technology consultancy, the PC accounted for
about 45 per cent of world-wide computer industry revenues last year -
almost as much as mainframe and mini-computers revenues combined.
The rapid changes in the PC industry have however shifted the balance of
power towards other players like Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer
whose microprocessor chips power the vast majority of PCs, and the software
companies such as Microsoft with its MS/DOS operating system, highly
successful Windows 'environment' and wide range of business software
packages, and Novell, which sells the most popular networking software.
Over the past 18 months, Intel has delivered a raft of new processors
including low power versions its top selling chips and a range of
upgradeable 'clock-doubled' processors built around its 80486 microprocessor
as well as its new high power Pentium processor. But Intel no longer has the
PC processor market to itself.
New chips from its rivals, AMD and Cyrix, have added to the recent
proliferation of 32-bit PC processor types. Meanwhile, Digital Equipment has
delivered the first of it 64-bit Alpha AXP chips based on 64-bit RISC
(reduced instruction set computing) technology and IBM has launched the
first PC workstation based on the PowerPC microprocessor jointly developed
by IBM, Apple and Motorola, the second largest chip manufacturer.
The first PowerPC chip, the 601, has been priced at about half the cost of
Intel's Pentium processor, signalling what some believe will be the start of
a 1990s 'chip war' as rival manufactures and technologies battle for control
of the desktop.
But do customers need the additional processing power of Pentium, Alpha and
PowerPC? Mr Mike Glennon of Dataquest is in no doubt that there is a place
for Pentium, the more difficult question he says is how big a place. He sees
applications like image transmission, PC-based video-conferencing and high
speed networking creating the demand for these more powerful processors.
PowerPC chips will be used in future generations of Apple machines but Mr
Glennon is less convinced about the Alpha chip which is very powerful but
expensive. The biggest customer for Alpha outside of Digital Equipment is
expected to be Olivetti which has a strategic partnership agreement with the
US group.
Digital Equipment and IBM also both stress that the 'downsizing' trend away
from large mainframes towards client/server network systems has also created
the need for powerful machines which can be linked together using high speed
networking technologies like ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode.)
In its briefing paper on the PowerPC, IBM notes, 'the introduction of faster
and more cost-effective microprocessors means that tasks once thought
suitable for mainframe and super computers can now be carried out at the
mid-range and personal workstation level, allowing greater devolution of
data processing down towards the desktop.'
But despite the trend towards 'downsizing,' IBM and most independent
analysts believe that the mainframe will continue to play an important role,
even though, as IBM and Cranfield University School of management discovered
in a study published earlier this month, many chief executives compare their
mainframe to the boiler in the basement- essential but dull.
For many smaller businesses the issue is not which computer platform to use,
but whether computers provide any benefits at all, according to a survey
undertaken for Sage Group, the leading UK accounting software producer. The
recent UK-based survey revealed that many small and medium sized businesses
see computers as offering little or no value to their operation and
discovered that as many as 1.5m non-computerised small businesses do not
intend to buy computers in the next two years.
The main barrier to purchasing a PC was identified as lack of understanding
of the advantages of computers in business by 67 per cent of small
businesses (1-19 employees) and by 52 per cent of medium-sized businesses
(20-120 employees.) In addition a majority of small businesses profess to
have little or no knowledge of computers.
When small businesses do buy a computer the most common reason is to
computerise their accounts. In total 57 per cent of companies with computers
use accounting software like Sage's products which include Sage Moneywise
which is particularly aimed at small businesses.
Other software companies including US-based Intuit have also recently begun
to target this sector. Intuit's product called Quicken is designed to be
simple to use and runs under Microsoft Windows or Dos on a personal
computer. Intuit has also recently added an add-on product called
Quickinvoice which helps the small business - typically employing one to
five people - automate its invoicing procedures.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): The alternative to
cellular radio - Data on the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN CHANNING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE communications are much in the news, particularly in the UK,
following the launch of Mercury's One-2-One PCN service and the subsequent
tariff and publicity battle with Vodafone and Cellnet. The productivity
benefits gained by equipping key staff with cellular phones are widely
appreciated.
Less well understood are the advantages of a more mature communications
technology - radio paging.
Cellular radio is widely perceived as innovative and dynamic, whereas paging
is seen as yesterday's technology. In reality, paging is a highly efficient
one-way messaging service and can be a cost-effective addition to a
company's communications portfolio.
Investment in terminals is low, prices are fixed and the service offers both
national and international coverage.
Yet, despite these advantages, European paging, when compared to the booming
markets of the Far East and the USA, has exhibited slow growth over the last
decade.
Many observers lay the disappointing development of paging in Europe at the
feet of the operators. Until recently there has been little competition with
many countries having only a single monopoly operator. Tariffs have been
high and the service offering was complex with multiple tariffs and zone
structures.
Paging was treated as a 'cash cow' by operators who were reluctant to invest
in new technology or undertake innovative approaches to market. According to
Nigel Salomon of new market entrant Hutchison Paging: 'Paging in the UK is
an under-rated technology - in the past it has been over-priced, too
complicated and too inaccessible to potential users.'
However, significant changes are taking place and paging looks set to
experience substantial growth through to the end of the decade. New
technology such as satellite links are improving the service with single
national zones and lower tariffs being introduced.
New market sectors are being opened up with the launch of specialist
information networks such as Hutchison's Pulse financial data service. Some
of the leading UK operators have amalgamated and new players such as
Hutchison are developing new and innovative approaches to the market.
According to Hutchison Paging's managing director, Mike Bowerman: 'There
will be significant market growth for a service that has so far been
under-estimated. The potential exists to more than double the market by the
year 2000.'
THE NEXT STEP:  GLOBAL PAGING
One of the factors which may stimulate paging growth is its European and
international dimension. Like the digital cellular service GSM,
international roaming is becoming a feature of paging networks. Hutchison
operates the UK end of Euromessage, a service provided by a consortium of
European paging operators, which allows users to be paged when travelling in
France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain.
Over the next two to three years, the pan-European paging standard ERMES
will be rolled out, offering a complete European roaming service for paging
customers.
The next step forward will be global paging. The International Maritime
Satellite Organisation INMARSAT, will be using its network of geostationary
satellites to provide a global paging service. Targeted at the international
business traveller, the service will be launched in the second half of 1994
and INMARSAT is forecasting 250,000-500,000 users within six years.
At least four manufacturers will be offering alphanumeric pagers linked to
the INMARSAT service.
Radio paging has the disadvantages of being a one-way service, limited in
the amount of data that it can carry.
These factors, together with the growth in the portable computer market,
have created a demand for more flexible and powerful mobile data
communications systems.
Mobile data was widely forecast to be a booming market but the market has
been slow to develop. In the UK, excluding Cognito's specialised two-way
paging service, only RAM Mobile Data is active.
There is general agreement that the mobile data market has long term
potential. PA Consultants forecasts a UK market of 2m by the year 2000 and
Arthur D. Little has identified 3.8m potential customers in the US.
However, as Jonathan Tarlin of communications consultants EMCI points out,
the demand for mobile data has so far been unimpressive - 'customer
acceptance of mobile data solutions is relatively low due to the inability
of operators to effectively communicate and market the benefits of mobile
data, relative to the costs involved.
The multiple standards used by European networks has also restricted the
growth of the marketplace and prevented manufacturers from reaching
economies of scale through mass production.'
John E. Jarvis, chief executive of RAM Mobile Data, concedes that there have
been problems in the past but is convinced that the market is now ready for
lift-off - 'you need five things to be right before you can achieve
successful market penetration: you need coverage, you need mobile
applications on host computers, you must have hardware and software
connectivity tools, hardware prices must be right and the distribution
channels must be in place.
'These major market inhibitors are now behind us and we can concentrate on
capitalising on the opportunities that are available. I strongly believe
that all the bits are falling into place. We have already scored some
notable successes and this stimulates the market.'
One of the developments likely to affect both paging and mobile data is the
rollout of digital cellular networks. The European GSM system, for instance,
offers both advanced data transmission capabilities and the Short Message
Service (SMS) which provides a two-way text messaging service.
Ian Germer of Vodata sees GSM as being a great liberator for potential users
of mobile data - 'GSM makes entry into mobile data much easier for the
customer. In the past, mobile data was hard to use, involved lots of extra
wires and boxes, had poor coverage, was expensive and unreliable. All that
has changed with GSM, so it lifts away a lot of the barriers that have kept
people out of mobile data.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): The promise of
cost-savings - Video-Conferencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of technological innovations beginning in the early 1980s ushered
in the age of corporate two-way video-conferencing.
The Gulf war in 1991 gave the medium a substantial boost as large companies,
particularly in the US, turned to interactive video-conferencing rather than
risk the threat of terrorism.
Since then more compact, higher quality and cheaper systems have helped turn
video-conferencing into an indispensable communications tool for many
companies, government organisations and others.
Now the first desktop personal-computer based video- conferencing systems
have begun to appear and promise to transform office telecommunications in
the late 1990s.
Corporate converts to video-conferencing already include most of the Fortune
500 in the US and many large national and multinational companies in Europe.
Cost-savings on business travel are one of the main reasons why corporate
users are turning to video-conferencing. For example, British Aerospace
claims it saved 980,000 on the cost of time and travel in the first year of
ownership of two video-conferencing installations. Similarly, Rank Xerox
calculated that it saved Pounds 2,700 per video-conferencing hour after
installing equipment at its Welwyn Garden City site to link with seven of
its sites in the US.
Customers also report that video-conferencing can boost productivity,
improve internal communications and enhance competitiveness.
Estimates for the size of the world-wide video-conferencing market vary
widely. There is, however, general agreement that the market is growing
quickly and that this growth is set to accelerate over the next couple of
years.
North America is expected to remain the largest market accounting for up to
60 per cent of the total. Within Europe, the most developed markets are the
UK, Germany and France, according to figures from Ovum, the
telecommunications consultancy.
At the heart of all video-conferencing systems is the video codec
(coder-decoder) - the component that converts video pictures, sound and
control information into a compressed digital form ready for transmission
and reception over digital telecommunications lines.
Greater silicon integration has enabled codec manufacturers to produce more
compact systems at lower costs. This in turn has fuelled increasingly fierce
competition between the system manufacturers and is one of the main driving
forces behind the falling system prices and market growth.
Another important factor which has helped boost equipment sales recently has
been agreement on video compression and other world standards by the
Geneva-based grouping of telephone companies, the CCITT. These standards
have been adopted by all the leading codec manufacturers and ensure
inter-operability between systems.
THE leading video codec manufacturers include US-based market pioneer
Compression Labs (CLI) which introduced the first commercially successful
codec in 1982, its main rival, PictureTel, and Videotelcom (Vtel). European
suppliers include BT and GPT.
The market for video-conferencing equipment divides into three main segments
according to Mr Mike Newman, managing director of Internet
Videocommunications, the Bristol-based video-conferencing specialist and
CLI's distributor in the UK. These are:
Large group or studio systems usually installed for use by between six and
10 people at each end. These bespoke studio systems cost from about 30,000
upwards and are the oldest segment of the market - they are the systems
which have typically been used by senior executives in large organisations.
Although they will remain an important part of the overall market, growth
will probably not be as spectacular as that of smaller systems.
Small group systems, suitable for up to four people at each end. These
compact or cabinet systems first appeared in the late 1980s and usually come
on wheels so they are also called 'roll-around', 'roll-about' or mobile room
systems (MRS).
They represent a second generation of video-conferencing products made
possible by the reduction in size and cost of equipment and are likely to be
the fastest growing segment of the market over the next few years.
For example, CLI's Eclipse system launched in February costs under Dollars
20,000 for a complete fully-assembled and ready-to-plug-in system including
overhead graphics and other features until recently only found only on
studio systems.
Desktop or personal video systems provide one-to-one video-communications
usually by adding a video camera and a plug-in video card to a personal
computer attached to a digital telephone line or office network. CLI's Cameo
Personal Video System, launched last year, is one desktop option and several
others are under development.
For example Olivetti, Europe's largest PC manufacturer, working with BT over
the past two-and-a-half years, has developed the personal communications
computer (PCC). The PCC integrates the functions of a video telephone with
mainstream computer applications and can transmit voice, video, data, text,
and graphics over a single ISDN line.
Mr Mark Churchward, divisional manager in Olivetti's UK document management
division, says with confidence, 'video on the desktop will revolutionise the
way offices work.' Certainly most analysts believe that by the mid-1990s,
desktop video will become the fastest growing segment of the
video-conferencing market.
'A lot of products are emerging from the development stage,' said Ms Heide
Aghnami of Dataquest, 'desktop systems really have a very good chance of
success if you imagine the number of PC users in Europe.'
Datapoint, another US codec manufacturer, has taken another, highly
integrated, approach to providing video on the desktop by combining the
functions of a PC and a video- conferencing system into a single workstation
called Minx Link which can either work on a point-to-point basis or be
hooked up to a local video network to provide multipoint video-conferencing.
Analysts are much less enthusiastic about the short-term prospects for the
small-screen video-phones - dubbed 'granny phones' - which are already on
sale in a number of countries. Most see them developing mainly as a consumer
electronics product rather than a business system and even then do not
foresee substantial sales until prices come down considerably and picture
quality is improved.
In contrast, equipment suppliers say that interest in full
video-conferencing systems in has never been stronger.
'Prices of equipment are falling and that is opening up the market,' says Mr
Robert Ralphs, product manager for video-conferencing at Mercury which, like
BT in the UK, also sells equipment alongside its network services.
'Video-conferencing is perceived as cutting costs and it seems to have
thrived on recession,' he says.
Because equipment is getting cheaper, the purchasing decision is moving down
the management ladder - 'you don't necessarily need board approval now,'
notes Mr Ralphs. Cheaper prices also mean wider use of video-conferencing
equipment and greater access to equipment within large companies.
Technical improvements have resulted in higher quality sound and pictures
over lower capacity data lines. Meanwhile the wider availability of dial-up
digital lines means that customers no longer have to own or lease expensive
high capacity dedicated data lines which were not used all the time, or
pre-book suitable telecoms circuits in advance.
Today, the availability of standard digital office lines means that setting
up a video-conference between two offices is no more difficult - or
expensive - than making an ordinary voice call through a digital PBX.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): A rush to log on -
In the US, Frank Lipsius looks at the growing appeal of online services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR two years, Andre Knecht, national singles sales manager for Warner Bros
Records, wanted to join the data superhighway with a CompuServe forum about
the music industry.
He won his chance in mid-September when the Music Vendor forum joined what
CompuServe spokeswoman Debra Young says is 400 forums on the online service.
Warner Bros is using its new outlet, accessible to 1.4m CompuServe
subscribers throughout the world, to post new release information that is
normally disseminated only within the music industry through flimsy
new-release books.
Warner pop group Depeche Mode conducted an online press conference on the
Music Vendor forum and Knecht fields questions on changing personnel of rock
groups by staying late at the office to log on. Warner Bros does not expect
to sell anything directly on CompuServe because, although shopping is an
option of CompuServe's 'electronic mall,' information is really the
service's stock in trade.
Information generates the most sales, as when people log themselves onto
airline reservation systems and figure out their own itineraries or buy
shares more cheaply than through brokers. But then CompuServe has extensive
research for stock-market investing, including a screening service to
highlight variables like book value, growth rate, debt/equity ratio and
yield.
A stock quote is constantly at hand by typing GO BASICQUOTES, and the
Analyzer answers financial and ownership questions.
CompuServe's income comes from keeping subscribers logged onto the system.
CompuServe supplies the information while outside vendors make the sales.
For less than Dollars 10 a month, subscribers get unlimited use of free
services but many are surcharged, including even the Music Vendors forum,
though stock quotes are free. As 'the Swiss army knife of all online
services,' (in the words of PC World magazine), CompuServe has the most
comprehensive online service.
But others have found their own niches in a field where information overlap
is almost unavoidable. The Dow-Jones service has exclusive online use of the
Wall Street Journal, its own flagship publication, while Mead Data Central
secured exclusive online use of the New York Times for its Nexis service.
Other popular networks are Prodigy, a co-production of IBM and Sears, which
has a consumer bent; GEnie, General Electric's consumer data service, which
is popular for online conversation and having the latest shareware; and
America Online, a newcomer with less information but speedy communications.
THE Windows interface has made access to the databases merely a few mouse
clicks on provided software. Once logged on, subscribers see icons
highlighting areas of access like news, research, investing, and travel. The
services differ in the way they charge, some putting limits on the time made
available with the monthly fee. All have surcharges for special services.
All these online networks are provided by for-profit companies, but the
network of networks, which carries thousands of networks besides these, is
government-subsidised and non-profit. The Internet, as it is called, came to
prominence when Vice-President Al Gore discussed the data superhighway of
the future, which he expected to be a public-private collaboration.
Many noted that such a thing already existed - Internet - which began as the
means for academic exchange. It gradually grew to include companies
exchanging data with customers, suppliers and their own far-flung outposts.
The debate over who should control the Internet goes on while commercial
activity leaps through the cyberspace. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced
that it intends to buy Delphi Internet Services which connects customers to
the Internet, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph said that it soon would
connect customers to the Internet with a toll-free 800 number.
The Internet itself is being inundated with businesses signing themselves
on. As of March 1, this year, more than half of 3,400 networks registered
for the Internet were private businesses, compared to 29 per cent research
institutes and 4 per cent educational centres - 'what is going on now is the
equivalent of a gold rush,' according to Phill Gross, chairman of the
Internet Engineering Task Force. 'Commercial companies, new users, the small
mom-and-pop outfits - they're all rushing into this new frontier.'
The task force is a voluntary group that deals with technical problems on
the Internet, including an effort to provide more security on the system.
The lack of security is itself protection against too much commercial
exploitation of the Internet. But as the National Science Foundation's
measly Dollars 11.5m subsidy is gradually reduced, the system is a tempting
target for commercialisation. For now, businesses that indulge in a
cyberspace version of junk mail are being excoriated by other Internet
users.
The future holds prospects for voice, text and video transmission, a
development that will only increase the appeal of the online services.
Already the Music Vendor forum foresees transmitting artwork, digital audio
files and video on CompuServe.
Knecht says that the Music Vendor forum had more than 1,000 log-ons its
first day, a feat that indicates the potential for this extra-terrestrial
definition of office space. He is leading the way in breaking down the
barriers between consumer and business communication.
But the rapid changes endanger the uniqueness of a channel pioneered by
non-commercial interests. Its fate may be decided all too shortly, as the
leading players in worldwide communications weigh in with their investments.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Cordless market has
big potential - Paul Taylor highlights advances in mobile communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE invention of the telegraph in America in the 19th century enabled the
office to be separated from the factory for the first time. Since then, the
telephone in its traditional guise, has played a central role in most
businesses.
But while the fixed wire telephone freed the office from the production
process, it has tied the office worker to the desk. Now the introduction and
rapid growth of mobile and cordless telephony promises to untether the
telephone and the telephone user.
'At the moment, telephones in the office are linked to desks, computers are
connected together in local area networks and 80 miles of cable snakes round
an average office building,' says Philip Ross, head of research at Business
Design Group, a UK-based design consultancy. 'People work in the same
location every day because communications are fixed between physical
places.'
However, radio telephony is beginning to challenge these restrictions. PABX
manufacturers like GPT Communications Systems are already supplying systems
which support cordless handsets within the office.
GPT's iSDX 100 system, which was launched earlier this year, is based upon
the same digital CT2 technology as telepoint systems like Hutchison's Rabbit
service in the UK and is designed for small to medium-sized businesses.
Canada's Northern Telecom has launched a similar system called the Companion
100 which is also available from BT.
Aside from providing the benefits of mobile telephony within an office,
these systems also enable new staff members to be accommodated with the
minimum of inconvenience. However, rival systems based on a European
cordless standard called Dect (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications)
are beginning to appear from companies such as Ericsson, Phillips and
Alcatel which claim that the system has advantages over CT2, particularly
for heavy use within office buildings.
Ericsson, which has just launched its Freeset system in Europe, acknowledges
that the cordless PABX market has been slow to develop so far, but
nevertheless expects the global market for cordless PABX extensions to be
worth about Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, buoyed by the adoption of the Dect
technology standard.
'Dect is by far the best technology for cordless PABX systems,' claims Hans
van der Hoek, Ericsson's sales and distribution manager for Freeset, 'apart
from being a mandatory standard within Europe, only Dect has the capability
to create offices in which almost everyone uses a cordless phone.'
While CT2 and Dect can provide mobility for voice telecommunications within
the office, other solutions are required once the executive, sales
representative or engineer travels out of the office.
The past 18 months has seen the launch of the second generation of mobile
telecom networks in Europe based on digital rather than analogue technology.
These new digital networks promise to deliver a wide range of sophisticated
new voice and data services for those on the move.
By the end of this decade, half of all telephone calls worldwide are
expected to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing
proportion of those telephones will be operating on the new digital
technology which boasts some advantages over older analogue systems.
Among these, digital mobile telephones can provide more reliable, clearer
and more secure telecoms - although at least for the moment these usually
have to be offset by higher equipment costs.
Europe has taken the lead in the switch to digital systems spurred by the
adoption in the mid 1980s of a pan-European digital telecommunications
standard called GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile).
The first GSM networks were launched 15 months ago and all the leading
European Community states apart from Spain now have them in operation. By
the end of this year Dataquest, the market research organisation, has
forecast that there will be 1.1m digital subscribers in Europe, growing to
8.31m by the end of 1996.
In the UK, Vodafone's GSM network is already operational while Cellnet plans
to launch its system early next year, initially on a regional basis.
Vodafone has already has reached GSM roaming agreements with a number of
overseas network operators which enables GSM subscribers carrying their
personal smartcards which slot into GSM handsets to make calls using a GSM
phone anywhere in Europe.
Vodafone has also launched a second national digital service called
MetroDigital which exploits GSM technology but provides lower cost local
calls and could prove particularly popular with business customers in urban
areas.
Meanwhile, the first PCN (Personal Communications Network) service, dubbed
One-2-One, was launched last month in the London area by a joint venture of
Mercury Communications and US West. Initially its coverage is confined to
the M25 area around London, but coverage will expand rapidly.
Like MetroDigital, One-2-One is targeted mainly at urban customers who
require a high quality digital service outside the office or home. Next
April, a second PCN service is due to be launched in the UK by Hutchison
Microtel, a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom and elsewhere in Europe, PCN
services are likely to be developed in Germany, France and Spain.
Another advantage of these new digital mobile services is that they are also
easier to integrate with fixed telecommunications and data processing
equipment and enable network operators and others to provide a wide range of
value added customer services like messaging services and data transmission.
'With their intelligent network architecture and nationwide digital
networks, the mobile operators will soon be able to offer all the services
that a (fixed network) telephone operator can, and more,' says Tim Harrabin,
a principal consultant at the Cambridge-based Analysys telecoms, strategy
and economics consultancy, in a recent report.
Some like Chris Gare, Mercury's manager of systems technology, believe that
at some stage before the end of the decade, office cordless and mobile
digital technologies will be integrated in a dual mode handset capable of
operating as a Dect handset in the office and a PCN phone outside.
Business Design's Philip Ross in London believes mobile voice and data
technologies are likely to be used alongside traditional hard wire cabling
or new solutions such as ISDN in the short term.
But he argues that once cordless technology has proved successful, there
will be a move toward a completely cordless environment, although probably
using a cabled backbone (either copper or fibre optic) as a link between
floors in a building.
In the longer term, some technology strategists believe individuals, rather
than machines, will be assigned a personal number which, once they have
'checked in,' will enable telecom services to be routed to them wherever
they are and irrespective of the equipment they are using.
Olivetti, the Italian PC manufacturer, has taken this concept a step further
believing that its future products will converge into a system which it
calls the Active Office.
Based on joint venture work with DEC at research laboratories in Cambridge
Olivetti has developed a system which enables digital video and audio
services to follow individuals around from room to room tracked via the
infra-red active badges which they wear and which send a location signal
every 15 seconds to a network of sensors.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (4): Ways to avoid 'the
voice mail jail' - Voice Messaging Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FIFTY per cent of all calls made are for one-way communication only, but
they often interrupt work which is more important than the call itself. So
says Nigel Harte, business manager for voice products at Mercury
Communications.
Irritation at these interruptions is helping to increase the take up of
answering machines, voice messaging and voice processing. The latest models
of answering machine come complete with cordless phone, and some provide an
electronic handshake between base station and handset for extra security.
Cordless answering machines are expensive. In the UK, Dixons, the
high-street electrical retailer, sells two models: one from South Western
Bell for Pounds 149.99 and one from Panasonic for Pounds 179.99. This
compares with Pounds 29.99 for its cheapest non-cordless machine from
Betacom.
On standard answering machines, popular features include automatic dating
and timing of messages (by a computer-generated voice), the ability to
switch the machine on remotely, and 'toll saver', available on Panasonic's
Pounds 59.99 Easa-Phone and some others. If the Easa-Phone does not pick up
the call on the fourth ring, the owner should hang up because there are no
messages.
Backlash against voice messaging: For the corporate environment, voice
messaging systems offer many more features than answering machines. But all
too often they are implemented using the answering machine as a model.
In the US, this has led to something of a backlash against voice messaging.
For example, the chief executive of First Union Corporation, made news when
he sent a memo banning his company's voice messaging system after his call
to a senior manager was greeted with a recorded message. His memo won
applause from employees who also hated the system.
Since then, the voice messaging industry has taken steps to make sure the
systems are used more effectively. In July 1992, leading voice messaging
manufacturers and service providers (including AT&amp;T, British Telecom Mobile,
Octel Communications Corporation and VMX Inc.) formed the Voice Messaging
Educational Committee, (VMEC); and this year the committee has published a
US market survey Voice Messaging: a vital link in Business Communications
and a booklet on voice mail etiquette.
At their simplest, voice mail systems allow callers to leave a message if
the person they want to talk to is not available. By dialing the appropriate
voice mailbox number (and a code), users can play messages back, or forward
them to another mailbox. But if a voice messaging system is poorly
implemented, the customer may simply get passed from voice mailbox to voice
mailbox, or from menu of options to menu of options. This frustrating state
is known as 'voice mail jail' because the caller feels trapped in the
system.
The etiquette guide suggests: 'Tell callers how they can easily reach
someone 'live' if their call is urgent.' In fact, the current trend in the
US is to use the systems to augment the work of humans, rather than as an
excuse for firing the receptionist.
There are two main types of voice messaging system: public services
(sometimes linked to a special voice mail phone number) offered by telecoms
carriers such as British Telecom and Mercury; and premises-based systems,
where a company buys voice messaging equipment for use with the in-house
phone system.
Researchers BIS Mackintosh say there will be 1.4m public voice mail users in
Europe on fixed and mobile systems by the end of the year, rising to 5.4m in
1997. Meanwhile, premises-based systems have grown 70 per cent a year
between 1991 and 1993.
In the UK, the profile of public voice messaging is increasing, largely
because cellular phone operators, such as Cellnet, Vodafone and One-2-One
(from Mercury), provide voice mailboxes linked to users' mobile phones.
Visual voice mailboxes: As well as spreading to mobile phone users, 'voice
messaging technologies are moving to the desktop and becoming integrated
with other forms of communication, such as electronic mail and fax,'
according to Elaine Cascio, a consultant at US voice systems consultancy
Vanguard. For example, products are emerging which allow a list of voice
messages to be viewed on a personal computer.
Particular messages can then be selected and played back on the PC (if it
has voice capabilities) or through the phone. Suppliers which have (or are
developing) integrated products for the desktop include VMX, Octel
Communications, C3, Applied Technology, Active Voice and Converse.
Apart from voice messaging, there are two other types of voice system:
audiotex (used for 0898 recorded information, such as racing results) and
voice processing (or interactive voice response).
Voice processing is the type of technology used in telephone-based home
banking systems. It might, for example, prompt the user to 'press 'one' to
order a cheque book, press 'two' for your bank balance.'
In essence, these systems link a voice interface to a computer database.
They allow customers to input and retrieve information using a touch-tone
phone.
The technology is often used in financial applications. In the US, it is
also used extensively to order goods publicised on the QVC home shopping
channel.
In fact, QVC's system, Tootie, has done a lot to expose consumers to voice
response. Interest is growing in Europe too. Cascio says US voice response
suppliers are experiencing 57 per cent growth in Europe, with much of this
growth coming from pc-based or client-server systems.
Integration with fax: According to Robin Scurlock, head of BIS Mackintosh's
messaging programme, one of the main drivers in the voice systems market is
integration with fax.
For example, Octel Communications sells a fax store- and-forward product in
the US which enables a caller to a voice mailbox to leave a voice message as
well as transmit a fax into the mailbox (where it is stored on disk). The
voice message can be collected in the usual way and the fax can be routed to
a nearby fax machine by using the phone handset to give details of the fax
number to the mailbox.
Integration is also evident in fax-on-demand products which enable users to
phone a supplier, use touch tone prompts to indicate which product/service
they are interested in, and then key in their fax number to get the details
faxed to them.
Companies using fax-on-demand in the UK include Compaq and Advanstar,
organisers of the recent 'Voice '93' show held in London. And in the US,
there are many bureaux that use fax-on-demand technology to send out
companies' brochures, charging on a monthly or per item basis.
Fax-on-demand could be the ideal form of one-way communication. No-one gets
interrupted and the fax starts to be sent before the caller puts down the
phone.
Copies of 'Making the most of voice mail,' a guide to voice mail etiquette,
are available from any VMEC member-company or from Vanguard Communications

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): How today's
telephones limit tomorrow's technology / A look at developments in office
communications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CORDLESS phones have begun to make an impact in the home. But traditional
PABXs still dominate the office. Ian Garcia, marketing communications
manager at GPT, says: 'Cordless PABXs will never be the norm in business;
but they are essential for managers who spend 50 to 60 per cent of their
time away from their desks.'
Factory managers at Wavin Industrial Products, a maker of plastic pipe and
fitting systems, are testing GPT software which adds cordless communications
to their standard PABX. Now the managers use cordless handsets to make and
receive calls from the factory floor, where they spend much of their time.
Cordless phones also have a place in the 'virtual office,' like one run by
Digital Equipment in Sweden. Here no-one has a permanent office, but desks
and computers can be booked as and when they are needed. Cordless PABXs are
ideal in this environment because the switchboard operator doesn't need to
know where people are to put a call through, (see article on facing page).
Despite the benefits, take up of cordless PABXs has been slow. Keith
Mallinson, director of research at the Yankee Group Europe, says: 'This is
starting to change with the launch of new products from Northern Telecom and
Ericsson.'
There are two main types of cordless technology - CT2 (cordless telephony 2)
and DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephony standard). Northern Telecom
and GPT both sell products which are developments from the CT2 standard,
used in the UK Rabbit wireless phone network.
Ericsson prefers DECT, which is backed by Etsi, the European Telecoms
Standards Institute. Mr Mallinson believes there is room for both
technologies and that the market will grow - 'between 10 and 20 per cent of
office workers could be using cordless phones by the end of the century,' he
says.
However, in the longer term, he believes that improvements to the interface
between humans and phone networks will have a more significant effect on the
way phones are used in offices.
HORRENDOUS HANDSETS
Telephone handsets seem easy to use so long as you only want to dial a
number. But many people even have difficulty forwarding a call to a nearby
desk. In fact, if you try to set up a conference call on a PABX or want to
use BT's Star Services (such as Charge Advice), you will need a good memory
for weird combinations of buttons, numbers and symbols. The poor interface
between phone user and network will become even more apparent when the next
generation of phone services, such as Selective Call Barring, Selective Call
Forwarding, and display of Caller ID, become available. Some believe that
phones should be controlled by the user's personal computer. But many will
find this a turn off. In the meantime, 'screen phones' are being developed
to fill the breach. These consist of a handset linked to a small liquid
crystal display. The challenge for the telecoms industry is to make them as
easy to use as through-the-wall cash machines or ATMs.
There are several screen phones available, (mainly in the US) including
models from AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom and Philips. Some have keyboards; others
are operated by buttons near the screen.
Widespread use of screen phones is some way off; use of enhanced network
services is much closer. This month BT begins trials in Perth, Scotland, of
Caller ID equipment (which displays the caller's phone number) and Caller
Return services.
Caller Return means that if the phone stops ringing before you get to it,
you can find out the caller's phone number by pressing a few buttons. If the
six-month trials are successful, BT will offer the services to phone users
nationwide next year. Another kind of enhanced service is available to
business users over the public phone network. Called Centrex, this is
essentially a substitute for having an in-house PABX. It uses the
intelligence in digital exchanges to offer PABX-like features. In the past,
these services have made very little headway but they now have some high
profile customers such as Daiwa Bank which uses Mercury's Centrex service.
VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS
Instead of (or as well as) replacing the PABX, it is possible to replace a
private telecoms network with a Virtual Private Network, (VPN).
A VPN is essentially a substitute for a network of leased lines. Telecoms
carriers which sell VPNs argue that they offer the same service levels as
private networks at a lower cost because they can carry several company's
data at the same time.
In the US, the market for VPNs is worth several billion dollars and has
helped to take traffic off private networks and give it back to the telecoms
carriers. European telecoms carriers hope that VPN will do the same for
them. One advantage from the carrier's point of view is that VPNs enable
them to offer a greater variety of different tariffs than is possible under
traditional tariffing regulations. It is early days for European virtual
private networks but they are already attracting customers like Barclays
Bank.
RACE TO OFFER TELECOMS 'OUTSOURCING'
VPNs usually form part of the portfolio of services offered by telecoms
suppliers which want to win telecoms outsourcing (or managed network
services) business. Telecoms outsourcing involves taking over the management
and day-to-day running of a company's telecommunications network.
Sometimes the network is already in existence. Sometimes the telecoms
company expands it or builds a new one, often making use of its own voice
and data networks.
Jonathan Crane, president of MCI National Accounts, says the global network
outsourcing market is geared primarily towards the estimated 2,500
multinational corporations in the world that have extensive communications
networks spanning the globe.
These have to deal with a multiplicity of telecommunications carriers and
bills in a variety of currencies. They therefore have much to gain from
handing over their networks to a third party.
A bigger incentive, however, is the potential for cost reduction. For
example, US bank J P Morgan expects to save Dollars 12.5m in operating
expenses through its Dollars 20m five-year contract with BT and could save
more from its Dollars 80m contract with MCI/Infonet.
MCI, now in a joint telecoms outsourcing venture with BT, estimates that the
global network outsourcing market is worth Dollars 5bn a year with annual
growth of 15 to 20 per cent. Fears about quality of service prevent the
market from growing any faster, reflecting the conservative nature of office
communications.

While offices in the developed world are spoiled for choice with technical
advances in communications, many other regions of the world are racing to
catch up in terms of basic telephone connections. In particular, the dynamic
economies of the Asia-Pacific area will experience rapid growth in telecom
service revenues in this decade, as this table indicates. Similarly, Latin
America shows strong demand for telecom modernisation.
Meanwhile, the success of mobile communications supports the 'leapfrog'
theory that areas such as eastern Europe may skip generations of telecom
development and leap to the latest technology.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (1): A revolution on the
desk-top - Networks of powerful personal computers and workstations, along
with cordless telephony and data systems, are transforming the way that
companies operate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGY and the office are inextricably intertwined. Without the
telephone and keyboard there would be no modern office, and without the
office there would be a much smaller market for technology.
The modern office has evolved over the last 150 years, aided by
technological breakthroughs like the development of the telephone in the
19th century. However, the pace of change has accelerated dramatically over
the past 15 years.
Since the late 1970s, digital technology has transformed the way information
is collected, analysed, manipulated, transmitted and stored.
It has not led to the creation of the 'paperless office' as some had
predicted. Nevertheless, it is making possible the closer integration of
data processing and telecommunications.
Perhaps the most dramatic change has been the arrival of the personal
computer on to the office desktop. Increasingly these PCs are hooked
together into networks in order to share data and digital peripherals, such
as printers.
This step has put the power of yesterday's mainframe computers at the
disposal of most office workers in a process which has become known as
'downsizing', or more recently 'rightsizing' - to acknowledge that the
mainframe or departmental mini-computer can still play a crucial role,
especially where large databases are involved.
There is no doubt that the computer has changed the way business is
conducted. As IBM, the master of the mainframe, is keen to point out, if all
the automated financial transactions in the UK, including direct debits,
were handled manually it is estimated that 72,000 extra banking staff would
be needed.
Similarly the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea holds over 60m
records on its mainframe computer. Normally the agency returns documents
within three days of receipt, but if each file were checked manually it
would take 114 years.
However, as a recent joint report from IBM and the Cranfield University
management school confirmed, chief executives are not concerned about the
type of computer 'platform' used in their business, 'they want solutions,
not boxes'.
What matters increasingly is how technology is used and, in particular,
whether it enhances competitive advantage and contributes to cost savings
and greater efficiency.
For example, one of most often quoted statistics in the telecommunications
industry is that more than two thirds of business telephone calls fail to
reach their intended target.
One possible solution to this problem would be to introduce cordless office
telephone lines and handsets. Indeed, GPT Communications Systems, Northern
Telecom and Ericsson have all recently launched cordless PBX systems in
Europe.
Ericsson, whose system is based on the digital European cordless telecoms
(Dect) standard is predicting that the cordless PABX will 'revolutionise
office communications during the 1990s'.
The Swedish company expects the global market for cordless PABX extensions
to be worth some Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, while some independent analysts
have predicted that cordless extensions will account for a third of the
market for all business telephones by the end of the century.
IN time, Mr Chris Gare, Mercury's manager of strategic technologies,
believes cordless office-based telecommunications systems will be integrated
with other digital telecommunications services including personal
communications networks (PCNs), such as Mercury's One-2-One service in the
UK and the next generation of personal digital assistants, (PDAs).
Within the office, wireless local area networks linking desktop computers,
workstations and other devices, without the need for fixed cabling have been
launched by both NCR and Motorola.
Such developments raise questions about whether a centralised office
structure will be needed in the future at all, or whether virtual private
telephone networks and other advanced facilities, such as desktop
video-conferencing systems, will enable office staff to be dispersed - or
even to work from home.
'Demand for cordlessness will result because the technology facilitates many
of the changes that are already gathering momentum,' says Philip Ross, head
of research at the Business Design Group consultancy in London.
'Flexibility and mobility will become the imperatives of the 1990s and the
freedom that cordless telephony and data transfer allows can only accelerate
this process as we move towards the virtual office.'
Mr Ross argues that organisations are already moving towards greater
flexibility as they 'downsize', contract out services, and use consultants
and part timers.
'We will see the emergence of a 'virtual office', more akin to a hotel,
where individuals have flexible space where and when they need it, sharing
facilities,' he predicts.
Networks of smaller and more powerful workstations, linked to central
databases are predicted in a new study by architects DEGW and the Building
Research Establishment.
'Many of the problems associated with the introduction into offices of the
first wave of distributed intelligence will be overcome. Workstations will
be freed from the locational constraints of the traditional office,' says
the report.*
Already a growing number of businesses are using cellular telephony,
portable computers and mobile data networks to exchange information between
a central office database and employees while they are on the move. Business
customers are also integrating their PC networks and telecoms to take
advantage of value-added network services, such as electronic mail and
electronic data interchange (EDI), which can remove the need to send and
receive standard paper forms such as invoices, orders and bills.
DESPITE the advent of EDI and other office technology, about 95 per cent of
information used in the office is still stored on paper, rather than
electronically. Indeed far from dispensing with paper, office employees are
handling ever increasing volumes of it.
At one organisation interviewed as part of a 1992 study by management
consultants Touche Ross, the 2,000 staff dealt with 45 tonnes of incoming
mail a year, and 48 tonnes of outgoing mail - equivalent to generating 25kg
of paper per person.
The study also shows a dramatic growth in the use of electronic data, and a
clear trend towards optical storage.
New hardware such as digital optical scanning, storage and retrieval devices
and CD-Rom systems have begun to appear in the office, but so too have paper
generators like high-volume electronic demand printers which link directly
to computers and digital copiers which scan a hard copy once before
reproducing multiple copies.
Indeed, office-based electronic printing is becoming increasingly
sophisticated. For example, earlier this year Indigo, a small
entrepreneurial Israeli company, demonstrated the first high quality colour
digital offset press, which it described as 'the marriage of offset printing
and digital imaging.'
The development of digital offset colour mirrors developments elsewhere in
the office where previously unconnected pieces of electronic hardware are
becoming integrated.
For example, multifunction digital devices which combine some or all of the
features of a facsimile machine, photocopier, laser printer and scanner have
begun to appear and fax and other communications capabilities are being
built directly into personal computers and office networks, removing the
need for paper print-outs entirely.
Technological improvements, dial-up high-capacity digital telephone lines
and tumbling equipment prices are also beginning to make video-conferencing
a real option for a much broader group of companies.
Already, the first desktop video-conferencing systems, usually using a card
plugged into a PC and a small video camera, have begun to arrive.
Some computer companies - including Olivetti, Europe's largest PC
manufacturer - have developed systems designed to integrate data processing
and video-conferencing into a single desk-top unit.
In order to deliver multimedia services such as real-time video, graphics
and data across a personal computer network, new high speed, high capacity
packet-switched technologies, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), have
been developed.
These technical advances will further erode the distinctions between
traditional computer companies and service providers such as
telecommunications network operators. They also underline the growing
importance of software and services.
The shift of computing power on to the desk-top has already had dramatic
repercussions for the traditional computer hardware vendors which have been
increasingly forced to respond to shrinking margins by trying to provide
their office customers with higher valued-added services, such as system
integration and facilities management.
At the same time, the advance has turned Intel, whose chips power most PCs,
and Microsoft, which dominates PC-operating systems and software
applications markets, into household names.
Where these dynamic forces reshaping the office are all leading is the
subject of much speculation. Gazing into his crystal ball, Philip Ross of
Business Design predicts that over the next few years, as the various
technologies in computers, media and communications converge, office workers
will be allowed a greater degree of flexibility and freedom to choose where,
when and how to work - 'the office of the future will be a very different
place,' he says.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a strong stores sector, Dixons recovered from Friday's weak session as
the market digested an analysts visit to the electrical retailer's South
Wales operations.
The stock had been rocked on Friday by revelations that Tandy Corp, of the
US, planned to take on Dixons' PC World stores, with plans to open on
several sites in the UK.
However, analysts said yesterday that Dixons' management made light of the
threat, advancing its own expansion plans and also telling analysts that the
Pounds 3.5bn UK PC market was likely to see a huge leap in retail margins as
its out-of-town computer store concept increased market share. Dixons added
2 1/2 at 279p.
There was some talk that Dixons was eyeing some of the sites being earmarked
for disposal by Do It All, the loss-making home improvement venture of WH
Smith and Boots. Do It All is also said to be negotiating with other
electrical retailers besides Dixons to share floor space in some
unprofitable sites. WH Smith 'A' rose 8 to 487p and Boots 2 to 517p.
Some nervousness set in around Wellcome ahead of its results on Thursday and
the shares slipped 11 1/2 to 834p. The stock was not helped by the advice of
Nomura to switch from Wellcome into SmithKline Beecham, but the latter also
had a poor day, falling 8 to 440p.
Glaxo lost 1 1/2 to 714p, holding a little resilience with Swedish and
Canadian approval for two of its drugs.
EC approval of Amersham International's heart imaging agent Myoview put
vigour into its shares, which advanced 25 to 906p. The decision by the
European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products came a little earlier
than expected, although the approval was anticipated. That, coupled with a
tight stock, sent the price climbing.
Further movements in the break-up of British Gas were partly behind the high
activity in the stock. While it was reported that the government may move
more quickly to end the gas monopoly, there is also a belief that there may
be less pressure for a proposed break-up of the company. In volume of 14m
the shares edged ahead a half-penny to 347p.
Profit-takers continued to dog Enterprise Oil, which fell 12 to 481p, while
Pittencrieff, still enjoying buoyancy from its telecommunications interests,
moved up 9 to 381p.
International conglomerate Hanson shed 3 to 270p in average trading of 4.5m
after US investment bank Goldman Sachs downgraded profits expectations.
Goldman now expects profits for the year to September 1993 will be Pounds
20m lower than its previous forecast at Pounds 1.04bn. A more substantial
downgrading was made to the current year's figure, reducing it by Pounds 80m
to Pounds 1.275bn.
Mr Jack Kelly at Goldman Sachs in New York also believes Hanson may dispose
of assets in both the UK and US in the next few months. He said: 'The
closing of the Quantum deal and its associated debt of Pounds 1.66bn will
encourage management to trim its non-core businesses.'
Among financials, National Westminster Bank relinquished 12 1/2 to 572 1/2
p, with James Capel and Kleinwort Benson said to be negative on the stock.
Royal Bank of Scotland eased 2 to 359p after stating that its US subsidiary
is to acquire Boston-based New World Bancorp for Dollars 144.3m.
Profit-taking marked the day's performance among composite insurers. Royal
Insurance receded 7 to 319p, while Guardian Royal Exchange eased 5 to 219p.
The consolidation of its television interests excited interest in Pearson
and there was strong trade of 1.5m shares, considerably above average for
the stock. The price edged up a penny to 570p.
Yield factors were said to have proved the attraction in United Newspapers,
which moved forward 3 to 557p.
A lower than expected dividend and a cautious interim results statement from
business services group BET saw the shares retreat 8 to 128 1/2 p. Profits
improved 24 per cent to Pounds 46.1m, in line with expectations, but the
dividend was halved to 1p, against predictions of a figure around 1.25p.
Volume was 4.9m at the close.
Investors remained unimpressed by the boardroom squabble at international
trading group Lonrho and the shares eased 2 1/2 to 128p.
Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries, up 4 at 490p, was in
demand ahead of next week's third-quarter figures.
Inchcape tumbled 13 to 505p after Robert Fleming downgraded profits
estimates and reiterated its sell recomm-endation to investors. The broker
shaved its current year estimate by Pounds 8m to Pounds 270m, to take
account of a 'shift in currencies'.
The news that troubled container leasing group Tiphook was splitting the
role of chairman and chief executive and that it had won approval for a
higher borrowing limit cheered the market. The shares strengthened 11 to
127p.
The appointment of Mr Roberto Quarto as the new chief executive of BBA was
well received by the market and the shares advanced 9 to 167p. Mr Quarto is
currently a director at BTR and his departure from the international
conglomerate saw its shares dip 2 to 373 1/2 p.
In a quiet leisure sector, catering outfit Compass Group was helped by a
positive note from NatWest Securities. The shares added 6 at 564p.
Second line stores stocks showed gains. Alexon put on 3 at 73p, Country
Casuals 2 at 173p, Moss Brothers - reporting figures yesterday - 7 at 245p
and Stylo 5 at 210p.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation over the future of Lasmo's finance chief continues to preoccupy
the market, with eyes yesterday fixed firmly on today's expected board
meeting. Weekend press reports further stoked the rumours, which were strong
in the market last week.
The shares notched up 1 1/2 to 145p amid consistent support from US buyers.
One industry watcher described the per-sistent speculation as encouraging
since the market would welcome a shift in the boardroom.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Scotia strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another stock launching into the market yesterday was Scotia Holdings, the
research-based pharmaceuticals group that has financed its growth from
products based on evening primrose oil.
Strong institutional demand for the shares pushed turnover up to 5.5m. The
issue was placed at 290p and immediately jumped to a strong premium at 323p.
Some profit-taking then set in and took the shine off, with the shares
closing at 316p.
Dealers said bullish sentiment surrounds the stock and its strong start is
not expected to peter out. One analyst said: 'It has been an excellent
debut, with institutions waiting to mop up the shares.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vendome makes dull debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market debut of Vendome, the Pounds 2bn luxury goods group spun off from
the restructuring of Rothmans, was largely shunned by London investors
yesterday, the shares slipping in a weak market. However, the new
tobacco-only Rothmans advanced strongly in busy turnover as investors sought
the high yield on the stock.
Although initially supported, Vendome units quickly came off and dealers
reported selling pressure throughout the rest of the session. They closed at
317p, a fall of 13 on the day. Turnover was 2.3m. Rothmans climbed 19 to
403p in volume of 5.4m. Both shares are traded in units and do not qualify
for the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices because of the companies' capital
structures and payment of dividends.
Vendome, which includes the Cartier jewellery group and the Dunhill luxury
gift company, had pro-forma profits of around Pounds 200m and earnings of
21.5p per share. However, stores analysts said the stock suffered from a low
yield and being relatively unknown to UK investors. Mr William Cullen at
Panmure Gordon, the house broker, said: 'Vendome is a long-term class
situation with excellent earnings growth prospects.' He added that the units
would probably find early support from French and Swiss investors.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares slip as big investors hold
fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE record-breaking run by UK equities, that has seen the FT-SE 100 Index
move up by around 5 per cent since the start of the month, stalled yesterday
as the big domestic and international institutions held back from pushing
more cash into a market seen by many observers as having run too far too
fast.
'The big funds are holding off until there is a much clearer picture about a
rate cut in the UK,' said one institutional salesman. He said the market had
virtually factored in a one percentage point cut in domestic interest rates,
but was uncertain about how the authorities would implement such a
reduction.
A rather untidy session in the UK equity market saw share prices come off
sharply as the second half of the two-week trading account got underway.
The FT-SE 100 ended one of the quietest sessions in the past two weeks 14.2
lower at 3,184.8. The lack of direction in the second liners was emphasised
by the performance of the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which finished the day
unchanged at 3,547.0.
Official turnover levels published by the Stock Exchange emphasised the
contraction in the levels of activity around the market yesterday. Turnover
was put at 482.6m shares, the lowest daily level for two weeks amd a good 10
per cent below recent average levels of business, which has often topped
700m shares daily. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks yesterday topped 300m
shares, dwarfing business in the leaders.
The value of customer business in the market last Friday reached Pounds
1.645bn, at the top end of the recent range of activity in the market and a
strong indication, dealers said, that UK and overseas funds had continued to
pump money into the market.
The lack of impetus in the market was evident from the outset of trading,
with sentiment said to have been undermined by Wall Street's failure to
establish new closing highs last Friday, despite a powerful opening
performance.
The FT-SE 100 kicked off almost four points lower and stayed in negative
territory all day, with small flurries of selling plus weakness induced by
pressure on the Footsie future, driving the 100 index down to a low point of
3,176.2 in mid-morning.
A lacklustre opening by Wall Street, unsettled by another uninspiring
performance by the US bond market, did little to underpin sentiment in
London, although a minor bout of short covering helped prices stabilise at
the close.
Leading dealings around the top UK securities houses were not surprised at
the downturn in the market. 'There has been no real downside pressure, and
turnover was by no means substantial,' said one trader. 'We still feel okay,
although there is still some profit-taking to come in this market.' He
stressed, however, that the underlying feel to the market was sound.
There is evidence of a sharp increase in unit trust sales which is bound to
impact on the market, said a senior salesman at one of the European banks.
He took the view that much of the big fund raising activity via rights
issues, had already been carried out.
International funds were said to have been instrumental in driving bank
stocks sharply lower yesterday, and were said to have been aggressive
sellers of drug stocks.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY derivatives were downbeat yesterday, with the recent inflow of money
having abated and no clear way ahead in sight, writes Christine Buckley.
The market, which was largely sentiment driven, was also fettered by a
general gloom surrounding the likelihood of an early interest rate cut.
Similarly, anyone looking towards the gilts market for a lift were
disappointed too as it edged easier.
The December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was thus left
floundering and independent traders gave up on it in considerable measure -
selling to push it lower. US dealers were said to have joined in by
off-loading some of their interest. There was little to combat the concerted
selling. The contract saw its highest point at the opening and fell back
from then on.
December opened at 3,224 and began to drift until it reached its low at
3,203. For most of the afternoon it traded sideways in a narrow band. The
contract ended at 3,206, a lead of nearly eight points on its fair value
premium to the cash market, which is taken at about 15 points. At 8,537
lots, volume was weak.
Traded options were similarly subdued, turnover reaching only 29,529 lots.
Index options featured strongly with 9,723 contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100
and 3,022 in the Euro FT-SE. Guinness was the most heavily traded stock
option with 2,445 lots.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes at record high in
late surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER A slow start, heavy demand for blue chip and cyclical issues sent the
leading US stock market index to an all-time high, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.31 at 3,673.61,
comfortably eclipsing its previous record of 3,652.09 set in August.
Secondary indices fared less well. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 ended 0.93 firmer at 464.20, the American SE composite down 1.67 at
475.58 and the Nasdaq composite off 2.93 at 769.75. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 260.3m shares.
Although investors started the week optimistic about the economy, concern
that stocks may be overpriced, with almost every major index at or near to
its record high, initially kept demand in check.
Also depressing sentiment were fresh worries about rising interest rates -
bond prices fell sharply for the third consecutive day yesterday, pushing
the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up above 6 per cent.
There were, however, some positive factors at work in the market, such as
the latest developments in the bid battle for Paramount Communications, and
good news on monthly home sales. Eventually, investor sentiment recovered
and, amid steady buying of blue chip and cyclical stocks, the Dow posted a
strong gain in the final 90 minutes of trading.
The big corporate story of the day was Paramount, which climbed Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 79 in volume of 3.2m shares on news that Viacom had matched
the Dollars 4.8bn hostile takeover bid for the entertainment group made by
QVC Network, and had begun a tender offer for Paramount stock at a price of
Dollars 80 a share. The news left Viacom, traded on the American Stock
Exchange, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 and QVC, traded on the Nasdaq
market, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 53 7/8 .
Among the cyclical stocks, Alcoa advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 70 3/4 ,
Allied Signal firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 7/8 and CSX added Dollars 1
at Dollars 78 3/8 . General Motors, however, retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 44 1/2 in volume of 5.57m shares after brokerage house PaineWebber
lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral'.
Investors also seemed to be unsettled by the news that GM had agreed on a
three-year contract with the auto workers union which gives the company more
room to avoid paying laid-off workers but offers it little relief from
pension and medical costs.
Fresh rises in bond yields hurt bank and brokerage issues. Citicorp declined
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 and Chase Manhattan gave up Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 33 1/2 , while Merrill Lynch slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 92 1/2
and Morgan Stanley Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO finished virtually unchanged after a day of lacklustre trading ahead
of last night's federal election results.
The TSE 300 index inched up 1.4 to 4,155.3. The index had been down slightly
for most of the session, before staging a modest rally to move into positive
territory. Rises led falls by 381 to 368 after volume of 42.9m shares valued
at CDollars 468.3m.
Inco, off CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 26 5/8 , said its third-quarter earnings
rose to CDollars 91.2m from CDollars 10.6m a year earlier, but the latest
quarter included an after-tax gain of CDollars 127.9m from the sale of
Inco's stake in TVX Gold.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking leaves most
bourses slightly lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-taking brought bourses back from last Friday's heights, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated after last Friday's gains, tilted down by slightly
worse than expected inflation figures from Baden-Wurttemberg. The DAX index
rose 8.22 to 2,074.39 on the session, but fell 9.23 from Friday's post
bourse close; yesterday afternoon, the Ibis-indicated DAX eased another
13.21 to 2,061.18.
Turnover fell from DM11bn to DM8.4bn. Carmakers featured in the official
session: Daimler, in spite of a Der Spiegel report of a DM3.9bn expected
operating loss this year, rose DM5.50 to DM755; Volkswagen gained DM7.70 to
DM397.50 after jobs cuts news over the weekend; and Porsche, up DM20 to
DM775, took its gains to 20 per cent this month.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, head of research at James Capel in Frankfurt, said
that Capel was still broadly negative on the sector; this included Porsche,
although analysts are beginning to look at an earnings prospect of DM60 a
share in three years' time as a result of cost cutting, and sales hopes for
the new small Porsche model.
Other outperformers included Allianz, up DM41 at DM2,873, BHF Bank, DM10.50
better at DM536, and Hornbach, the do-it-yourself retailer, DM70 higher at
DM1,850. Mr Wodniok noted that an analysts' meeting of Hornbach next week is
expected to cover the flotation of its operating subsidiary; that, he said,
could be the excuse for producing some surprisingly good figures.
PARIS ended moderately lower, off 4.13 at 2,227.73, after setting an
intraday record high of 2,240. Turnover slipped back on the first day of the
new account to FFr3.1bn from Friday's FFr6.3bn.
Synthelabo, the pharmaceuticals subsidiary of L'Oreal, was one of the most
actively traded stocks following news that French regulators were to suspend
authorisation of its anti-anxiety drug. The shares tumbled FFr18.40 or 7.4
per cent to FFr228.10, while those of L'Oreal lost FFr8 to FFr1,214. The
drug, which has only been on sale in France, had been expected to contribute
up to FFr170m to annual sales in 1993. Synthelabo has seen its shares fall
back in recent weeks from a year's high of FFr262 set at the start of
September.
Elsewhere Peugeot slipped FFr3 to FFr640 on news of plans for further job
cuts within the group.
AMSTERDAM was slightly weaker following pressure on a number of major
issues. The CBS Tendency index shed 0.6 to 136.5.
Chemical sector stocks continued to ease, with DSM down Fl 1.50 to Fl 99.70
and Akzo off Fl 3.50 to Fl 178.00. Goldman Sachs remained positive on Akzo
in spite of a number of negative comments recently on prospects in this
sector. The US investment bank commented that efforts to restructure and
reduce costs are likely to provide resilience against a near term downside
in the share price. The bank estimated earnings per share of Fl 20 by 1995,
compared with forecasts of Fl 13.40 in 1993.
Wolters Kluwer, along with Heineken, was one of the day's gainers. The
shares gained respectively 60 cents and Fl 2.30 to Fl 110.50 and Fl 198.50.
Morgan Stanley came out positively on Wolters Kluwer as part of its
strategic shift away from cyclicals and into defensive growth stocks,
looking for an initial price target of Fl 115.
MADRID saw late institutional buying which left share prices above their
worst on a day depressed by profit-taking after last week's rally.
The general index closed 1.67 lower at 308.61 in volume steady at Pta27bn.
Among banks, Popular fell Pta320 to Pta17,180 after last week's UK tour; a
James Capel sell note said that 1994 was going to be a very difficult year
for most Spanish banks, and that Popular seemed unlikely to be an exception.
ZURICH heard its good news after hours, as CS Holding, the parent of Credit
Suisse, announced 'significantly higher' third-quarter earnings. Before
that, insurers had seemed more vulnerable than banks among Swiss financials
during a general market consolidation, the SMI index falling 16.7 to
2,684.9.
OSLO was little moved by news of Norsk Hydro's better than expected third
quarter results and the All Share index slipped just 0.63 to 608.88. Norsk
Hydro shares rose NKr2.50 to NKr215.50.
ISTANBUL lost 1.7 per cent after the prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller,
replaced four ministers at the weekend. The composite index ended 251.6
lower at 14,069.3.
ATHENS fell 1 per cent after weekend announcements by the government that no
interest rate cuts were likely in the short-term. The general index closed
8.44 lower at 845.97.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Choosing between Germany and France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors plumped for Europe last week; according to the FT-Actuaries World
Indices, it showed a gain of 2.8 per cent in local currency terms, and 7.1
per cent for October so far.
This compared with a rise of 1.1 per cent in Japan and a fall of 1.4 per
cent in the US. Hong Kong had an average performance after starring with a
gain of 8.6 per cent in the week before; Mexico relieved the North American
tedium with a rise of 4.3 per cent.
The European week started well and took off again on Thursday when the
German Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates - the French equity
market reacted most obviously, with the CAC-40 index ahead 2.3 per cent on
the day. Germany picked up on Friday, but trailed on the week.
That set the stage for the renewal of the argument over which senior bourse
to choose for recovery, Paris or Frankfurt. A top German equity salesman
says that German institutions had been sceptical and English fund managers
uninterested in German stocks, but that US investors were pouring money into
the Frankfurt bourse.
Goldman Sachs looked at what it called the 'French-German conundrum' towards
the end of last week: Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah said that, on
most measures, the French equity market was significantly under-valued and
the German market overpriced. 'If interest rates were to fall to the 5 per
cent area over, say, the next nine months in both countries, then,' they
said, 'we could be very surprised if French equities did not significantly
outperform the German market on a 12 to 15-month horizon.'
Nomura's Mr Nicholas Knight, however, maintains his support for the UK, and
gold: 'The German and French equity markets have been looking for rate cuts
all year,' he says; 'this development is in the price, and it is better to
travel hopefully than to arrive.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms ahead of
East Japan Railway listing
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average firmed ahead of today's listing of East Japan Railway, as
financial institutions and public fund managers pushed up activity by
trading large-capital issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 44.50 at 20,309.33. The index rose to the day's
high of 20,473.85 in the morning on institutional buying. Selling by
corporations and arbitrageurs briefly pushed down the index to the day's low
of 20,271.83 in the afternoon.
Volume amounted to 300m shares, against 315m. Declines outnumbered advances
by 634 to 387, with 175 issues unchanged. Dealers and institutional
investors shifted funds from smaller stocks to large-capital issues to lift
volumes. Indices of small-capital stocks lost ground, with the OTC Jasdaq
average falling 1.98 per cent and the second section index losing 1.23 per
cent.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.35 to 1,669.44 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.86 to 1,313.23. Traders said most
investors were wary of building long positions ahead of the JR East listing,
while some corporate investors unloaded holdings to raise funds to buy JR
East shares.
Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said investors would want to keep share
prices steady during the initial period after the listing; but he added that
expectations of poor corporate results due to be released during the next
few weeks and bad economic figures would eventually trigger selling
pressure.
Steels and shipbuilders were traded actively: Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, rose Y6 to Y349 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial also gained
Y6, at Y691.
The dollar's recovery against the yen helped export-oriented issues. Sony
rose Y50 to Y4,950 and Pioneer Electronic advanced Y60 to Y2,860. However,
TDK lost Y100 to Y3,820 on reports of poor earnings prospects.
Financials, including banks, brokers and non-life insurers, firmed on
bargain hunting. Industrial Bank of Japan put on Y70 at Y3,410 and
Mitsubishi Bank appreciated Y90 to Y3,180. Nomura Securities rose Y30 to
Y2,030 and Tokio Marine &amp; Fire moved forward Y30 to Y1,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 4.45 to 22,221.40 in volume of 27.4m
shares.
Roundup
A MIXTURE of performances characterised yesterday's trading among the
region's markets. Taiwan and New Zealand were closed.
HONG KONG rebounded from earlier losses to end higher on bargain hunting.
The Hang Seng index was finally up 36.28 at 8,755.60, after a fall of 94
points early in the session. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.1bn from
HKDollars 5.5bn.
Among the major stocks, Cheung Kong finished 25 cents firmer at HKDollars
33.50 and Jardine Matheson was ahead 50 cents at HKDollars 70.
SINGAPORE firmed as recent gains were consolidated ahead of the listing of
Singapore Telecom shares later this week. The Straits Times Industrial index
added 12.49 at 2,102.58.
CWT Distribution, Singapore Technologies Industrial and IPC attracted
interest on news that they would become component stocks of the index from
November 2.
SEOUL was higher in moderate turnover, with Hanbo Steel and General
Construction and Sammi Steel closing the day's limit up of Won600 and Won400
respectively at Won13,200 and Won8,650.
The composite index rose 6.20 to 742.48. Turnover totalled Won581bn.
MANILA's composite index fell back by 29.81 to 2,231.18. Philippine Long
Distance Telephone and Manila Electric eased 20 and 7.50 pesos respectively
to 1,850 and 290 pesos. Turnover dropped to 674.2m pesos from 1.2bn pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR saw most buying concentrated in second-line issues as falls in
some major stocks dragged the composite index down 3.62 to 930.49.
Advance Synergy saw a day's high of MDollars 4.04 as rumours persisted of an
asset injection, before ending 28 cents up at MDollars 3.78.
Total volume was 825m shares, against Friday's 760m.
AUSTRALIA lost ground on a weaker futures market and declines in a number of
leading issues. The All Ordinaries index retreated 14.5 to 2,046.9 in
turnover of ADollars 306.8m.

There were mixed performances among the banks, with National Australia Bank
down 12 cents at ADollars 12.26, ANZ relinquishing 4 cents to ADollars 4.03
and Commonwealth gaining 5 cents at ADollars 9.90.
KARACHI added to its gains and the KSE index finished 15.72 higher at
1,501.40, recording another high for the year.
BOMBAY was firmer on the first day of the new account. The BSE-30 index
climbed 16.22 to 2,737.98.
JAKARTA failed to be encouraged by measures aimed at deregulating the
economy which were announced on Saturday. However, JP Steel rose Rp125, or
5.6 per cent, to Rp2,375 on expectations that there will be lower tariffs on
iron and steel products.
The JKSE index finished 1.75 easier at 464.47.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Pound rises on rate cut doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pound rose against the D-Mark and dollar as an element of doubt emerged
over an early cut in UK interest rates and other currencies settled
following the volatility of last week, writes Peter John.
But most of yesterday's moves reflected adjustment of trading positions
rather than heavy shifts of money, and economists were wary of giving them
too much importance.
Economic data on Friday had suggested that the UK economic recovery was
still on track. This prompted coverage in the weekend press arguing that a
UK rate cut was less necessary than previously thought. The comment gave an
additional lift to a pound already helped by selling of the D-Mark and the
dollar.
The German currency was weaker in the aftermath of the Bundesbank's surprise
rate reduction last Thursday. Many investors feel that the Bundesbank might
have signalled a shift in monetary policy and be more prepared to ease rates
again. That view was slightly jolted when the west German state of
Baden-Wurttemberg announced a 0.3 per cent increase in the cost of living in
the month to mid-October, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.1 per cent. Most
economists had hoped for a lower figure.
Nevertheless, short-term investors had built up large holdings of D-Marks
during the recent speculative selling of the French and Belgian francs and
the movement of those holdings is likely to take some time.
By the close of European dealing, sterling was up two pfennigs at DM2.4880.
The dollar saw some correction after its six-pfennig rise against the D-Mark
last week and was sold down a pfennig after the release of the
Baden-Wurttemburg figures. It rallied later to finish at DM1.6735, down from
Friday's DM1.6750. Against the pound it dipped to Dollars 1.4860 from
Dollars 1.4730. In New York the dollar advanced to close at DM1.6865.
US home sales climbed in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.91m, the highest level this year, but economists are waiting for
Thursday's GDP figures. The data are forecast to show a rise of around 2.4
per cent in the third quarter after a 1.9 per cent increase in the second.
The French franc lost some of the gains achieved after key rates were cut on
Friday. The currency slipped to FFr3.50 to the D-Mark at one stage
yesterday, but rallied to end at FFr3.49, against a previous FFr3.493. The
Belgian currency was weaker during the day in reaction to the breakdown of
talks on the government's social pact. It fell to BFr21.80 per D-Mark, but
closed steady at BFr21.68.
Economists said the impasse could store up trouble for the currency if it
appeared that strikes were looming.
The Canadian dollar fell half a cent against its US counterpart to CDollars
1.31 as the country went to the polls. Surveys have shown the Liberals
holding a strong lead over the governing Conservatives.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling dips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN that the govern-ment might be less willing than previously thought
to ease UK interest rates led to weakness in short sterling yesterday,
writes Peter John.
Recent hopes that a half or even a one percentage point cut might be made
before the November Budget were fuelled towards the end of last week by a
rash of interest rate cuts throughout continental Europe.
On Friday, the market ignored figures showing the UK recovery was still on
track and continued to take the line that further easing was needed to
revitalise the economy.
But speculation in the weekend press that the Treasury and Bank of England
felt there was no fundamental economic basis for a further reduction in
lending rates dulled the optimism.
'The market was over-bought,' said one trader. 'It got carried away in
sympathy with the Continental cutting.'
Yesterday, the short sterling futures contract for December slipped 11 basis
points to 94.60 as a more pragmatic reappraisal of the economy percolated
through the market.
German and French short-term interest rate futures were also weaker. The
German contract for December eased 6 basis points to 93.91 and the French
December was marginally lower on the day.
UK interbank operations proceeded smoothly in spite of expectations that a
large liquidity shortage might cause problems.
Money market dealers anticipate shortfalls of more than Pounds 5bn this week
as loans mature. That figure will be exacerbated by a record-sized Pounds
3.5bn gilts auction on Wednesday, half of which will have to be paid for
this week.
Yesterday's early forecast shortage of Pounds 1.2bn, later revised to Pounds
1.3bn, contained Pounds 1.83bn of bills for repurchase but was partly offset
by Exchequer transactions which injected Pounds 900m into the system and a
fall in note circulation which added Pounds 940m. The figure for note
circulation is generally high on Mondays as the high street banks adjust to
the high levels of cash they need to carry over weekends.
The bulk of the shortage was taken out during the early round when the Bank
provided Pounds 950m of bills at 5 29/32 per cent. This allowed the
remaining assistance to be taken up in smaller lots of Pounds 125m and
Pounds 225m both via band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent, bringing help
for the day to Pounds 1.3bn.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: E German energy investment
programme under gas cloud

THE FIRST phase of a massive investment programme in eastern Germany's brown
coal-based energy sector began yesterday amid growing concerns that more
cities in the region will switch to gas.
Vereinigte Energiewerke, or Veag, eastern Germany's major utility company,
started construction of a DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) power generating block at
Schwarze Pumpe in the eastern state of Brandenburg, which will be fuelled by
brown coal. The plant, which will have a capacity of 800MW, is part of a
long-term investment programme totalling DM46bn and spread over ten years.
The investment programme by Veag, which is due to be sold by the Treuhand
privatisation agency, to western Germany's eight utility companies, is aimed
at constructing, modernising and upgrading eastern Germany's electricity
sector which, when completed, will have a capacity of 12,400MW.
The implementation of this ambitious plan is part of the federal
government's commitment to save the brown coal industry, which before
unification employed over 120,000 people and accounted for 90 per cent of
eastern Germany's energy consumption.
Consumption of brown coal has since fallen below 50 per cent because of the
collapse of the region's manufacturing base, and the workforce has been
reduced to 35,000.
Both Veag and Laubag, eastern Germany's largest brown coal producer, which
is the main supplier to Veag, estimates that the region must consume 55m
tonnes of coal a year to secure the economic viability of both companies.
However, several cities, most notably Potsdam, the state capital of
Brandenburg, earlier this month voted to switch from brown coal to gas. Veag
officials yesterday said they were concerned that this would set a precedent
for other cities, including neighbouring Cottbus, and Gorlitz, in Saxony,
which are also considering a switch to gas.
Potsdam's decision means a loss of 1m tonnes of brown coal. If this trend
continues, Veag may decide not to build a new 800MW power plant at Boxberg,
in Saxony. This would rob Laubag of a further 10m tonnes. And unless there
was a sharp rise in the eastern German industrial sector the viability of
Veag and Laubag could be undermined.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil traders interviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday revealed that officers from the US
Department of Justice had been interviewing traders with London-based oil
companies, Reuter reports.
Market reports said several companies were being interviewed by US
investigators after some traders in August 1992 cut brokers' commissions.
An OFT official confirmed that it sat in as an observer at talks last week
in London between the Justice Department and some trading companies,
although no British investigation was under way. The office is the UK
authority to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour.
The official would not name the companies involved or what issues were
raised by the Justice Department.
Trade sources said that some companies last year informed oil brokers in
Britain, the US and Singapore that commission paid to them on account of
crude oil trading would be cut by 30 per cent.
Commissions were cut from 0.5 cents a barrel to 0.35 cents on trade in the
North Sea Brent forward or 15-day paper market. Brokers at the time said
they felt that they had no option than to agree to lower commission rates.
At least one brokerage company might be seeking financial compensation,
brokers said. One broker, who refused to be identified, said any
compensation could run to millions of dollars.
Crude oil prices fell yesterday, extending a sell-off that began late last
week against a background of concern about weak world demand.
December futures for the benchmark Brent Blend sank to Dollars 16.57 per
barrel during London's afternoon trading session, down from a close last
Friday of Dollars 16.85.
Prices, which fell 20 per cent earlier in the year, had until late last week
seemed more stable.
