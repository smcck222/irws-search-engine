FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin hopes boosted as China
comes into fold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA, THE world's biggest tin producer, is joining the Association of Tin
Producing Countries and analysts suggested yesterday that this should
improve the ATPC's chances of curbing supply and raising prices.
'This must be good for those who want tin prices to go up. China coming into
the fold will help the ATPC exert more restraint on supply,' said Mr Neil
Buxton, analyst at Metal Bulletin Research.
He suggested that China was mainly responsible for this year's rise in world
tin stocks to about 40,000 tonnes, 13 or 14 weeks supply. Available
statistics suggest that China lifted annual exports from about 10,000 tonnes
at the begining of the 1990s to between 30,000 and 35,000 tonnes - roughly
20 per cent of the 175,000 tonnes consumed each year in the western world.
Western tin producers had cut output much more than other base metals
companies, by about 30 per cent over the past two years, Mr Buxton pointed
out. 'These cuts were completely offset by exports from China and, to a
lesser extent, from other, smaller, far east Asian countries such as Vietnam
and Laos.'
Although China had informally agreed export restrictions with the ATPC, this
obviously had not worked well, Mr Buxton pointed out. China's full
membership of the ATPC would put more pressure on it to keep its promises.
The news about China from a two-day ATPC meeting this week in Kuala Lumpur
did not stop tin prices falling sharply again yesterday, a reaction to the
recent, equally sharp, rise. The spectre of increasing stocks drove down the
tin price to a 20-year low of Dollars 4,350 a tonne early in September but
it then bounced back to touch Dollars 5,053 last Thursday amid suggestions
that it was being manipulated upwards in the Kuala Lumpur market by
merchants and producers.
Tin for delivery in three months fell another Dollars 207.50 to close at
Dollars 4,797,50 last night. Ms Karen Norton, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven
Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said recent higher tin prices
were not fundamentally justified. 'And our technical analyst says tin was
overbought and due for a sharp (downward) correction.' Ms Norton believed
China's decision to join the ATPC was 'a positive move in the longer term'.
China set conditions before it agreed to join. It wanted to be exempted from
providing monthly tin market statistics on the grounds that there are no
sources from which it could obtain the data. It also insisted that its
membership payment be based on exports, not production as is the case for
other countries, as its domestic market consumed a great deal of its output.
Other members of the ATPC are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Thailand and Zaire. Brazil, the second-largest producer, has
indicated it may join next year.
The ATPC wanted 1993 exports restricted to 89,400 tonnes compared with
87,091 in 1992 in the belief that this would cut world stocks from about
39,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes by the end of this year. Failure to meet
these targets has split opinion within the ATPC about whether the so-called
supply rationalisation scheme should be continued and even whether the
organisation should be disbanded.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gives assurance on barley
subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS have assured Mr Don Russell, Australia's ambassador to the US,
that they will act consistently with President Bill Clinton's undertaking to
protect Australia from any negative effects of the Export Enhancement
Programme.
Last week, Australia protested that the US had allocated 100,000 tonnes of
subsidised malting barley to China under the EEP for 1993-94. China, which
was not previously included in EEP barley allocations, represents the most
important malting barley export market for Australian growers.
Mr Tony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, told Mr Russell
that the US recognised that China was a sensitive and major market for
Australian exports of malting barley. However, he also pointed to unfair EC
marketing in China, an Australian Embassy statement issued in Washington
said.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian miners have second
thoughts on land legislation
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN mining industry, which last week expressed qualified backing
for the federal government's 'Mabo' Aboriginal land rights legislation,
yesterday sounded a less optimistic note, saying that the package could
discourage investment and might fail to validate all previous land titles as
the commonwealth had promised.
Mr Geoff Ewing, the Australian Mining Industry Council's assistant director,
said yesterday it was 'not apparent from the details so far available that
all past titles will be fully secured, and therefore not affected by native
title as the prime minister stated'.
'The proposals for the approval of future grants still leave open the
possibility of both the commonwealth and states each being involved in the
process, and the time limits for completion of the process have been
significantly extended,' he added.
'It also appears at this stage that consideration of native title, which
could take as long as 20 months, will have to precede other approval
processes which themselves take a considerable time.'
The draft legislation has yet to be unveiled and all commentators are at
present basing opinions on the public statements made by Mr Paul Keating,
the prime minister, and other government officials. Last week, it appeared
that Mr Keating had scored a political triumph by hammering out a land
rights package that had at least qualified support from most interested
parties.
The need for legislation has been pressing in the wake of a high court
decision last year that did away with the notion that Australia was
uninhabited before European settlement. It said that native title claims
could succeed where there had been close and continuing association with the
land in question.

The GOLD price bounced back above the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce mark at the
London bullion market yesterday following the sharp fall at the end of last
week. As the price moved up Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 371.75 an ounce dealers
said most of the interest came from professionals who had been caught short
by the late bounce on Friday evening at the New York Commodity Exchange
(Comex). Some encouragement was also taken from the market holding above
Dollars 365 throughout last week. SILVER prices were only marginally higher
but PLATINUM gained Dollars 4.60 to Dollars 376.35 an ounce in light
trading. Buying of the white metal had been noted towards the close at the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange. 'The fundamentals haven't changed but the market
and the charts are both positive,' one London dealer commented. At the
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended in the middle of the day's
range after being trimmed back by technical selling in New York. COCOA
prices ended closer to the highs, but dealers said conditions were dull,
with total turnover amounting to only 2,117 lots (10 tonnes each).

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Chips are
down for UK potato monopoly - The marketing board's stay of execution could
yet turn into a permanent reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAD MR John Gummer still been Minister of Agriculture, you might, by now,
have read about the UK Potato Marketing Board in the obituary columns. Like
its milk marketing counterpart, the PMB enjoys monopoly status and this,
together with its statutory powers to control the area of potatoes planted,
fail to match the co-operative and competitive pattern for the marketing of
farm commodities set by the EC Commission in Brussels.
Brussels-based bureaucrats have been gunning for all such UK institutions
since Britain joined the community in 1973. Since then the marketing boards
for eggs, hops and wool have been wound up. Those for milk and potatoes were
bigger, stronger and had more staying power. But in recent years EC
administrators once again increased the pressure for something to be done
about them; and in Mr Gummer they found an ally.
He initiated winding up procedures for both the milk and potato boards. That
for milk has already gone beyond the point of no return and April 1 1994 is
the target date for completion of the process. But although it had long been
assumed that the PMB would follow the MMBs into oblivion, the appointment in
May of Mrs Gillian Shephard as minister of agriculture led to a stay of
execution.
As a farmer's daughter Mrs Shephard no doubt absorbed the stabilising
advantages of the PMB for both farmers and consumers during her Norfolk
childhood. Indeed one of her first actions when she arrived at the Ministry
of Agriculture was to announce a delay in the winding up of the potato board
and a review of the entire marketing scheme.
In essence she challenged all sectors of the potato industry - growers,
processors and retailers - to get together and come up with an acceptable
alternative scheme. By implication it would need to retain the important
feature of promoting price stability while at the same time satisfying the
demands of the EC and the UK government in their ambitions to expose the
potato industry to the rigours of the market place.
Last week the minister received the response of the potato industry. For the
first time ever growers, merchants, processors and retailers came up with a
joint agreed proposal. That in itself is remarkable because in the past they
have been poles apart. Growers, as represented by the NFU and the farmer
members of the PMB, have called for the continuation of statutory control
while the trade has consistently insisted on a totally free market.
This new plan, which the Mrs Shephard is now considering, contains several
key points. The first and most crucial is that statutory area control be
partially relaxed. It proposes that the national quota area of potatoes
should be set annually, as at present, by the joint consultative council, a
subcommittee of the PMB containing a majority of users and consumers. But
rather than setting a strictly controlled area for each farm, which must at
present be observed if a grower is to avoid a fine for over-planting or risk
losing some entitlement to grow potatoes if he under-plants, the plan
proposes 5 per cent flexibility either way.
The concept is based on experience in other potato growing countries where
there are no statutory area controls. A study of fluctuations in acreage
following profitable and unprofitable potato years in such countries has
revealed that there is seldom more than 10 per cent difference in the area
grown. It is therefore argued that 5 per cent either side of a target area
would allow the potato market to operate while at the same time avoiding
vast surpluses or shortages.
Meanwhile the machinery of quotas would be maintained in case, in a few
years' time, the EC were to decide that as for milk, sheep and sugar beet,
Community quotas for potatoes were also necessary.
Another fundamental aspect to the joint proposals is that producer funded
intervention in the potato market be discontinued. In the past the PMB has
had the right and the duty to buy surplus potatoes in years of oversupply
and sell them at a considerable loss for feeding to livestock.
The cash to fund this expensive operation has come, in recent years, from
grower levies of some Pounds 85 a hectare. In the distant past the
government also made a contribution. The new proposal suggests that, as with
area quotas, the intervention legislation remains in place but that for the
foreseeable future it is not used. This in turn would allow the area levy
paid by growers to be halved with most of the reduced revenue being used for
uncontroversial but important matters such as market promotion and technical
research. The new levy would correspond closely with similar schemes in
other EC countries and amount to about Pounds 1 for each tonne of potatoes
grown.
It is also proposed that the size of the board to run the new scheme should
be drastically reduced. At present the PMB consists of 22 members. A few
years ago there were 33. It is now proposed that the number be cut to a more
workable eight. Surprisingly perhaps, this may be more difficult for some
growers to swallow than the more fundamental proposals.
For many farmers are wedded to the illusion of regional representation, even
though the statutory duty of board members is to run the present marketing
scheme efficiently. Representation is, and always has been, the job of the
National Farmers' Union.
Even so the fact that the plan is agreed by all parties involved should give
it a head start. And the modest amount of production and price stability it
should provide may help to maintain UK potato consumption at the top of the
EC league.
Advocates of the present board's activities have always claimed that this
consumption record is directly related to the relatively stable prices paid
for potatoes by UK consumers for many years. It is argued that price
volatility cuts consumption, even in countries, like Holland, where potatoes
are an even more important crop.
The authors of the new plan are convinced that it will prove acceptable to
Brussels; that the administrators there will recognise that it would lead to
a less intrusive scheme than that currently operated by the PMB and that
they may even sanction the adoption of something similar in other EC
countries where volatility in potato markets is the rule rather than the
exception.
Given Mrs Shephard's recent pronouncements on the need to develop markets
and to make it more attractive for UK consumers to buy more UK produced
food, together with her encouragement for farmers to collaborate more with
processors and retailers, there would appear to be no logical reason for her
not to accept the proposals. It is rumoured that she will do just that very
soon.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European investors switch into shorter
maturities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last week's sweeping round of rate cuts, most European yield curves
continued to steepen yesterday as investors took profits at the long end and
shifted into shorter maturities.
US Treasuries' continued weakness added to the markets' soft tone and
compounded the pressure on longer-dated bonds.
GERMAN bonds were damped by somewhat disappointing regional September
inflation data. Consumer prices in Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.3 per cent on
the month and 4.1 per cent on the year, above market forecasts for 0.2 per
cent and 3.8 per cent. Numbers from North Rhine-Westphalia - at 0.2 per cent
and 3.7 per cent, respectively - were more in line with expectations.
'The numbers weren't really all that bad, but they provided a good enough
excuse for long-overdue profit-taking,' said a Frankfurt trader.
The December bund contract fell by 0.49 point to 90.97 and is expected to
test key support levels at 90.90 today.
The German railways issued DM2.35bn 10-year 6 1/8 per cent bonds at an
average 6.05 per cent yield. A second portion of the bonds will be sold
today via a US-style auction.
FRENCH government bonds followed bunds lower. The notional bond contract
fell 0.26 point on the day to 124.66 and slipped another 0.12 point in
after-hours trading.
UK gilts eased across the curve, with the short end damped by receding hopes
for a rate-cut before the November 30 Budget and longer maturities pressured
by profit-taking.
Medium maturities were restrained ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds
3.5bn of 6 per cent gilts. Retail activity has been scant in recent days and
this had some traders worrying that the bid-to-cover ratio might be
disappointing. But according to one gilts salesman, 'the issue has cheapened
up quite nicely and that should attract some good demand'.
AFTER being Europe's top performers in recent weeks, the high-yielding
markets posted the sharpest losses on heavy profit-taking.
The Italian BTP futures contract dropped 1.10 point to 117.35 and is
expected to test key support at 117 today, with the next target seen at
116.50.
The Spanish bond contract on Madrid's futures exchange fell 0.49 point to
103.52. Market sentiment was subdued by warnings from the International
Monetary Fund that Spain should be cautious on further rate cuts until price
stability and structural economic reforms had been achieved.
BELGIAN bonds held up relatively well despite the breakdown on Sunday of the
social pact talks between the country's unions, employers and the
government.
While the Belgian franc weakened against the D-Mark, Belgian bonds' yield
premium over bunds widened by only one basis point from Friday to 121 basis
points.
THE sell-off in the US Treasury market continued yesterday as long-term bond
yields rose back above 6 per cent in the wake of economically bullish
comments from senior government officials.
In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down
17/32 at 103 7/32 , yielding 6.011 per cent. At the short end of the market,
the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 29/32 , to yield 3.908 per cent.
After last week's declines, investor sentiment was shaky when trading
opened. It was no surprise, therefore, when prices nosedived mid-morning
after Mr Robert Reich, the Labor secretary, made bullish comments about the
economy, predicting fourth-quarter growth of more than 3 per cent.
Prices were also pressured lower by a relatively robust September home sales
report, by rumours of heavy selling by a large hedge fund, and by a
stronger-than-expected mid-October car and truck sales report.
CANADIAN government bonds fell more than  1/2 point in early trading,
dragged lower by the sell-off in US Treasuries.
While market sentiment was nervous ahead of last night's elections, most
traders were discounting a majority win by the Liberal party, which was
widely seen to be positive for the market.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian offerings find firm
demand from overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG response from international investors to recent offerings which
provide exposure to India gives some indication of the volume of foreign
money which is waiting to flow into the country.
India is widely regarded as the emerging market of the 1990s, following the
introduction of free market reforms.
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets said yesterday that its new India fund
had attracted around Dollars 150m, well above its expectations of Dollars
50m-Dollars 100m.
There were also reports yesterday that the Dollars 125m six-year
Euroconvertible bond issue from Reliance Industries, India's largest
private-sector company, had been oversubscribed by 10 times. The issue is
expected to be priced today.
When Reliance's issue was launched last Thursday, lead manager Morgan
Stanley said that the issue was already several times oversubscribed.
However, Morgan Stanley declined to comment on yesterday's reports.
Mr Sanjit Talukdar, the fund manager of F&amp;C's Indian Investment Company
Sicav (Indico), said that the sum raised was equivalent to one day's trading
volume in the Indian stock market.
Half of the money came from UK institutions, followed by Asia which
accounted for 40 per cent. The remainder was divided equally between the
United States and continental Europe.
Indico is an open-ended fund which aims to invest mainly in medium-sized
Indian companies. Mr Talukdar said that initially only 20 per cent of Indico
would be invested in medium-sized companies because of the lack of liquidity
in these stocks.
The remaining 80 per cent would be invested in blue-chip Indian companies.
However, more than 50 per cent of the fund would be invested in medium-sized
companies by the end of the first year, he said.
Indico, which will be listed in Luxembourg, is due to start trading later
this week once it has received the final approval from the Indian
regulators.
The strength of international demand for Indian investments has prompted
several Indian companies to tap the international capital markets this year.
They include SCICI, a financial institution; ITC, a tobacco and hotels
company; and Hindalco, an aluminium company.
Bombay Dyeing, a textiles manufacturer, is expected to launch an issue of
global depositary receipts with warrants later this week. Lead manager CSFB
declined to comment on the size of the issue but there were reports that the
issue would only raise between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Dealers anticipate issues from Swedish
borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO large international bond issues from Swedish borrowers are likely to
emerge today when the Kingdom of Sweden raises at least Dollars 1bn through
an issue of three-year global floating rate notes (FRNs) and Urban Mortgage
Bank of Sweden (UMB) raises Dollars 500m through an offering of five-year
Eurobonds.
Sweden's FRNs, via Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan, are expected to be priced
at a small discount to par and carry a coupon of three-month Libor minus
1/8 point.
UMB's Eurobonds, via Nomura, are likely to be priced to yield 68 basis
points over the when issued US treasury due 1998.
Some syndicate managers said the two issues effectively offered investors a
broad yield spectrum on Swedish government debt, since UMB is backed by
SKr27bn guarantee fund from the government.
Among yesterday's issues, the European Investment Bank tapped investor
demand for short-dated Eurolira paper with its L500bn issue of three-year
Eurobonds. Joint lead manager IMI said that investors were reducing their
exposure to the long end of the yield curve and were re-investing their
profits in the shorter end.
The EIB kept the proceeds of the issue in fixed-rate lira but hedged itself
against any fall in Italian interest rates over the next four months by
entering a 'spread-lock' or a 'delayed rate settlement' agreement with IMI.
IMI said the agreement offered mutual compensation to both parties because
it also protected IMI against a rise in rates during the four-month period.
EIB's bonds had a re-offer price of 99.88 to yield 52 basis points below the
9 per cent Italian government bond due 1996. When the bonds were freed to
trade they were quoted at 99.75 in line with underlying weakness in European
bond markets.
Elsewhere, the development of an international fixed-income market for Hong
Kong borrowers took another step yesterday with the launch of a five-year
Eurobond issue from Sun Hung Kai Properties.
Sung Hung Kai Properties is the holding company for the largest property
investment and development operations in Hong Kong. It is the fifth-largest
company on the Hong Kong stock exchange by market capitalisation.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said Sun Hung Kai was able to raise Dollars
300m, Dollars 50m more than it had originally planned, due to
greater-than-expected demand.
The bonds were priced to yield 82 basis points over the when issued US
Treasury due 1998, which was one basis point below the yield spread at
launch on the Dollars 500m five-year issue from Cheung Kong in early
September. Cheung Kong's bonds, which opened up the Eurobond market to Hong
Kong borrowers, were trading at a spread of 85 basis points yesterday.

INTERNATIONAL Bank of Asia (IBA), the Hong Kong retail bank which is part of
the Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), is to be spun off via a
HKDollars 598m public offer in Hong Kong.
ABC has recently sold 20 per cent of IBA to the state-owned China Everbright
for about HKDollars 440m.
After the Hong Kong public offer, ABC will own 55 per cent of the bank, one
of the largest in Hong Kong with 20 branches.
Net earnings over the past five years have risen at a compound rate of 35
per cent. Net profit this year is forecast to increase by 16 per cent to
HKDollars 166m.
The company is offering 159m new shares at HKDollars 3.76 a share. Proceeds
will help fund expansion of the group's retail operations in Hong Kong.
The link-up with China Everbright is expected to expand IBA's presence in
China.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Builders make the most of the
good times - Indonesia offers rich pickings for property companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN West Jakarta, a newly-constructed, garish pink shopping and hotel complex
rises from the ground like a giant wedding cake. Designed to be visible from
the passing toll-road, it is the showcase project of Ciputra Development, a
leading Indonesian property company.
Indonesia, with a population of 190m, is the largest country among the
fast-growing economies of south-east Asia. In common with its neighbours,
two decades of economic success have resulted in a growing middle class and
a demand for modern retail outlets, offices and housing - and Indonesia's
property companies are making the most of the good times.
Ciputra Development has announced plans to go public by the end of the year,
raising Dollars 120m and valuing the company at about Dollars 500m. Brokers
expect the issue to proceed smoothly; the Jakarta stock market has risen
more than 60 per cent since December, and property companies have matched
the index.
The six leading quoted property companies have a combined capitalisation of
over Rp3,600bn (Dollars 1.7bn), though much of that is rooted in faith.
Companies are rated on future potential, not on the bricks and mortar in
place.
Modernland Realty, which went public in January and has a current market
capitalisation of Rp654bn, has two residential sites totalling 820 hectares
in the Jakarta area. At its more up-market Tangerang estate just outside
Jakarta, on which development began four years ago, an 18-hole golf course
is being constructed to attract potential residents.
The first nine holes will not be ready until December but lots beside the
course have been selling for Rp1.6bn each, excluding the cost of the house.
With most of the land still in the form of paddy-fields, the estate is
unlikely to be completed until 2004.
Jakarta International Hotel and Development has a similar story in the
office sector. Its sole current operation is the Borobodur Hotel in Jakarta
and the company's Rp1,600bn market capitalisation is due largely to its
undeveloped 41 hectare site in the city's business district. By 1995, this
site will be home to the stock exchange and plots have been sold to a
state-pension fund and an army-controlled bank. But plans for the 36
remaining hectares are incomplete and development is forecast to take 15
years.
Ciputra Development is little different. Its 455 hectare Citra Garden
housing project is less than half complete, while its 500 hectare estate in
Tangerang and 1,000 hectare housing project in Surabaya, East Java, are
still in initial stages.
While the number of rival housing projects grows almost monthly, Mr Hugh
Obbard, managing director of property consultants First Pacific Davies
Indonesia, believes 'the demand for low to middle-cost housing is
outstripping supply.
The main surprise in the market has been the upper-income housing bracket
continuing to perform so well'. The steady lowering of interest rates this
year bodes well, he says.
Ciputra Development claims two competitive advantages: the geographical
spread of its 8.8m sq metre landbank around Java island, home to 60 per cent
of Indonesia's population, and the reputation of Mr Ciputra, the company's
founder and chairman.
While most companies' landbanks are concentrated in Jakarta, Ciputra
Development has highlighted other densely-populated urban centres: Surabaya,
with a 2.6m population, and Semarang, Central Java's capital with a 1.3m
population, where the company is building a 20,500 sq metre shopping and
hotel complex.
Mr Ciputra has more than 30 years' experience in property and Ciputra
Development enjoys a 14 per cent share of Jakarta's housing market. Two
other private companies in which Mr Ciputra is a large shareholder - Jaya
Group and Metropolitan Group - hold a further 41 per cent share.
Mr Harun Hajadi, director of Ciputra Development, says the three companies
reduce costs through joint marketing activities, but adds that Mr Ciputra
avoids favouring one company to the detriment of the others.
Brokers say Mr Ciputra is politically well-connected and packs a punch in
Indonesia's golfing world - important for networking government officials.
The company forecasts a gross profit of Rp88bn on revenue of Rp242bn this
year, rising to a profit of Rp161bn on revenue of Rp503bn in 1994. Brokers
expect it to be a blue-chip property stock, but reserve their final
endorsement until the issue is priced. The company is unlikely to be offered
at a steep discount. Brokers say the anticipated price of Rp5,000 a share
would value the company at about 18 times projected 1994 earnings.

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the Australian brewer which owns Courage in the UK,
yesterday announced that it had accepted an offer from Hudson Conway (HCL),
a Victoria-based property group in which Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated
Press has an interest, to buy back and cancel shares owned by Foster's in
HCL.
The offer is pitched at ADollars 3.50 a share. Foster's owns around 12.8m
shares in Hudson Conway, which would net it approximately ADollars 45m
(USDollars 30m).
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Hudson Conway - which is
part of the consortium that recently won the right to build Melbourne's
first casino - said the proposal was subject to shareholder approval at its
annual meeting, scheduled for November, and confirmation by the Supreme
Court of Victoria.
CRA, the Australian mining house which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ
Corporation, yesterday announced a series of top-level management changes,
intended to ensure a smooth succession as members of current management
retire.
The mining company said that Mr Leon Davis would succeed Mr John Ralph as
chief executive of the company, when Mr Ralph retires next year. Mr Davis
has been with CRA for 37 years and was seconded to RTZ, as mining director,
in 1991.
He will return to Melbourne in May, and fill the post of managing director
and chief executive designate until Mr Ralph, CRA's long-standing chief
executive retires later in 1994.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: SIA profits fall 15% at halfway
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable
carriers, blamed recession in many markets, intense competition and the
strength of the Singapore dollar for a 15 per cent drop in pre-tax profits
for the six months ending September 30.
SIA had pre-tax profits of SDollars 423.5m (USDollars 269m) in the six
months, compared with pre-tax profits of SDollars 498m in the same period
last year.
While SIA reported that turnover had increased by 10.3 per cent to SDollars
3.04bn, it said that intense competition had cut yields and lowered revenue
by SDollars 187m.
The airline said revenues were cut by a further SDollars 48m due to the
strength of the Singapore dollar.
Mr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said the airline was working
in a very difficult business environment. 'SIA's first-half profit was lower
than a year ago but considering the performance of the competition, we did
not do too badly,' said Mr Cheong.
Cathay Pacific, one of SIA's main competitors in the Far East, recently
reported a 46 per cent fall in interim earnings.
'Although the industry continues to be plagued by low yields, traffic has
picked up over the past few months and load factors are higher than the same
period last year,' said Mr Cheong. 'It is tempting to conclude that the
worst is over but it is too soon to tell.'
SIA's interim results were below market expectations. SIA is committed to
maintaining a young fleet of aircraft but in recent years it has faced
increasing difficulty off-loading older aircraft in what has been a poor
second-hand market. SIA consolidates the revenues from aircraft sales into
its operating profits.
However, SIA is still cash rich - net cash reserves declined slightly over
the six-month period to SDollars 1.27bn.
Earnings per share over the six-month period were 30.5 Singapore cents,
compared with 34.8 cents in the same period last year.
The dividend was unchanged at 7.5 cents.

PEPKOR, South Africa's largest mass-market retail group, increased
attributable profit in the six months to August by 8 per cent to R48.7m
(Dollars 14.5m), from R45m last time.
The markets in which Pepkor operates continue to be depressed with consumer
confidence low, disposable income down and unemployment, especially in the
market segments served by Pepkor, rising. Turnover, as a result, rose by
only 2 per cent - well below inflation - to R3.8bn. Margins, however, were
maintained and operating profit was also 2 per cent higher at R98.9m.
Earnings per share rose by 5 per cent to 29 cents from 27.7 cents and the
dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 8.5 cents per share. Mr Christo
Wiese, chairman, said that barring political setbacks, he expected Pepkor to
continue the earnings growth of the first six months for the remainder of
the year.
A divisional breakdown of earnings shows that Pep, the clothing retailer
that is the core of the group, suffered a 5 per cent fall in earnings. Pep's
chain of Scottish stores, known as Your More Store, is expected to break
even in the second half of the year. Shoprite/Checkers, the food arm,
continued rationalisation and expansion, with earnings rising by 7.7 per
cent. Cashbuild increased earnings by 48 per cent and they rose by 19 per
cent at Smart Centre.
Mr Wiese said Pepkor was in a consolidation phase following some large
takeovers in recent years.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX of Japan's 10 second-tier stockbrokers remained in the red in the first
six months of the current fiscal year.
Daily average trading value for the six months to September rose 58 per cent
on the Tokyo stock exchange to Y408bn (Dollars 3.77bn). However, trading has
been dominated by institutional investor,s and some smaller brokers which
rely heavily on retail commissions did not benefit from the increase in
trading activity.
Cost-cutting and a rise in brokerage commissions and bond trading profits
helped New Japan Securities, Kokusai Securities, Wako Securities, and Tokyo
Securities return to the black. Kokusai posted the largest pre-tax profit of
Y4.7bn, against a pre-tax loss of Y7.2bn the previous year.
Pre-tax losses at the remaining six ranged from Y894m at Yamatane Securities
to Y5.3bn at Kankaku Securities.
On an after-tax basis, Cosmo Securities posted the largest loss of Y72bn as
it wrote off losses stemming from its 'tobashi' deals, or manipulating
investors' lossmaking accounts.
Sanyo saw a pre-tax loss of Y5bn, while Okasan posted a pre-tax loss of
Y1.4bn.
Yamatane posted a loss of Y269m.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: First-quarter loss at MIM
Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing slump in base metals prices has pushed Brisbane-based MIM
Holdings to a first-quarter after-tax loss of ADollars 30.4m (USDollars
20.3m) in the 12 weeks to September 19, compared with a profit of ADollars
29m a year ago, writes Nikki Tait.
At the operating level, the international metals group saw an after-tax
deficit of ADollars 6.9m, down from last time's profit of ADollars 34.5m.
The final result was further depressed by ADollars 17.8m due to a write-off
of cash contributed by MIM to its joint-venture smelting operations in
Germany.
The company said that sales volumes rose in some areas - 18 per cent higher
for lead, 28 per cent for zinc, and 41 per cent for coal - although copper
was down 10 per cent and gold by 24 per cent.
But base metals prices fell in Australian dollar terms, with zinc - down 38
per cent - showing the largest year-on-year decline.
Gold and silver prices were stronger, but total sales revenue for the
quarter still slipped by 9 per cent.

TWO leading Japanese paper companies which merged this month reported
declines in sales and profits as demand for paper was hit by the prolonged
economic downturn, writes Emiko Terazono.
Kanzaki Paper and Oji Paper, which formed New Oji Paper on October 1, said
their earnings were hit by a fall in paper prices due to over-supply.
Oji's non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September fell
7.5 per cent to Y5bn (Dollars 46m) on a 4.9 per cent fall in sales to
Y216bn. After-tax profits dropped 17.4 per cent to Y3.2bn. Sales of paper
and pulp products fell 4.5 per cent to Y201bn, while processed paper
products and lumber fell 5.2 per cent to Y215bn.
Kanzaki posted a 24 per cent fall in half-year pre-tax profits to Y788m,
while sales fell 9.6 per cent to Y64.2bn. After-tax profits rose 27.7 per
cent to Y641m. Sales of its mainstay paper and pulp products fell 9.3 per
cent to Y63.7bn.
For the full year to March, New Oji expects pre-tax profits of Y11bn on
sales of Y496bn and an after-tax profit of Y6.7bn.

third term

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN forest products companies improved their results sharply in the
third quarter, due to good building materials markets and a lower Canadian
dollar. However, their performance for all 1993 will be volatile.
The industry has been fighting recession and weak prices since 1989, its
last good year. Building materials were the first to rally early this year,
with rising US housing stocks helping integrated companies and specialised
Western timber producers. After a summer slowdown, construction timber
prices are rising again as inventories are rebuilt.
Noranda Forest posted third-quarter profits of CDollars 6m, or 2 cents a
share, against a loss of CDollars 17m, or 16 cents, last time.
For the nine months it had a loss of CDollars 42m, or 38 cents, after a net
charge of CDollars 58m on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan
Bloedel.
This compared with a loss of CDollars 62m, or 55 cents, on revenues of
CDollars 1.13bn (excluding MacMillan), against CDollars 3.3bn.
MacMillan Bloedel, the most diversified group, lost CDollars 20.7m, or 19
cents, in the third quarter, against a loss of CDollars 14.2m, or 15 cents.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 48.1m or 39 cents, compared with a loss of
CDollars 32.3m, or 35 cents a share.
Abitibi-Price reduced its third-quarter loss to CDollars 25.3m, or 36 cents
a share, from Dollars 73.3m, or Dollars 1.06, a year earlier on sales of
Dollars 485m, up 10 per cent. The nine-month loss was Dollars 72.3m, or
Dollars 1.05 a share, against Dollars 148.7m, or Dollars 2.16. Revenues were
Dollars 1.45bn, against Dollars 1.23bn.
Donohue, an eastern Canada newsprint producer, earned CDollars 1.3m, or 3
cents, in the third quarter, against a loss of CDollars 5.9m, or 18 cents.
Nine-months profit was CDollars 9.7m, or 26 cents, compared with a loss of
CDollars 17.1m, or 57 cents.
Doman Industries, the timber and pulp group, earned CDollars 11.2m, or 30
cents, in the third quarter, against CDollars 132,000, or 9 cents.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 38.7m, or CDollars 1.14, against CDollars
21.4m, or 70 cents.

THE takeover battle for control of Associated Dairies, the Victorian dairy

Australian Co-Operative Foods and QUF Industries - raising their offers,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Sydney-based ACF moved first, increasing its offer to ADollars 3.25 a share
from ADollars 2.85 previously.
This exceeded the ADollars 2.97 a share on offer by QUF. However, within
hours, the Queensland-based company had announced it would pay Dollars 3.35
a share, or ADollars 81.3m (USDollars 54.6m) for Associated Dairies.

Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom (DT), is generally
unflappable. But he talks in almost apocalyptic terms about the
privatisation of Germany's state-owned telecommunications company. 'It is
five to midnight,' he says.
His fear is that the interminable political debate on privatisation could
delay the process until well beyond next year's 19 federal and state
elections.
That, he says, would severely hamper DT in its attempt to become a first
division competitor in and beyond Europe's liberalising telecoms markets.
Even in its home market, DT faces unprecedented competition. The company
will lose its monopoly on ordinary telephone services in January 1998, when
the European Community opens up national telecommunications markets to
competition.
It already faces competition in the high-growth satellite and mobile
markets.
Two years ago, Mannesmann, the industrial group, was granted a licence to
operate a second national cellular phone network in competition with DT's.
It now has a 50 per cent market share.
The Brussels deadline gives DT five years to become competitive, but Mr
Ricke is anxious to get the privatisation trauma over long before then. So
is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, which has been pressing for a sale
for the past two years. However, privatisation requires a constitutional
amendment; and to achieve the required two-thirds majority, the support of
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) is needed.
Most SPD leaders are not opposed to privatisation in principle. They
appreciate the 1998 deadline, and the need for DT to be able to raise funds
on the stock market in order to continue its large investment in eastern
Germany. However, the SPD wants to retain significant state controls over a
privatised DT.
As a compromise, the government has agreed to create a holding company in
which it will keep a majority stake until full EC liberalisation. But before
even partial privatisation can proceed, government and opposition have large
differences to settle over how much managerial influence the holding company
will be granted.
The government has drafted a 1,000-page privatisation bill, which is the
subject of negotiations between the government and SPD.
The bill is reported to give only a minor role to the holding company.
Ministers argue that in order to achieve the objectives of privatisation, DT
must have sufficient managerial freedom to make it attractive to investors.
Much depends on the line taken by hard-liners in the SPD leadership.
Mr Ricke hopes that, once the privatisation bill is adopted, the company
will be able to sell a first tranche of shares worth between DM10bn and
DM15bn (Dollars 6.25bn-Dollars 9.37bn) on the stock market in 1996.
He says that delay will have 'fatal consequences', for three reasons.
The company needs to raise cash to reduce its DM100bn debt and continue its
DM60bn investment programme in eastern Germany.
A privatised DT will be freer to forge international alliances, now de
rigueur in the industry.
DT needs privatisation to push through cost-cutting measures.
Mr Ricke stresses that liberalisation will progressively undermine DT's
revenue. He estimates that German tariffs for domestic and international
calls, which are among the highest in Europe, must fall by 20 per cent by
1998 if DT is to be competitive.
The company is losing DM2bn a year on local calls, which are subsidised by
international traffic.
With just a 5 per cent drop in overall phone bills, the company stands to
loose in 1995 DM2bn-DM3bn in revenues, Mr Ricke claims.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post and telecoms minister, has pledged to reinvest
all the privatisation proceeds in Deutsche Telekom.
As well as lifting investment in the eastern states, this will allow the
company to reduce its debt - which cost DM8bn to service last year, and is
expected to rise to DM140bn in 1995.
Privatisation will allow DT to reinvest more of its own profits, which are
depleted because of a legal obligation to cover the deficits of the post and
postal bank.
The company last year had to transfer DM5bn to the federal government and
DM1.5bn to the two sister companies out of its DM6.5bn net profits.
DT urgently needs to cut costs. Above all, that means greater productivity
from its 230,000 strong workforce. But that will not be easy. More than half
of DT's employees are civil servants who enjoy benefits such as life
employment and special pension funds.
The privileged status of German civil servants is written in the
constitution and cannot be modified against their will. Mr Ricke hopes that
after privatisation, financial incentives will motivate many of them to
retire early or become regular employees. But such plans are regarded with
suspicion by the 550,000-strong Post Trade Union, which has strong links
with the SPD.
The union and SPD accept DT will have to stop subsidising the post and
postal bank and become an independent shareholders' entity. But they still
have two demands.
They want the constitution to specify the duty of a private DT to service
all parts of Germany, regardless of the population density. The post
ministry maintains this is a regulatory matter, not a constitutional one.
The union wants to retain some influence over DT's management. It wants
voting rights on important issues such as wage settlements and redundancies,
and is particularly afraid of Mr Ricke's desire to slash 30,000 jobs by
2000.
DT contends any such restraint will simply slow down the pace of change, to
the detriment of all DT employees.
DT managers want the freedom to take risks in the global market.
A DT-led consortium is the front runner to become strategic partner in the
privatisation of Matav, the Hungary state telecoms operator. But in general,
argues Mr Klaus Grewlich, DT's director for international affairs, foreign
partners are looking for a private company free from state interference.
Government and opposition risk clashing on such issues throughout the autumn
as they finalise the privatisation bill.
If no compromise is reached soon, it is highly unlikely the current 1996
privatisation date can be kept.
This is the second in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state
telecommunications operators. The first appeared on October 11; the third
appears on Thursday.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sale of unit lifts Inco to
Dollars 91.2m in third quarter

THE sale of a gold-mining subsidiary enabled Inco, the world's biggest
nickel producer, to post a strong third-quarter profit in the face of a 25
per cent fall in nickel prices.
Third-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 91.2m, or 83 cents a share, from
Dollars 10.6m, or nine cents, a year earlier. The increase was entirely due,
however, to an after-tax gain of Dollars 127.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a share,
from Inco's disposal of its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold.
The weaker nickel price, as well as lower prices for copper, cobalt and
rhodium, resulted in a sharp reversal in operating performance, from
earnings of Dollars 70m to a Dollars 13m loss.
Net sales slumped to Dollars 468m from Dollars 608m, in spite of virtually
unchanged metal deliveries.
Nickel shipments totalled 111m lbs, compared with 112m lbs a year ago, but
the average price received fell to Dollars 2.60 a lb from Dollars 3.47. One
silver lining was a turnround in the troubled alloys and engineered products
division, from a Dollars 7m operating loss to earnings of Dollars 2m. Inco
said that lower prices were offset by reduced costs.
Finished nickel inventories fell to 49m lbs on September 30 from 71m lbs a
year earlier as a result of holiday shutdowns.
Inco earlier this month announced a 16 per cent reduction in planned 1994
nickel output, with the bulk of the cutbacks taking place in the first
quarter.
The company said yesterday that it 'will continue to monitor market
conditions to determine whether additional measures will be required'.
Proceeds from the TVX sale reduced the debt-to-equity ratio to 37:63, the
lowest level in three years.
Long-term debt has been cut to Dollars 925m from Dollars 1.08bn.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Losses at Asarco after metal
prices fall

PLUMMETING copper, lead, and zinc prices contributed to a third-quarter loss
at Asarco, the integrated US mining company.
It suffered a net loss of Dollars 3m, or 8 cents a share, compared with
profits of Dollars 18.1m, or 44 cents, in the third quarter of 1992. Sales
were Dollars 425.2m, down from Dollars 490m a year ago.
For the first nine months, Asarco posted a loss of Dollars 58m, or Dollars
1.40 a share, against a gain of Dollars 28.8m, or 69 cents, before
extraordinary charges. Year-to-date sales are Dollars 1.3bn, down from
Dollars 1.4bn in the first nine months of 1992.
Asarco said its average realised price for copper dropped to 86 cents a lb
in the third quarter, down from Dollars 1.13 a year earlier. Zinc prices
were down 20 cents a lb, to 41 cents, and lead prices down 12 cents, to 19
cents a lb this quarter.
The company's average realised price for gold and silver gained, but volumes
were not sufficient to offset price declines in copper.
Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said the decline in metals prices reduced net
earnings for the quarter by Dollars 33.8m from levels a year ago.
Asarco realised an after-tax gain of Dollars 5.4m from the sale during the
quarter of 9.9 per cent of Asarco Australia.
AMAX, the diversified US aluminium and coal company, reported third-quarter
net losses of Dollars 60.7m, or 77 cents a share, from last year's loss of
Dollars 24.6m, or 29 cents.
The company had an operating loss of Dollars 15m in the third quarter,
against an operating profit of Dollars 14.4m in the same quarter a year ago.
Sales for the quarter fell to Dollars 893.3m, from Dollars 959m last year.
Amax, which is in merger negotiations with another large metals and mining
group, Denver-based Cyprus Minerals, said depressed worldwide aluminium
prices would keep the pre-merger results under pressure into 1994.
Amax and Cyprus shareholders will vote on the merger plan on November 12.
Under the plan Amax will spin off its aluminium operation, Alumax, as an
independent, publicly-held company.
Analysts say the global aluminium glut will make the spin-off difficult, but
Mr Allen Born, Amax chairman, said the subsidiary was already adopting price
protection programmes to stabilise revenue, and was considering diversifying
into higher-value aluminium product manufacturing.
For the first nine months Amax reported a loss of Dollars 170.6m, or Dollars
2.18, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 133.3m, or
Dollars 1.53, on sales of Dollars 2.8bn in the same 1992 period.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: GM takes Dollars 950m charge to
cover closure scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that it would take a Dollars 950m pre-tax
charge against third-quarter earnings to cover additional costs from its
programme to close 21 redundant manufacturing plants in North America.
The news came just 24 hours after GM reached a new three-year labour
agreement with the United Auto Workers union which will sharply push up the
company's pension costs, while allowing it more freedom to relocate laid-off
workers to new plants.
News of the charge came after the close of the New York Stock Exchange,
where the company's shares had fallen Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/2
yesterday in reaction to the labour deal, which fell short of GM's aims and
Wall Street's hopes.
The company, which is to report third-quarter figures on Thursday, said the
charge resulted mainly from greater productivity gains than had been
expected when it first made a provision for the plant closing programme.
This meant fewer jobs would be available within the group for workers from
plants that GM was closing, which in turn would push up its job security
costs. Under a long-standing job security programme, GM continues paying its
workers even after they have been laid off.
However, the company said even with the charge it believed it could attain
its 1993 financial goal for its North American automotive operations - to
break even before interest, taxes and non-cash healthcare expenses.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, said earlier in the day it
had revised its rating outlook for GM to negative from stable because of the
new labour pact.
It said the reported provisions of the agreement would not bolster the
company's cost-cutting efforts in North America as had been anticipated
before.
GM's market share performance had been disappointing in recent quarters, S&amp;P
said .
These factors heightened uncertainty about the company's ability to achieve
meaningful profits in North America, it added.

THE turnround at American Express engineered by Mr Harvey Golub, chairman,
continued in the third quarter as the financial services group's core
travel-related services business maintained the earnings momentum of the
previous three months.
The group showed further benefits from the rise on Wall Street. Its Lehman
Brothers investment banking unit recorded a rise in net income, to Dollars
114m from Dollars 95m the previous quarter, driven by a jump of 77 per cent
in its income from making markets and other principal transactions.
Net income at American Express for the three months to the end of September
reached Dollars 430m, or 83 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars
204.7m (after a one-off restructuring charge of Dollars 492m) a year ago.
The figures were lifted by a net benefit of Dollars 23m from the rise in the
US corporation tax rate, which led to a one-off adjustment to deferred
taxes. It said this benefit was offset by costs from the early repayment of
some debt.
Net income in travel-related services rose to Dollars 236m, from Dollars
234m the previous quarter and a loss of Dollars 187m the year before. Gross
revenues fell 2 per cent over the year to Dollars 2.16bn, due to a fall in
the discounts charged to merchants for accepting American Express cards and
a decline in card fees.
However, provisions for credit losses fell by nearly 30 per cent, to Dollars
375m. The number of cards in force continued to fall, to 34.2m from 35.1m a
year before, though the amount of business billed to cardholders during the
period, at Dollars 30.8bn, was up 4 per cent.
Gross revenues (net of interest costs) at Lehman Brothers rose by a third,
to Dollars 885m, as income from principal trading jumped sharply to Dollars
421m. Investment banking revenues advanced by 34 per cent, to Dollars 186m,
while commissions grew by a fifth to Dollars 126m.
Other businesses continued to show improvements in operating performance.
Net income at IDS, the investment management and advisory arm, rose to
Dollars 96m from Dollars 80m on higher fee income, while after-tax profits
at American Express Bank climbed to Dollars 27m from a loss of Dollars 30m
the year before.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting boosts profits at
Exxon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXXON comfortably exceeded market expectations yesterday with third-quarter
profits which were bolstered by recent cost-cutting and disposals of assets.
The US energy group's 19 per cent rise in net income for the period,
compared with the previous year, came against a backdrop of lower oil prices
which has held back earnings at other oil companies.
'These strong earnings were generated despite soft worldwide economic
conditions, weak crude oil prices, and provisions associated with the tax
rate increase in the US,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman.
Net income for the period rose to Dollars 1.36bn, or Dollars 1.09 a share,
from Dollars 1.15bn, or 91 cents, on sales down to Dollars 27.9bn from
Dollars 30.6bn.
On Wall street, Exxon's shares rose Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 65 1/2 .
While exploration and production profits in the US remained flat, at Dollars
273m, overseas earnings in this area jumped to Dollars 549m from Dollars
468m.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco) said net income in the third quarter fell to
Dollars 68m from Dollars 332m in the previous year due to the increase in
the US corporate tax rate and the cost of settling a legal action.
The results were held back by an after-tax charge of Dollars 115m resulting
from the effect of the tax rate rise on deferred taxes.
The company recorded after-tax charges of Dollars 50m against the costs of
litigation.
These mostly related to the decision by the US Court of Appeals to confirm a
judgment against the company in a class action suit over breaches of energy
pricing regulations between 1973-1981.

The US energy group's 19 per cent rise in net income for the period,
compared with the previous year, came against a backdrop of lower oil prices
which has held back earnings at other oil companies.
'These strong earnings were generated despite soft worldwide economic
conditions, weak crude oil prices, and provisions associated with the tax
rate increase in the US,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman.
Net income for the period rose to Dollars 1.36bn, or Dollars 1.09 a share,
from Dollars 1.15bn, or 91 cents, on sales down to Dollars 27.9bn from
Dollars 30.6bn.
On Wall street, Exxon's shares rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , by
early afternoon.
While exploration and production profits in the US remained flat, at Dollars
273m, overseas earnings in this area jumped to Dollars 549m from Dollars
468m.
US downstream operations, on the other hand, recorded an increase to Dollars
121m from Dollars 31m, while overseas earnings rose only slightly to Dollars
474m.
Falling oil prices, while holding back upstream earnings in the US, had been
more than offset by the improvement in margins in petroleum products that
resulted from cheaper oil, Mr Raymond said.
Exxon said the results benefited from lower operating costs, the effects of
its asset management programme, under which it sold assets which were
marginal or did not fit its long-term plans, and lower tax rates in some
overseas countries.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco) said net income in the third quarter fell to
Dollars 68m from Dollars 332m in the previous year due to the increase in
the US corporate tax rate and the cost of settling a legal action.
The results were held back by an after-tax charge of Dollars 115m resulting
from the effect of the tax rate rise on deferred taxes.
The company recorded after-tax charges of Dollars 50m against the costs of
litigation.
These mostly related to the decision by the US Court of Appeals to confirm a
judgment against the company in a class action suit over breaches of energy
pricing regulations between 1973-81.
Earnings per share fell to 42 cents from Dollars 2.06, on sales down to
Dollars 4.55bn, from Dollars 4.83bn.
Arco is to reorganise some of its oil and gas operations, resulting in a
'substantial' charge to fourth-quarter earnings, Reuter adds.
The group said that it expected to cut between 900 and 1,000 jobs by the end
of the transition period. The reorganisation of Arco Oil and Gas Co should
result in annual after-tax cost-savings of about Dollars 100m, the company
said.

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, yesterday revised its outlook on
General Motors to negative from stable, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
S&amp;P affirmed its ratings for the company, including senior debt at triple B
plus and preferred stock at triple B.
It warned, however, that ratings could be lowered within the next two years
unless the company's North American automotive operations improves its
financial performance significantly and the liability on the unfunded
pension is reduced materially.
S&amp;P noted that GM's market share performance has been disappointing in
recent quarters. It added that the company's labour contract will not
contribute to cost-cutting efforts at GM's core North American automotive
operations, as had been expected.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: No quick recovery from IBM's big
blues - Analysts see further losses at the troubled computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE summer of 1993 brought big changes for International Business Machines.
These included a new management structure and accelerated cost cutting - but
not, it appears, any sign of recovery from two years of heavy losses.
Even the most optimistic analysts are predicting that today, IBM, once the
bluest of the blue chip stocks, will report a loss for its third quarter.
The only question is how deep the red ink will flow. While the consensus is
an operating loss of about Dollars 170m, or 30 cents per share, it could be
double that, some IBM-watchers fear.
The stage has been set for IBM by disappointing results from several other
companies in the computer sector. Digital Equipment, in the midst of
restructuring, last week reported net losses of Dollars 83m on revenues of
Dollars 3bn for its first quarter, in spite of a Dollars 20m lift from
accounting changes.
Digital's revenues declined almost 10 per cent from the same period last
year, reflecting weak sales in Europe - particularly Germany and Italy - the
company said. Even Hewlett-Packard, which earlier reported a 44 per cent
earnings rise to Dollars 271m for its third quarter, ending in July, with
revenues up 23 per cent at Dollars 5bn, saw a sharp drop in European order
growth rates to 10 per cent, from 28 per cent growth in the previous
quarter.
Depressed economic conditions in Europe, the largest export market for the
US computer industry, are taking their toll on companies and IBM is expected
to be no exception.
Last year, European sales of Dollars 23.75bn accounted for almost 37 per
cent of IBM's total revenues. Germany, Italy and France are IBM's largest
European markets. Thus the continuing weakness of the European economy
represents one of the most formidable barriers to IBM's efforts to return to
profitability.
Another factor in the gloomy projections for IBM's third-quarter performance
is rapidly declining mainframe computer prices. Mainframe computers,
together with associated storage devices represent about 20 per cent of
IBM's revenues.
Amdahl, one of IBM's direct competitors in the mainframe computer market, is
due to report this week. The company has warned it expected to report an
operating loss 'considerably larger' than its second-quarter Dollars 23.7m
loss.
The company cited slow mainframe computer sales and 'intense competitive
pressure on pricing' as the principal reasons for anticipated losses.
Industry analysts say mainframe prices have declined by about 40 per cent in
the 12 months ending in July, with IBM driving the trend with heavy
discounting.
The personal computer market, in contrast, is rising and after losing market
share to competitors, the IBM PC is on the rebound. IBM's share of the
worldwide PC market rose to 14.9 per cent in the first quarter of this year
from 10.9 per cent in 1992, according to IDC, a market research group.
Yet IBM's ability to take advantage of strong demand for its PCs has been
hampered by parts shortages. In particular, IBM has been unable to get
enough of the active-matrix flat panel displays used in its popular Thinkpad
portable notebook computers.
Analysts estimate IBM may have lost as much as Dollars 1bn of business in
the third quarter because of inability to keep pace with demand for its PC
products.
Similar problems dogged Apple Computer and Compaq Computer last year and
industry executives see the ability to forecast demand accurately - and
order parts in advance - as a critical element of success in the PC market
that IBM has yet to master.
Rival Compaq Computer, which last week reported a 64 per cent jump in sales
to Dollars 1.75bn for the third quarter, with income more than doubling to
Dollars 107m, seems to have been the chief beneficiary of IBM's supply
constraints.
'Compaq is well prepared with manufacturing capacity and parts availability
to take advantage of the strong demand we are experiencing,' said Mr Eckhard
Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive.
As in other segments of the computer industry, personal computer profit
margins are declining rapidly amid intense price competition.
Apple Computer, which reported its results this month, saw gross margins
fall to below 26 per cent from above 40 per cent. In spite of record
revenues of Dollars 2.14bn for its fourth fiscal quarter, Apple recorded a
meagre net profit of Dollars 2.7m, down 97 per cent from the same period
last year.
IBM's painful struggles to adjust to lower gross margins have seen its
workforce cut by 125,000 since the end of 1986. Another 60,000 workers are
expected to leave the company before the end of 1994. The company has
written off Dollars 2.9bn in assets this year, half of it in manufacturing
facilities.
While the short-term outlook for IBM is still bleak, at least one analyst
believes Big Blue is on the right track.
'I'm not predicting it will happen in the fourth quarter or in the first
quarter of next year, but the ingredients are in place for a recovery,' says
Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers in San Francisco.
IBM's operating expenses and manufacturing costs are now 'almost at parity'
with industry competitors, Mr Jones says.
There is a new 'fire in the belly' of its product divisions; a new
determination to beat external competitors rather than squabble among
internal divisions, he believes.
The decline in IBM's mainframe computer business will bottom out in
1995-1996, Mr Jones predicts. The company's introduction - expected next
year - of parallel processing mainframe computer technology could lead to a
reduction in mainframe computer costs, creating stronger demand.
'Of the data stores in Fortune 500 companies, 80 per cent is on mainframe
computers today,' Mr Jones points out. He expects IBM's new parallel
processing technology, which will not require any software changes, to be an
important factor in IBM's recovery.
New sources of revenue and profit for IBM include its emerging merchant
semiconductor business.
Until recently, it has manufactured semiconductor chips only for its own
use, but it has set aggressive goals to become a multi-billion dollar chip
supplier to outside customers over the next few years.
Chips are one example of IBM's strategy to sell technology, components and
even finished products to other companies, rather than end-users. IBM has
set a goal of Dollars 3bn in original-equipment sales to industry customers
this year.
These efforts are unlikely, to yield short-term returns and today's
third-quarter financial report is expected to demonstrate that there is no
quick fix for IBM's big blues.

WESTERN Digital, the US semiconductor and disk drives group, is to sell its
silicon wafer fabrication facility to Motorola, the US electronics group,
for between Dollars 112m and Dollars 115m in cash, agencies report.
Motorola will also assume equipment leases associated with the facility. The
deal will include other unspecified considerations. The transaction is
should be completed by the end of December. Western Digital and Rockwell
International earlier this month terminated their negotiations on the sale
of the facility.
The transaction with Motorola also involves a supply contract, under which
Western Digital said it would obtain a significant portion of its silicon
wafer requirements for its disk drive and microcomputer products businesses
from Motorola for at least two years after the sale.
The sale is subject to a definitive agreement and government and private
party approvals.
'Once completed, the transaction will continue to fulfil one of our
principal goals over the last year - meaningful reduction of bank debt  - as
well as facilitate our transition to a variable-cost structure from a
high-fixed-cost structure,' said Mr Charles Haggerty, Western Digital
chairman.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Goodyear meets profit
projections with Dollars 136m

<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies,
yesterday posted third-quarter profits at the top end of its projections.
The Akron, Ohio-based company earned Dollars 136.2m, or 92 cents a share, in
the 1993 third quarter, compared with net income Dollars 91.5m, or 64 cents,
in the same period of last year.
Earlier this month, Goodyear predicted earnings of Dollars 130m to Dollars
135m for the quarter.
Sales in the three months slipped to Dollars 2.9bn from Dollars 3bn. The
company attributed the decline to currency translations and weakness in
world economies. In addition, 1992 sales included Dollars 92m from
subsequently divested businesses.
Goodyear said that its business unit operating margins of 10.5 per cent for
the quarter continued to exceed its long-term objective of 10 per cent.
The company has cut costs, reduced sales and administrative expenses and
improved its manufacturing efficiency.
Unit sales of tyres rose in the quarter, led by Goodyear's premium lines in
the US and by light and medium truck tyre sales worldwide. Operating income
from tyres rose 12.2 per cent to Dollars 261.2m in the quarter, although
sales eased slightly to Dollars 2.5bn.
The company's general products division had operating income of Dollars
47.3m, including one-time gains of Dollars 9.1m from the sale of its Reneer
Films business. A year earlier, the business had operating income of Dollars
46.3m.
Goodyear's oil transportation operations continued to post an operating loss
in the quarter of Dollars 2.4m, compared with Dollars 2.6m a year earlier.
Results for the first nine months were muddied by special items in both
years. Including these, Goodyear posted net income of Dollars 360.9m, or
Dollars 2.47, against a net loss of Dollars 746.1m, or Dollars 5.24 a year
ago.
Stripping out extraordinary items, last year's accounting changes and
adjusting for a two-for-one stock split, Goodyear earned Dollars 375.5m, or
Dollars 2.57, in the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars
264.5m, or Dollars 1.86, in the same period of last year.

CREDIT SUISSE, flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group,
said its consolidated pre-tax profit in the third quarter 'showed a marked
increase' over last year. It expected a 'good performance' for the full
year.
No earnings figures were given. The bank earlier reported half-year pre-tax
profit of SFr2.4bn (Dollars 1.6bn), 67 per cent higher than in the first
half of 1992.
Credit Suisse said its investment and trading business continued to benefit
from favourable market conditions in the third quarter. The Credit Suisse
Financial Products derivatives subsidiary was an important source of income.
Progress in merging Swiss Volksbank, acquired last spring for SFr1.6bn, was
bringing the expected cost savings.
However, the bank warned that loan-loss provisions remained high because of
the recession, especially in Switzerland.
Consolidated total assets stood at SFr228.4bn at the end of September, 32
per cent above a year earlier. Three-quarters of the growth came from the
Volksbank takeover.

structure

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's largest trading company, has launched a
review of its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates, in which it plans to close,
merge or sell unprofitable businesses.
This is the latest of several of Japan's keiretsus, or families of companies
linked by equity cross-holdings, to reassess their alliances in the light of
the recession.
Mitsubishi Corporation, which embraces oil and fuels, heavy industrial
goods, metals, textiles and goods among other sectors, plans to produce
details of its new strategy by early next year.
Businesses will be divided into three types: those to be liquidated or
merged, candidates for more investment, and those that need more monitoring.
Surplus staff will be shifted to other business units, officials said .
The move was prompted by the poor performance of some of the several hundred
businesses Mitsubishi Corporation acquired or invested in during the
economic upturn of the late 1980s.
Those investments were themselves the consequence of a previous strategic
rethink, in 1986, when the group responded to the coming upturn of the time
by expanding its activities.
The latest part of an existing management plan at Mitsubishi Corporation -
the most recent stage of which was its decision last month to disband the
capital markets division - represents a move away from the financial
engineering which was popular among Japanese industrial groups.
Officials warned that restructuring costs might exceed the Y30bn (Dollars
277m) forecast for the current year.
Net profits are widely expected to decline sharply from the Y52.72bn in the
year to March 1992. The move should strengthen the group's earnings in the
longer term, officials said.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Asset disposal helps boost Norsk
Hydro
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, yesterday reported a
rise in nine-month net profit, to NKr2.89bn (Dollars 396m) from NKr2.61bn.
It was helped by a large gain on the disposal of its 38.3 per cent stake in
Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate producer.
Even discounting the gain, Hydro said group results improved during all
three quarters of 1993. It attributed this primarily to lower production
costs, higher crude oil production, and the effect of a higher dollar
exchange rate.
With this year's result affected by a pre-tax gain of NKr2.53bn on the Freia
disposal, and last year's by changes to the US accounting code (GAAP), Hydro
said the two figures were not directly comparable.
'When these factors are excluded, net income for the first nine months of
1993 is calculated to be NKr1.067bn compared with NKr647m for the same
period last year,' it said.
Group revenue in the first three quarters rose by NKr2.44bn to NKr46.07bn,
as operating income climbed NKr1.11bn to NKr3.35bn. Operating costs shot up
by NKr1.23bn to NKr38.73bn.
'Our business areas are still affected by difficult market conditions,' said
Mr Egil Myklebust, president.
He attributed the improvement in operating income to reductions in
production costs and higher crude oil output.
'Oil and gas, petrochemicals and agriculture all show progress, while there
was a certain decline for light metals. This was due to a particularly
difficult market situation for both aluminium and magnesium. Our fertiliser
operations have increased sales, but have not achieved higher prices,' Mr
Myklebust said.
There was still uncertainty about how European fertiliser markets would
develop, he said.

BMW is continuing to resist the worst effects of recession, the luxury
German carmaker claimed yesterday.
Although sales fell 9.8 per cent to 406,500 units in the first nine months
of this year, deliveries were still higher than for the same period of 1990,
the last 'normal' year before German unification, it said.
Production, at 396,700 cars, was down 12 per cent compared with 25 per cent
for the German automotive industry as a whole. BMW exports were only 7 per
cent lower, compared with an overall drop of more than 20 per cent.
Turnover also fell a relatively modest 6.6 per cent to DM21.9bn (Dollars
13.1bn).
The company had been able to 'build a bridge over the cyclical dip', it
said.
In the domestic market, a 22 per cent rise in sales in eastern Germany, to
15,100, helped offset a 17 per cent decline in the west, where new
registrations overall are down 19 per cent.
BMW attributed much of its relative success to growth in north America and
south-east Asia, where deliveries rose 17 per cent and 24 per cent
respectively. With an eye on further high-potential markets, the company is
preparing to open assembly plants in the Philippines and Vietnam.
Yesterday's figures suggest a marginal improvement from the halfway mark,
when turnover was 8.8 per cent lower than in 1992, and when the company
reported net earnings down 39 per cent at DM255m.
Although the international market appeared to have reached the bottom of the
slump, recovery is not expected to appear before the middle of 1994.

gypsy lady on the packet, and the Asterix-like winged helmet on Gauloises
packaging have become national symbols. Seita, however, is destined to
become better known following the Balladur government's decision to put it
on the list of 21 companies to be sold to the public.
Given the recession depressing prospects for so many other privatisation
candidates, Seita's sale could be sooner rather than later. 'We are a very
uncyclical enterprise,' says Mr Eric Albrand, finance director, 'and the
timing (of privatisation) would depend more on finding a certain number of
buyers than on the economic context.'
Seita and British American Tobacco (BAT) are already eyeing each other with
interest. BAT makes no secret of the fact that its recent 'financial'
investment in the Banque Nationale de Paris privatisation was partly
designed to smooth its political path to an 'industrial' investment in
Seita. At an overall estimated value of between FFr7bn and FFr9bn ((Dollars
1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn), Seita's sale could be easily slotted in between larger
candidates.
However, before it goes on to the privatisation slipway, Seita needs to be
stripped of its residual monopolies. These still give it the right to
manufacture all tobacco products in France and to import all tobacco
products from outside the EC. However, they no longer confer any commercial
advantage to the company.
'It has simply meant that other companies have set up manufacturing and
import facilities elsewhere in the EC, without hindering their ability to
sell into the French market,' says Ms Isabelle Okrent, communications
director.
Seita's performance is improving. It expects a rise in net profit this year,
to more than FFr400m, compared with the FFr367m total last year (or 2.7 per
cent of 1992 turnover). But with even gross profits only 5.3 per cent of
turnover last year, Seita has hardly been the cash machine expected of
tobacco companies.
There are two main reasons for this. First, it has had to struggle with
strong public-sector unions to concentrate production in five factories
around the country, down from 12 a decade ago. Second, France taxes tobacco
fairly heavily. The industrial price was also controlled by the government
until last year.
The benefits to Seita of this latest lifting of price control has been
neutralised by three increases in tobacco taxes in the past 18 months. The
fact that some of Seita's competitors have cut, rather than increased, their
prices in order to gain market share has not helped either.
Seita had nearly half the French market last year. Its overwhelming
strength, however, is still in dark tobacco, a market which is declining by
between 7 and 8 per cent a year. In the steadily more fashionable light
tobacco, which now accounts for two-thirds of what is smoked in France,
Seita was last year second to Philip Morris and just ahead of Rothmans. Both
Seita and Rothmans have lost market share this year to Reynolds, which has
been cutting the price of its Winston brand.
Overall, the French market has dipped. After average growth of 0.8 per cent
during the 1980s, cigarette consumption fell by 0.8 per cent last year, and
by 3 per cent in the first eight months of this year.
Mr Albrand blames the decline on price/tax increases, and on the new law
banning tobacco advertising everywhere except inside France's 36,400
officially-designated tabacs, the only legal outlet for tobacco in the
country.
The tabac system suits the government, because it reduces evasion of tobacco
tax, and tobacco sales usefully cross-subsidise corner shops which would
otherwise have to close down in rural areas.
The system also suits Seita. It does not own the tabacs, but it might as
well do, because it is effectively their sole tobacco supplier, furnishing
them with other companies' cigarettes as well as its own.
Seita also makes money out of the network by distributing local communes'
parking permits, and France Telecom's telephone cards, to the tabacs for
sale.
Seita's incestuous relationship with the tabacs will not change with
privatisation; it rests on economies of scale and efficient service rather
than the law. However, it is hard to see how investing in Seita would give,
for example, BAT any edge in selling its products in French tabacs; the
neutrality clause in Seita's distribution contracts would prevent that.
Given that Gitanes or Gauloises are part of France's image in the world,
Seita believes the government will seek some core domestic shareholders. So
far the only French shareholder to show interest is the Bollore shipbuilding
group, in which Rothmans has a stake.
Seita sees a much better fit with BAT, which is strong in areas of where
Seita is weak - Latin America, east Asia and English-speaking Africa.
Another fit for Seita would be Reemstma of Germany. The two companies
already operate jointly in Belgium, Switzerland and Italy, and the German
company could provide Seita with an entree into east Europe and Russia.

FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sweden studies partial sale of
electricity generator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government is to consider urgently a partial privatisation of
Vattenfall, Europe's sixth-largest electricity producer, to enable the
company to raise SKr4bn (Dollars 497m) in new capital.
Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said yesterday the government could
not afford such a sum. He was replying formally to a request from the
state-owned company for a capital injection.
However, the minister said he understood Vattenfall's need for new capital.
The right-centre government would discuss urgently a suggestion by the
company that it be allowed to raise the money through a share issue to
Swedish institutions and its employees.
Mr Westerberg stressed the government had no intention of giving up its
control of Vattenfall, which produces about half of Sweden's electricity
needs, mainly through hydro and nuclear power generation. He also ruled out
a break-up of the group.
However, it is clear that a share issue on the scale suggested would not
significantly erode the state's dominance of the group, said by officials to
be worth upwards of SKr60bn.
Since coming to power two years ago, the coalition, led by prime minister
Carl Bildt's conservative Moderate Party, has begun working through a list
of 35 wholly or partly state-owned companies it wants to sell off.
This year, it completed the SKr2.2bn flotation of Celsius, the defence
group, and is now working on the disposal of its big holdings in Procordia,
the pharmaceuticals and food group, and the OK Petroleum group.
Vattenfall is the dominant - though not a monopoly - producer and supplier
of electricity in Sweden. It delivers about 80m megawatt hours a year,
including exports of more than 9m megawatt hours - three times as much power
as Sydkraft, its biggest private-sector Swedish competitor.
It ranks itself sixth in Europe, behind EDF of France, ENEL of Italy, RWE of
Germany, and Britain's National Power and Powergen.
It has recently been converted into a limited liability company. It said
yesterday it needed the capital injection to invest in production,
transmission and distribution facilities. These would strengthen the group
in the face of growing competition in Sweden and throughout Europe.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Targeting the Asian market for marine seals
 -The rationale behind TI's purchase of a majority stake in Dover Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP'S contested Pounds 510m takeover of Dowty last year has inevitably
focused City attention on the enlarged engineering group's aerospace
ambitions. In a quieter way, though, it is also making waves at sea.
Over the past two years TI's John Crane International seals business has
developed a world-leading presence in a range of seals and bearings for
hulls and propulsion systems.
Behind the recent formation of John Crane Marine International to handle the
marine side of the business lies one of the few purchases by a UK group of a
majority stake in a publicly quoted Japanese company.
The acquisition will help John Crane exploit Asian markets for marine seals.
Its Deep Sea Seals business had grown consistently in sales and profits for
several years but its mechanical-type seals had been focused mainly on naval
markets. These are a higher value product than the 'radial lip seals', made
of synthetic rubber, used in commercial shipping.
But, says Mr Bob Fisher, chief executive of John Crane, there are probably
80,000 commercial ships afloat, compared with 8,000 naval ships of different
types. And to be strong in commercial shipbuilding markets, 'we needed to be
in Asia - probably 60 per cent of all commercial shipbuilding is in Asia,
with Japan first, then Korea, China and Taiwan'.
Developing a strong commercial presence from scratch would have taken years.
There were only three main producers, Blohm + Voss in Germany, Kobelco -
part of Japan's Kobe Steel - and Dover Japan, a company 50.14 per cent owned
by Dover Corporation of the US.
As a producer that was independent of steelworks and shipyards, Dover Japan
seemed the best bet. But it was a small Japanese company with banks,
insurance companies and institutions among its investors, and the
acquisition needed careful handling.
In June 1991, however, a deal was concluded, with TI paying Y5.7bn (then
Pounds 25m) for Dover's stake. It paid a further Dollars 34m (Pounds 21m)
for Dover's complementary US and European marine seals activities.
That year, Mr Fisher joined John Crane after five years living and working
in Japan, an experience, he says, that was to prove useful in understanding
Dover Japan's mentality.
'There are more vestiges of the past when you buy a small Japanese company.
We had to be sensitive to the Japanese ways of doing business, and make the
Japanese management comfortable that things would work out,' he says.
Dover Japan was quickly introduced to TI's financial and reporting system.
In the UK, finance directors are much more involved in the business and work
more as a guide to operating division heads, while their counterparts in
Japan concentrate on statutory reports, says Mr Fisher.
'That's a tremendous change, and it took several months to be put in place,'
he adds.
TI has since increased its stake in Dover Japan to 55 per cent, but it
remains publicly quoted. In renaming it Japan Marine Technologies in
January, 'we wanted to be sure it was clearly recognised as a Japanese
company', says Mr Fisher.
At the same time, though, the Japanese company has become an important
element in the overall strategy at John Crane Marine International.
The acquisition of manufacturing capability for commercial seals in Asia,
along with sales and service capability in the US and western Europe, has
given the unit a 2-to-1 loading in favour of commercial seals.
Tighter environmental and pollution regulations from 1995 will drive market
growth in new commercial shipbuilding, Mr Fisher says, while the service and
repair business will also play a stronger role.
'Because of pollution penalties, and to preserve their reputations, ship
operators will want upgraded products,' he says.
By bringing all types of marine seals into one organisation, the unit can
offer 'one-stop shopping' for ship operators and encourage the shift away
from the traditional packed glands. These have been used as a cheaper, but
leakier, alternative to mechanical seals in markets where environmental
correctness holds less sway.
But naval markets are not being ignored. The Japanese navy is larger than
the UK's, says Mr Fisher, but is not among the 51 navies using John Crane
seals. Owning a Japanese company could help it gain access, although it will
take a while, he says.
There is also a big opportunity to supply both commercial and naval fleets
in eastern Europe. Until recently, he says, it was very difficult to
understand who was making and supplying their seals.
TI does not publish profits for the marine seals division, but Mr Fisher
says the acquisitions and reorganisation have added to the group's profits.
The Japanese deal has had other effects too. TI has wanted for years to
increase its Asian presence - Asia and Latin America collectively account
for about 10 per cent of group turnover.
John Crane itself has had a Japanese joint venture for 25 years, but the
purchase of JMT has helped focus the group's attention on the region, says
Mr Fisher.
'At chairman's policy committee, and at strategy and board meetings, there
is much more of an emphasis on Asia than there had been before,' he says.
'That is an important change for all of TI.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recovery gets under way at slimmed-down
Darby
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DARBY GROUP, the USM-traded specialist glass company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 379,000 for the six months to August 31, on sales of
Pounds 8.27m.
The Scunthorpe-based group also announced a return to the dividend list with
an interim distribution of 0.5p.
The comparable period saw losses of Pounds 471,000 before tax, as profits of
Pounds 99,000 from continuing activities were outweighed by a deficit from
French and US operations, now sold.
Mr Michael Darby, chairman, said business in the UK was slowly improving -
the factory in Barking has been recommissioned reflecting a stronger market
in the south-east - but there was reduced activity in German markets.
Nevertheless, exports now account for some 10 per cent of total turnover.
'We shall continued to pursue this market vigorously,' he added.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.2p (losses of 1.99p).

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sharp turnround at Graystone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAYSTONE, the engineering components group formerly known as Ptarmigan
Holdings, announced a turnround from losses of Pounds 736,000 to profits of
Pounds 200,000 pre-tax for the year to June 30.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 9.92m (Pounds 3.26m) with some Pounds 7.3m
coming from acquisitions.
Mr Dick Richardson, chairman, said the recommended Pounds 32.8m offer for
British Syphon was expected to be declared unconditional on November 15.
The pre-tax result was after a Pounds 763,000 provision for losses on
operations to be discontinued, and increased interest charges of Pounds
517,000 (Pounds 247,000). However, there was a Pounds 935,000 profit on
early redemption of loan stock.
Earnings per share were 0.57p (5.07p losses). Mr Richardson said dividend
payments would be resumed as soon as was practicable.
Meanwhile, Graystone has agreed to provide a fuller description of its
accounting policies on goodwill in its 1993 accounts and listing particulars
circulated this week, following discussions with the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the accounts watchdog.
The change came after the panel ruled that Graystone had not adequately
disclosed in its 1992 accounts the reasons for an accounting change to
capitalise and amortise goodwill over its estimated useful economic life.
The accounts were qualified in relation to goodwill by auditors Ernst &amp;
Young.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Moss Bros up 77% on higher market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGER share of the UK suit market helped Moss Bros, the clothing
outfitter, lift pre-tax profits by 77 per cent, from Pounds 354,000 to
Pounds 625,000, in the six months to July 31.
Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, described the rise as 'satisfactory given
the fragility of the recovery the UK is seeing'.
The shares rose 7p to 245p.
The group, which makes 70 per cent of its operating profits in the second
half, lifted its market share for suits from 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent in
the first six months. It maintained its position as the number one hire
business for formal wear with a 38 per cent market share.
More than half the pre-tax profit was accounted for by interest receivable
of Pounds 321,000, down from Pounds 491,000. Operating profit was Pounds
304,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.5m, compared with a previous operating loss
of Pounds 137,000 on turnover of Pounds 23.9m.
The group had net cash of Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 8.5m) at the period end. Mr
Terry Donovan, finance director, said the group was 'not embarrassed by the
money - too many retailers have fallen by the wayside'. The group would
continue to take a cautious approach with its cash.
Mr Gee said the group had rigorously controlled its costs and was continuing
to pursue a policy of organic growth. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds
260,000 to Pounds 1m in the period.
The Savoy Taylors Guild outlets in Canterbury, Exeter and Colchester were
relocated to larger shops and a new Cecil Gee branch was opened recently at
Lakeside, Thurrock. The group now has 107 stores, almost half of which trade
as Suit Co.
Earnings per share rose from 1.42p to 2.5p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 1.5p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE Lloyd's invest-ment trusts have issued pathfinder prospectuses
following last week's vote to admit corporate capital to the London
insurance market.
Angerstein Underwriting Trust is aiming to raise up to Pounds 75m through an
issue of ordinary shares, with warrants attached, on a 1-for-5 basis. It
said it had received indications from Stace Barr, its adviser, that it would
be allocated more than Pounds 100m of underwriting capacity on syndicates in
1994. NatWest Markets is sponsor to the issue.
As with other Lloyd's trusts, Angerstein will run an investment portfolio as
well as participating in insurance underwriting. Angerstein's investments
will try to match the FT-SE 100 Index. The prospectus does not reveal an
indicative gross dividend yield on the shares.
The pathfinder for Masthead Insurance Underwriting does not reveal the
maximum number of shares that the company plans to offer. However, it does
show the expected initial net asset value per share (96.5p, compared with an
issue price of 100p) and the indicative annual gross dividend yield (4.6 per
cent).
Masthead's offer is sponsored by Hambros and the group will be advised by
Murray Lawrence Members Agency, the fourth largest members' agent at Lloyds.
The investment portfolio will be managed by Hambros Bank and will, at first,
mainly comprise of sterling fixed interest instruments with an average gross
yield of 6.5 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Kewill's Austrian arm signs marketing deal
with IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEWILL SYSTEMS, a Surrey-based computer software supplier, said yesterday
that Han Dataport, its Austrian subsidiary, had signed a development and
marketing agreement with IBM Deutschland through which the computer giant
would sell Han Dataport's computer-aided design software.
The agreement covers co-operation in the development of the software -
called CAD 400 - and its selling on IBM's System/6000 mid-range computers.
CAD 400 is designed for the construction and building services market.
The aim of the co-operative effort is to provide systems for planners,
architects, construction engineers, interior designers, building services
engineers and building managers.
Mr Richard Broad, Kewill's finance director, said he expected the adoption
of CAD 400 by IBM to prove very significant for the company but he did not
expect to see the benefits working through to the results before 1994 or
1995.
IBM is thought to have about 25 per cent of the German CAD market.
Kewill is recovering from a period of poor results caused by problems with
its German subsidiary, Weigang, sold to its management earlier this year.
Kewill reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.69m for the year to March 31.
The shares closed up 4p at 248p, against a 12-month low of 47p.

for full year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EFG, the garden leisure and horticultural products company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 804,000 for the 26 weeks to August 1.
That compared with losses of Pounds 1.19m, restated to take account of a
Pounds 1.22m extraordinary charge being reclassified in accordance with the
FRS 3 standard.
However, the company warned that because of the seasonality of its products
it was likely to show a loss in the second half, although the year as a
whole should be profitable.
The shares rose 2p to 14 1/2 p.
Turnover declined to Pounds 10m (Pounds 13.7m). Net interest payable fell
from Pounds 281,000 to Pounds 148,000.
Earnings per share were 3p, against losses of 7.4p.
Net borrowings at August 1 were Pounds 1.28m for gearing of 18 per cent.
Borrowings, which stood at Pounds 5.35m at January 31, were reduced by the
rights issue, which formed part of the restructuring.
Borrowings have been further cut since the end of the period by asset sales,
which have raised Pounds 1.33m.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: LA Gear disposal helps Blacks recover to
Pounds 0.64m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLACKS LEISURE, the camp-ing, sports and fashion retailer and distributor,
lifted profits from continuing operations before tax and exceptional items
by 6 per cent to Pounds 226,000 in the six months to August 28.
At the pre-tax level, profit of Pounds 638,000 compared with a loss of
Pounds 8.2m.
The latest figure included a profit of Pounds 885,000 from the sale in June
of its LA Gear distribution business. The loss last time included Pounds
7.7m of goodwill already written off. Total interest payable was down from
Pounds 507,000 to Pounds 307,000.
Total turnover fell from Pounds 35m to Pounds 30.4m, including Pounds 2.67m
(Pounds 7.7m) from discontinued operations. Total operating profit after a
Pounds 439,000 loss on discontinued operations was Pounds 60,000, compared
with an operating deficit last time of Pounds 203,000 following a Pounds
753,000 loss on discontinued operations.
Continuing operations of the retail division made profits of Pounds 1.1m
(losses Pounds 273,000) on turnover of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 17.9m).
Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said the division had
improved its margins and pushed like-for-like sales up by 20 per cent.
This had been achieved through much keener buying, concentration on Blacks'
own brands, and the purchase of more clearance lines from established
suppliers.
At the same time the group was advertising more and had increased staff
training and cut costs.
The distribution division incurred a deficit of Pounds 288,000 (profit
Pounds 1.3m) from a sharply lower turnover of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 9.5m).
Mr Bentley said the group was looking for suitable opportunities to expand
the distribution division following the disposal of the LA Gear business.
He described the market as flat. 'If we do see growth in the market, all to
the good, but we don't expect it in our strategy or plans.'
Earnings per share were 1.86p (losses 25.94p). The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.75p.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Automotive Products shows decline to Pounds
5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMOTIVE Products, which serves the car and aircraft industries and is
owned by the Guthrie Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of BBA, reported
pre-tax profits down from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 5.7m in the first half of
1993.
Sales from continuing operations rose from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 141.1m,
generating operating profits of Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 8.8m).
The interest charge was reduced to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.6m). Earnings per
share came out at 4.9p (7.3p).
The company said the worldwide recession continued to affect its markets and
a cost reduction programme was continuing. This strategy was reflected in
redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.7m), which had
been charged against operating profit.
In June, the jury in patent/anti-trust litigation in the US recommended
damages against the company totalling Dollars 5.69m (Pounds 3.76m). The case
is proceeding and judgment will be entered in due course. If an award of
damages against the company is confirmed, the award is liable, under US law,
to be trebled.
The company is confident, however, that following the appropriate appeal
processes no material damages will ultimately be payable.

Porter Chadburn, the packaging, consumer products and specialist
distribution group, said it had received 'one or two approaches' for its
consumer division businesses.
However, Mr Raymond Dinkin, chief executive, said that weekend press reports
suggesting the company was about to unveil a rescue package involving the
sell-off of its British interests were 'pretty speculative'.
Porter Chadburn reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.62m for the year to
April 2 and last month warned that profits for the half year to September
would, on a like-for-like basis, be 'well down on last year'.
The shares, which have fallen from a high of 42p this year, were unchanged
at 20p.

BOOSTED by an Pounds 813,000 exceptional item representing settlement of a
legal dispute, pre-tax profits of Olives Property improved from Pounds
141,583 to Pounds 720,392 in the six months to end-June.
Turnover, including the exceptional profit, increased from Pounds 1.89m to

Following a Pounds 2.55m net open offer and placing, the property developer
installed a new management team in mid-June.
As part of the transition the company's two residential sites were sold for
Pounds 1.1m.
Mr Anthony Grant, chairman, said UK property returns remained higher than
borrowing rates, and Olives was exploring opportunities for investment to
establish a secure income and capital base for the future.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 122,682 (Pounds 196,862). Olives had zero
gearing at the period end and net assets stood at Pounds 5.5m.
Earnings per share improved to 4.74p (1.36p); there is, however, no interim
dividend against 1.5p last time.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS TEXTILES has agreed to acquire the broad stretch fabric
manufacturing operations of Gold-Zack Werke in Murg, Germany and Manila in
the Philippines for an expected total of DM34.2m (Pounds 13.9m) cash.
The businesses being acquired sell primarily to the international lingerie
market and their purchase will strengthen and geographically expand
Courtaulds Textiles' position in this market, particularly in the Far East.
Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to various conditions
including regulatory approval, Courtaulds Textiles will acquire selected
trading assets in Germany and the entire share capital of Gold-Zack
Philippines.
Some DM17m of assets, net of a small amount of local debt in the
Philippines, are being acquired.
The combined businesses generated DM5.1m of operating profits last year on
sales of DM65m.
Mr Noel Jervis, managing director, said: 'This acquisition will enhance our
established position in the German stretch fabric market and will provide an
additional base from which to supply the large and rapidly growing market in
the Far East.
'Our customers, which include the world's leading lingerie manufacturers,
are spreading their businesses internationally and we are correspondingly
developing our business so that we can meet their requirements on a local
basis through our global network.'
Courtaulds Textiles' existing stretch fabric businesses in Europe include
Penn Nyla and Courtaulds Jersey in the UK, Penn Elastic in Germany, Penn
Italia, Penn France and Penn Sedespa in Spain.
In Asia the group's stretch fabric interests include the Penn Asia joint
venture in Thailand.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Flextech in talks with TCI: US group to
take controlling stake in enlarged Pounds 200m company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEXTECH, the cable and satellite television group, is in talks to buy the
European programming business of Tele-Communications, continuing the current
scramble to buy broadcasting assets.
TCI, the US broadcasting group, is in turn in merger discussions with Bell
Atlantic.
The Flextech deal, expected to be tied up by Christmas, will more than
double its size, and give TCI a controlling stake in the enlarged company.
Flextech's shares jumped 49p to 224p yesterday.
The deal is expected to put a value of about Pounds 100m on the assets being
acquired and so give Flextech a market value of about Pounds 200m, compared
with Pounds 77m at yesterday's close.
Talks are still at an early stage, and yesterday's announ-cement was
prompted by the rise in Flextech's share price in recent days.
Mr Roger Luard, chief executive of Flextech, said the purchase would help it
to achieve 'critical mass in programming terms in the UK'.
He said the combined company would then develop further, and intended to
maintain its quote to enable it to do so.
Flextech will issue shares to TCI for the acquisition of United Artists
European Holdings, TCI's European programming business.
These shares would give TCI a stake in Flextech of probably between 50 and
60 per cent. TCI is expected to take the shares at a premium to the market
price reflecting its gaining control.
It is planned to get a dispensation from the Takeover Panel so that a full
offer for Flextech would not be necessary. Shareholder approval would be
required.
Flextech has a controlling 50.1 per cent interest in The Children's Channel,
through a joint venture with TCI formed last year. It also has a 39 per cent
interest in the Family Channel, launched in the UK this summer.
The deal will increase Flextech's stake in TCC to 75 per cent, and give it
100 per cent of Bravo, a 'time warp' channel broadcasting cult TV series and
old films, plus a 24 per cent stake in UK Gold, which shows old BBC and ITV
entertainment programmes and 35 per cent of UK Living, a channel of soaps
and quiz shows.
Mr Luard said that Flextech, which trades on the USM, was the only quoted
company in the UK to focus on cable and satellite broadcasting. It had
developed from a small oil services group - the oil activities were sold in
1992 - but still needed a strategic partner to develop rapidly.
Flextech is likely to move its shares to the Official List as part of the
deal, and may seek a listing in the US as well.

MACDONALD Martin Distill-eries, the producer of Glenmorangie malt whisky,
has bought Crabbie's Old Scottish Green Ginger Wine from United Distillers,
the Guinness spirits division.
The acquisition, for an undisclosed price, includes trade marks, stocks of
maturing and cased wine, and a bottling line. It will be funded from
existing bank borrowings.
Macdonald said Crabbie's would not make a material contribution to profit in
the early years but, with marketing support and increased volumes, was
expected to generate 'worthwhile' longer-term earnings.
Crabbie's is the leading brand in Scotland and number two in the UK to

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON ENGINEERING, the maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear,
has negotiated in principle an extension of its banking facilities to the
end of next year.
Mr Maurice Dixson, who became chief executive as the group announced a
first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m at the beginning of September,
yesterday described the proposed extension as 'a milestone.'
It would give the management time to take the necessary actions for a return
to profitability, he said.
Under the proposals, which have been submitted to lenders for approval,
Simon would receive bonding facilities to allow it to compete for new
business in key areas - including the sale of fire rescue equipment in North
America.
The group would grant security to the small number of mainly UK banks with
which it has Pounds 60m of medium term finance, and to North American
holders of Dollars 125m (Pounds 83m) of unsecured loan notes.
Both the banks and the noteholders would waive Simon's breach of banking
covenants earlier this year.
The group is committed to reducing its net debt substantially by the end of
1994.
Mr Dixson, on taking up the reins of the group, identified the reduction of
net debt from Pounds 143m to less than Pounds 100m as his most urgent task.
'I have set a target below Pounds 100m as a matter of priority,' he said
yesterday. 'I don't need anyone to drive me to do that - it's a commercial
imperative.'
The simplest way to reduce the debt was to make the company more profitable.
Mr Dixson said a lot of his attention had been directed at the access
equipment business, where he planned to sort out the working capital and
boost margins.
In addition, there would have to be further sales both of businesses and
property assets. While Mr Dixson said he had now identified the core
businesses which would provide a future for Simon, he would not be drawn on
details.
The main part of the debt reduction programme is expected to fall in next
year's second half.
The first half loss was struck on turnover of Pounds 190.8m, and compared
with a previous profit of Pounds 6.16m on turnover of Pounds 242.3m.
The deficit marked the culmination of more than two years of bad news for
the group, which has suffered from an ill-fated diversification into
environmental engineering, loss-making plant contracts, the recession and
rising debts. At the end of June gearing was 195 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank in Dollars 144m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland said yesterday that it had reached agreement to
buy a small Boston-based savings bank to add to its Citizens Financial Group
US subsidiary.
The bank, which has set a target for Citizen to contribute at least 10 per
cent of earnings, said it had agreed to buy Neworld Bancorp for Dollars
144.3m (Pounds 95.4m). The deal will add a further Dollars 1.1bn to
Citizens' assets of Dollars 7bn.
The deal is the fifth acquisition by Citizens since the end of 1990,
including the acquisition last month of Boston Five Bancorp. It will be
financed by Royal Bank injecting Dollars 75m of cash into Citizens in return
for common stock.
Neworld, which has 22 branches, converted from a mutually owned savings bank
in 1982. Its branches are concentrated around Boston, and on Cape Cod, the
Massachusetts peninsula with a high number of affluent residents.
Mr Larry Fish, chairman of Citizens, said Neworld was 'a wonderful, perfect
fit' with Citizens' New England network, which it has been trying to extend
from its original base in Providence, Rhode Island.
Citizens is to pay Dollars 35 a share, or 1.6 times the book value of
Neworld. However, Mr Fish said this was a lower multiple than Fleet
Financial agreed to pay last month to acquire Sterling Bancshares of
Massachusetts.
Mr Fish said Neworld fitted with Citizens' attempt only to acquire banks
with high asset quality. He said that its total non-performing assets were
Pounds 14m, and these were nearly two times covered by provisions of Pounds
27m in its reserves.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said the bank had 'plenty
of cash' to finance the acquisition. He said Citizens would be able to
improve Neworld's earnings through cutting overlap between processing
operations.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Investors vent their spleen on Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS not the easiest of days for Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman of
Tiphook, the container leasing group which has in recent months been bearer
of huge quantities of grief to its investors.
He yesterday obtained the approval of shareholders for an increase in
Tiphook's borrowing limits, which the loss-making group needs while it
renegotiates new covenants with its bankers.
But in spite of confirming that he would split his role with a chief
executive, the flamboyant founder of the group discovered that a few
shareholders were determined to vent their spleen on the board, which has
seen the group's market value drop by 66 per cent since March.
The meeting got off to a sticky start when Mr Montague asked if he could
take as read the sole resolution before the meeting, which increased the
group's borrowing limit to Pounds 1.3bn, equivalent to six times
shareholders' funds. One shareholder insisted that the resolution be read
out 'because I'm not sure members of this board can tell a million from a
trillion'.
The task fell to Mr Nicholas Smith, Tiphook's company secretary. Perhaps
predictably, he stumbled over the 10-figure number. 'Thank you, sir, you've
confirmed my point,' said the shareholder, with grim satisfaction.
The chairman's difficulty arose as he said he had been advised by
Freshfields, the group's lawyers, that he was restricted in what he could
tell the meeting. He could give the shareholders no assurance their stake
would not be diluted by any refinancing, nor give any new information about
the group's borrowing or trading.
The same shareholder berated the chairman for sheltering behind the advice
of his lawyers: 'You're throwing stones at us from behind a brick wall.'
Mr Montague said it would not be in the interests of either shareholders or
the company to give out more information until the resolution had been
passed and the support of the bankers secured. But he promised to inform
shareholders of any further developments as soon as possible.
Another shareholder suggested the board should take large cuts in salary to
share the same pain as the shareholders. Mr Montague, who last year earned
Pounds 851,000, said directors had promised at last month's agm to take pay
cuts.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Ladbroke seeks NY betting shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE Group, the UK lei-sure company, has approached Mr David Dinkins,
mayor of New York, with an offer to buy or run the city's 93 off-track
betting shops.
Mr John Long, president and chief operating officer of Ladbroke Racing in
the US, wrote to Mr Dinkins on October 13 suggesting a meeting to discuss
'several levels of involvement' by the UK company.
These could range from 'a management contract to outright purchase', he
said.
The future of racing and off-track betting in New York is being reviewed by
New York state governor Mr Mario Cuomo. This review prompted the Ladbroke
approach, said Mr Long, adding that the company has approached the city and
the state before.
The New York city-owned Off-Track Betting Corporation suffered for many
years from under-investment and many of its branches are badly sited or in
need of refurbishment. The corporation said it was now spending Dollars 4.5m
(Pounds 3m) a year on revamping its branches.
In the year to June the corporation attracted bets of Dollars 811m, down
from Dollars 878m the year before. It blamed this fall on the weakness of
the US economy, though casinos and other gambling operations have increased
their business. After paying out Dollars 616m on winning bets, the operation
contributed Dollars 43.4m to the New York state and city last year.
Even if Ladbroke won the support of New York city, it would still face
obstacles to making the betting operation more profitable.
The New York Racing Association, which owns three of the state's four
racecourses, restricts the live broadcast of races in off-track betting
shops to encourage punters to go to its tracks. Only around a third of
branches carry live broadcasts. Also, several neighbourhood organisations
have prevented new branches from opening in desirable locations in
Manhattan.
Mr Dinkins, who is in the middle of a bitter mayoral election battle, has
yet to respond to the Ladbroke overture.
A spokeswoman for the mayor said: 'It (off-track betting) is in the
assessment mode. No decision has been taken.'
Ladbroke's US off-track betting operations are restricted to five large
venues in Pennsylvania, where it broadcasts races. Mr Long refused to
comment on whether the company wanted to move into off-track betting in
other states.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Boeing falls 45% due to recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 45 per cent drop in third-quarter net earnings as it continued to
be hit by recession in the world's civil aviation industry.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 189m, or 56 cents a share, on sales
of Dollars 5.15bn, down from earnings of Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.02 a
share, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn in the same period of last year.
The figures were within the range of analysts expectations but the shares
dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 5/8 in morning trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Boeing said that based on current programmes and schedules, fourth-quarter
sales and earnings would be well above the third quarter, with total sales
for 1993 now projected near Dollars 25.5bn.
Lower sales would continue next year, reflecting previously announced
production cutbacks. Production rate changes were currently being
implemented to cut the 737 rate to 10 per month, the 757 to five per month,
and the 767 to three per month. In early 1994 the 747 production rate would
be cut from five to three per month.
'Economic growth in the major airline traffic markets worldwide continues to
be weak, particularly in western Europe and Japan,' it added. 'Consequently,
airline profitability, although improving in the aggregate, is expected to
remain below historic levels in the near term.'
Boeing continued to review future production and 'there is no assurance that
rates will be maintained . . . for all models'.
However, it added that the start-up of production of the new 777 aircraft in
1995 would provide a 'substantial offset' to sales reductions elsewhere.
For the nine months, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 940m, or
Dollars 2.77 a share, on sales of Dollars 19.78bn, compared with earnings of
Dollars 1.19bn, or Dollars 3.52 a share, in the same period of 1992 on sales
of Dollars 22.69bn, excluding adjustments for accounting changes.
The company gained new orders for 142 commercial aircraft worth Dollars
9.8bn during the nine months, compared with 158 orders valued at Dollars
11.5bn in the same period of last year.
At the end of September its firm backlog stood at Dollars 77.4bn, compared
with Dollars 80.8bn at the end of June and Dollars 87.9bn at the end of
1992.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Bidders dig deep to stage final showdown: The rising stakes
in the battle for Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much is Mr Barry Diller, chairman of the television home shopping group
QVC Network, prepared to pay to snatch Paramount Communications away from
its engagement to Viacom, the cable television company?
That is the central question facing Paramount shareholders this week,
following Sunday night's move by Viacom to increase the value of its agreed
bid for the company from Dollars 7.5bn to Dollars 9.5bn, thus matching the
value of QVC's hostile offer. The move sweeps aside the financial edge QVC
has enjoyed since it entered the fray on September 20, with a Dollars 9.5bn
proposal.
And it leaves Viacom with a slight upper hand: it has the agreement of the
Paramount board to a merger, and the two marriage partners are advanced in
obtaining the necessary regulatory clearances.
Viacom also has the advantage of 'lock-up' provisions that allow it to buy
20 per cent of Paramount's stock at Dollars 69.14 a share and receive a
Dollars 100m payment from Paramount if its bid does not go through.
'The ball is in QVC's court to decide whether to step aside or raise its
offer,' says Ms Margo Vignola, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
It was Mr Diller, a prominent film industry figure, who increased the tempo
of the contest last Thursday when, frustrated by the Paramount board's
reluctance to open negotiations, he changed the terms of QVC's bid proposal,
while maintaining the overall value.
First, he announced that QVC would proceed this week with a cash tender
offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares, at Dollars 80 a share, costing
Dollars 4.8bn. It would buy the remaining 49 per cent in a later stock-swap
tender, also valued at around Dollars 80 a share.
The move had two important elements. First, it raised the amount of cash in
the QVC offer from Dollars 3.5bn to Dollars 4.8bn - shareholders generally
prefer to receive cash. Second, by launching a tender, QVC by-passed the
Paramount board and took its offer directly to the shareholders. The
manoeuvre left Viacom with no alternative but to increase its offer. It
therefore launched a tender offer on Sunday on the same terms as QVC, and
offered to buy the remaining 49 per cent in a second stage tender at Dollars
80 a share in a mixture of common and preferred stock.
Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, says this leaves Mr Diller
with three choices: 'He can increase the cash portion of his bid, he can
increase the total value above Dollars 80, or he can walk away. But given
the scarcity value of the assets I think walking away is the least likely.'
But how much more can either QVC (with revenues of around Dollars 1bn) or
Viacom (revenues Dollars 2bn) afford to pay for the much larger Paramount
(revenues of Dollars 4bn)?
Their offers are already far from cheap - Ms Reif puts them at around 19
times Paramount's 1993 operating cash flow and 36 times its earnings. With
Dollars 4.8bn in cash on the table, both companies appear to be getting
close to the limits of their war chests.
QVC's armoury contains around Dollars 5bn, consisting of Dollars 3bn in bank
loan commitments and Dollars 500m of equity investments from four other
media companies: Comcast, Liberty Media (both of which are already large QVC
shareholders), Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications.
Viacom's new offer was made possible by a Dollars 1.2bn equity commitment
from Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company, and a further Dollars 600m from
Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental business. It must also have
lined up some Dollars 3bn in bank borrowings.
However, in addition to the war-chests, the protagonist gaining control of
Paramount will have access to that company's Dollars 1bn in cash reserves,
giving each side some latitude to increase its offer. Either side might also
persuade their media backers, or bankers, to provide some extra money.
Certainly, takeover battles have a habit of soaring out of the bounds of
rational financial considerations, and Paramount is such a rare prize - one
of the last of the large, independent Hollywood film studios - that the
bidding seems certain to go higher, be it from QVC, Viacom or an entirely
new entrant to the fray.
The heads of all three companies have a great deal riding on the outcome.
For 70-year-old Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, the deal is a chance
to cap his career in style - although he vowed yesterday not to carry out
'an excessively leveraged transaction'.
For Mr Diller, it is an opportunity to turn QVC from a humble television
home shopping business into a leading US entertainment concern. Mr Martin
Davis, chairman of Paramount, is anxious to complete the friendly deal with
Viacom and avoid being swallowed by QVC. He and Mr Diller are bitter
enemies.
The only thing that can be said with certainty is that the battle is far
from over. Few shareholders will be interested in the tender offer when even
better terms seem likely to be on the table before too long.

FT  26 OCT 93 / BET takes another step towards recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group which overstretched itself in a series of
1980s acquisitions, took another step on the road to rehabilitation
yesterday by reporting a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits.
However, sales fell slightly, from Pounds 1.09bn to Pounds 1.03bn, in the
six months to September 25. Reduced losses from discontinued operations and
lower interest costs mainly accounted for the increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 47m from a restated Pounds 36m.
The group warned: 'Conditions in our market are likely to remain tough for
some time. Despite the significant cost reductions that have been made,
pressure on margins persisted.'
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said BET's three-year restructuring
programme was almost complete, although there would would be more disposals.
Since the sell-off programme began in 1991, the group has shrunk from 180
companies to 69, with 11 non-core units sold in the last six months.
Mr Clark said: 'Attention has now been focused on improving the performance
of the core businesses in the areas of productivity and marketing. The
growth potential of these core businesses is being assessed so as to ensure
that we have the right mix of businesses for the future.'
He said the debt and cost reduction programmes and the introduction of new
management systems had eliminated the serious structural and financial
problems previously facing BET.
Net borrowings were cut from Pounds 65.2m to Pounds 9m, giving gearing of 3
per cent. Interest payments fell from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 3.2m. Operating
profit from continuing operations declined from Pounds 55.9m to Pounds
50.5m, while losses on discontinued operations were about Pounds 10m down at
Pounds 1.2m.
Textile services suffered from reduced demand and business closures.
However, the restructuring of the UK business helped increase the division's
operating profits from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 18.9m.
The cleaning services division's operating profits fell from Pounds 10.4m to
Pounds 5.4m because of serious problems in the depressed New York commercial
property market and pressure on prices in the UK.
Security services increased operating profits from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds
6.5m. The group said demand remained strong and the outlook appeared
positive.
Heavy pressure on margins caused profits from plant services to fall from
Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 15.4m. The distribution division's profits were flat
at Pounds 14m, in spite of strong sales growth.
Earnings per share rose to 3.3p (1.5p). The interim dividend was cut from 2p
to 1p, in line with an intention to make the final dividend larger than the
interim.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Pounds 2bn 'raves'pose threat to leisure spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAVES are now a Pounds 2bn a year industry challenging established leisure
industries according to a study by the Henley Centre, the research and
forecasting organisation, released yesterday.
Over a million young people a week in the UK are now going to 'rave' parties
and spending an average of Pounds 35 a head on the activity, the study
reveals.
The 'staggering' spending figure - much of it on illegal drugs - is about
the same size as the books or newspaper markets, and at least a quarter of
the spirits market, says Henley. The study excludes unlicensed raves.
The parties, which are held in warehouses and halls within easy reach of
metropolitan areas, commonly attract 4,000-10,000 young people at a time, a
large proportion of whom are under 21 years of age. Raves are usually
alcohol-free but there is normally heavy consumption of drugs, says the
centre.
Raves 'pose a significant threat to spending for such sectors as licenced
drinks retailers and drinks companies,' says the study. Pub visits by young
people fell 11 per cent between 1987 and 1991 and Henley is forecasting a
further decline of 9 per cent during 1992-97.
Henley calculates that the average admission charge to a rave is Pounds 15;
spending on drugs is typically Pounds 3-Pounds 5 for LSD; Pounds 15 for
ecstasy; Pounds 5 for speed; Pounds 15 for cannabis; mineral water is Pounds
1 a bottle; and cigarettes cost Pounds 3.
The report says it is clear that the minimum spend at a rave is about Pounds
20 and the maximum could be about Pounds 50. Henley uses an average figure
of Pounds 35 a visit per person to produce a weekly spending total of Pounds
35m for the million participants. The percentage of 16-24-year-olds taking
illegal drugs has doubled to nearly 30 per cent over the three years to
1992, says the report.
Raves are also extremely time-consuming, displacing time and energy 'which
might have been expended on other leisure activities'. Raves can last
anywhere between eight and 24 hours, and a weekend rave can go on for 48-72
hours.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Finance ministers told EC economy is 'on the way up'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community has passed the low point of the recession, the EC's
economic affairs commissioner said yesterday.
Mr Henning Christophersen said at a meeting of EC finance ministers in
Luxembourg if projections of German recovery next year were accurate, the EC
economy would grow faster than the Commission had forecast. 'We have seen
the bottom and we are on the way up,' he said.
His comments provided an upbeat start to a busy week for the community,
which ends on Friday with a summit of EC leaders in Brussels.
Ministers agreed they should maintain efforts to promote growth and
employment. Last night French president Francois Mitterrand said he would be
proposing at the summit an Ecu100bn (Pounds 77.6bn) bond issue to finance
public infrastructure to spur the European economy.
According to EC forecasts, even if the German economy lives up to
expectations next year, the EC economy will not expand enough to put very
many of the community's 18m jobless people back to work.
A report from Germany's six leading economic institutes published yesterday
says the German economy should grow 1.5 per cent next year. This year it is
expected to shrink 1.5 per cent.
Brussels has predicted the EC economy will grow 1.25 per cent this year, and
by 1 to 1.5 per cent in 1994. But Mr Christophersen said if German forecasts
were accurate, the EC economy could grow 2 per cent next year, heralding the
end of recession.
At Luxembourg ministers also discussed increasing the number of
infrastructure projects eligible for funds from an Ecu8bn temporary lending
facility from the European Investment Bank.
They approved a range of secondary legislation to allow the setting up of
the European Monetary Institute, a precursor of the central bank, from
January 1 1994, and endorsed the EC central bank governors' recommendation
that Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy be the first EMI president.
Speaking of plans for this Friday's EC summit, Mr Mitterrand acknowledged he
was picking up an idea of fellow socialist Mr Michel Rocard, who suggested
that the EC borrow Ecu50bn for public works. Mr Mitterrand said the Brussels
commission had told him yesterday it would be feasible for the EC to borrow
and spend twice that amount.

FT  26 OCT 93 / US plans drive to open overseas finance markets: Asia and
Latin America likely to be the main targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury plans a drive next month to try to open up financial
services markets in key Asian and Latin American countries.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration
would work to level the playing field for US banks and financial service
companies.
'Too often the playing field looks like the Rockies. Barriers - both formal
and informal - prevent US firms from entering markets on an equal footing
with their competitors,' Mr Bentsen said in a speech yesterday to the Center
for National Policy, a Washington think-tank.
Mr Bentsen said the US's highest priority was a multilateral agreement in
the Uruguay Round of trade talks that would open financial markets on a
non-discriminatory basis.
'But we have made it clear that we will not agree to lock our markets open
on a Most Favoured Nation basis, unless or until other countries commit to
open their markets to US financial institutions,' Mr Bentsen said.
'We are prepared to guarantee national treatment and full access to
countries that commit to open their markets. And, we are prepared to
guarantee their existing operations in our market. But we will not assure
countries that keep their markets closed the right to expand operations
here, or to take advantage of new powers or benefit from future reforms,' he
added.
Mr Jeffrey Shafer, the assistant Treasury secretary for international
affairs, is to travel to a number of countries to warn them they must do
more to lower barriers to US banks.
The administration yesterday threw its weight behind the fair trade in
financial services bill being sponsored in Congress by Senator Donald
Riegle.
The legislation would empower - but not compel - the US government to deny
the right of further expansion to banks and financial institutions from
countries which did not offer equal access to US institutions.
Such a measure parallels retaliatory mechanisms contained in the European
Community's second banking directive, and is not expected to cause
difficulty to banks from European countries.
US commercial banks are likely to concentrate their complaints on countries
such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Brazil.
The Treasury secretary also called for legislation to allow US banks to open
branches outside their home states. 'The basic approach would be to let
banking organisations convert existing multi-bank, multi-state operations
into a single bank, multi-branch operation,' he said.
Richard Waters adds from New York: US banks gave only a subdued welcome to
this initiative. Few restrictions remain on their ability to operate across
the US through separate subsidiaries, although the ability to branch across
state lines would reduce the cost and complexity of nationwide banking.
On the other hand, the banks fear that a debate over branching could allow
insurance agents to lobby against banks' involvement in selling insurance
products.

FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BTR/Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that good housekeeping is all that lies behind BTR's decision to
float off its Graham builders merchants is perhaps a little too pat. BTR has
owned Graham for 10 years, so it has scarcely rushed to the task. In part
that may reflect the retirement of Sir Owen Green, who was attached to
businesses he bought. BTR may also have had an eye to the high stock market
valuations of building materials companies. Then again, while recovery
stocks are selling on high multiples, their earnings are close to the bottom
of the cycle. Significantly, BTR's cash flow was also boosted by recent
warrant issues and the enhanced scrip dividend. The most persuasive argument
for selling Graham now is to help fill the war chest for another
acquisition.
Given its much lower rating, Hanson might consider a similar flotation. A
sale to the stock market would certainly help cut gearing. Even more
fashionably, demerging a highly-rated recovery company might increase
shareholder value. Yet floating off UK businesses would institutionalise
Hanson's advance corporation tax problem. In the US there may still be
residual resentment of Smith Corona's poor performance after Hanson floated
it. That might compel the company to offer attractive terms to get the deal
away, undermining the point of the transaction. Besides, the more recovery
businesses Hanson sold, the less attractive the remainder. Following the
Quantum acquisition, Hanson will probably shed some of its peripheral US
manufacturing businesses to cut borrowings. But trade sales look the most
likely route.

FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The aura of unreality surrounding the bidding war for Paramount has only
been marginally dispelled by the two rivals thumping more hard cash on the
table. Viacom's move to match QVC Network's tender offer must give it the
edge, at least momentarily. With Paramount's board remaining impervious to
QVC's blandishments and a poison pill defence in place to frustrate a
hostile bid, QVC has now been manoeuvred into a position where it either
raises or folds its hand. There remains a real possibility that the bidding
will climb. Urged on by eager allies, QVC seems determined to press ahead.
The prospect of another buyer entering the fray cannot be ruled out.
Already, both declared suitors are prepared to pay a premium of more than
Dollars 3bn over Paramount's pre-bid market value. That premium alone is
more than the market worth of either Viacom or QVC. The justification for
such generosity is based on the synergies offered by the rapidly converging
world of multi-media and the scarcity value of Hollywood studios. But it
will require an extraordinary harmony of interests among the winning group
to justify the price. A coherent alliance of media and telecommunication
companies could perhaps make the sums stack up. There is less chance that a
rag-bag of allies hastily assembled during the heat of a bid will be able to
make the Paramount deal pay.

FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As befits a collection of late-cycle businesses, BET's shares turned seven
months after the main body of the stock market. While the first increase in
interim pre-tax profits since 1989 justifies the market's faith, progress
has relied on self-help and a fair wind in the currency markets. Nearly
three years after the arrival of Mr John Clark as chief executive, loss
makers are still being weeded out and interest charges reduced. More of the
same should be enough to maintain earnings momentum in the second half. By
this time next year, though, BET will need to show decent margin
improvements in businesses which have survived the axe.
So far the trading performance has been mixed. Creditable results in textile
services and electronic security in the first half were offset by more pain
in cleaning and plant hire. Comparisons with the best of the competition
suggests margin improvements might be achieved through the kind of
productivity drive the company now promises. But where prices are falling
BET is running to stand still. The danger must be that prices will remain
under pressure in its low-margin businesses even after economic recovery has
taken hold.
Whether BET should continue to slug it out in areas with low barriers to
entry - such as office cleaning and security guarding - is thus an open
question. If these businesses continue to act as a drag on recovery there
will be a strong argument for redeploying resources elsewhere. Having repaid
Pounds 700m debt and preference shares over three years, BET can at least
afford to wait and see.

FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Long haul for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tough being an Attali twin: frere Jacques departs the EBRD amid
criticism he has spent too much money; frere Bernard resigns as chairman of
Air France for trying to save too much. The latter Mr Attali's plans to cut
costs were modest in relation to the scale of Air France's problems, yet
they were still sufficient to provoke the implacable opposition of the
unions. His departure in such circumstances will only compound the
challenges confronting his successor.
Air France is woefully over-staffed and deeply in loss. This may not have
mattered much while the government remained indulgent and Europe's aviation
industry cosily cartelised. But Air France's rivals threaten to turn the
competitive screw as the industry liberalises. British Airways, which is
benefiting from a lower cost base following sterling's devaluation, is fast
encroaching into the French market through TAT. Even the lacklustre
Lufthansa has more resolve in pressing ahead with cost-cutting and
privatisation. Its link-up with United could develop into a powerful threat
to Air France. A consummation of the proposed Alcazar alliance between four
European airlines would also buffet the French carrier badly.
How the French government tackles this conundrum could develop into a
fascinating clash between traditional dirigisme and new-found pro-market
rhetoric. Air France boasts some attractive international routes and readily
saleable assets. This may enable the government to privatise the carrier -
but at a price determined by a broader view of the airline's prospects. That
underlines the case for firm action by the government now.

The government of Mr Edouard Balladur, faced with its first serious
industrial dispute since taking office in March, quickly climbed down from
the brink.
The withdrawal of Air France's controversial cost-cutting plan on Sunday
night was aimed at preventing the escalation of a strike that had paralysed
the loss-making airline for the past week. The prospect of today's 'Black
Tuesday' industrial action, with unions at Air France's domestic subsidiary
and the Paris airport authority planning to join forces with striking ground
staff, fuelled fears of a winter of public sector discontent. It forced the
government to promise that a new recovery package for the airline would be
negotiated over the next three months.
The declaration was quickly followed by the resignation of Mr Bernard
Attali, the airline's chairman, who had drawn up the plan to cut 4,000 jobs
by the end of next year and reduce overtime pay. He had argued that the
measures were crucial for the group's survival.
The government's concession on the plan and Mr Attali's departure should
help defuse the conflict at the state-owned airline after today's strikes.
But Mr Balladur and his colleagues may find the costs greater than the
benefits. The problems at the airline are being shelved, not solved. More
significantly, the dispute highlights the dilemma facing the Balladur
government as it seeks to restructure French industry and privatise public
sector groups, while trying to prevent social unrest in the face of an
unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent and rising.
The events at Air France represented the first significant test of how the
government would respond to this dilemma. Its reaction is the clearest
evidence so far that unemployment and the consequent threat of industrial
strife are creating a barrier to reform that the government is unwilling to
breach.
This is implicit in the government's justification of its decision. 'We
cannot save Air France while clashing with all its employees,' said Mr
Bernard Bosson, transport minister. 'Because we must have social peace, we
must change the plan.'
But by backing down in the airline strike and abandoning the cost-cutting
plan, the government may find that its hand is weakened in its pursuit of
industrial restructuring. The case could encourage other unions to press
their causes through industrial action and complicate, rather than ease, the
implementation of economic reforms.
Even at Air France, social peace is far from guaranteed. While the unions
that spearheaded the protests said they might return to work tomorrow, Air
France, which suffered losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half of
the year, remains in urgent need of restructuring.
Mr Bosson has said that the 4,000 job cuts in Mr Attali's plan are still
necessary, although he believes they can be implemented without involuntary
redundancies. But delicate negotiations will be required if a repeat of the
unrest is to be avoided.
The appointment as chairman of Air France of Mr Christian Blanc, former head
of RATP, the French capital's bus and metro authority, could work both ways.
A friend of the Socialists, including their leader, Mr Michel Rocard, he has
a reputation as a tough manager and a penchant for reform, which he
practised widely at RATP.
For their part, public sector trade unions said yesterday that they were
satisfied with what they described as a 'first victory', but warned that
they would continue to press their case against cuts in pay and overtime
rates in negotiations with the transport ministry.
There are grumblings of public sector discontent elsewhere, too. The
Confederation Generale du Travail, the left-wing union group which was at
the forefront of the Air France dispute, has called for a day of protest on
November 18 against job cuts. This is expected to hit France's railways and
several public sector companies, including Aerospatiale, the aerospace
group, Snecma, the aero-engine manufacturer, and Groupe Bull, the computer
group.
Disgruntlement is also evident in the postal service and at France Telecom.
A one-day strike on October 12 drew wide support from workers at these
groups, reflecting fears of job cuts and opposition to government plans to
reform employment laws.
For the moment, the risk of widespread public sector unrest appears limited,
partly because of continuing divisions among different unions. Several union
groups, including Force Ouvriere, the radical federation that is prominent
in the Air France dispute, have indicated that they will not participate in
the November 18 protests. And at the weekend, the government reached
agreement with four public sector unions over pay for civil servants. The
deal, which gives civil servants a pay rise of 5 per cent for the next two
years, avoids a potentially damaging impasse.
The events at Air France, however, have given France's trade unions a boost.
'Yes, it is possible to win,' said Force Ouvriere in a statement. 'The
employees are victorious.' Moreover, the rise in unemployment, forecast to
exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year, will continue to provide fertile
ground for disputes.
But faced with a growing budget deficit - targeted at FFr317bn this year -
and the need to prepare public sector companies for privatisation, the
government urgently needs to improve the efficiency of state-owned industry.
It cannot afford to support loss-making state enterprises indefinitely.
Without substantial reform, including job cuts, it will also be difficult to
find buyers for the state's industrial assets.
The case of Air France, which is one of the 21 publicly owned groups slated
for sale, illustrates the difficulty in striking a balance. But there are
other cases too. The government is anxious to sell the loss-making Groupe
Bull as quickly as possible to ease the drain on public sector funds.
Earlier this month it was forced to inject FFr7bn into the group to cover
its accumulated losses. To restore the group to profitability, however, will
require cutting at least 2,500 jobs, according to industry observers.
For the moment, the government's dilemma is eased by the fact that the
groups which will begin the privatisation campaign are in relatively good
health. Banque Nationale de Paris was successfully sold earlier this month.
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas
group, which are next on the auction block, should also enjoy smooth sales.
But the scale of the problems at Air France, Groupe Bull and other public
sector groups such as Thomson-TCE, the consumer electronics group which is
also losing money, requires remedies to be implemented quickly.
Mr Balladur can take some solace from a number of encouraging factors. The
threat of industrial disputes is restricted largely to the public sector. Mr
Francois Perigot, head of the French employers' federation, points out that
the number of strikes in the private sector has fallen to the lowest level
since 1945.
Recent economic indicators have also suggested the end of recession, and
hence rising unemployment, could be in sight. Industrial production figures
released last week showed a rise of 1.3 per cent in July and August over
June, while housing starts in the third quarter increased by 8 per cent.
Last week's interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank allowed France to follow
suit.
Even with the government's optimistic scenario of a recovery from the fourth
quarter of this year and 1.4 per cent growth in gross domestic product next
year, however, the effect on unemployment will take time to feed through.
Economists in Paris estimate it will take two or three quarters after the
economy starts to recover before the rate of joblessness will stabilise.
Industry chiefs will continue to press for cuts in staff, and unions will
resist. Air France is unlikely to represent Mr Balladur's final journey to
the brink. On the evidence of that dispute, he seems unlikely to take the
bold steps required to withstand the threat from unions.

Kim Campbell's future may not lie in baseball, pace Observer's helpful
suggestion yesterday, but another woman apparently features on the shortlist
to take over as the sport's next commissioner. She is Lynn Martin, formerly
a Republican congresswoman from Illinois, George Bush's labour secretary
and, though now a university teacher, still a player in national politics.
She would certainly need all her political wits about her in a position that
has been vacant for over a year, since the owners of baseball's 28 teams
summarily dismissed Fay Vincent for being insufficiently solicitous
concerning their imperious wishes.
Most of those previously considered, as well as those still in the race,
have political backgrounds. George Bush and James Baker graciously declined
to apply, and so last week did George Mitchell, top Democrat in the US
Senate. But Paul Kirk, former national Democratic party chairman, and
Richard Thornburgh, ex-US attorney general, are still in there pitching.
Baseball has had some powerful, and wondrously named, commissioners over the
years - Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis, A B 'Happy' Chandler, Bowie Kuhn and
A Bartlett Giamatti, a former president of Yale.
The commissioner may get the best seats in the house, but he, or she, now
operates on the shortest of leashes from the owners, as Vincent, an
honourable man, discovered. In comparison, politics begins to look easy.

Joao Alves, the Brazilian federal deputy accused of masterminding a huge
corruption scheme in the government's budget, seems to be temporarily down
on his luck.
Giving evidence in front of a special inquiry into the scheme, he explained
how 'thanks to God' he had been fortunate with money since the late 1980s.
Not surprisingly, there was considerable interest as to how, as a poorly
paid congressman, he had built up a personal empire now worth an estimated
Dollars 5m, complete with luxury apartments, farms and even a rented Lear
jet.
Alves did have one explanation for all this good fortune - the local
lottery. In the past few years, the lottery company estimates he picked up
more than 200 big prizes. Unfortunately for Alves, this in itself may not
entirely convince his inquisitors in a country where lotteries are also
known to provide opportunities for money laundering.

Whatever is the significance of those two unfamiliar Asian businessmen who
appear in Midland Bank's brand new national advertising campaign?
'Shekor and Anil have a good business proposition. And we have a billion
pounds to lend,' boasts one of the many banks that has in the past been
criticised for throwing good money after bad. 'And we're lending some of
that money to Shekor and Anil. And it's not a mistake; we did say a
billion,' it rounds up, less than wholly clarifying the matter.
What the reader should have realised, it transpires after some considerable
research around the various divisions of Midland, is that Shekor and Anil
are 'real small businessmen' - owners of an Indian restaurant in London, as
it happens. And the bank has recently made available an extra billion pounds
to lend to just such small entrepreneurs.
But Stuart White, head of small business at Midland, has some sympathy with
the confusion generated.
'I'm a simple Yorkshireman; any ad I might write would never get past all
those creative types,' admits White, before adding that it was a mistake
that the 'mistake' bit was included in the final copy - accidentally left in
from a very early draft.

<TEXT>
Mikhail Poltoranin, head of Russia's Federal Information Service, says he
was never in favour of censorship. Yesterday, he was certainly giving pretty
free rein to his own version of what happened a month ago in Moscow.
Poltoranin claimed that he had known a day in advance that there was to be a
parliamentary rebellion. He therefore warned Victor Yerin, the interior
minister, to make sure that the television station was properly guarded. But
he was told, he says, not to worry: 'We've got our own disguised people
inside.'
Sure enough, the next day the rebels stormed the TV tower, in a battle which
cost several lives. They were 'provoked' into doing so by the fact that it
was not visibly defended, claims Poltoranin. And, he says, censorship was
imposed on the press afterwards in an attempt to suppress the truth about
the incompetence of the security forces.
Indeed, Poltoranin continued, he had seen a decree one week before the
rebellion, which planned for emergency rule and censorship, but had managed
to get the reference to censorship removed. When censorship was imposed
despite his heroic gesture, Poltoranin further claims that it was his
telephone calls that persuaded President Yeltsin to order its immediate
lifting.
Proof, if such were needed, that chaos rules at the top, and that
presidential rule gives the president's aides plenty of room to pass the
buck.
And what happened to Yerin the Unready? He was subsequently rewarded with a
medal making him a Hero of Russia.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Feudal system in the sky: The obstacles to restructuring and
profitability at the airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In putting off the radical restructuring of Air France, the French
government is taking an enormous gamble.
According to Mr Bernard Attali, who quit as chairman of Air France on
Sunday, the government has simply lost its nerve. The airline union had
strongly opposed Mr Attali's restructuring plan, involving 4,000 job cuts, a
reduction in routes and capacity, and the sale of non-core assets including
a stake in the Meridien hotel chain.
The survival of Air France is not at risk, so long as the French government
continues to see it as a strategic national asset. But its viability as a
profitable international airline is in the balance.
Lean and aggressive US carriers have whittled away at Air France's share of
the North Atlantic routes. Between 1991 and 1992, Air France increased its
north Atlantic capacity by 8 per cent. The US carriers increased theirs by
30 per cent. This is also evident in airline growth measured by revenue
passenger kilometres, the most common industry measure - the number of
fare-paying passengers multiplied by the number of kilometres flown.
European deregulation took off at the start of this year, giving carriers
new freedom to operate in other European countries. Lufthansa has launched a
low-wage-cost subsidiary for short-haul routes as part of a programme that
includes 8,000 job losses.
BA, too, pays lower wages on its BA regional operation which works out of
non-London UK airports. A year ago, it also took over the low-cost operation
of Gatwick-based Dan-Air, and has a stake in budget French carrier, TAT.
This shows up in productivity figures. Between 1988 and last year, Air
France's sales per employee rose 12 per cent to Dollars 168,000. At
Lufthansa, the rise was 22 per cent to Dollars 173,000; at BA, the increase
was 32 per cent to Dollars 190,000.
Mr Attali conceded two weeks ago Air France had been slow to address its
cost base - one of the heaviest in the industry. The risk was the airline
could be left behind when its main competitors were already well down the
road of restructuring and were showing improvements in profitability.
Even Lufthansa of Germany, with its own difficult labour situation, has won
important concessions from its union and is showing signs of improvement.
For Air France, the old 'fortress France' strategy is beginning to show deep
cracks. Government protection has been increasingly undermined by the global
nature of the airline business and the European Commission's resolve to open
up European skies and clamp down on state subsidies.
Air France has recently lobbied the EC's committee of 'wise men'
investigating the problems of the European airline industry, pleading for a
return to controls on capacity and fares and for EC funding for troubled
airlines.
This has been rejected, under pressure from a powerful lobby of more liberal
member states including the UK and the Netherlands. As Sir Colin Marshall,
BA's chairman, told the EC wise men, if an airline was unable to restructure
itself to become competitive it should be allowed to go out of business.
All airlines have been hit by overcapacity and prolonged recession. Air
France has been worse hit because the French market, now in deep recession,
accounts for about 40 per cent of its traffic.
Mr Attali's strategic acquisitions and marketing partnerships have
strengthened Air France's international reach. But underlying problems must
still be addressed. Apart from entrenched union opposition, it has lacked
strong management.
This reflects its political nature. Air France has been run more by civil
servants than by professional airline managers. Mr Attali was no exception.
He took over four years ago because he was strongly favoured by the Elysee
palace, where his brother, Mr Jacques Attali, had long been a close
confidant of President Mitterrand.
Air France has been a feudal barony, with management factions fighting each
other, with the sides being decided by political and civil service colours.
Mr Attali accepted the need for change, but attempted a delicate balance
between restructuring and maintaining the political consensus to enable him
to run the airline.
Market pressures forced him to act vigorously. Indeed, he claimed the
government had been closely consulted in his latest restructuring plan and
that he had its full backing until a few days ago. The risk now is that, as
the rest of the industry starts to recover, Air France will still be
shackled by its past and will fail to take advantage of the eventual
recovery cycle in the airline industry.
Even if the government is prepared to pay this price, it may find it
particularly difficult to continue supporting the airline when state aids
are coming under attack from Brussels and other big international carriers
are turning themselves into fitter competitors.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Hard choices for defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury over the size
of the British defence budget has become one of the predictable issues in
this autumn's public expenditure round. Whatever the short-term outcome of
this struggle, the absence of any prospect of war, and the pressure of
Britain's public spending problems combine to ensure that the defence budget
is bound to seem a tempting source of savings.
Under current plans the UK will spend around 3 per cent of gross domestic
product on defence in the late 1990s. This is less than the 5.3 per cent of
the mid-1980s, but more than most of Britain's European allies. But the
right level cannot be determined simply by this criterion or by comparison
with other public spending priorities.
Britain has a relatively impressive military capability and a military
record of which it can be proud. But it must now adapt to new circumstances.
Armed services have to plan, no longer against a known enemy, but against
the unpredictable. Nobody knows what or where the next 'threat' will be, its
size or direction, or its order of battle. This means the government has
more difficult choices than before about the kinds of forces it needs to
provide, and where.
National security
Clamorous warnings about the damage further cuts would cause are largely
unhelpful. The House of Commons defence committee has warned that military
capabilities could fall below the minimum level necessary for national
security and that, already, the navy could not protect the nation's
sea-lanes. But there is no conceivable direct outside threat to the UK that
would not involve its allies, and few tasks it would want to take on
overseas on its own.
What is needed is a clear foreign policy framework within which Britain's
defence commitments can be set. The Ministry of Defence, in its last white
paper in July, laid out 50 distinct tasks which the armed forces carried
out. The message it wanted to send to the Treasury was, first of all, that
the military often fulfils two or more tasks for the price of one and,
second, that there is no room for further cuts unless the government is
ready to drop some defence commitments.
The argument was disingenuous. In many cases, such as Britain's contribution
to Nato reaction forces, the actual requirement in terms of men and
equipment is not subject to any fixed measure. It is as much as you want to
make it.
More selective
Although the forces have undergone substantial cuts and reorganisation under
the 1990 Options for Change review, there has been no sacrifice in the range
of military capabilities provided. The challenge for military planners is
that they will have to more selective. While it may be possible to absorb
some short-term financial cuts through improved efficiency and cheeseparing,
there are hard choices that must be faced.
If Britain wants to keep its Royal Marines, for instance, there is little
point unless it provides the ships and helicopters they need. But that might
have to be at the cost of anti-submarine frigates. Modern attack helicopters
might be regarded as a higher priority for the army than tanks. But reducing
Britain's armoured presence in Germany could call into question its
leadership of Nato's new rapid-reaction corps.
With defence budgets being squeezed throughout the Nato region, the trend
must be towards a sharing of responsibilities between European allies. In so
far as this makes European defence efforts more effective, it could help to
encourage a con-tinued US commitment to the alliance.
In the very short term, the room for manoeuvre is limited. On new equipment
projects due for service in the next few years, much of the money has
already been spent or committed. The armed forces also have some
justification in asking for a breathing space after the upheaval of the
reductions which followed Options for Change. But it is not too early for
the government to provide a sense of direction, putting defence in the
context of a shared European discussion rather than a narrow domestic public
expenditure argument.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Leading Article: France's air of confusion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE overall economic scheme of things, the skirmishing over the future of
Air France between the French government, the company's management and its
workforce may seem of limited and local significance. Politically, however,
it represents a reversal of large and ominous proportions.
By climbing down under union pressure and scrapping the rationalisation plan
it had six months ago encouraged Air France management to adopt, the
government has not only demolished the position of the chairman, Mr Bernard
Attali. It has sent out the clearest possible signal of its own weakness in
the face of the multifarious special interests that recession and economic
restructuring have brought clamouring to its door. Those of France's
European partners who want the Community's industrial structures to continue
adapting to competition within and without, rather than retreating behind a
wall of subsidy and trade protection, have a right to be concerned.
That would be an excessively harsh judgment to hang on the events of the
last two days if the government's handling of Air France were the only sign
of its confusion. The trouble is that it is not. Over the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations, over economic and monetary policy and even
potentially over his programme to privatise state-owned industry, Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, looks increasingly adrift in a sea of
conflicting pressures and demands.
Hobson's choice
In this he is, of course, not exactly alone. All EC governments are
grappling to a greater or lesser extent with problems of rising
unemployment, uncompetitive industry, sluggish growth and high public sector
deficits. From Wolfsburg to Wolverhampton, companies and their workers are
having to look afresh at the structure and costs of labour, and politicians
are struggling to redefine the role of the state. In France, however, the
difficulties seem especially acute - in part because of the more prominent
role the state has traditionally played in the economy, but also in part as
a result of Mr Balladur's failure to explain the consequences of his own
policies.
On the Gatt, he has himself admitted the Hobson's choice he faces: between
the domestic crisis that would result from his accepting the terms likely to
be on offer from the EC and France's other trading partners, and the
international crisis that would ensue if he refused. But although this is a
dilemma in part of his own making, he has barely begun to point a way out of
it, or to tell protesting farmers that, Gatt or no Gatt, their industry is
in secular decline.
Job losses
On monetary policy, the government is still behaving as if the currency
crisis of this summer never happened. By failing to take advantage of its
new-found freedom to cut interest rates, it is prolonging and deepening the
recession - and fuelling the clamour against job losses. Over time, this
could seriously complicate the privatisation policy that has thus far been
the government's one big success, by preventing necessary restructuring at
such companies as Groupe Bull and Air France. Instead of decisively reducing
public ownership and increasing the ability of French industry to compete in
the European market, Mr Balladur may thus find himself endlessly juggling
demands for subsidies from badly managed state companies - and coming
increasingly into conflict with France's EC partners as a result.
That is why Air France is such an important test case. Until Sunday, the
government agreed that Mr Attali's painful restructuring programme was
'indispensable' if the airline was to be able to compete with other
streamlined carriers in the liberalised EC aviation market. Now it appears
to be suggesting that a softer option exists. Worse, Mr Balladur's
volte-face has merely encouraged public sector unions to try their luck
against other tough but necessary management decisions in future.
It is certainly true that decisions of this kind can only be implemented if
a political consensus can be mustered behind them. But by giving in on this
occasion, the government has not taken a step towards creating such a
consensus; it has merely postponed the evil day, and given encouragement to
those who urge the EC to turn away from the market.

FT  26 OCT 93 / No need to talk to IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It can go on like this. The campaign of violence generated by the
provisional wing of the IRA nearly a quarter of a century ago may continue
for as long again. Sir Pat-rick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said
in the Commons on Friday that the price of defending democracy and the rule
of law is always high, and always worth paying. 'We shall defend them in
Northern Ireland, if necessary at infinite length,' he insisted. The thought
is almost too awful to contemplate, particularly as we weep for the innocent
victims of the Saturday night bombing in the Shankill Road. Surely something
can be done?
Not much. Formulas for immediate peace depend on one of two unlikely
starting points. First, the IRA provisionals could unilaterally renounce
violence. The events of the past few days demonstrate their unreadiness to
do so. Alternatively, the British government could offer concessions and
negotiations in return for an undertaking to end the carnage. As Sir Patrick
intimated again yesterday, there is no question of such a deal.
The courageous Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party member
for Foyle, will not accept this impasse. He is to be given credit for his
motives, even if his hard work does not produce a successful result. He has
been talking to Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the IRA.
They appear to have been working on a delicate formula. Perhaps we should
see the full details before we judge it, but rejection is the likely
outcome. Any peace plan that involves formal negotiations with Mr Adams or
Sinn Fein ahead of a complete and unequivocal renunciation of the use of
terrorism as a political weapon will fail.
Some will protest that this is too inflexible a posture, that the situation
is so horrible that it requires an abandonment of previously entrenched
positions. The recent South African and Middle East breakthroughs are
seductive examples in support of such an argument. The case does not,
however, stand up to examination. It is true that President F W de Klerk
released Mr Nelson Mandela from prison and negotiated with him, even though
the ANC leader refused to disband his raggle-taggle and pathetically
ineffective army. But the IRA cannot rely on this analogy. Irish republicans
have the vote, both north and south. Mr Adams even won an election to the
Westminster Parliament. South Africa's blacks could not vote. They have not
yet done so.
Again, the Israeli government has recognised and dealt with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, after years of swearing that it would not. But its
overriding objective is survival. It has always seen its first duty as the
defence of Israel's existence against a host of external enemies. At the
time of the recent deal it had nowhere else to go. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
leader, was likewise in a corner. The other Arab states were not able to
represent the Palestinian interest in direct talks with Jerusalem.
Here it is different. Britain is not, and will not be, threatened with
obliteration by the IRA provisionals. No external enemies surround us. Sir
Patrick looks to constitutional talks to further the peace process. The
Anglo-Irish agreement provides for direct conversations between London,
Belfast and Dublin; he will pursue those.
Principles apart, there is no need to deal with the provos. Think about it.
There is no domestic political reason why the government should conclude a
peace agreement with Sinn Fein, let alone with its terrorist counterpart.
You might think that after 24 years of violent insurrection there would be a
swelling chorus in favour of compromise, of doing a deal, of getting out, of
ceasing hostilities at any price.
There is not. I recall a recent conversation with a senior minister. Our
starting point was the catalogue of IRA and 'loyalist' violence. Since 1969,
no fewer than 3,089 people have been killed by terrorists in Northern
Ireland alone. Some 2,156 of these were civilians. These figures include an
increasing number of murders by 'loyalist' paramilitary organisations.
Murders on the British mainland are becoming commonplace. To remind you of
just two - in Warrington in March an IRA bomb killed a three-year-old and a
12-year-old. This was part of a seemingly never-ending series of bombing
campaigns, some pre-Christmas, some for Christmas, some aimed at 'economic
targets'. The City of London has been sealed off since the summer; only
yesterday travellers inwards from the west were inconvenienced by bombs at
Reading and Basingstoke. Mr Tony Benn, relying on the House of Commons
research department, said on Friday that the total cost of the emergency
since 1969 was Pounds 14.5bn at current prices.
The senior minister pointed out that this unhappy story carries a strange
moral, namely that there has been no public demand for a change of
government policy. Mr Benn quoted opinion polls that suggest the opposite,
but these were even less convincing than usual. The postbags of members of
parliament are not stuffed with constituents' letters pleading for a deal
with the IRA. The troops-out movement appears to have faded away; yesterday
Labour was calling on the government to send more soldiers in. The British
people are almost absurdly stoical. They express horror at every new
outrage. They condemn, but offer no quarter to, the perpetrators. Each
additional inconvenience to the travelling or working public is bitterly
criticised, but rarely adduced as a reason for changing tack.
In sum, the political tide is against Mr Hume's plan. Mr John Major, who
does not enjoy a reputation for firmness, would be greatly damaged were he
to 'give in to the IRA'. That would be seen by the voters as losing a war,
something alien to the British psyche. The prime minister is aware of this.
He said at the recent Tory conference that 'no government which I lead will
negotiate with those who perpetrate or . . . support the use of violence'.
The Tories have restored their former name - the Conservative and Unionist
party - in recognition of the reality that Mr Major's government, which
commands a majority of just 17 with Conservatives alone, frequently has to
importune nine Ulster Unionists for support. Heaven knows what has been
promised in return, but we can be sure that a deal with the provos before
they lay down their arms is not part of it.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Salvage task for metal man: Japan's depressed electronics
groups are seeking high-tech saviours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, it was not unusual to spot in Tokyo's rubbish dumps
perfectly functioning TV sets or audio equipment, abandoned by their owners
to make room for the latest model.
Today, Japan's hard-pressed consumers are loath to throw away anything, let
alone buy another electronic gizmo for their small apartments. Yet the worst
recession in 20 years is only one of a daunting list of problems facing the
country's once world-beating consumer electronics groups.
Most of their main foreign markets are shrinking, at a time when the yen's
rise has hit their price competitiveness. The domestic market, once a
willing test-bed for new products, is saturated. In addition, the consumer
electronics giants are short of the imaginative new gadgets they badly need
to ensure future growth.
The impact of such pressures and shortcomings on consumer electronic sales
has been considerable. The Japanese market's total turnover has plunged by
23 per cent from a peak of Y2,150bn in 1988 to Y1,657bn last year. Last
month the mighty Matsushita warned that pre-tax profits for the year would
be 35 per cent less than earlier forecast. Today, the company, along with
Sharp, is likely to report lower profits for the past six months; Toshiba
and Hitachi should be in a similar position on Thursday.
While the problem of product saturation was countered by the rapid rise in
consumer spending of the late 1980s, recession has served to reveal the
glutted home market. According to the Electronics Industry Association of
Japan, 99 per cent of households have at least one colour TV; more than 75
per cent own a video-cassette recorder; and 54 per cent a compact disc
player. 'The era of continuing expansion is over,' mourns Mr Nobuyuki Idei,
a director of Sony.
When asset prices, particularly land, collapsed soon after the turn of the
decade, the knock-on effect was to make consumers more price conscious.
Consumer electronics companies were jolted by the realisation that they had
lost touch with what their customers wanted.
Nothing illustrates the giants' sleepiness more clearly than their failure
to spot the emergence of the video games market, where smaller, more
entrepreneurial companies, such as Nintendo and Sega, have achieved
dominance.
'Before we realised what was happening,' admits Sony's Mr Idei, 'the market
was dominated by Nintendo and it was very difficult to get in.'
Such strategic blindness has proved costly. The Japanese video games market
saw sales rise 13.5 per cent last year, while VCR sales fell 12 per cent,
according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Having missed out on the surge in video games, the pressure on consumer
electronics groups to find growth areas is intense. Many observers agree
that they need to look beyond traditional boundaries. 'We cannot rely on
consumer electronics alone,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president
of Matsushita.
For some, the answer has been to diversify into the entertainment industry.
Sony, Matsushita, JVC, the maker of audio and visual equipment, and Toshiba,
the broad-based electronics company, have all bought stakes in US
entertainment companies. Matsushita has invested in 3DO, a US start-up
company developing a three-dimensional games machine, while JVC has launched
a machine with Sega.
Another move has been to use digital technology, the basis for modern
computing and telecommunications, to open the door to a range of possible
new products. Compact discs are one example. Here, the boundaries are being
expanded as discs begin to carry video as well as audio entertainment.
The marriage of computer technology and telecommunications could form the
foundation for the growth business the consumer electronics industry is
seeking. The electronics industry association of Japan estimates that the
global market for such 'multimedia' products could eventually be worth
Y325,000bn a year. 'Multimedia will enter the home so consumer electronics
companies must participate in the market,' says Mr Murase.
But the way forward for digital technology has not yet been mapped out.
Exactly how companies will penetrate the home and workplace is a question Mr
Murase and his competitors are struggling to answer. 'The future of
multimedia is not yet clear,' he says.
The Japanese industry is still debating whether multimedia will take off as
a sophisticated video games machine, a communications tool for business
people, or a high-tech TV set that lets viewers communicate with each other.
One snag is that multimedia requires consumer electronics makers to venture
into areas where they have little experience. Japan's competitors,
particularly computer makers in the US, have greater expertise in digital
technology and many have already introduced multimedia computers which can
display videos, play music and send faxes. Companies in the US are also
ahead of Japanese companies in developing multimedia software. Microsoft,
the computer software company, recently launched a line of home business and
entertainment programmes under the Microsoft Home brand, which will target
the home computer user.
The Japanese have been forced to catch up by linking with US groups. Sony
and Matsushita have bought stakes in General Magic, an Apple subsidiary
developing communications software, and Matsushita has invested in EO,
another embryonic US company which is developing personal digital
communicators. 'As telecommunications and computers combine, the
relationship with the US becomes increasingly important,' says Mr Yoichi
Morishita, president of Matsushita.
It is clear that Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers will have to
rely on the expertise of video games makers, computer companies and software
developers in creating the vital partnerships that could herald future
growth for the industry. Even with the help of such partners, Matsushita and
its rivals will need skills far beyond their traditional business of making
electronic boxes.
The test of whether Japanese consumer electronics companies continue to lead
the world market into the next century is how they live up to this new and
unfamiliar role.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Size of UK theatrical business no
justification for subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Cameron Mackintosh (Personal View, October 14) protests too much
about the virtues of subsidies to the arts and the evil effects of their
reduction.
The size of the British theatrical business and the revenue earned from
subsidised productions are not justifications for subsidy. Every business in
Britain could claim that it would perform better if it had more aid from the
government: but who would then finance the subsidies? And experience of
other industries suggests that subsidies reduce rather than increase
efficiency - improvements in which are the source of economic growth. Any
economic benefits from the theatrical business are likely to be local;
theatres may attract visitors to one place rather than to another. That is
one reason why I suggest that any subsidies should result from local
decisions, not come from central government (Personal View, September 30).
It is not surprising that talented artists and entrepreneurs have gravitated
towards the cheapest and most abundant source of funds, the subsidised
sector, or that unsubsidised theatres show productions which have, to
varying degrees, had their costs reduced by subsidies. But it is improbable
that all the talent in the subsidised sector was drawn to the theatre by
subsidies, or that it would all leave the theatre if subsidies were
withdrawn.
The British theatre managed to attract quite a lot of talent before it first
received subsidies in the 1940s, and there is a much richer and
better-educated public to support it now. The present strength of the
British theatre must be at least partly attributable to this increasing
wealth and sophistication of its audience, which is also the strongest
guarantee of its future health. If educational standards and incomes
continue to rise, the market for the arts will continue to grow - and the
case for national subsidies will become progressively weaker. I believe that
the government should promote knowledge of the arts through the educational
system, so more people can appreciate them.
It is not just high-profile theatres that attract upper-class audiences, as
Mr Mackintosh suggested. A survey of audiences in Glasgow, Merseyside and
Ipswich in 1985 found that 73 per cent came from social groups A, B and C1,
although they formed about 33 per cent of the population.
A reduction in subsidies might reduce the profitability of new productions,
so their number and cost would be reduced, and producers would seek a larger
audience for each play. The earnings of those concerned with production
might fall; but their incomes do not deserve taxpayer support. Any reduction
in choice seems unlikely to reduce the audience significantly, because
theatre-goers on average attend only two or three performances a year. Loss
of national subsidies should not be the disaster Mr Mackintosh believes.

<TEXT>
Sir, Geoffrey Howe ('The triumph and tragedy of the Thatcher years', 23/24
October) includes as one of Margaret Thatcher's triumphs 'the remarkable

As one who chanced to start to draw a non-inflation-proofed pension in 1979,
I have often wondered if the pound has ever lost more of its value under any
other prime minister.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: At what cost new funds?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER MILNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Lapper's piece ('Back from the abyss', October 22) on the
arrival of corporate investors at Lloyd's gave some useful background for
potential new investors to bear in mind. The extent to which the new
corporate vehicles will be exposed to past losses seems unclear, which must
be a concern. The other fairly big reservation I would have is just how much
is going to be extracted in expenses before the investor receives his
return.
To the famed rapacity of those at Lloyd's, something now has to be added for
all those nice merchant banks and brokers, not known for undercharging, who
have suddenly become so enthusiastic about the new Lloyd's product. No doubt
all this will be clearly set out in the prospectuses.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Audi aluminium car a questionable
'Vorsprung'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTIAN ETZEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Griffiths (Technology: 'On the road to the future', October 22)
portrays the use of aluminium in the manufacture of cars as an innovation.
While this is true of the use of a space-frame in a high-volume car, other
carmakers such as Land Rover and Rolls-Royce have used aluminium for some
time.
What has made cars heavy over the years are safety features such as
anti-lock brakes, air bags and side-intrusion protection beams, as well as
the use of electric motors to power just about anything that moves, while
car bodies have increased comparatively little in weight.
The argument that aluminium bodies will last much longer than their steel
counterparts is certainly valid - witness the longevity of Land Rovers - but
Audi body shells already outlast the mechanical components. Is Audi
addressing a problem that does not really exist? Higher manufacturing costs
and presumably a higher purchase price will also affect insurance premiums.
A car requiring such complex production is likely to require complex
repairs. Aluminium body panels are usually replaced rather than repaired.
While the ASF Audi is an interesting experiment, it does give the impression
that Audi is rather desperate to upstage its technological feats of the
1980s - the low drag Audi 100, the five-cylinder engine and the Quattro - at
any cost. But is it a real 'Vorsprung' that will put cash in Audi's till?

FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: BR privatisation bid essential to
send 'message of hope'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms RUTH EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Right lines for rail privatisation' (October 22),
argues that British Rail should not be allowed to bid against commercial
operators to run train services on the grounds that BR could win most of the
franchises by cross-subsidising its bids in order to fend off competition.
The National Consumer Council cannot agree with this. If the intention of
the government's rail privatisation programme is to lead to improved rail
services, then BR must be allowed to bid.
This would send a message of hope to the many thousands of disenchanted rail
users up and down the country, by letting them know that the government is
serious about achieving this aim. It can only be to the consumer's advantage
if BR's services are forced to meet the rigorous standards of service set
down by the new franchise authority.
We can envisage no better discipline for BR than for it to be subject to
these controls over fare and service levels. Quite simply, if BR did not
provide value for money it would lose the franchise.
The alternative is to leave BR to run the services that nobody else wants to
run. Our National Consumer Council's concern is that, all too soon, this
could lead to a two-tier rail service, in which BR becomes a provider of
last resort, rail fares climb higher still, and rail passengers are the
losers.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A test for unit trust managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LANDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex makes the point that some unit trust managers are against the
Securities and Investments Board proposals, because it would be 'more
difficult for them to make profits by holding units on their own account
ready for resale' ('Unit trusts', October 22).
Somewhat similar behaviour by stockbrokers and traders has been punished
severely by stock exchanges everywhere.
Could you publish a list of unit trusts which do not engage in this practice
and also an interview with a fund manager who does? The interview should
give him the opportunity to explain how he keeps the investors' interest
paramount, and he may also tell us what happens to the units he has bought
when the market takes a sudden fall.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Waiting for the final resolution in residence - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all our larger public institutions, the National Gallery was the first,
some 15 years ago, to make a studio available on the premises and to invite
a particular artist to take up residence. The scheme excited controversy at
the time, though quite why seems hard to fathom now. What did mere artists,
those rude mechanicals, have to do with the old masters, that they should
have such privileged access to the collect-ions?
In practice it proved itself almost at once. Artists have always plundered
the art of the past for their own reasons. In introducing the current show
of the works of Ken Kiff, the latest to emerge from the scheme, the director
of the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor, admits as much: 'They have a double
power. They are the exploration of an autonomous vision, entire in itself.
But. . . they are at the same time a revisiting of a painted world which I
thought I knew and which I now see to be even richer than I had guessed.'
But the scheme has changed its spots over the years. So rich and yet so
various is the feast afforded by the collections that a certain maturity is
required to digest it. From being an annual residency open to competitive
application and immediately attractive to younger artists as an early step
up in their careers, it has now become a matter of direct appointment as
Associate Artist.
Ken Kiff has been thus in post for about 18 months, in which time he has
come to work at the studio provided at the National Gallery more or less
full-time. He is now 58 and for these dozen years past has been showing his
work, on his own and in mixed company, with increasing prominence and
regularity. Even so, he is not yet so prominent as all that. In a sense he
is still a private artist, a painter's painter, a well-kept secret.
The work is intensely personal, quite as much in its physical and practical
aspects, with its saturated colour and impulsive, sensual working of the
paint, as in any of its imagery. And that imagery is fraught with reference
and symbol, at once overt and yet densely ambiguous and private, funny yet
frightening, erotic yet innocent. He knowingly embraces the full scope of
the surreal and symbolist tradition at its most sophisticated, from Duccio
to Pisanello, Patenier and Bosch, to Goya, Blake and Moreau, to Klee, Miro
and Picasso. Yet he remains curiously and touchingly himself.
He has produced a mass of work, much of it unfinished and more to come. The
final resolution can wait, for it will come. He has spent much time
exploring the collections, from Filippo Lippi and Masaccio to Monet and Van
Gogh. But in his work he has naturally, been drawn to the masters of magic
and miracle, and in particular to the iconography of the Renaissance.
His is the narrative world of the predella, the altar-piece and the
morality, the lives of the saints, the deaths of the martyrs, the Garden of
Eden. The sun flowers in the sky, the snake which slips through the grass,
the girl in the pool. And while these things remain unmistakably the product
of Kiff's personal vision and elegant hand, we find ourselves, with Neil
MacGregor, looking again at Bellini's monks slaughtered in the wood, or
Pisanello's Holy Vision of St Eustace.
It is to Ken Kiff that we may well ascribe Baudelaire's 'impeccable
naivete', the quality that by coincidence is cited as epigraph in the
catalogue to the show of recent work by Howard Hodgkin. Many things he may
be, and the most knowing and calculating of colourists: but Hodgkin naive?
Never.
He is an abstract artist in the older and truer sense, moving from
particular reference of place or person to its more generalised evocation by
association, mood or trick of memory. The achievement is reductive in terms
of imagery and the broad simplicity of the final sweeps of paint, cumulative
in terms of the actual overlaying of paint. He has a seductive command of
his material, most especially so the smaller the scale, to which he brings a
visual concentration and intensity.
But now he has begun to move the other way, making paintings that are not
exactly vast but are certainly very large for him. And what is lost in
concentration is hardly made up by size and weight alone, or at least not
yet. The paint seems thinner, the single sweep of the house-painter's brush,
that in the smaller works appears so magisterial, seems now stretched, less
certain and assured with more space to animate. But then again, it is only
the pointless experiment that is ever vitiated by failure. We shall see.
Ken Kiff at the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square SW1, until January 9.
Howard Hodgkin, Anthony d'Offay Gallery, Dering Street W1, until November
24.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Marching to a different drummer - Royal Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to know what to make of the programme with that the Royal
Ballet opened its Opera House season on Saturday night. Advertised as
'White-hot and different' - a catch-penny phrase which makes no sense - it
offers new works by apprentice choreographers Matthew Hart and William
Tuckett, a third-hand exercise in kick-boxing by William Forsythe, and a
revival of Kenneth MacMillan's Different Drummer.
Were this ill-formed bill the precursor of a season of novelties, of fresh
thinking, it might be seen as an artistic card boldly played. Not so. The
Royal Ballet promises the return of last season's turkeys: the leaden Don
Quixote; Glen Tetley's turgid La Ronde; the traducing of Ashton's film
choreography for Beatrix Potter - and such rarities as Cinderella, The
Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet.
Our national ballet has a duty to find its choreographers, and the evening
acknowledges that fact. I doubt if the grand arena of Covent Garden is the
place in which they should first seek to prove themselves. Matthew Hart,
while still a student, made dances of promise. He is young - only two years
in the company - and he has created one professional work, with Birmingham
Royal Ballet.
For Fanfare, his Opera House debut, he has been given a new score by Brian
Elias and design by Yolanda Sonnabend. Wisely, he has opted for a small cast
of three couples, and sought to expose something of their physical
identities in a series of entries which have an ambiguous emotional air. Yet
he has not really mastered his score, which is bold, clangorous with bells,
richly varied in texture; nor his designs, which are opulently coloured
gauzes and rather too exotic for the dance.
That Hart has talent, I do not doubt. Invention is fluent, and he moves his
cast easily about the stage, though inconclusive hints of drama are more a
tease than a flavour. But he needs experience on smaller stages, under less
tremendous circumstances.
Had I a wish for him, it is that he join the Birmingham troupe, and make a
succession of ballets there - learning, creating, over a period of years,
just as MacMillan, Cranko, and Bintley got to grips with their craft. Hart
is too valuable to be sacrificed to the exigencies and tensions of Covent
Garden before he has proved his metier.
William Tuckett's If This is Still a Problem is its own problem. Tuckett -
as we have seen in ballets made for Birmingham and at Covent Garden - is
concerned with dance as exploration of emotional states. His pieces are
patently sincere, but they come burdened with too many private messages, and
not enough technical mastery. It was less than wise to impose his danced
anxieties on the perfections of Ravel's piano trio. Twelve dancers, looking
confused and at less than their best, drifted and rushed through the
knee-high 'angst', the girls in pallid long frocks and bathing caps, the men
in basic tights.
Andy Klunder's design appeared a bland variation on his Gloria setting.
There were fraught moments when I feared we might be trapped in a 'buddy
ballet' - chap to chap, as it were. Nothing happened. Tuckett can do better
than this, and the Royal Ballet should concern itself with guiding him.
About Herman Schmerman, the Forsythe acquisition, I report that it was first
staged for New York City Ballet in 1992, then mounted in Frankfurt on
Forsythe's troupe. The accompaniment is, unsurprisingly, more borborygms
from Thom Willems' central heating system. The first part comprises
exercises for three girls and two men; the second part is an apache duet for
Sylvie Guillem and Adam Cooper. The opening is unenterprising. The cast
build brief, awkward blocks of classical steps, then lope away like athletes
after a race. The text is fragmented, with movement given the occasional
vicious kick - something from 'Mugging for beginners'. It is dull, disjunct
stuff, where quick, distorting shafts of energy do the work of dance
invention. The lovely girls, bare-legged and lit from above, are turned into
advertisements for cellulitis.
The duet for Guillem and Cooper is more interesting. It proposes partnering
as sparring, feeding upon Guillem's extraordinary looseness at the hip, so
that steps rotate and reverse and turn in upon themselves. Cooper, dancing
and projecting a character with fine assurance, is her match. It is
unrelenting - albeit given savour by Guillem's extraordinary physique and
Cooper's tough response to her - and arid, because mechanistic. With lesser
artists it would be unbearable.
The revival of Different Drummer makes the evening worthwhile. MacMillan's
exposure of Woyzeck's soul was created a decade ago. Its return, in the
version he revised for the Berlin Ballet, reasserts the piece's importance
as a brave expressionistic study. With Irek Mukhamedov as Woyzeck, the title
role receives ideal interpretation. Here is Buchner's dumb-ox hero,
brutalised, exploited, maddened. And, as Mukhamedov shows us, almost holy in
his innocence. It is a frighteningly true, heart-tearing (and technically
staggering) portrayal by a great dance artist. The other players - David
Drew as the Captain, Adam Cooper as the Drum Major, Luke Heydon as Andres,
Iain Webb as the doctor - are very fine. I thought Vivana Durante's Marie
something too conscious - even too intelligent - though the role is
excellently danced. The ballet is searing. Mukhamedov must be seen in it.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Old hippie cool - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jackson Browne made a rare visit to London at the weekend: when a man's got
a new album to promote, no sacrifice is too great.
In a way he has always been a distant voice rather than a solid body - the
voice that spoke for a generation of soulful romantic 1970s students who
indulged their broken hearts and painful ideals by listening to his songs of
tortured relationships and fractured hopes. No handsome, intelligent,
sensitive millionaire can have suffered so much at the hands of women.
For someone roughly handled by fate, and whose body has been rigorously
exposed to the Californian drug culture, Browne looks in remarkably good
shape: much better than his audience. The lank of bonny brown hair still
sets off a sensitive, slightly hungry looking face; the voice remains high
and yearning; the band is as accomplished as only a West Coast folk-rock
combo can be.
And the new songs, generously aired at the Cambridge Theatre, London,
suggest Browne still has trouble with women, is still searching for personal
fulfilment in a better world. But 'My Problem is You' and 'I Hear Your Heart
Beating Everywhere' have a softer, almost Fleetwood Mac-ish undertone: it is
the laid back sound of California, the legacy of old hippie cool. Browne is
not so pitiful now.
Indeed some of my favourite Browne songs of the past, guaranteed sobbers
like 'Here Come Those Tears Again' and 'Fountains of Sorrow', were squeezed
out of the programme. This was an up-beat Browne, glad to be here and intent
on putting on a professional show for the BBC, which was recording the
concert. This meant that the tricky vibrato at the end of 'Linda Paloma' had
to be repeated to make sure the note was hit. Browne was a bit fussy
generally, although he still managed to drawl away down conversational side
roads.
Browne has promised a quick return visit. It is needed. This was a pleasant
evening, but while he may have outgrown some of the great emotional ballads,
for his fans the old days were still probably the best days. Some of the
memory jerkers were performed. 'The Pretender' now sounds pretentious but
'Before the Deluge' powerfully evokes the fears of those dear dead days, and
'Running on Empty' is now a classic rock standard.
No one was better at stretching clever metaphors over long pounding chords
to voice the preoccupations of an era. Musically Browne has progressed
little: this concert could have been preserved in aspic from two decades
ago. But he now enjoys the carapace of a survivor, and has gone gentle.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: She Stoops to Conquer - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer entered the first division of
English comedy when it was originally performed in 1773 and has stayed there
ever since.
In its new outing, directed by Sir Peter Hall at The Queen's, it is playing
at the very top, along with the best productions you can remember of (say)
The Importance of Being Earnest or A Midsummer Night's Dream. The subtitle
is The Mistakes of a Night which must have been picked up from Shakespeare,
and Wilde plainly learned from it.
The play's strengths are its dialogue, its characters, and to some extent
even its plot: in short, everything that you could ask for.
Scarcely a word is wasted and it is remarkable how many of its lines remain
colloquial to this day: 'This is Liberty Hall', for example.
Goldsmith also had a wonderful way with names: not only Tony Lumpkin, the
young bumpkin of a squire, but also Diggory, the man taken in from the barn
to serve in the house.
In Hall's production there are at least three characters who are
outstandingly drawn. Joint top are quite exceptional performances by Tom
Beard as Marlowe and Emily Morgan as Kate Hardcastle. Marlowe is the
well-bred man who has a way with women provided they come from beneath the
stairs, but lapses into a Feydeau-like stammer when confronted by a girl of
his own class. Beard plays him as if he is the star of the show, which
perhaps he is.
Even Beard, however, would not be so good without Ms Morgan beside him. Her
Kate is the reverse of Marlowe; she can't win him as her real self, so
pretends to be the maid. Scenes of mistaken identity are frequent,
hilarious, and exquisitely timed.
It may seem odd to concentrate on that pair when Donald Sinden is also in
the cast, yet he seems happy enough to take a slightly secondary role in
such company.
As Hardcastle, the genial father of Kate, he has a little trouble with his
wig; in the second act it fell off. But it is a pleasure to hear his plummy
voice again and to watch his magnificent stage presence.
'I love everything that's old,' he says, 'old friends, old times, old
manners, old books, old wine.' And, in this performance, that's the way it
is.
There is a special delight towards the end when the late entrant, Sir
Charles Marlowe, is played by Donald's brother, Leon. Watch them looking out
from behind the screen together. Every theatrical device is there.

Viewpoint 93: Saddam's Killing Fields (ITV, 11.20) is a sickening account of
the sufferings of the marsh dwellers of Iraq. No one who has read Wilfred
Thesiger can forget his evocation of the riverine culture of the marsh
Arabs. Now these inhabitants of the original Garden of Eden inhabit a
Gehenna of poisoned water, rocket attacks, and land fast being turned into
an arid waste by Saddam's drainage project.
Documentary-maker Michael Woods excoriates the US for abetting suppression
of the revolt of the southern Shia in 1991. The ghastly reprisals are
described with the help of smuggled video film and interviews with refugees
in Kurdistan. There is harrowing footage of the last minutes of Kerbala.
Given how little information is leaked out of southern Iraq, it is
unfortunate that this important film is screened so late.
Omnibus: Houdini (BBC1, 10.20) is a life of the legendary escapologist,
presented with charm and wit. Some delightful characters are interviewed on
family memories of Houdini, born Eric Weiss of Milwaukee, son of a hopeless
Hungarian rabbi.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: An end to the battle of forms - A H
Hermann examines a set of terms to help standardise domestic and
international trade contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When businesses enter into contracts for the supply of goods, there are two
dangers to avoid: either too little legal input, or too much of it and of
the wrong type.
The first danger looms whenever the deal is made by word of mouth or by a
short letter, such as: 'Ship 100 units as last time'. If it comes to a
dispute, it will be a veritable feast for lawyers, particularly when the
contract is governed by a non-codified law, such as English law.
The second danger, too much law of the wrong type, takes two forms.
One is an antique, standard contract of the respective market, such as the
charter party, about which the courts have been complaining in vain for 100
years, to which shipping lawyers retort: 'What would we do if it was all
clear and certain?'
The second form of too much law of the wrong type appears in the small print
on the back of the form used by the other party for ordering goods or
confirming orders.
These sale or purchase 'conditions', often long and drafted in legalese
which few businessmen have the patience to read, can sometimes be summed up
in one sentence: 'We have all the rights and you have none.'
A particularly nasty mess results if both parties use their own pre-printed
forms, one for the order, the other for its confirmation.
This can lead to a 'battle of forms', and when the forms differ
substantially, the court may find that there is no contract at all.
A set of International Trade Terms (Intraterms), produced at the Centre for
Commercial Law Studies of the Queen Mary and Westfield College in the
University of London, aims at avoiding, or at least substantially reducing
these dangers as well as some new ones resulting from the adoption by 34
countries, including the UK's main trading partners, of the UN Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention).
Though designed primarily for application by reference to contracts for
international sale of goods, Intraterms are equally suitable for domestic
contracts with the exception of consumer sales.
If used by both contracting parties, they can form the basis of a continuous
trading relationship where individual deals are concluded over the telephone
or by a short letter.
Alternatively, they can be used selectively, for drafting a contract with
the help of computer software supplied with the book which also contains a
running commentary relating the terms to the national laws of the main
trading nations and to the Vienna Con-vention.
The Intraterms incorporate into a contract many of the improvements to
English law which have been for some time advocated by English judges or
academic lawyers.
In the first place, they require interpretation and performance according to
the principle of 'good faith and fair dealing', which in its generalised
form is absent from English commercial law, but which, nonetheless, English
commercial judges try to substitute by a variety of devices.
That they do not always succeed is evidenced by the many judgments
introduced with the ominous phrase: 'With the greatest regret, I must hold
that . . .'
While English courts are only slowly moving away from the 'parole rule'
which excluded evidence of statements not contained in the written document,
the Intraterms prefer an interpretation which makes the contract effective
and the result reasonable and which takes negotiations preceding the
conclusion of the contract into account.
While English law treats the post office as the agent of the addressee, the
Intraterms reduce his exposure by requiring the receipt of communications to
be confirmed and limit the adverse consequences for the parties of delayed
or distorted communications.
English commercial law accepts that a change in circumstances may frustrate
a contract but the success of such claims is very difficult to predict.
Various theories enable the court to consider whether the parties made the
bargain on the assumption that a particular state of things will continue to
exist.
The element of uncertainty is further increased by the assumption that in
such cases the discharge of the contract occurs not by an act of the parties
but by the operation of law.
By contrast, Intraterms do not rely on an automatic operation of the law,
but give the parties the possibility of discharging the contract by a notice
if its purpose can no longer be achieved.
The inclusion in the Intraterms of clearly defined rules concerning force
majeure is of particular importance because such rules do not exist in
English commercial law. Moreover, the Intraterms also provide detailed rules
for a fair apportioning of loss caused by frustration of the contract or
force majeure.
No less important are rules assuring the survival of contracts which provide
that 'price is to be agreed' and rules protecting the debtor who made an
agreed part payment in full settlement from further claims.
Both parties are assured contractual interest on overdue debts and the buyer
is protected against the consequences of the House of Lords 1982 decision in
'The Chicuma' case where it was held that payment made on the agreed day to
the creditor's bank was not made on time if the bank credited it, according
to continental custom, with 'valuta next Monday'.
The Intraterms are also aimed at protecting the seller against the
anticipated insolvency of the buyer - an issue which, according to the law
lord, Lord Mustill, has been exposed to almost every conceivable error by
the courts and for which there are no generally accepted principles for the
courts to follow.
Other controversial or unclear issues with which the Intraterms deal are
fundamental breach, reservation of title, passage of risk and claims against
the carrier, the merchantability and fitness for purpose of goods, indirect
damages, and buyers lien in prepaid but rejected goods.
The chapter on resolution of disputes provides for alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) and more flexible, faster and cheaper arbitration, in line
with the thinking of the Department of Trade and Industry committee now
considering this subject.

Westfield College, can be obtained from Kluwer Academic Publishers,

FT  26 OCT 93 / Technology: Contest for an industry's future - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ALDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spectacle of the French Minister of Industry, Gerard Longuet, hawking
round the chairmanship of Groupe Bull, with few takers, as he wrestles with
the restructuring of the computer concern is highly diverting - in more
senses than one.
For while the EC Commission concentrates on the aid being offered, the real
contest for the future of the computing industry is being fought elsewhere.
Europe is not even in the game.
The US, however, plays to win. Faltering giants such as IBM, Unisys, Digital
and Wang are left to find their own salvation. In the country that sets the
agenda for information technology - for users and providers - action is
centred on establishing leadership in new techniques for computing.
In the vanguard of such action was the Defence Advanced Research Projects
Agency, set up in the Sputnik era of the 1950s. DARPA instigated a strategic
computing programme in the early 1980s that helped supply users with new
parallel processing systems, including 68 from two vendors, Intel and
Thinking Machines, in a programme now running at Dollars 120m (Pounds 82m) a
year.
Such single-minded concentration of this largesse on just two suppliers
irked the powerful House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services,
which instigated a General Accounting Office enquiry.
Its May 1993 report criticised the way the programme had been run,
especially its hardware procurement, but not its goals. The director of the
programme was removed, the largesse spread and the programme continued.
Congress had also joined the action and passed a High-Performance Computing
Act in 1991, raising the budget (including software and computer networking)
by 68 per cent to Dollars 3bn over five years. The act co-ordinates 10
agencies, including DARPA - now renamed ARPA to emphasise its refocus on a
dual-use technology role - in a programme that disbursed Dollars 796m in
fiscal 1993 on R&amp;D in high-performance computing.
By the summer of 1993 it had funded 30 significant systems, this time
including each of the leading companies in the industry. No foreign-owned
suppliers were included, hardly surprising since any contract that does not
comply with the Buy America Act must be reported to Congress.
Where high-performance computing goes today, so commercial computing goes
tomorrow. In July, a Congressional committee lifted the sum by a further
Dollars 200m a year and widened the scope to include commercial
applica-tions.
Policymakers in Brussels are well aware that the issue matters.
One Commission official has estimated that Brussels allocates Dollars 15m a
year on activities comparable to those on which the US spends Dollars 796m.
In 1991, Brussels produced a discussion document on IT. This stressed the
'enabling' nature of these IT industries, now involved in virtually all
economic activities, and their external impact on the EC economies as a
whole, already representing 5 per cent of GDP directly and set to approach
10 per cent by 2000.
The role of parallel processing in computing was recognised as an
opportunity to improve Europe's status quo. But the EC also noted that
European purchasers of advanced computer systems tend to turn to US
suppliers which, thanks to their government's intervention, are larger and
have more users than their European counterparts.
The latest example was announced last Friday, when it was revealed the
European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was acquiring the Cray
Research T3D parallel system - without even going out to tender.
As Paris and Brussels wrestle with Groupe Bull, therefore, the sound and
fury will signify little unless some thought is spared for the consequences
of the next generation of computing being abandoned to the US.

computing company.

European Law

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Community rules prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality apply
to intellectual property rights, according to a judgment last week from the
European Court of Justice in two cases involving British pop singers Phil
Collins and Cliff Richard.
The cases, which were heard together, were both referred from German courts
on the issue of the compatibility of certain provisions of German copyright
law with European Community law. The domestic provisions in question gave
protection against unlicensed distribution of the work, including
performances, of any German artist. The protection of performance work was
guaranteed irrespective of the place of the performance. However, protection
of performance work for non-German artists was limited to those performances
on German territory.
Mr Collins's case concerned the recording without his consent of a concert
in the US in 1983. Mr Collins sought to have the distribution of the
'bootleg' record in Germany stopped.
Mr Richard's case related to the sale in Germany of some of his work
performed in the UK between 1958 and 1959. The German exclusive distributor
brought an action in Germany against the defendant company, which allegedly
had distributed records containing some of the relevant performance work in
breach of the former's exclusive rights.
In both cases, the question of the compatibility of the German legislation
with EC law arose, and was referred to the European Court of Justice.
The Court first dealt with the issue of whether the provisions of the Rome
Treaty prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality applied to
copyright and neighbouring rights. It found that copyright included economic
rights, notably the right to exploit commercially the marketing of the
protected work, particularly in the form of licences granted in return for
the payment of royalties. The exploitation of a copyright therefore could
constitute both a source of remuneration for the owner and a form of
marketing control.
It followed that, as with other industrial or commercial property rights,
copyright was capable of affecting the flow of goods and services as well as
competition within the Community. It was for this reason that the Court had
previously held that such rights, although determined by national
provisions, were nonetheless bound by the Rome Treaty provisions. Given
this, copyright and neighbouring rights were thus bound by, inter alia, the
prohibition against discrimination on grounds of nationality contained in
the Rome Treaty.
The Court then dealt with the issue of whether provisions such as those
contained in German law were contrary to the Rome Treaty provisions on
non-discrimination. The argument raised by the defending parties was that
discrimination between German and non-German artists was justified by the
differences which existed between the national law of member states, and by
the fact that not all states had adhered to the 1961 Rome convention which
protected the rights of performing artists.
The Court reiterated that the Rome Treaty provisions on non-discrimination
were not concerned with those disparities in treatment or distortions that
arose from divergences between the laws of member states, so long as these
differences affected all persons subject to them in accordance with
objective criteria and without regard to nationality. This was not the case
here.
The Rome Treaty provisions required that persons in a situation governed by
EC law should be placed on an equal footing with nationals of the member
state in question. The principle of non-discrimination therefore precluded a
state from making the grant of a right subject to the condition of being a
national of that state.
The Court finally held that the Rome Treaty provisions on non-discrimination
were of direct effect and could thus be invoked before the national courts
in cases such as these.

This month, the European parliament welcomed Europe's scientific and
industrial elite to a two-day 'science summit' in Brussels. At the end of
November, the European Community will sponsor a week of 'scientific culture'
in an attempt to improve the general understanding of science and technology
through a series of conferences, competitions, open days and exhibitions
across Europe.
Meanwhile, in a somewhat less celebratory atmosphere, EC research ministers
are trying to decide on the size and shape of the next five-year 'framework'
programme of EC-funded research and technological development, to run from
1994 to 1998.
The framework programme is the EC's fourth since 1984, and the European
Commission's proposal for Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10.2bn) of funding makes it look
like the biggest so far. The 1990-94 framework programme - which will
overlap its successor - was worth Ecu6.6bn. But appearances are misleading:
R&amp;D spending remains pegged at about 4 per cent of the overall EC budget.
The Commission may have to struggle to prevent member states from chipping
away still further at that figure. When EC research ministers met in
Luxembourg recently for their first substantive discussion of the
Commission's plans, nine member states backed a figure of Ecu13.1bn. But the
Community's three largest paymasters - Britain, France and Germany - said it
should be reduced by Ecu1bn or more. The proposals require the unanimous
approval of the 12 member states.
Antonio Ruberti, an engineer by training and former Italian minister for
research and university affairs, took over responsibility for the EC
programme of science, research and development at the beginning of the year
with a two-year mandate. He wants to move quickly, but so far is clearly
frustrated by the apparent contradiction between member states' desire to
improve economic performance and their grudging attitude towards research
spending.
'When it comes to earmarking resources to be devoted to research in
individual member states and in the Community, all sorts of difficulties
arise which are not consistent with statements of principle as to the
strategic role of research,' he told a Brussels press conference.
Part of the problem is that some governments still have lingering doubts
about the value of the EC's framework programme. After nearly a decade,
critical observers are bound to ask why a programme aimed at improving the
performance of EC industry against US and Japanese competition has not given
the Community more of a competitive edge.
Large projects such as Esprit, the EC's flagship information technology
programme, are criticised for their lack of commercial impact, while
industrialists complain that Brussels spurns market-oriented projects for
fear of distorting competition. 'You can't at the same time want to increase
competitiveness and say that any project which by some misfortune leads to
an industrial application can't be financed,' argues Viscount Davignon,
chairman of Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, at
the science summit.
These criticisms are not entirely fair. The framework programmes account for
only a tiny proportion of overall research spending in the EC, so Community
officials argue that some blame for a technological deficit should be laid
at the door of member states and companies. Moreover, the Community is
supposed to concentrate on basic research; a separate pan-European
programme, Eureka, exists to help companies collaborate on projects with
direct market applications. There are also notable exceptions to the
over-simplified claim that EC-funded research rarely leads anywhere: ICL's
launch earlier this week of an advanced computer system, partly based on
technology developed under Esprit, was one of them.
Nonetheless, Ruberti is on his mettle to produce a fourth framework
programme which answers some of the main questions raised by past
programmes.
To do so, he has decided to concentrate resources on fewer areas, promoting
so-called 'generic' technologies which will benefit a range of different
industries and serve wider EC objectives such as economic integration,
employment, environment and infrastructure improvements.
A Commission working document outlining the possible contents of the
Ecu13.1bn programme says that projects for the next five years should
respond to the 'real needs' of technology consumers.
For example, information technology and communications would still represent
more than a third of the Commission's proposed research budget, but Esprit
would lose its current high profile and its name. IT projects would have
broader applications, linked more closely to market needs.
The Commission has high hopes, for example, that the EC can gain a lead over
Japan and the US in the development of tiny, intelligent machines known as
microsystems with uses from medical diagnosis to cable maintenance. A
network of some 120 research bodies and companies, mainly small or
medium-sized, was set up under the third framework programme and is already
discussing what may be required. Under the fourth framework programme,
specific proposals for basic research will be considered for funding.
Similarly, in the field of industrial technologies, which would take up 16.5
per cent of the proposed budget, the Commission hopes the EC will fund
technologies which might help equip the 'factory of the future', while the
Ecu1.32bn channelled towards 'life sciences' would focus on the use of
biomedicines in the fight against Aids.
A further Ecu530m will be devoted specifically to disseminating and
exploiting the results of research projects, so that EC companies actually
benefit from Community-funded innovation. A special effort will also be made
to co-ordinate Community and national R&amp;D strategies, helping to end the
framework programme's reputation as an unlucky '13th' research effort.
The speed with which the Commission has produced these outline proposals has
a political purpose. Following ratification of the Maastricht treaty, the
fourth framework programme will be one of the first Commission proposals
subject to a new and complex legislative procedure involving consultations
between European parliament, ministers and Commission. If, as seems
possible, ministers and Euro-MPs disagree on the size of the research
programme, then there is a risk that implementation will be delayed. 'This
(working document) is so that nobody can say that the Commission has not
made its suggestions and ideas clear,' explains one Brussels official.
What is already clear from the Commission plans is that Ruberti wants to
avoid the same traps as his predecessors. Whether he succeeds may not be
apparent until long after his 24-month mandate expires - and a great deal of
EC money has been spent. Member states will have to decide, probably before
the end of this year, how much cash they are prepared to risk to carry out
those ambitions.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Technology: Meter readers go remote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days of the peripatetic meter reader could soon be numbered in Britain
as new technologies are developed to take readings remotely and dispense
with the human eye.
Instead of utility officials having to enter homes, factories and offices to
measure the amount of water, gas or electricity used, future readings could
be taken from moving vehicles through low-power radios from transmission
devices on the meters.
Meters could also be read down the mains electricity network, with
information sent back to users, if necessary, about new charges or rates of
consumption.
At present, these technologies are still in the trial stage, the main
interest being shown by the water industry.
Aid-Call, which makes medical alarms for the aged, will start installing its
meter-reading devices later this year for tests. In the US, remote meter
reading is common. But Terry Giles, Aid-Call's technical director, says
tougher UK and continental European regulations and the use of different
frequencies for meter-reading radios than in the US means different
equipment is needed.
Aid-Call, part of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the big French water and
communications concern, has spent three years developing its product, called
Ramar. It uses transponders to obtain the readings through low-power radio.
Giles says remote metering technology needs to be cheap since so many
devices have to be installed. Ramar has just gone into partnership with Kent
Meters, which makes more than 7m meters a year for the world market.
The companies will work on a radio-assisted, hand-held reading system
capable of reading meters up to 50m away and a mobile system to obtain
readings in vehicles moving at up to 30mph from distances of around 100m.
In Somerset, Wessex Water plans tests on a different system developed by
Remote Metering Systems, half-owned by Scottish Hydro-Electric. Tom Houston,
Wessex's commercial services manager, says the trial will show whether meter
reading by electricity works over long as well as short distances.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Legal salaries - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salaries for lawyers working in commerce, finance and industry rose by an
average of 5.8 per cent over the past 12 months, according to a salary
survey of lawyers in industry published by Chambers and Partners,
recruitment consultants. The highest average earnings were for the top 10
per cent of senior legal advisers aged 45 and over, at Pounds 170,189. The
lowest, for the bottom 10 per cent of legal assistants aged 25-29 years, was
Pounds 23,750.
Chambers says recession appears to have hit the banking sector particularly
hard. Lawyers in banking were the second highest paid group in 1992, but
ranked only eighth in 1993. Lawyers in the entertainment industry were the
highest paid in 1993, with an average salary of Pounds 64,520.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Mediation on offer in housing disputes
 -Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's 1.8m registered housing association tenants are to be offered
mediation as an alternative to litigation when in disputes with their
landlords. This follows an agreement between the new ombudsman service
established by the Housing Corporation, and IDR Europe, a mediation group.
The Housing Corporation is a public body set up to distribute government
grants to, and to regulate, housing associations in the UK.
This is the first time a public body has signed a formal contract to use
alternative dispute resolution rather than resorting to the courts. It is a
big step forward for the use of alternative dispute resolution in the UK.
IDR, with more than 120 trained mediators, will be called in to resolve
disputes between landlord and tenant in cases where the ombudsman feels
mediation is more suitable than court action.

FT  26 OCT 93 / People: Waste Management International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the rapidly expanding environmental services
group, has appointed Humphrey Claxton to the new position of managing
director in charge of the water deparment of its services subsidiary.
Waste Management, which is the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the US,
says the appointment will enable it to offer a full range of environmental
services to industrial and municipal customers.
Claxton, 47, a chartered engineer with an MBA from Cranfield, has
considerable international experience in this field, most recently as
managing director of Costain Environmental Services and earlier with Portals
Water Treatment.
Although Waste Management already provides water treatment services in a
number of countries, Claxton's appointment is designed to provide
co-ordination and leadership.
The group's newly formed water department 'will be working on a number of
big projects worldwide,' says Edwin Falkman, chief executive. 'These include
expanding activities in those countries where we have a water business, such
as Italy and the Netherlands, but more importantly in those countries where
there is a substantial need for our total environmental services package,
particularly in Asia.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / People: Rapid elevation for Watson at Olivetti in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Watson's move to the top slot at Olivetti UK was sudden even by the
computer industry's standards. Late in September he was still general
manager of the company's customer support group, a position he had held
since 1986. Two weeks later he had been elevated to control of the whole of
the UK operations as Paulo Tosi, managing director for the past eight years,
dashed back to Italy to take responsibility for Olivetti Systems worldwide,
though he remains chairman of the UK operation.
Watson, now 52, says the succession had been planned for some months but the
timing had taken everybody by surprise. These are unpredictable times at
Olivetti, however, as Europe's second largest computer-maker struggles with
floods of red ink and ever fiercer competition. Watson's first job will be
to deal with the complexities of the annual budget-making process - a
baptism of fire for a new chief executive.
Olivetti UK, however, is not in immediate need of succour. Indeed, it is a
shining light in the Milanese gloaming. Under Tosi, it improved its market
share and increased its revenues. Watson, as head of the fastest growing
segment of the company, played a major role in Olivetti's advance. The group
is now second only to Granada Computer Services as a supplier of third party
maintenance services.
Watson trained as an engineer in south London and spent some time with
Gillette Industries before joining the then British Olivetti in 1967 as a
mangement trainee. He has held a number of positions in the UK company and
spent seven years based in Copenhagen running the engineering activities of
Olivetti Scandinavia.
He does not envisage making radical changes at Olivetti but argues: 'We can
do a lot more with our present resources,' and has his eyes set on an award
from the European Quality Foundation.

<TEXT>
David Moffatt, finance director of Hanson Amalgamated Industries, has been
appointed group finance director of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based
real ale brewer.
The move underlines the acquisitive ambitions of Howard Hodgson, the
entrepreneur who became Hoskins' largest shareholder and chief executive two
months ago. Hodgson, who bought a 9.6 per cent stake in Hoskins from Barrie
Hoar, the company's former chairman, said in August that he planned to
embark on a series of acquisitions to expand into associated business areas.
He used such tactics during the 1980s to expand his family firm of funeral
directors into the UK's largest quoted funeral services company.
Moffatt, 41, has worked for Hanson for the past seven years, having been
employed previously by Imperial Group which Hanson acquired in 1986.
According to Hodgson, Moffatt's 'experience, particularly in the field of
acquisitions and operational control, will complement that of the rest of
the Hoskins board'.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Two moves on - one back /
Charles Batchelor, who leaves the growing business page today, looks back on
the past seven years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six in ten of the businesses which started up in 1987, the year I began
writing about small firms, will have shut down by now.
By no means all will have 'failed', in the sense of going bust. Many will
have been closed down by their owners for a variety of personal and business
reasons; others will have merged or been taken over. But only 40 per cent
will be trading in a form that would be recognisable to the outsider present
at their birth.
Life for the individual business owner may be tough and full of uncertainty
but the past decade has been one of improvement for the small business
sector as a whole. Its contribution to the economy is now much more widely
recognised. Small and medium-sized businesses, employing up to 500 people,
account for 99 per cent of all businesses in the European Community and 72
per cent of jobs.
In the UK, schoolchildren are encouraged to run their own businesses, while
graduates spend their long vacations gaining job experience in small firms;
in Europe and the US, MBA students flock to optional courses on managing the
small business.
Television programmes focusing on the activities of small companies have
become popular with viewers, while regional development organisations, which
once concentrated on attracting inward investment by large multi-national
corporations, now regard encouraging local enterprise as an important part
of their role.
In spite of the greater recognition small firms have won, surprising gaps
still remain. The family firm still does not enjoy the same prestige in
Britain as it does in continental Europe. The relative sophistication of the
public stock market and the corporate finance sector in the UK make it
attractive for growing companies to sell out or float.
Not that the public stock market is necessarily always welcoming to the new
entrant. My first article on the Small Business page appeared in January
1987 and discussed the previous day's launch of the Third Market.
This market, intended as a home for dealings in the shares of young unproven
companies, has long since disappeared and even the Unlisted Securities
Market, whose success prompted the creation of the Third Market, is now
under threat.
The problems small businesses have in raising capital have remained a
constant theme over the past seven years although the public debate goes
back at least to the 1930s.
It is unlikely that the debate about the 'equity gap' will ever be resolved.
Funds will never be available in the quantities demanded by the ambitious
entrepreneur. This is not to say that the methods by which banks assess risk
and the criteria which venture capitalists set for backing business should
not be subject to regular review.
Both the banks and the venture capital industry have had their reputations
tarnished in the past few years. Even at the height of the venture capital
boom, in the late 1980s, concerns were being expressed at the venture
capital industry's shift away from backing start-ups and early-stage
companies.
The banks, too, have had to respond to increasing criticism that in the good
times they lend too much and in the bad times too little. It is by no means
clear that the banks, large organisations with centralised management
structures, will be any more responsive to the needs of small firms during
the next boom and bust cycle.
Finance is a perennial problem for small businesses, but other issues have
come to prominence or faded in significance over the past seven years. In
the mid-1980s the shortage of suitable premises was still a constraint on
the expansion of small firms. The launch of short-lease 'managed workshops',
with shared reception facilities, and the impact of the recession on the
commercial property market have changed all that.
But other challenges have emerged. Quality, specifically the quality
management scheme defined under British Standard 5750, has become an
important issue. Some small firms claim the standard is unduly bureaucratic
while others have adopted it grudgingly under pressure from their customers.
The problems caused by the late payment of debt have become particularly
pressing during the recession and its aftermath.
The need to reduce red tape has increased as European Community directives
have been heaped on domestic legislation and hopes are currently centred on
a new deregulation initiative launched with the backing of the prime
minister, John Major.
In the early stages of small firms' rediscovery they were put in something
of a ghetto. Much of the early press coverage portrayed them as quirky,
quixotic ventures frequently engaged in homely, non-industrial pursuits.
A more realistic view has come to prevail in recent years and they are now
seen as part of a broader economic picture. The FT's Management Page
reflected this evolving perception by dropping the Small Business title in
favour of Growing Business in January 1989.
In the 1980s there was also a growing awareness that maybe the problem was
not so much in getting small businesses started - Britain had become rather
good at this - but in helping them to grow. The independent, medium-sized
company, a key element in German, French and Italian economies, is
under-represented in the UK.
The government came to realise that backing more established companies made
sense. They had survived the early, vulnerable stages and were less likely
to go bust after public money had been spent on them.
But the government's record at helping small businesses can at best be
described as mixed. Although an attempt is now being made to rationalise the
network of small business support agencies by setting up one-stop advice
shops, known as 'business links', small firms remain confused by the
plethora of public-sector schemes.
The creation of a network of Training and Enterprise Councils has allowed
support to be tailored to local needs. But it has also destroyed valuable
schemes such as the Small Firms Service, which provided a nationwide service
of information and counselling.
The government, under pressure to 'to do something' for small firms, has
been unable to resist meddling. The Enterprise Initiative, an extremely
successful government scheme which was extensively and expensively promoted,
is to be modified and handed over to the Tecs. In preparation for this,
funding has been reduced.
At the European level, the directorate general established to look after
small and medium-sized enterprises, DG23, resisted the threat of merger with
other directorates earlier this year. DG23 has had only limited success in
representing smaller firms but it does have a distinctive voice in the
sector.
But how important is the small business sector to government? In the UK,
small firms ministers have changed with bewildering speed. Lord Strathclyde,
appointed last month, is the sixth in seven years. None has had the time or
the funding to make much of a mark. Fortunately for the small business
community, the present trade and industry secretary, Michael Heseltine,
takes a strong interest in small firms issues.
But the decisions which really affect small firms are taken in the Treasury,
the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, all of which have other
priorities. Small business lobbyists believe that it is these departments
which have yet to be made fully aware of the impact of their decisions on
small firms.
My seven years spent covering the small and growing business sector
coincided with a government which adopted among its aims the creation of an
'enterprise culture'.
The recession carried away many of those hopes and many of the businesses
themselves. Ensuring that business legislation, both new and existing, takes
account of the needs of small firms, remains an unfinished task for
government.
Small firms have been the only creators of new jobs in Europe and the US in
recent years and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): When cash is a factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Factoring and invoice discounting, both ways of raising cash against a
business's invoices, have increased in popularity in recent years as
companies have realised the limitations of the overdraft.
A factor will take over the administration of his client's sales ledger,
provide credit protection and advance cash against invoices. An invoice
discounter only provides cash.
But how does a company choose a factor?
Cash Flow Solutions, a consultancy*, makes the following suggestions:
Check the financial strength of the factor and find out who are the backers.
The large bank-owned factors are all members of the Association of British
Factors and Discounters but there are many sound factors outside the
association.
Obtain the names of one or two of the factor's clients in your industry
sector and ask them about the speed of service provided. How quickly are
requests for increases in credit lines met? How helpful are the staff? Could
the factor provide an export service if you started selling overseas and
does he have an invoice discounting service if you outgrow factoring?
How generous will the factor be in providing funds against invoices? One
company was offered pre-payments of 33 per cent and 65 per cent by two
different factoring companies. Are the credit limits offered by the factor
adequate for your business and your customers?
Check which fees the factor will charge. Is there a cost for transferring
funds in addition to the administration fee? Are there any arrangement,
commitment or renewal fees?
Choose a factor which is within easy travelling distance. Although most
contact will be by telephone or computer link-up, it helps to maintain
personal contact.
What happens if you want to end your agreement? The notice period required
varies. Some agreements only allow notice to be given on the anniversary of
the agreement; others permit termination within three months of written
notice.

Small businesses are more likely to insure their furniture than their key
members of staff, according to a survey by Legal &amp; General insurance group.
A survey of 840 directors and managers from small firms revealed the loss of
a key person would cost, on average, Pounds 40,000 in the first year. L&amp;G
estimates there are about 175,000 small, limited companies with an uninsured
key person. Key protection cover is a form of short-term life or health
insurance.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Protection for part-time workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords yesterday began a judicial review of an allegation by the
Equal Opportunities Commission that employment protection legislation
discriminates against part-time workers, Lisa Wood writes.
The commission alleges that the government discriminates against women by
making part-timers work three years longer than full-time workers before
qualifying for employment protection rights.
In early 1990 the commission wrote to the government claiming that certain
provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1978 were in breach of European
Community sex equality law. It asked for legislation to remove the
restrictions on employment rights for part-timers.
The government said it had no plans to amend the legislation, and the
commission applied to the High Court for a judicial review.
The High Court ruled that the statutory provision was not contrary to EC
law. The commission appealed to the Court of Appeal which ruled by a
two-to-one majority that the government was not discriminating against
part-time workers. It also ruled that this sort of case should be pursued by
individuals through the tribunal system rather than by the commission using
judicial review proceedings.
The Court of Appeal rejected the commission's request for the right of
appeal to the House of Lords. But the commission successfully petitioned the
Lords for a judicial review.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Labour calls for EC recovery fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday urged the European Community to set up a multi-billion
pound fund as part of a seven-point plan for a co-ordinated EC economic
strategy.
The idea is part of a submission to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, who is preparing a white paper on growth and
unemployment.
Under Labour's plan, the fund would be used to reduce unemployment and speed
Europe's economic recovery. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the
fund would be in addition to a Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.88bn) bridging facility
proposed by Mr Delors.
Labour says only joint action by the EC and member states can promote
sustainable growth and a reduction in Community unemployment, which totals
18m.
'The economies of the Community are now so inter-dependent that expansionary
measures undertaken in concert can achieve common benefits which cannot be
realised by any single member state acting alone,' Mr Brown said.
'This is particularly so where, as in Britain's case, capacity weakened by
under-investment and balance of payments problems mean that recession in the
rest of Europe is one of the biggest barriers to recovery at home.'
Mr Brown said the proposed recovery fund would take advantage of EC
credit-worthiness to raise funds to be made available as grants or loans to
member states.
The money would be spent on infrastructure, training, environmental
protection, and maintenance work, mainly in areas of high unemployment.
'The aim should be to operate the fund at a deficit in periods of recession
in the Community, and in surplus when economic recovery is secured,' Mr
Brown said.
Labour's submission to Mr Delors reiterates the party's support for a system
of fixed exchange rates leading to European monetary union.
However, it says progress towards EMU will depend on economic convergence
between member states and more flexible exchange rates.
'The imposition of a fixed-rate regime, as a prelude to monetary union,
without real convergence having first been achieved, and with inflexible
insistence on nominal targets, is a recipe for divergent economic
performance and a waste of people through unemployment on a grotesque scale.
'The community has seen more than enough of this; we don't want more,' it
says.
Labour also calls for a 'jobs initiative' to cut the numbers of long-term
unemployed through rebates of social insurance for employers; acceleration
of infrastructure projects; improved skills and qualifications for workers;
a shift away from the EC common agricultural policy; and spending on
environmental improvement projects.
Labour said the government had failed to take up the full EC training and
regional funds to which Britain is entitled. 'They have dragged their feet
on much needed investment measures,' said Mr Brown.

Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday joined health authorities
and trusts at a conference in London where she urged them to involve the
public more in making decisions about the shape of local health services,
John Willman writes.
Mrs Bottomley said that abolition of the regional health authorities,
announced last week, would improve the accountability of health service
managers to parliament. But the devolution of management responsibilities to
authorities and trusts should improve accountability downwards.
'Health authorities and trusts must engage the public's interest in the
issues they face,' she said. 'They must actively encourage public
participation in the decision-making process.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / Judge raps child maintenance tactic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COURT ruling in favour of a divorced father yesterday threw into question
a tactic of the Child Support Agency which many separated fathers claim is
financially crippling them.
A series of sharp rises in maintenance payments imposed by the agency, set
up by the government in April to ensure absentee fathers pay for their
children's upbringing, have prompted a number of complaints.
The father in the case before Teesside County Court was divorced seven years
ago and is now settled into another relationship. He was paying Pounds 120 a
month to his ex-wife, who looked after their two children.
The court heard how she went to court and revoked the maintenance order on
the advice of the agency.
As the man was therefore not technically paying any maintenance, the agency
was able to assess the matter and ruled he must pay Pounds 480 a month to
his former wife.
But Judge David Bryant said yesterday: 'It is not enough simply for a person
to come to court and say 'I wish to go to the Child Support Agency, please
revoke the existing order'.'
He said that if the mother needed more money, normally the correct procedure
should be an application to the court to increase the existing maintenance
payment.
The judge reinstated the order for Pounds 120 a month and ruled that none of
those involved should be identified.

FT  26 OCT 93 / TV groups ordered to surrender riot film
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC, Sky Television, Independent Television News and London News Network
were yesterday ordered by a judge to hand to police transmitted and
unscreened footage of a riot in Whitechapel, east London, last month.
Judge Gerald Butler, Southwark crown court's senior judge, ruled that
establishing the guilt or innocence of those involved in the riot 'far
outweighed perceived loss of integrity' of the television companies.
Issuing production orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, he
said public interest demanded that they supply police with footage.
The disturbances on September 10 came during a vigil by more than 300 mainly
Asian demonstrators outside the Royal London Hospital for Mr Quaddas Ali, a
student who was in a coma on a life-support machine after an attack two days
earlier by a white gang.
The judge said he had heard evidence from police how members of the crowd
had 'run through the streets of Whitechapel assaulting members of the public
and police and causing damage to property and motor vehicles.
'Thirty-one police officers and five members of the public were injured,
some seriously. Nine arrests were made. They have been charged variously
with public order acts and other offences.'
LNN and ITN had refused to hand over film but made no submissions to the
court against the issuing of production orders, the judge said.
The BBC and Sky News - part of BSkyB, the satellite television venture in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake  -
argued through counsel that such orders would 'put in question' their
'integrity and impartiality', as well as 'imperilling' the safety of
journalists and photographers.
Judge Butler said: 'This material is crucial to these matters. I do not see
how the integrity and impartiality of those involved should be affected when
it is an order of the courts. Public interest far outweighs the perceived
loss of integrity.'
The judge went on to reject suggestions by counsel for the respondents that
the material was not likely to be of substantial value to the investigation
or be relevant evidence.
He made no order as to costs.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Upturn in van and truck sales signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAN AND TRUCK makers believe the most severe recession in the commercial
vehicle market since the second world war may be over.
Registrations rose 14.94 per cent last month on a year-on-year basis - the
first monthly rise since January. The decline in new van and truck sales
which began in 1989 has slowed since July, and the September figures
indicate that a turning point has been reached.
This is in spite of a continuing deterioration in the market for light vans
and a strong performance in the heavy trucks sector caused by trucks being
registered to beat the October 1 introduction of tougher exhaust emission
standards.
The 17,871 commercial vehicles registered in September compared with 15,549
in the same month last year.
They lifted the total for the first three quarters of the year to 153,211 -
still 2.82 per cent lower than the same period last year.
The effect of the emissions deadline on trucks was dramatic - September's
registrations rose 85 per cent to 5,059 compared with the same month a year
ago. Heavy truck sales have been rising almost continuously since the
beginning of this year and industry observers believe the market would still
have risen without the deadline.
Registrations of panel vans - the largest sector in the commercial vehicles
market - rose 10.39 per cent in September to 7,537 on a year-on-year basis.
Those of utility four-wheel-drive vehicles jumped 22.7 per cent, and buses
and coaches rose 49 per cent.
Light van registrations were 22.2 per cent lower at 3,719.
The share of the market taken by imports continues to rise. They accounted
for 43.82 per cent of the September market compared with 35.45 per cent a
year ago, and for 41.13 per cent in the first three quarters compared with
35.82 per cent last year.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Citibank appeals over Pounds 14m payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Court of Appeal yesterday began hearing an appeal by Citibank against a
High Court ruling that it should pay Pounds 14.7m compensation to Smith New
Court, the securities house, for losses incurred on the purchase of Ferranti
shares worth Pounds 23m.
The 28m shares were bought in July 1989, shortly before the discovery of a
fraud on Ferranti halved the value of the stock.
The High Court held in March last year that SNC's bid price for the shares
had been induced by fraudulent misrepresentations made to it by Mr
Christopher Roberts, the then head of private banking at Citibank, part of
the US Citicorp group, and a director of Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset
Management), its marketmakers.
Mr Roberts had falsely told SNC it was competing with two other bidders, Mr
Justice Chadwick had said at the hearing. SNC was awarded Pounds 10.7m
compensation plus interest of about Pounds 4m.
Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, for Citibank, yesterday argued that the judge had
made a finding of fraud against Mr Roberts without adequate foundation.
Mr Sumption said a high standard of proof was needed to support the
allegation of fraud - especially since Mr Roberts was acquitted of similar
criminal charges.
SNC's allegations were always based upon evidence given by two of its
directors, Mr Lewis and Mr Abrahams, who were primarily responsible for the
transaction, Mr Sumption said. Mr Justice Chadwick had regarded both men as
discredited witnesses whereas he made no adverse finding about the
credibility of Mr Roberts.
The judge's finding of fraud was therefore substantially based on
speculative inferences. This was a wholly inappropriate basis on which to
make the grave finding of fraud, Mr Sumption said.
The case is due to last 10 days.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Legal battle launched over Isuzu imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IM GROUP, Britain's largest private motor-import business, is to serve a
writ against General Motors and its Vauxhall subsidiary over their plans to
take over import and distribution of Isuzu vehicles in the UK from January.
Mr Bob Edmiston's IM, whose wholly owned Isuzu (UK) subsidiary has held the
Isuzu franchise since 1987, declared its intention to serve the writ after
Vauxhall's chairman, Mr Charles Golden, said Vauxhall would 'take up its
right' to import Isuzu's four-wheel-drive Trooper model from January 1.
IM's dispute with General Motors centres on its allegations that General
Motors unlawfully sought to procure the termination of Isuzu (UK)'s contract
to operate the franchise in the UK.
IM originally filed a suit against General Motors in the US, but a US court
ruled last month that any proceedings should be heard in the UK, and that
General Motors should make available any documents and witnesses considered
necessary.
Specifically, it is seeking to retain its right to market the Isuzu Trooper
four-wheel-drive vehicle, in spite of the contention of General Motors -
which has a 37 per cent stake in Isuzu - that IM had agreed to relinquish
the franchise at the end of this year.
According to IM, Isuzu (UK) has also instructed lawyers in Japan to obtain
an injunction from a Tokyo court preventing the termination of the
concession by the Japanese company. Isuzu in Japan has refused to comment on
the dispute.
Under General Motors' plans, the Trooper will be sold through the Vauxhall
cars network from the beginning of next year, badged as the Vauxhall
Monterey.
General Motors has been selling the vehicle through its Continental European
dealer networks, where it is badged as an Opel, since early last year.
Mr Golden insisted: 'Any litigation will not delay the launch of the
Monterey.'
But Mr Edmiston said: 'If General Motors and Vauxhall think they can now
brush us aside and carry off the Trooper without a fight they are much
mistaken.'
In the meantime IM has been negotiating to obtain the concession for further
four-wheel-drive vehicles and is understood to be close to a final agreement
to import Korean-built Ssangyong vehicles to the UK from late next year.
IM has already signed a letter of intent with Ssangyong, whose new off-road
vehicle, the FJ, was unveiled at the recent Frankfurt motor show. The
vehicles are powered by Mercedes-Benz engines and have been designed by a
British designer.
IM is also the importer of Japanese Subaru cars and until earlier this year
held the import concession for Hyundai, Korea's largest carmaker.
However in July it signed a deal with the Lex Service group giving Lex a a
50.1 per cent stake in Hyundai Car (UK), a new joint-venture company with IM
which acquired an exclusive rolling three-year contract to import Hyundais
from last month.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Hostility to Jews 'less in Britain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTITUDES towards Jews in Britain are more positive than those towards other
minorities, says a survey by Gallup for the American Jewish Committee, the
international lobby group.
The survey of 959 people, which was published yesterday and is part of an
international series, also showed that hostility towards Jews was less in
Britain than in many other countries, including the US.
Dr David Singer, director of research for the committee, said the results
were encouraging but he noted that 25 per cent of those questioned still
thought that anti-Semitism would increase in the fut-ure.
Eight per cent of respondents thought Jews behaved in a way which provoked
hostility. This compared with 57 per cent who felt this about Gypsies, 28
per cent about Pakistanis, 26 per cent about West Indians and 21 per cent
about Arabs.
Asked if Jews had too much influence in British society, 8 per cent said
they did, 42 per cent said they had the 'right amount' of influence, and 7
per cent 'too little'. On the extent of anti-Semitism, the survey found that
45 per cent felt it was 'not a problem at all'.
International comparisons show that 28 per cent in Austria think Jews have
too much influence, compared with 20 per cent in the US, and 5 per cent in
the former Czechoslovakia.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Mental healthcare strategy attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is relying on an 'inadequate, piecemeal approach' to mental
healthcare and ignoring the experience of other countries, the King's Fund
Institute said yesterday.
The health think-tank made several recommendations in a report published
yesterday, including the drawing up of national 'goals' for mental
healthcare.
Ms Judy Turner-Crowson, a former US health official, said the care of
mentally ill people in the community could be transformed if policymakers
learned lessons from the US.
She added: 'The central problem in both countries has been the patchy, slow
and uneven development of community services to take the place of the old
mental hospitals.'
Services could only be properly developed if a framework of action were
agreed by the mentally ill people and their families, health professionals,
managers and policymakers, she said.
The problems in Britain have been made worse by the large number of
different professionals responsible for caring for the mentally ill. Cash
shortages coupled with plans to create smaller local authorities pose a
threat to Care in the Community policies, Dr Gary Craig, a health policy
expert, said in a report yesterday. He said the changes would weaken social
services, endangering services such as meals-on-wheels and home-helps in
some areas.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Unions criticised over training and flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   David Goodhart, Labour Editor
UNIONS fail to take the lead in vital workplace activities such as training,
fostering workplace flexibility and employee involvement, says a submission
to the Commons employment committee inquiry into the future of unions which
begins its hearings today.
The submission, from the Involvement and Participation Association, an
organisation supported by both unions and employers, also says that unions
could expand their work on individual grievance issues.
'Employees need more support over redundancy procedures, abuse of employee
rights and individual contract bargaining,' the IPA says.
The association stresses that employee involvement is not dependent on
unions, and points to the John Lewis Partnership and Black &amp; Decker as
non-union companies with model involvement systems.
Yet it also says that individual and collective representation are not
alternatives and should complement each other. 'There is a continuing need
for a collective voice but if trade unions are to play a beneficial role
when the recession lifts they will have to adapt very rapidly to the changes
which surround them,' the association says.
It states that unions have two main roles: first, as guardians of individual
rights and providers of individual services to members; and second as
providers of an employee 'voice'. It adds: 'Change is only possible today
with employee support, and it is essential for survival. Unions have a
particularly important role to play in creating a better balance between job
security and job flexibility.'
It believes unions should lobby for the maintenance of training budgets and
employee involvement activities when times are hard. Unions should also
encourage their members to develop mobile skills, thereby giving them
greater flexibility.
At today's first hearing the Trades Union Congress will call for a change in
the law to give workers a legal right to be represented by a union.
The TUC says world-class companies recognise unions and that unions in
Britain, as in Germany and Japan, are committed to the best standards in
employment as the basis for producing the best goods and services.
Workers in unions, says the TUC, have better wages and conditions and are
better protected against arbitrary employer action.
The casualised labour force of the 1990s lacks power in the labour market
and so has a greater need for unions, it says.

FT  26 OCT 93 / PM hits back at Thatcher attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday hit back at criticism in Lady
Thatcher's memoirs, and urged the media to stop comparing him with his
predecessor.
Speaking in Cyprus, at the end of the Commonwealth conference, Mr Major said
he had not read Lady Thatcher's book, The Downing Street Years.
But he said her claim that he 'drifted with the tide' as chancellor related
to the debate about joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System.
He said: 'If I was drifting with the tide, so was the Conservative party,
the Labour party, the Liberals, the CBI, the trade unions and most economic
opinion in this country and across Europe. So I had plenty of company on the
raft.'
In his strongest comments yet on the continuing friction with the former
prime minister, Mr Major virtually accused the media of creating divisions
where none existed. 'There is no doubt whatever that Lady Thatcher wants the
Conservative government to succeed,' he said on BBC Radio. 'She has made
that clear. I have made that clear.
'We both face a problem. Every time Lady Thatcher says anything, colleagues
of yours in the media crawl over it to see if some interpretation can be
placed upon it that causes difficulty for the government.
'Every action I take, people crawl over it to see if Lady Thatcher might
have done it the same way.'
In a conscious effort to place Lady Thatcher firmly in the past, Mr Major
said the world had 'moved on' in the three years since he replaced her as
prime minister.
He said: 'The problems we face have moved on and some of the ways we have to
address problems have moved on. Looking back over our shoulder all the time
is not the way to conduct government.'
Mr Major refused to say whether the party whip would be withdrawn from
Conservative MPs who vote against the government in the coming session of
parliament.
But he said the party had demonstrated clearly at this month's conference
that MPs were expected to support the government on 'principal areas of
policy'.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Sell-off schedule 'lost Pounds 1.1bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government should stagger future privatisations to get a better deal for
the taxpayer, Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the Commons public
accounts committee, said yesterday.
The sale of the regional electricity companies in one block in 1990 meant
that the government lost Pounds 1.1bn, he said.
Opening the debate on a series of reports prepared by his committee, which
scrutinises government expenditure, Mr Sheldon said it was likely that more
finance would be raised by phasing any future sell-offs over a period of
time.
The government is committed to privatising British Rail and British Coal.
The Post Office, however, is likely to remain in the public sector after a
recommendation by the Department of Trade and Industry that it should not be
sold off.
The 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales were sold in one
block for Pounds 5.2bn. But Mr Sheldon said the market decided they were
worth Pounds 6.3bn.
'It rose from Pounds 5.2bn to Pounds 6.3bn on the first day of trading - and
that was a loss to the taxpayer. Uncertainty of this kind should lead to
tranches being examined rather more carefully and rather more fully in the
future.'
Selling off only part of the companies initially would have enabled a second
sale to be set at a better price, Mr Sheldon added.
He said he feared that the Treasury preferred to sell nationalised companies
in one block to raise revenue more quickly.
Mr Sheldon expressed concern that the government had appointed 53 advisers
to deal with the power sale, 16 of them without competition.
He said: 'Clearly we feel very uneasy about some of these appointments and
we feel they should all be subject to competition.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / BBC ahead of programme efficiency reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, yesterday told MPs that the
BBC was ahead of the programme of efficiency reforms recommended by
accountants Price Waterhouse in 1990, Roland Rudd writes.
The success had been reported by accountants Touche Ross, invited by the
government to study the BBC's progress. Mr Brooke said: 'The very powerful
incentive the BBC has for these improvements in efficiency is the ability to
re-invest in programmes.' It would be premature to publish the Touche Ross
report before an announcement on the level of the licence fee, he said.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Regulator will oversee running of gas auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday confirmed that it had given Ofgas, the
gas industry regulator, responsibility for overseeing the auctions of gas
from British Gas stockpiles.
The changeover comes after complaints that increasing numbers of speculators
were attracted to the auctions, which were intended to stimulate early
competition in the market by making British Gas supplies available to the
new independent gas companies.
The supply of such 'release gas' was intended to be a temporary solution,
which would allow the new companies to attract customers while they
developed their own offshore gas sources or negotiated long-term contracts
from North Sea producers.
Ofgas has told the industry that it will introduce checks to ensure that
speculators are excluded in future. Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director
of Alliance Gas, the joint venture between BP, Statoil, the Norwegian state
oil company, and Norsk Hydro, yesterday welcomed the change.
'In the last auction more than 100 companies were allocated release gas,' he
said, 'but only 30 or so actually made transportation agreements with
British Gas.'
The importance of the auctions is likely to diminish in future as more gas
becomes available to the independents. In addition, a secondary market is
emerging and Mr Maroe said it was 'now possible to sell or acquire spot
gas'.
British Gas said yesterday that it had been expecting the transfer of
regulatory responsibilities. The company will meet Ofgas shortly to make
arrangements for future sales.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Peugeot may use pit site for car centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PART of British Coal's defunct Coventry Colliery at Keresley, West Midlands,
could become an import and export centre for Peugeot and Citroen cars.
The Wooton group, through its development manager Ashford Developments,
wants to turn the surface site of the colliery into a multi-use industrial
and commercial area, which could create up to 2,000 jobs.
The proposals include use of the colliery's existing railhead as a transport
and distribution centre for Peugeot, the French car group, which also
includes Citroen. Peugeot has a manufacturing plant at nearby Ryton.
Ashford Developments has prepared the proposals for the car distribution
centre on behalf of Gesco, a wholly owned transport and distribution
subsidiary of the Peugeot group. Gesco is understood also to be examining
other possibilities for a regional depot close to the Ryton plant.
The Keresley site is potentially attractive to Peugeot because it offers the
opportunity to move cars directly by rail to the group's distribution
terminal at Calais after the Channel tunnel opens next year.
It would also facilitate distribution of Peugeot and Citroen cars in the
Midlands. Currently the cars are distributed through an import-export centre
at Sheerness, Kent.
The Coventry pit is also the subject of a bid from Coal Investments, the
company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of British
Coal, who wants to re-open the mine. The company has also bid to re-open the
Trentham colliery in Staffordshire under licence.

FT  26 OCT 93 / BCCI payout unlikely until August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are
unlikely to receive any payments until at least August next year, it emerged
yesterday.
A first dividend of 15p in the pound cannot be paid unless an agreement
between the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder in the bank, is ratified by the Luxembourg court of appeal.
A verdict is expected tomorrow in an appeal by three BCCI depositors against
the ratification of the agreement by a lower court last year. If the appeal
fails, accountants at Touche Ross, BCCI liquidators, can proceed with a
ballot of creditors to approve a contribution of at least Dollars 1.7bn
(Pounds 1.14bn) from Abu Dhabi in exchange for a waiver of legal action
against it.
Touche Ross warned that a payout in August next year was its most optimistic
assessment and that a further appeal to Luxembourg's highest court could
take the distribution of a first dividend into 1995.
Mr Hal Skolnick, Mr Adil Elias and Mr Assilaos Artiki, the appellants, will
have six months to appeal against tommorrow's judgment if it goes against
them, which would defer payments further.
If their appeal succeeds, however, Touche Ross will have to consider
launching its own appeal, suing Abu Dhabi or renegotiating its agreement.
Even if the court of appeal finds in favour of Touche, the firm said it
would need to obtain approval from at least Dollars 4.75bn-worth of
creditors before proceeding with its agreement with Abu Dhabi.
Total fees incurred by Touche Ross in the worldwide liquidation have reached
approximately Pounds 100m, up from Pounds 86m at the start of the year.
The Luxembourg court is also expected to announce tomorrow that an appeal
against a separate pooling agreement between BCCI liquidators in different
countries has been dropped.
That will clear the way for Touche Ross to negotiate with other
jurisdictions on the distribution of any dividends.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Booker Prize faces union protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S Booker Prize ceremony faces a demonstration from several dozen women
mushroom pickers, dressed as plantation slaves, who have been dismissed by a
Booker subsidiary after a dispute over overtime payments.
The women's union, the TGWU general union, hopes to embarrass the company by
connecting its treatment of the women in North Yorkshire with its origins in
the Caribbean slave trade.
Booker yesterday strongly denied the charges and pointed out that the
part-time women workers had lost an unfair dismissal case at an industrial
tribunal in Leeds and were not appealing against the decision.
The dispute began when the company's loss-making Middlebrook Mushrooms
subsidiary proposed to reduce overtime pay for weekend working after several
supermarket chains said they required permanent seven-day deliveries.
Middlebrook reached agreement at all of its farms except Whitley Bridge
where, after several months of negotiation, it imposed the new terms and
sacked the 89 employees who would not accept them.
The union says it was happy to negotiate about reducing the overtime
payments but could not accept the breaking of agreements. Booker says the
company, facing intense competition, acted to safeguard its future. It says
basic wages at Middlebrook are one-third above local rates for similar work.
The company feels vulnerable to the adverse publicity associated with the
dispute, and last week it offered to donate Pounds 50,000 to the union as a
gesture to help alleviate hardship in an area badly hit by the recession.
The offer was rejected.
The TGWU says two of the six book authors on the Booker short-list have
expressed concern about the dispute.
The women will hope to add to that number outside London's Guildhall
tonight, where they will be handing out copies of Our Bitter Harvest, their
book about the dispute.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Jordan warning ignored, Iraq arms inquiry told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTELLIGENCE warnings that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route for
defence exports to Iraq were ignored by Foreign Office officials because the
information was not 'irrefutable', the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard
yesterday.
Mr Charles Haswell, a Foreign Office official formerly responsible for
Britain's bilateral relations with Israel and Jordan, was justifying a
decision to exclude Jordan from countries suspected of breaking the UN
embargo on Iraq published in December 1991.
He told the inquiry: 'It was important not to mislead the minister (Mr
Douglas Hogg), particularly on something that he had taken great interest
in. To risk damaging our relationship with Jordan on the basis of little or
no evidence was wrong.'
Mr Haswell was questioned about a series of intelligence reports giving
examples of the country being used as a route for defence related and/or
dual-use chemical products for Iraq.
He said he had responded to ministerial concerns about the potential
diversion by calling a meeting of intelligence staff in November 1991 to
make a judgment on the evidence.
But he had concluded that at most Jordan had been involved in isolated cases
of 'technical breaches' of the UN embargo which did not justify the adoption
of a more restrictive policy towards the country.
The evidence supplied by intelligence agencies included the diversion of
parts for Iraq's supergun project, and of chemical products such as ammonium
nitrate which had a potential military application.
In an exchange with Lord Justice Scott, Mr Haswell was asked whether there
was not an inconsistency between the view of intelligence officers and that
adopted by some officials. He replied: 'You may think my view bonkers, but I
don't think I was.'
Mr Haswell was recently appointed to the UK delegation to the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna.
The hearing continues today.

THE US might withdraw military protection from Europe if the European
Community fails to reach a compromise deal on the Uruguay Round of Gatt
trade talks, Lady Thatcher said yesterday.
Addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in London, she said that a US
military withdrawal would be 'very serious indeed for the world as a whole'.
She said the US presence in Europe was 'all of a piece with co-operating
together on the international economy under the Gatt'.
Singling out France for special criticism, she said hopes of a Gatt deal
were threatened by a long-standing 'anti-American streak' in the EC.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Radio survey finds BBC losing out to independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL radio stations increased their share of radio audiences in the
third quarter of the year at the expense of the BBC, independent audit
figures released yesterday show.
The BBC's share of listeners dropped to 56.1 per cent from 57.2 per cent in
the second quarter and 59 per cent in the first quarter of the year.
Commercial radio's share, meanwhile, has grown to 41.1 per cent from 38.9
per cent in the second quarter and 37.4 per cent in the first. The balance
is mostly made up of listeners to foreign stations
The figures are collected by Radio Joint Audience Research, (Rajar), jointly
funded by the BBC and commercial radio.
Mr Douglas McArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, said
the figures showed that BBC radio had lost 1.3m listeners to commercial
radio in the past year.
The results were 'great news for advertisers - not just in terms of higher
audience but in terms of the broadening of listener appeal'. Analysis of
Rajar's findings showed that commercial radio was reaching a quality
audience, Mr McArthur said.
The BBC said its radio audience had 'remained firm in spite of intense
competition from independent radio'. It said it wanted to see the full
year's figures before it could confirm whether the Radio Advertising
Bureau's claims were correct.
The BBC said local and regional radio was its most popular service after
Radio 1. A total of 10m people listened to local stations each week, while
more than half of people aged 15 to 34 tuned in to Radio 1 each week as part
of the total audience of 16m.
Mr McArthur said it was clear there was now a 'true commercial radio
generation where there is a genuine appreciation and acceptance of radio
with commercials'.
It was only in the 55-plus age group where commercial radio's listening
share fell below 40 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Northern Ireland industry upbeat after years of gloom:
Ulster is still the UK's poorest region but, some manufacturers are
optimistic about its prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TAKES an almost religious zeal to promote Northern Ireland as a good
investment opportunity. But even the province's most ardent flag-wavers must
have dropped their heads in their hands on hearing of the bomb that killed
10 people in Belfast at the weekend.
Persuading people to invest is tough enough and the latest atrocity will not
help Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to attract private
investors, whether indigenous or from overseas.
Yet persuade them it must, for even though the economy is in better shape
now than it was during most of the last decade, Northern Ireland remains the
UK's poorest region. It can ill afford an intensification of sectarian
violence.
Northern Ireland was less affected than any region by the UK recession. In
the worst year of the downturn - 1991 - its output was flat, compared with a
drop of 2.4 per cent for the UK in total. Similarly, employment was barely
affected by the nationwide fall.
One helpful factor was the high level of government spending in the region.
In 1991-92, government spending per head, including security costs, was
Pounds 4,191 in the province, compared with Pounds 2,963 in England, Pounds
3,506 in Scotland and Pounds 3,268 in Wales.
But the region was also cushioned by the prudence of its manufacturers and
consumers, who entered the recession with a lower burden of debt than their
counterparts on the mainland and were thus less exposed to the very high
interest rates of 1989-90.
As a result, some of Northern Ireland's industrialists are feeling upbeat
about prospects.
'Things have suddenly brightened after years of gloom,' said Mr Norman
Stewart, company secretary of James Mackie and Son, a west Belfast-based
manufacturer of textiles machinery. With orders from China and Africa
swelling the order books, Mr Stewart believes the company may soon expand
its 300-strong workforce.
The company's smart new factory overlooks the Springfield Road, which
separates Protestant and Roman Catholic areas. The road is boarded on either
side by high barriers to keep the two sides apart and is sometimes referred
to as Belfast's Berlin Wall.
Mr Stewart admits that the company is a 'political animal' and only survived
the 1980s because the government was determined to see the big west Belfast
employer survive.
But in spite of the company's sensitive location Mr Stewart is more
concerned about getting help from the government for overseas contacts and
seeing an end to the recession in Europe than he is with the problems of
security.
At Desmonds, a textiles factory in Derry that supplies exclusively to Marks
and Spencer, Mr Sean O'Dwyer, deputy director, said he believed Northern
Ireland's troubles could be costing the economy up to 20,000 jobs, but he is
optimistic that if places such as Derry - an awkward spot, close to the
border and with a large Catholic community - can shake off its bad image,
then so can the rest of the country.
'Derry has done very well over the last two years - it has improved its
image and there is a lot of optimism in the town,' said Mr O'Dwyer.
But in spite of the optimism of individual companies, the Northern Ireland
Economic and Research Centre, an independent research organisation, has
estimated that output in Northern Ireland would have to grow at about 10 per
cent a year to reduce unemployment to the UK average within a decade.
That is not likely while the violence continues.
Productivity was only 83 per cent of the UK average last year, according to
the centre. And although the region's wage levels are low, they are not low
enough to outweigh the productivity gap - unit labour costs in manufacturing
are 5 per cent to 6 per cent above the UK average.
But political problems can only be part of an explanation of the economy's
weakness. Mr Tony Dignan of the centre points out that between 1971 and 1991
average gross domestic product growth per annum in the province actually
exceeded the UK average.
Referring to Saturday's bombing, he said: 'Over the last 20 years you have
had more than enough incidents of this type, but Northern Ireland has kept
apace. Political uncertainty is something that investors don't like, whether
they are foreign or indigenous, but people still get up in the morning and
go to work, as they have been doing for the past 20 years.'
The deeper problems include the size of the private sector, which last year
employed 23.9 per cent of male employees in manufacturing compared with a UK
average of 28.6 per cent.
By contrast, males in the public sector in Northern Ireland accounted for
almost one third of the workforce, compared with one fifth in the UK. For
women the figures are even more startling. Last year, 53.9 per cent of
female employees worked in public administration in the province compared
with a UK average of 44.6 per cent.
Many of Northern Ireland's industrialists complain that the overwhelming
presence of the public sector holds back development of the private sector.
'The public sector is a very safe haven for a lot of people,' said Mr Nigel
Smyth, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern
Ireland. 'It would be nice to see some of them working in the private
sector, but somebody at a reasonable level in public administration can live
very pleasantly in Northern Ireland.'
Manufacturing is concentrated in old-fashioned areas such as textiles and
aerospace, with limited chances of growth. The small-business sector is also
relatively underdeveloped.
And, according to the CBI, 35 per cent of Northern Ireland's employees have
no qualifications - compared with 29 per cent in Great Britain - while the
province's population grew twice as fast as the UK average at 0.6 per cent
last year and higher than any other UK region except East Anglia. Such
growth puts pressure on the economy and government-funded training schemes.
Yet in the past financial year the province claims to have attracted almost
2,000 jobs through inward investment. This was the development board's
second best performance since it began in 1982.
'The most important thing is to get people to come here,' said Mr George
Forster, executive director of the board's international investment
division. 'If they only go on the media, then they won't want to know
Northern Ireland.'
At best, Saturday's bombing will prove a temporary discouragement for
overseas investors. At worst, it will have stopped the latest peace
initiative in its tracks. This will leave the province still struggling to
overcome a host of deep-seated structural problems, but without any hope of
shedding perhaps the worst image of any region in Europe.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Concession offered on BR pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday tried to win over Tory MPs
sceptical about rail privatisation by offering a concession over BR's
pension fund.
In a letter to Tory backbenchers, Mr MacGregor said the government would
seek agreement with British Rail's pension-fund trustees before putting
proposals before parliament. The move follows the government's defeat in the
Lords over its plans to water down its obligations on Treasury contributions
to the fund.
The Lords passed an amendment tabled by Lord Peyton, a former Conservative
transport minister, which would re-impose an obligation on the government to
secure the trustees' written agreement before altering its financial
commitments.
Lord Caithness, transport minister, had argued the amendment would in effect
give the pension-fund managers a veto over government expenditure. He said
the obligation should be to consult the trustees.
In his letter, Mr MacGregor says: 'The government's obligations will be
reflected as an asset of pension funds and taken into account in determining
any surplus for pensions. We intend to agree the details of such an
arrangement with the trustees and we will bring before parliament in due
course orders which will give effect to such agreement.'
Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown and one of the backbenchers who
forced the government to climb down over pensioners' railcards, said he
would support the sell-off bill, but with reservations. He said: 'I am
delighted that the government is bringing appropriate orders before
parliament to protect the pension fund.'
Mr Tim Rathbone, MP for Lewes and another backbench sceptic, also welcomed
Mr MacGregor's assurances.
Ministers, however, made clear last night that their concession did not mean
they would accept the amendment in full. This is why some MPs remained
sceptical about how far the government was prepared to go in accepting Lord
Peyton's amendment.
Rebel Tory MPs are also threatening to back an earlier Lords' amendment
allowing BR to bid for the franchises under which the network will be
gradually privatised.
Mr Rathbone said the government had nothing to fear since ministers had been
successful in attracting proposals for management buy-outs when it was not
known whether BR could bid for the franchises.

THE government is to abandon the Exchange Risk Guarantee Scheme, aimed at
protecting companies from fluctuating money rates, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade
and industry minister said yesterday.
Loans worth Pounds 123.2m had been made under the scheme to 2,000 companies
since 1978. The Department of Trade and Industry said one reason for
scrapping it was the recent stabilisation of exchange rates.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Welsh police staff crisis threatened
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE staffing in south Wales may have to be cut by more than half over
Christmas because of a budget crisis, Mr Robert Lawrence, chief constable,
warned yesterday.
The South Wales Police Authority has asked to meet Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, urgently to ask for a cash injection of at least Pounds 2m. The
authority, which has a Pounds 128m budget, is heading for an overspend of
Pounds 9m by the end of the financial year.
Mr Lawrence, who leads Wales's biggest force, described the situation as
'critical'.
He said: 'If the home secretary cannot assist us, we will have to make
substantial cuts in policing levels right across the force area throughout
Christmas, by at least a half. In blunt terms, we need at least Pounds 2m.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER director of ammunition procurement at the Ministry of Defence
yesterday denied 12 charges of corruptly accepting bribes to help companies
win arms contracts.
Mr Gordon Foxley was accused at Snaresbrook Crown Court of accepting money
'as an inducement or reward' from three international arms companies -
Fratelli Borletti of Milan, Italy, Gebruder Junghans of Schramberg, Germany,
and A S Raufoss, of Gjovik, Norway.
Mr Foxley, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, was alleged to have taken
bribes between 1979 and 1984.
Each charge alleged that Mr Foxley, acting as an agent for the MoD,
corruptly agreed to accept money as an inducement or reward for showing
favour in relation to the placing of contracts for the supply of ammunition
equipment.
The trial is expected to last at least two weeks.

FT  26 OCT 93 / IRA explosion causes rail chaos in south: Bomb damage delays
40,000 commuters - Belfast holds silent memorial / Ulster's economic image
dented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRA brought chaos to rail travellers in southern England yesterday as a
result of Sunday's bomb explosion at Reading on the main line from London
Paddington to the west and south Wales.
It was feared that there would be further chaos today after an explosive
device damaged a road bridge over the London Marylebone to Banbury line at
Brill, Buckinghamshire, yesterday.
British Rail said last night that the Reading line reopened during the day
but the stretch of track between Princes Risborough and Bicester on the
Marylebone-Banbury line remained closed and passengers were being bussed
between the two towns. There was uncertainty about whether the line would be
open by this morning.
A third line from Reading to London Waterloo and the spur to Gatwick Airport
remained closed because of signalling damage, BR said.
This line had been replaced with a bus service between Earley and Wokingham
in Berkshire but services were expected to be back to normal in time for
this morning's rush-hour.
Police were 'keeping an open mind' about the Brill explosion but did not
know when the blast happened. They were not linking the explosion with the
one in Reading late on Sunday night and, together with bomb squad officers,
were planning a further examination of the track in daylight.
BR urged passengers and people living close to railway lines to watch out
for anything suspicious. Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, said after visiting
the scene of the Reading blast: 'Let's face it, our lines are exposed. What
we need is vigilance by everybody concerned.'
Thames Valley police said train spotters and station security cameras could
hold vital clues in the search for the terrorists who targeted Reading.
The trackside explosion came seven hours after a device was found in a
toilet. Police believe this device was meant to go off afterwards, hitting
emergency services summoned to the scene. 'This was a deliberate attempt to
lure emergency services into the path of an explosion with total disregard
for human life,' said Det Supt John Bound.
The blast damaged a signal post and caused a crater up to 18 inches deep but
it was not thought the track itself was damaged.
BR said 40,000 people using the main rail link to London from the west and
south Wales were delayed by about an hour yesterday. Police said a warning
was given about the Reading bomb, claiming it to be the work of the IRA.
Another device was made safe on Sunday at Basingstoke station in Hampshire.
Thousands of workers in Belfast downed tools yesterday to join a silent
tribute to the victims of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Shankill Road.
About 6,000 workers - the vast majority Protestants - from the Harland and
Wolff shipyard and the Shorts aerospace factory marched across the city for
a service of remembrance outside the Methodist church next to the site of
the bombed fish shop.
The service was arranged at the request of shop stewards from the two
factories.
A 22-year-old Catholic taxi driver shot in Belfast hours after the Shankill
Road bombing died in hospital yesterday, police said.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Decline in London rush-hour travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people travelling to work in central London in the morning
rush-hour has fallen to its lowest level for more than 30 years, the
Department of Transport said yesterday.
Fewer than 1m people entered central London between 7am and 10am each day
last year. This represents a fall of 14 per cent from the peak year of 1988.
This mirrored a drop of 500,000 to 3.5m in the total employment available in
London over the same period. Public transport use has also fallen from 1988
with declines of 8 per cent on Underground miles travelled, 10 per cent on
rail mileage and 7 per cent on buses.
In the period 1989 to 1991 Londoners travelled an average of 5,600 miles a
year on personal business, an increase of 28 per cent on 1975-76. This
largely reflected increased car ownership - car travel made up two-thirds of
the total distance travelled.
In 1991, 52 per cent of people living in outer London travelled to work by
car while 35 per cent used public transport. In inner London the picture was
reversed with only 30 per cent of commuters using cars and 51 per cent using
of public transport.
Road traffic speeds have fallen since 1968 and vehicles now move at an
average of just over 10mph during the day in central London.
However, the most recent figures for inner London showed a slight increase
in traffic speeds from just under 12mph in 1986-1990 to just over 13mph in
the morning rush-hour in 1991.
Underground mileage travelled is at its highest level for 30 years while the
increased use of midi and mini-buses has boosted mile-age travelled by the
bus network.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Tube line extension set for go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will on Friday give the formal go-ahead for the construction
of the Pounds 1.7bn extension of the Underground's Jubilee Line to Canary
Wharf in London's Docklands, Robert Peston writes.
Barring last-minute hitches, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary; Sir
Wilfred Newton, chairman of London Transport; and Sir Brian Unwin, president
of the European Investment Bank, are planning to announce that all hurdles
to the construction have been cleared.
The last barrier to authorisation of the scheme is court approval for Canary
Wharf, the Docklands property development, to come out of administration
under UK insolvency procedures.
Only if Canary Wharf comes out of administration and is reconstituted as a
going concern will the project's bankers provide the Pounds 400m
contribution to the costs which the government has made a condition of the
extension being built. The High Court is expected to allow Canary Wharf to
come out of administration on Friday.

FT  26 OCT 93 / NatWest raises charges for 1m small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday announced increases in charges for just
under a million small-business customers.
But the bank said that, to help businesses manage their cashflow, they would
be given a new option of paying charges on a monthly rather than on a
quarterly basis.
The announcement of small rises to the level of charges came just one day
after Lloyds said it would cut its transaction charges to small businesses
by 13 per cent from November 10.
At NatWest, however, from 6 December 6 the account maintenance charge for
the bank's basic tariff will rise from Pounds 7 to Pounds 7.50 a quarter.
Customers will pay 67p for each debit and credit item, compared with the
current charge of 66p.
The Lloyds price cut will see similar charges fall from 75p to 65p per
transaction, while the maintenance charge will remain unchanged at Pounds
2.50 per month.
Ms Jane Bradford, head of NatWest's small-business services, said: 'The
opportunity to settle charges each month, rather than a larger bill every
quarter, will help some small-business customers manage cashflow more
effectively and keep track of the charges they are paying.'
She added that the typical small-business customer, with 30 items passing
through the account each month, would pay only an extra Pounds 6 a year.
The basic tariff is intended for customers with an annual turnover of up to
Pounds 100,000. Larger businesses will still pay on the basis of
individ-ually negotiated charges, normally reviewed with each customer every
year. On average these will increase by about 2.6 per cent, but existing
charges will continue until the next review.
Last month Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, urged
executives of the big four clearing banks to do more to support small
businesses.
Midland is expected to announce its revised small-business charges for next
year later this month.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Carmakers to fuel new US export region -
Trade-based investment in the south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mercedes Benz, the German luxury carmaker, recently chose Alabama as
the site of its new American assembly plant, it joined an increasing number
of manufacturers, large and small, that have identified the American south
east as a good place to make and export their products.
Mercedes says its intends to export half the four-wheel drive sports utility
vehicles it will produce in Alabama. BMW, its main German competitor, also
aims to export about half of the new line of cars it will begin assembling
in neighbouring South Carolina in 1995.
The two big car companies are likely greatly to lift the region's export
figures. But exports from the south east have already been picking up in
recent years as the region has undergone a transformation from a low-tech
industrial backwater that once produced mainly for the domestic market.
Over the past decade pockets of high technology have developed and the motor
industry, especially from Japan and Europe, has moved in to take advantage
of its relatively low production costs.
While a number of the recent investors are multinational companies such as
Nissan, Robert Bosch, and Michelin, which export routinely, many small and
medium-sized local companies are discovering overseas markets, according to
economic development officials and experts in the region.
Between 1991 and 1992, exports from eight south-eastern states - North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky
and Tennessee - grew at more than twice the rate of the nation as a whole.
Exports from south-eastern states rose 13.5 per cent, from Dollars 44.9bn to
Dollars 51bn, while those for the nation as a whole grew a little more than
6 per cent, from Dollars 421bn to Dollars 448bn.
This surge in export activity has caught the eye of regional bankers, who
are focusing new attention on trade services, particularly to small and
medium-sized companies. Trade experts note that this is a especially welcome
development because, next to finding a market, finance is a small exporter's
chief problem.
After a period of massive expansion by acquisition, First Union, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, for example, is focusing much of its
energy on trade services. With the third-largest branch network in the
country, says Mr Andrew Oliksiw, First Union's trade services division
manager, 'there's no reasons for our customers to use Citibank for trade and
us for everything else'.
Trade transactions of small and medium-sized companies may not generate much
fee income, but big banks such as First Union can sell these customers an
array of other services that make the overall relationship profitable, says
Mr Oliksiw.
First Union had previously left the field open to its biggest competitor,
Nationsbank, the fourth-largest US bank, also based in Charlotte.
Nationsbank has an already well established reputation among small
companies. 'But', says Mr Erwin Carter, Nationsbank's chief of trade
finance, 'the challenge with a bank this size is and will continue to be on
the customer service side.'
Small exporters frequently complain that they are given short shrift because
their transactions are relatively tiny and that dealing with big bank
bureaucracies takes too much time.
The creation of a new, small British-owned bank that promises better service
looks set to provide some added competition. AmTrade International Bank,
with branches in Atlanta and Miami, began operating earlier this year under
a bank holding company controlled by Sir Michael Sandberg, former chairman
of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. It is targeting small and medium-sized
exporters in the South East and is almost exclusively devoted to trade
finance.
Sir Michael is building AmTrade on the foundation of a Dollars 6.5m
acquisition of First American Bank of Miami, which had a thriving trade
finance operation largely with Latin America.
State-level economic development officials, anxious to raise their state's
exports, are hoping that more bank competition will mean better trade
services for small companies. Tougher competition would be good, says Mr
Charles Schroder, chief of export promotion for the Georgia Housing and
Finance Authority.

CHINESE and US officials yesterday announced in Beijing a schedule of talks
on four areas of trade conflict, with the aim of winning agreement by the
December 31 deadline set by Washington for the opening of China's markets.
A trade official in the highest-ranking US delegation to visit China since
the 1989 student uprising, said the two countries had to place their
relationship 'on a sounder and firmer footing'.
In the past few weeks the Clinton administration has complained of China's
nuclear proliferation, human rights and trade policies. Mr Warren
Christopher, the secretary of state, and other officials have warned they
are prepared to remove China's Most Favoured Nation status, which gives it
access to tariff benefits.
The US action has been aimed at pushing China on a number of fronts well
before it is time, in June, to renew its MFN status. If China co-operates,
the US has said it is prepared to extend MFN status, which currently
requires annual renewal.
If China fails to heed US warnings, trade sanctions could go into effect by
the end of the year on the dispute over market access.
Transparency of trade rules, services, the enforcement of copyrights,
trademarks and patents and the transshipment of goods to the US through
third party countries are all on the talks agenda.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt fears ease over procurement hurdle -
Japanese pledge on construction contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNIFICANT new offers to open up national procurement markets were tabled
in Geneva yesterday, reducing concerns that disputes over the issue will
jeopardise progress towards successful completion of the Uruguay Round of
world trade liberalisation talks.
Japan tabled proposals to open up domestic construction contracts, both
national and regional, to international competition. This has been a
sticking point between Japan and the US in protracted bilateral negotiations
in Tokyo in recent weeks.
The US has also bowed to European Community pressure to include sub-federal
procurement business in the package being negotiated. A new US offer gave
assurances that contracts from 'entities from all 50 states' would be
subject to foreign competition.
'The US has yet to say which entities these are, but inclusion of
sub-federal bodies looks like good news,' an EC negotiator said yesterday.
Officials in Geneva yesterday were perplexed by suggestions that
disagreements over opening up the telecommunications sector had triggered a
crisis in talks. On the contrary, they noted the US and the EC had agreed a
memorandum of understanding in May this year hiving telecommunications off
from the procurement package. A joint study of the sector is in progress,
with a bilateral agreement targeted for March next year.
'It is true that telecommunications was formally withdrawn today,' an EC
negotiator said: 'But that was purely a technical matter and a surprise to
no one.'
The US and EC have been sparring over government procurement rules for
months. The US claims that bidding opportunities worth Dollars 16.8bn
(Pounds 11.1bn) were offered to EC contractors under the Gatt government
procurement code in 1990, compared with only Dollars 7.8bn in EC contracts
open to US companies.
The EC agrees that, in absolute terms, the 1990 Gatt figures confirm the US
is more generous; but Brussels officials argue the value of EC contracts
open to US companies rose sharply between 1985 and 1990, while the value of
US contracts fell over the same period.
Following withdrawal of telecommunications, talks have focused on three
areas: access to contracts awarded by central government, ranging from works
contracts to goods and services; access to similar contracts awarded by
local or sub-federal bodies; and contracts in the utilities sectors,
excluding telecommunications. These include electricity, gas, water and
transport.
The EC yesterday 'fleshed out' its procurement offer by detailing the 12,000
national and local bodies which would be subject to the agreement. Other
countries had not yet presented such detailed offers, 'but there seems a
fair chance we can get substantial liberalisation at a sub-federal level',
an EC negotiator said.
A US negotiator said the details of the US offer at a sub-federal level
remained 'very fluid', adding: 'We are working intensively with states
seeking commitments, but we don't want to force things on them.'
Disagreements have also narrowed over the threshold level at which contracts
will have to be opened up to competitive bidding, particularly in the
construction sector. The US, which has consistently pressed for the lowest
thresholds, has apparently raised its proposal closer to the majority
preference for Dollars 4.5m per contract. More significantly, Japan has
agreed to lower its proposal for a Dollars 15m threshold. It has not offered
a new figure, which 'is being negotiated internally', an official said in
Geneva.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Siemens powers ahead in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is expanding in the
Chinese power plant market through a joint venture to make instrumentation
and control (I&amp;C) equipment there.
The venture, Siemens Power Plant Automation, will be 60 per cent-owned by
Siemens, with the balance held by Nanjing Electric Power Automation
Equipment General Factory, controlled by the Chinese ministry for the
electric power industry.
The venture will be based in a special economic zone in Nanjing, 150 miles
from Shanghai, and will employ about 100 people when fully established.
It will focus on producing, selling and servicing the Teleperm ME process
control system, developed by Siemens for large power plants, but will
subsequently also produce hardware such as electronic equipment cabinets.
The joint venture is the latest in a string of link-ups between western and
Chinese power equipment suppliers, prompted by China's surging demand for
power capacity. Advanced I&amp;C equipment increases the reliability,
cost-effectiveness and service life of plant while reducing fuel consumption
and emissions.
The tie-up replaces Nasic, another venture set up in 1991 by KWU, the
Siemens power equipment subsidiary, with the same partner.
Siemens said preparations were under way for further joint ventures in
China.

FT  26 OCT 93 / World Trade News: French managers back Gatt peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST French employers would prefer their government to make a compromise,
even a 'mediocre' one, in the Gatt trade negotiations, rather than risk
isolating the country by opposing a Gatt deal, according to an Ifop poll
published in La Tribune, a business daily, yesterday.
The Ifop polling organisation found that 79 per cent of the top managers of
408 companies canvassed last week backed compromise, and that 67 per cent
believed the government was paying undue attention to farmers' interests to
the detriment of industry and the service sector.
The poll is another sign that the mood for compromise is gaining ground in
France, with more than half (54 per cent) the employers believing a Gatt
deal would help pull France of recession. But it is typical of this silent
majority of French businessmen that they are only ready to vouchsafe their
pro-Gatt views to the anonymity of an opinion poll, because these views are
still at odds with general public sentiment.
In a BVA poll for France 2 television, two-thirds backed prime minister
Edouard Balladur's tough public stance on Gatt. Eighty-one per cent believed
a Gatt deal on present terms would endanger French farming, while 75 per
cent felt it would reinforce American economic dominance.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Clutching at straws in the off-year polls: Jurek Martin
assesses the role of the great tax revolt, women's card and religious right
in the US local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE larger straws in the wind of off-year elections are always earnestly
clutched, if at times not firmly. This year, while the New York mayoral race
is, as ever, sui generis, the races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey
and a number of tax and social issue ballots, notably in the west, form the
basis for discerning national trends.
The leading questions that may be answered on November 2 include:
Is the great tax revolt really over and are Americans resigned to the
inevitability of having to pay more locally as well as nationally? If
Governor Jim Florio, a Democrat, is returned in New Jersey, an affirmative
case will exist. The jury may be split, however, if a majority of anti-tax
initiatives in over 20 states carry.
If last year saw women make great strides in elections, will this year's
suggest it was a fluke? A defeat for Mary Sue Terry in Virginia and
Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey, both early favourites, will be adduced
to suggest it was, though neither have seriously played the women's card.
Is the religious right on the rise again after serious setbacks in 1992? A
victory in Virginia for George Allen, especially if complemented by a win
for his lieutenant-governor running mate, might imply it is, at least in its
southern base. The expected defeat for the school voucher proposition in
California would suggest the reverse, though the margin will be closely
watched.
In reality, as Tip O'Neill, former Speaker of the House, used to say 'all
politics is local'. But the Florio-Whitman match-up has attracted wider
attention not only because New Jersey is a big bellwether state. It has
drawn into the fray two of the most skilled political operatives, James
Carville, of Clinton campaign fame, to Mr Florio, and Ed Rollins, the
Republican who flirted with Ross Perot last year, to Mrs Whitman.
It has also been, remarkably, as much a battle of ideas as personalities.
Two years ago, having steeply increased state taxation, Mr Florio was
probably the most unpopular man in the state, even suffering the
mortification of seeing the Democrats lose control of the legislature.
Having enforced some gun control and vetoed attempts at repeal, he was a
prime target of the National Rifle Association and its vast resources.
Yet he has had the brass nerve to run on his record, which might be
described as Clintonite even before Bill Clinton became president. He has
unashamedly welcomed the president and his wife to New Jersey just when
other Democratic aspirants were turning the other way.
Mrs Whitman, barely known when she nearly beat the popular incumbent Senator
Bill Bradley in 1990, seemed to be riding a tide, easily ahead in the polls
earlier in the year. But she took a chunk of the summer off, saw her
campaign organisation get involved in unseemly spats and often seemed stiff
in debate against Mr Florio, not for nothing a former boxer.
Most controversially she said it was still possible to cut state taxes (by
10 per cent a year for three years). Her plan received some approval - from
Forbes magazine, for example, though this may be because its publisher,
Steve Forbes, helped design it. But it provided a ripe target for Mr Florio,
something of a Lazarus if his current 5-15 point polling lead holds up.
Like Mrs Whitman, Mary Sue Terry in Virginia suffers from being apparently
less warm and lovable than her male opponent, but this is hardly because of
her sex. A former state attorney general, she is as close as it comes to
being a female 'good ol' boy', with a lifetime in the smoke-filled rooms of
Virginia Democratic party politics. She could hardly be more different from
one of last year's female successes, Mrs Patty Murray, who won election to
the Senate from Washington state last year by campaigning as 'the mom in
tennis shoes'.
Her career as a professional politician is part of the Terry problem. The
state has moved on a lot since it was run by the reactionary Byrd Democratic
machine. It has a Democratic black governor, Doug Wilder, and a progressive
Democratic senator, Chuck Robb. Its expanding northern suburbs, near
Washington, are nothing like as conservative as the old south.
But new Virginia Democrats are forever falling out, as was evident from the
vicious Wilder-Robb feud, leaving Ms Terry, perhaps for the first time, very
much on her political own.
Nevertheless she, too, held big leads, of up to 30 points, over George
Allen, all of which and maybe more, has apparently evaporated. A
conservative Republican state legislator, Mr Allen and the Republican
candidate for lieutenant-governor, Michael Farris, who are not paired on the
ballot paper, are indisputably of the right, anointed at a convention
dominated by religious fundamentalists and their new secular hero, Lt Col
Oliver North, the architect of Iran-Contra who is eying the Senate next
year.
Ms Terry, over-emphasising the negative with some indifferent commercials,
has tried to make Mr Farris, the harder right of the two, and Mr North the
bogeymen of the race. Mr Allen, genial and an effective campaigner, has
countered by talking 'issues' - ending parole for prisoners, cracking down
on crime and slashing the state budget but with only a modest recourse, on
his own account, to invocations of the Lord.
Out west various education propositions long on the right wing wish-list
would make easier the maintenance of private, often religious, schools. In
California, Governor Pete Wilson, the ambitious Republican whose stock is
also rising, a la Florio, from the depths, is leading the opposition.
In Washington, Bill Gates of Microsoft has given Dollars 80,000 to the fight
against two anti-tax initiatives on the grounds that they would destroy
state higher education. 'This dwarfs all my previous political
contributions,' he said, demonstrating that at least one American is taking
these off-year elections very seriously indeed.

FT  26 OCT 93 / UN warns Haiti of new sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council yesterday threatened additional
sanctions against Haiti's military rulers unless an accord calling for the
restoration of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was fully
implemented.
The new warning was announced as UN special envoy Dante Caputo continued
intensive efforts in Haiti aimed at Mr Aristide's return by a Saturday
deadline.
Mr Aristide's return was originally agreed as part of a United
Nations-brokered plan aimed at restoring Haiti to democracy. The plan was
signed on New York's Governor Island last July by Mr Aristide and army chief
General Raoul Cedras, who overthrew him in a 1991 coup.
The threatened new sanctions would include a complete trade embargo, on top
of an arms and oil ban and a freeze on financial assets that were reimposed
last week.
Haitian legislators will begin debate today on new laws proposed by
pro-military parliamentarians, which would include a broad amnesty for all
political crimes committed since the military forced Mr Aristide out two
years ago.
Legislators are also to consider the broadening of Mr Aristide's cabinet to
include supporters of the military, and legislation to separate the army and
the police. 'It is essential the parliament meets (today),' Mr Caputo said
yesterday.
Mr Robert Malval, the premier appointed by Mr Aristide, and Gen Cedras, the
army leader, met last night to discuss Gen Cedras' undertaking to step aside
as soon as parliament ratifies the new laws, but little progress was made in
the talks and the two will meet again on Wednesday.
There are doubts that MPs who support Mr Aristide will attend parliament
today. Most went into hiding a fortnight ago when an armed gang, held to be
supporters of the military, invaded parliament and abducted some members.

SALES OF existing US homes climbed 2.6 per cent in September to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.91m, the highest level this year, the National
Association of Realtors said, Reuter reports from Washington.
The association's president, Mr William Chee, said: 'Low interest rates and
a positive expectancy about the economy clearly have set the stage for prime
home buying conditions.' The association said there was an impressive
turnout of first-time buyers, another sign of the positive effect of low
interest rates.
September sales - which exceeded Wall Street economists' forecasts - were
the highest since the 4.04m units recorded in December last year and stood
15.7 per cent above the 3.38m level seen a year ago.
Mr John Tuccillo, an economist with the association, said: 'Strong housing
markets have always had a positive impact on the whole economic picture.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / US may support small oil groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Energy Department is to launch a study into whether the smaller
independent companies in the American oil and gas industry should receive
greater government support.
Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, said in London yesterday that US-based,
large multinational oil companies had the international experience and
financial resources to diversify away from the US, where oil production is
steadily falling.
The same could not be said of many of the independents, whose future would
remain in the US. 'We owe them some obligation to find some answers for
them,' she said.
Mrs O'Leary said the study would determine whether there was a need to offer
strategic support to the independent oil sector, in the same way that the
Clinton administration was proposing to help the US car industry to develop
a non-petrol burning, zero-emission passenger vehicle in the next century.
She offered little short-term relief to the industry, however.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR years of free-market reforms in Mexico have helped lift more than 1m
Mexicans out of poverty, a UN-sponsored study has found, AP reports from
Mexico City.
The drop in the poverty rate - reversing a long trend - comes as the US
Congress debates whether Mexico's living standards are rising sufficiently
for it to join in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The study, conducted by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean and the Mexican government, found 13.6m Mexicans lived in 'extreme
poverty' in 1992, about 16.2 per cent of the population. That is an 8.7 per
cent drop from 1989's total of 14.9m people, or 18.9 per cent of the
population.
The fall came despite a growth in Mexico's population; between 1984 and 1989
the poorest segment of the population grew by 6.3 per cent annually, said Mr
Pedro Sainz, director of the study.
'More Mexicans than ever have improved their ability to feed themselves and
meet the basic necessities for their well-being,' the study concluded.
Mr Carlos M Jarque, head of the Mexican government's National Statistic
Institute, said the results were extremely encouraging.
President Carlos Salinas has sold off more than 900 state enterprises since
taking office in 1988 and mounted a successful assault on inflation. He has
vowed to lift Mexico into the ranks of the developed world through Nafta,
which would link his country with Canada and the US in a bloc of 362m
consumers.

FT  26 OCT 93 / The Cyprus communique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commonwealth heads of government met in Cyprus from October 21 to 25. Of
the 47 countries that attended the meeting, 36 were represented by heads of
state.
GLOBAL TRENDS AND PROSPECTS
Heads of government welcomed continued easing of global tensions and
expressed conviction that the United Nations was now better placed than ever
before to fulfil its role. . . They underscored the complementary role which
the Commonwealth and regional organisations could play in supporting the
efforts of the UN.
They reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, fundamental human rights, the
rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and just and honest
government as essential ingredients of the Commonwealth's fundamental
political values.
Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom
were inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing.
Commonwealth leaders stressed the need to strengthen international security
through disarmament and non-proliferation.
They noted the world economy faced grave uncertainties but believed the
current climate of low inflation and declining interest rates presented
opportunities for economic recovery.
They welcomed the broadening political consensus on market-friendly
measures, combined with human resource development and poverty reduction.
They acknowledged special difficulties of sub-Saharan Africa and noted the
performances of many countries were constrained by weak commodity prices and
deteriorating terms of trade. Big efforts were still required throughout the
developing world to overcome institutional, economic and financial barriers
to stronger growth; they also recognised these reforms should be supported
by an appropriate blend of adjustment and external financing.
They expressed disquiet at the continuing debt problems of many developing
countries and called for measures to cut the debt burden to sustainable
levels and for the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms.
They noted with concern that official development assistance had fallen in
real terms and called for action to reverse the fall in aid flows.
Commonwealth leaders noted with appreciation numerous practical measures
undertaken by the Secretariat to promote the Commonwealth fundamental
political values, including monitoring elections in seven member states.
SOUTH AFRICA
Commonwealth leaders agreed that developments had marked irreversible
progress to democracy.
They endorsed lifting of sanctions but the arms embargo would remain until a
new post-apartheid government was established with full democratic control
and accountability. But the communique recognised that the process remained
fragile and agreed the pre-eminent need was to help ensure a united,
non-fragmented, democratic and non-racial South Africa.
They agreed the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa should remain
in South Africa until after the election planned for April 1994 when the
situation would be reviewed.
MOZAMBIQUE
Leaders expressed concern at recurring delays in implementing the October
1992 peace accord and called on the Renamo opposition party to comply fully
with its terms, including despatch of its personnel to UN-administered
assembly points. They urged all concerned to co-operate in ensuring
multi-party elections are held by October 1994 and called on Renamo to
co-operate with the government in the speedy completion of an election law.
ANGOLA
They deplored continuation of the civil war and called on Unita to end
hostilities. Failure on the part of Unita to comply with UN Security Council
resolutions on Angola would justify further sanctions and other measures.
CYPRUS
Commonwealth leaders reiterated support for the independence, sovereignty,
territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus.
They stressed the importance of securing compliance with all the UN
resolutions on Cyprus, divided when Turkey invaded the northern part in
1974. Lack of progress would prompt the Commonwealth secretary general to
request the UN Security Councilto consider alternative ways to promote
effective implementation of the UN resolutions.
MIDDLE EAST
Commonwealth leaders welcomed the agreement of September 13 1993 between the
government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and expressed
the hope that the momentum for peace would be sustained.
BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA
They expressed deep concern at the continuing hostilities and urged the

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commonwealth calls for withdrawal of foreign forces and
settlers from Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commonwealth leaders called for 'the speedy withdrawal of all foreign forces
and settlers' from Cyprus and expressed 'grave concern over the continued
influx of Turkish settlers'.
But although the toughly worded statement went on to condemn what it called
'the negative attitude of the Turkish Cypriot side' to recent United Nations
'confidence building measures', it proposed no new initiatives.
However, if no progress were made, said the communique, the Commonwealth
would 'fully support' Security Council consideration of unspecified
'alternative ways' to implement Council resolutions on Cyprus.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Indonesia's ruling party elects civilian chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S ruling Golkar party yesterday sought to distance itself, at
least publicly, from the military by electing a civilian as its chairman for
the first time.
He is Mr Harmoko, currently Information Minister and a close confidant of
President Suharto. The election, at the end of a five-day party conference,
was backed by the president, who saw his own grip over Golkar tightened with
the appointment of two of his children to its executive board.
Indonesian politics is a notoriously closed-door affair in which outsiders
are given few clues as to what the changes in leading personnel mean.
Diplomats believe, however, that there is a growing rift between some armed
forces officers and 72-year-old President Suharto over the choice of his
eventual successor. As the ruling party will be instrumental in the
emergence of the next leader, diplomats suggest the president is trying to
reduce the military's role in Golkar.
The armed forces, however, remain the dominant political force in Indonesia
and their members control many of Golkar's important provincial branches.
The promotion of civilians within Golkar's central leadership may cause some
resentment.
In particular, the appointments of Ms Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and Mr Bambang
Trihatmodjo, children of President Suharto, to the 45-member executive board
is likely to spark widespread debate.
Both have enjoyed successful business careers, establishing companies in the
early 1980s which currently have a combined annual turnover of several
billion dollars. Until now, however, they have kept a low political profile.

Economy

<TEXT>
INDICATIONS of a small pick-up in Japanese retail sales were yesterday
disappointed when department stores reported a 6.7 per cent decline in sales
for last month.
The year-on-year fall, for the 19th month running, came despite the apparent
popularity of a series of sales drives in mid-September, the Japan
Department Stores Association said. Demand from corporate buyers was weak,
while private customers' sentiment was damped by the string of typhoons to
hit Japan over the past month.
Further evidence of the extent of Japan's recession emerged on the first day
of a three-day conference of regional managers of the Bank of Japan, the
central bank.
Companies across the country reported a sharp decline in export volumes
because of the yen's strength, said managers.
Corporate profits were still being revised downwards and demand for capital
remained weak.
Separately, Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the minister of international trade and
industry, hinted that if the economy failed to improve, the government would
consider further pump-priming measures, on top of the two packages so far
this year.
He told Japan's foreign trade council that the packages did not appear to
have worked well.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Commonwealth seeks to push role of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMASSOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONWEALTH last night moved to carve out a new role for itself as a
pressure group for international economic and political reform.
In a communique at the end of the five-day biennial summit, the Commonwealth
leaders called for urgent trade reform, improved debt relief terms for poor
countries and action on human rights.
The conference was the first for 30 years not to be dominated by South
Africa, and the 50-member body was seeking a new cause.
It was also coming to terms with its limitations, acknowledging that its
capacity to resolve even its own members' disputes, whether Cyprus or
Kashmir, is often slight.
South Africa remained high on the agenda, with the conference communique
welcoming the fact that the changes undertaken marked the 'irreversible'
ending of apartheid, but warning that the transition to a democratic
government was 'fragile'. Commonwealth leaders announced plans for a 60-70
strong team to help monitor next April's scheduled general election.
Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, together with Mr John Major, his
UK counterpart, helped galvanise the Commonwealth into action on the trade
issue, with talks dominated by ways of securing a successful end to the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks by the mid-December deadline. As a
result, a Commonwealth delegation of trade ministers is to tour the world's
leading capitals to press the case for agreement.
The other key issue was debt relief. Mr Major urged a write-off of up to 80
per cent of official debt of developing countries embracing economic reform
programmes endorsed by the World Bank and IMF.
The communique also promised renewed emphasis on the need for democracy and
respect of human rights among member states, but it resisted suggestions
that members should be monitored.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, invited the Commonwealth to be a watchdog in
post-apartheid South Africa but the conference did not follow up his offer.
Other inconsistencies remain. A delegation from Chief Moshood Abiola, winner
of Nigeria's annulled presidential poll last June, was refused a hearing,
while delegates of the military - backed government took their seats.
Cameroon's application for membership will be accepted in 1995 provided it
has met the Commonwealth's professed standards, yet when existing members
such as Sierra Leone flagrantly breach them, they pay no penalty.
For all the body's shortcomings however, leaders still think it is worth
their time: Ms Benazir Bhutto felt the conference important enough to fly in
just 48 hours after her victory in the Pakistan election.
Meanwhile, its numbers are growing. When the conference reassembles in 1995
South Africa will have rejoined, Cameroon could be re-admitted and
Mozambique will almost certainly have its application on the table.
By then the observation of Mr Major will have been put to the test: 'What we
cannot do, we should not pretend to do. . . but what we do decide to do, we
must do well.'
He was talking about the UN, but the words apply with equal force to the
Commonwealth.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Inside the prisons of the intifada: Life in the jails of the
occupied territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELCOME to the detention centre, says the sign in Hebrew outside Gaza's
Ansar II prison, presumably for the benefit of Israeli soldiers unfortunate
enough to be stationed there.
Underneath, the same message in Arabic has greeted the thousands of intifada
offenders who have passed through the gates since the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation broke out in late 1987.
Ansar II, in common with the other jails in Israel and the occupied
territories where Palestinian prisoners are held, is a dump - a coastal
sprawl of tents, concrete offices, barbed-wire fencing and olive-green watch
towers.
It is a dump, though, that is nearing the end of its life. Under an
agreement reached by Israeli and negotiators for the Palestine Liberation
Organisation last Thursday, Israel yesterday released 700 Palestinian
detainees - the old, the young, the sick and the women.
In the weeks and months ahead, almost all the 10,000 or so Palestinians now
in jail are to be freed. Only a few hundred inmates 'with Israeli blood on
their hands' may be kept in custody.
Some of those identified with Yassir Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of
the PLO, such as Salim Zriri, released earlier this week after 23 years in
Israeli captivity, may become leading supporters of the Israeli-PLO autonomy
programme.
Others, though, members of Hamas and the rest of the Palestinian
rejectionist groups, will be the peace accord's most dangerous opponents.
Inside Ansar II, as at the other jails, the Fatah and Hamas inmates are kept
strictly apart.
The bearded, sullen men of Hamas have the worst conditions, sleeping in
crowded tents, crammed into a narrow compound that allows little space for
exercise. Most of the Fatah detainees, by contrast, sleep in squat concrete
buildings - also inside fenced-off compounds, but with more room to walk
around, room, too, for table-tennis tables supplied by the Red Cross.
Ansar II is a holding jail with space for just a few hundred, a first stop
for alleged offenders, from killers to graffiti artists. Brought in for
questioning, they can then be held, tried, transferred or freed.
Life in the compounds is dull but not especially harsh. The Red Cross
ensures that the food is good. The Israelis are non-intrusive beyond calling
the prisoners together twice a day for roll-call: inmates squat on their
haunches in lines, and bob up when their names are called.
But in a nearby interrogation centre, run by the Shin Bet security service,
there are no niceties.
The first stage of a Shin Bet interrogation routinely involves a prisoner
being blindfolded, handcuffed behind his back and left to stand outside for
hours.
Those who don't co-operate can be kept for days, alone or in pairs, in tiny,
filthy cells, defecating into plastic buckets. The Israeli human rights
group, B'Tselem, has documented several cases of alleged torture by the Shin
Bet at Ansar II.
Friday is visiting day. Long lines of anxious Palestinian mothers wait to
spend a few minutes face-to-face - across a wire grill - with their sons.
For most prisoners this is the only chance to leave the compounds; only the
shawish - the Palestinian trusty in each compound through whom all
communication with the Israelis is conducted - can move move freely around
the jail.
The Israelis are not proud of Ansar II or the other prisons like it. When
Israel television was preparing a news report on prisoner releases this
week, it had to resort to archive footage of the Ketziot jail in the Negev
Desert; the military authorities would not allow a camera crew inside any of
the jails to shoot fresh film.
The Israelis are also acutely aware that the prisons have served only to
re-inforce opposition to the occupation.
Far from being a deterrent, a jail term is essential to the credibility of
any self-respecting Palestinian activist.
It is richly ironic that, with the dawn of Palestinian self-rule, many of
those PLO loyalists now serving their final week inside Israeli jails may
well soon be joining the Palestinian police force - working alongside the
Israeli military authorities to ensure a smooth transfer of power from
Israeli to Palestinian hands in the occupied territories.
The Israeli authorities do not normally allow reporters into prisons for
Palestinians. David Horovitz saw Ansar II from the inside while serving
there as an Israeli army reservist last year.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners at the beginning of
a mass release aimed at bolstering the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and
winning over Palestinian opponents.
However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, cancelled the release of
members of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements,
after the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza
Strip on Sunday by the Hamas' military wing.
Both groups reject the peace accord and have vowed to fight against it. Mr
Rabin also told a parliamentary committee that 'prisoners with blood on
their hands will not be released'.
By the end of today Israel plans to have freed up to 700 prisoners, mostly
the sick, women, youths and men over 50, as a first step in the phased
release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Most of those released this week have been imprisoned on minor 'offences'
such as membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation, demonstrating and
throwing stones.
Thousands of relatives crowded at the Eretz checkpoint crossing into Gaza
and cheered as buses delivered prisoners to their freedom. Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza closed stores and observed a one-day strike to press
for further releases.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation sees the release of prisoners as key
to confidence-building between the two sides in talks on implementing the
peace accord which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. The
PLO is demanding a much swifter release of all prisoners held on non-life
threatening charges and is calling for the release of prisoners of all
groups, including Hamas and its leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
The release of Hamas activists, however, has drawn a barrage of criticism
from the Israeli public. Opposition to the freeing of Hamas prisoners is
likely to grow after the incident in Gaza on Sunday and release yesterday of
a leaflet by Hamas which called the killing of the two soldiers their 'gift
to the peace process' and proclaimed: 'There is no peace between us and the
Israelis except in the cemetery.'
Despite the PLO's insistence on the release of all prisoners regardless of
their political affiliation, Israeli officials believe there is a growing
opportunity to drive a wedge between moderate and secular Palestinians, who
support the peace process, and the rejectionist and Islamic fundamentalist
groups opposing it.
Mr Rabin also told the parliamentary committee yesterday that Palestinian
attacks against Israelis had fallen dramatically since the signing of the
peace accord last month.
Attacks in Gaza were down this month to 30, from 60 in September, and in the
West Bank to 44, from 59 last month.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Ukraine assures US about its atomic weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S President Leonid Kravchuk has assured Mr Warren Christopher, the
visiting US secretary of state, that his republic is committed to becoming a
non-nuclear power.
But his foreign minister, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, has reiterated that Ukraine
cannot dismantle all its nuclear weapons without Dollars 2.8bn of western
assistance.
While Mr Christopher reported that the Ukrainian parliament intended to
ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) next month, it is still
unclear when it will dismantle its 1,656 nuclear weapons or accede to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear power - something
President Kravchuk agreed to in 1992. Ukraine is currently the third largest
nuclear power in the world.
In addition to financial assistance, Ukraine is looking to the US for
security guarantees to protect its borders from neighbouring Russia through
'an expansion of Nato'. Mr Zlenko said: 'The sooner we receive aid and
guarantees, the sooner Ukraine will follow through with its commitments.'
Mr Christopher responded that 'security assurances would certainly be within
contemplation', once Ukraine became non-nuclear.
Mr Christopher and his Ukrainian counterpart yesterday signed an accord
under which the US will provide Dollars 175m as initial help to dismantle
nuclear missiles.
Two small accords were announced for enhancing the safety of Ukrainian
nuclear power stations and for establishing a science and technology centre
to keep highly trained Ukrainian nuclear scientists well paid and working in
the republic.
Mr Christopher also came to promote economic ties between the two nations,
offering Dollars 155m in agricultural credits and technical assistance for
1994. The US plans to expand trade and private investment through lowering
tariffs on Ukrainian goods and helping the republic join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said he would continue to press
Ukraine to dismantle its nuclear arsenal. 'I understand their position, but
I think it is not justified because we are making progress with Russia, too,
in complying with all these agreements,' he said.

The French car market is forecast to shrink about 16 per cent this year in

available to Ms Dorothea Holland, head of the German probe.
The link is the first significant development in the case involving VW
production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and several
associates, all former General Motors employees, since Ms Holland led a raid
on VW's headquarters in August.
Mr Lopez and his colleagues are suspected of systematically collecting vast
quantities of industrial data while employed at GM and its German
subsidiary, Adam Opel. He has admitted having ordered the destruction of
'possibly sensitive' GM material at VW.
The German authorities granted the FBI access to Ms Holland's findings after
top-level negotiations between Washington and Bonn and the Hesse regional
government. Mr Georg Nauth, for the Darmstadt prosecutors' office, confirmed
the move yesterday.
Ms Holland was still sifting data from 25 computers and 250 diskettes seized
in the VW raid, in an 'enormously complex' exercise, Mr Nauth added. Asked
if new evidence had been found, he replied: 'I don't want to say.'
While the German investigation has slowed, the US probe has gained momentum
with the summoning of a grand jury which will decide whether the evidence
justifies indictment.
The FBI has had access to all General Motors' material and affidavits
involved in the case, and is also believed to have questioned officials from
Volkswagen of America, VW's US subsidiary.
Possible charges against Mr Lopez, his colleagues and the company include
wire or mail fraud, which carry possible penalties of imprisonment or fines.
US law prohibits the use of postal or telecommunications services for
illegal purposes which include 'violations of obligations of loyal and
fruitful service' to an employer.

<TEXT>
SPAIN'S economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, has warned that
benchmark interest rates in Spain, now at a historic low of 9.25 per cent
following cuts last week, are unlikely to fall further in the immediate
future.
In an interview with the Madrid business newspaper Expansion to be published
today, Mr Solbes said: 'In the present conditions we have pretty well
reached the limit on interest rate reductions. It is difficult to determine
the absolute limit but we are pretty close to it.'
He added, however, that external factors such as a further cut in French
interest rates and a fall in German inflation could give Spain's monetary
authorities 'a certain room for manoeuvre'.
The only domestic factor that would allow rates to be lowered, Mr Solbes
said, would be agreement on pay restraint and on reform of labour market
rigidities.
Discussions between the government, employers and unions on an incomes
policy and on the labour laws are due to begin tomorrow. Mr Solbes said that
although the government preferred to negotiate these issues it would act
unilaterally if necessary.

POLAND'S coalition partners last night agreed on a cabinet only hours before
its formal presentation today to President Lech Walesa.
Five hours of tense negotiations between the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD)
and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) saw Mr Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister
and PSL leader, drop his nominee for privatisation minister in favour of Mr
Wieslaw Kaczmarek, a banker from the SLD free market wing.
Earlier in the day Mr Pawlak had unveiled a list without consulting the SLD
and giving his party control of more economic ministries than his coalition
partners had previously agreed to accept.
The new ministers are expected to be sworn in by Mr Walesa today. However,
the coalition will have to win a vote of confidence within two weeks in
parliament where they control two-thirds of the seats following last month's
election.
Mr Marek Borowski, a former internal trade minister from the SLD, will be
finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the economy; Mr
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, also an SLD supporter, is to be justice minister
and deputy premier responsible for social policy; Mr Alexander Luczak from
the PSL will be education minister and deputy premier responsible for
defence, internal and foreign affairs; Mr Andrzej Milczanowski remains
interior minister; Mr Andrzej Olechowski becomes foreign minister; and
Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk gets defence.

Mr Solbes said that although the government preferred to negotiate these

'not renounce' its plans to peg salaries to below the inflation index over
the next three years. Overhaul of labour legislation was also 'an essential

INFLATION in two key west German states edged upwards in the month to
mid-October, although year-on-year price increases appeared to be steadying,
according to preliminary figures published yesterday, writes Christopher
Parkes in Frankfurt.
Prices in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, rose 0.2 per cent
in the review period and were 3.7 per cent up on the year, compared with 3.8
per cent in September. Wealthy Baden-Wurttemberg reported a 0.3 per cent
month-on-month rise for an annual rate of 4.1 per cent, unchanged from
September.
Yesterday's numbers showed that rents and services - up around 6 per cent in
both regions - are still providing most impetus to price rises, while
insurance costs have also risen markedly.
North Rhine-Westphalia's statistics office said local inflation for the
first 10 months of the year was 4 per cent. Latest estimates from the
Bundesbank suggest the west German rate will be below 4 per cent before the
end of the year.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Paris puts on brave face over UK's nuclear 'Non'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE claimed yesterday it would not let disappointment at the UK
government's decision to cancel an air-launched missile project affect its
desire for closer Anglo-French nuclear co-operation.
Paris had hoped London would join it in extending the range of an existing
Aerospatiale air-fired missile into a nuclear weapon for both countries' air
forces, in order to share costs.
But last week the UK, with an even stronger desire to save money, decided to
abandon any such idea and to rely instead solely on its Trident nuclear
submarines.
At a joint Paris news conference with his UK counterpart, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, France's defence minister, Mr Francois Leotard, said diplomatically
'we take note of it (the British decision), but we think it would be a pity
to sacrifice what has been achieved in the nuclear dialogue between France
and Britain over the past two years'.
Both ministers praised the usefulness of this dialogue, which has focused
chiefly on such issues as how and against whom Europe's two nuclear powers
might consider using their atomic arsenals, as well as questions of nuclear
non-proliferation and testing.
Mr Rifkind, who later today will visit France's nuclear submarine base at
Brest, was slightly more open than UK ministers have been on the eventual
possibility of the two countries' nuclear submarines patrolling together,
saying 'discussion on this could not be excluded in the weeks and months to
come'.
However, a French official said yesterday: 'With the British, it is always
the same - the courtship is fine, but we never get into bed.'
Collaboration on conventional arms is easier, with the UK, France and Italy
committed to building frigates together. Earlier yesterday, Mr Leotard took
Mr Rifkind to his southern mayoralty of Frejus and to Eurocopter, the
Franco-German joint venture which hopes to sell its Tiger anti-tank
helicopter to the UK. Mr Rifkind said it would take the UK a year from now
to make its helicopter decision.
With his defence review drawing to a close, Mr Leotard said the new French
government accepted a closer relationship with a reformed Nato, but gave no
indication this might allow him to start attending regular Nato meetings.
Mr Leotard said France had 'an open attitude' to the possibility of
extending Nato to east European countries, but felt that the Western
European Union, converted by the Maastricht treaty into a defence arm of the
EC, had to play a role.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Dissent at the heart of German forecasting: How one of the
six economic research institutes differs on analysis and policy implications
of continued stagnation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time in more than six years Germany's independent economic
research institutes yesterday had to agree to disagree in their economic
forecasts.
The Berlin-based Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) produced
its own figures in an addendum to the report of the majority, suggesting
that, far from a recovery in the German economy next year, it will continue
to stagnate.
The disagreement between the DIW and the other five institutes which jointly
produce the biannual economic forecasts goes to the heart of economic,
financial and monetary policy in Germany.
The five expect an overall economic recovery, with a 1.5 per cent growth
rate in the all-German figures - with 1 per cent in the west, and 7 per cent
in the east. The DIW opts for a fall of 0.5 per cent in the west, (compared
with a fall of 2 per cent this year), and a rise of only 5 per cent in the
east (compared with a 5.5 per cent rise in 1993). For Germany as a whole,
the DIW forecasts mean zero growth for 1994.
Far from expecting a gradual but appreciable recovery fuelled by private
investment, the DIW fears that long-term investment will continue to
decline, and that the turning point will come - at the earliest - around the
middle of the year.
The institute concludes that instead of continuing to squeeze public sector
spending, the government should switch to an investment stimulation
programme. And the Bundesbank, far from continuing its slow but steady
reduction in short-term interest rates, should accelerate the pace.
At the heart of the DIW argument, presented yesterday by Mr Heiner
Flassbeck, the institute's chief economist, is the persistent inverse
structure of German interest rates: short-term rates, dictated by the
Bundesbank's Lombard and discount rates, have remained stubbornly higher
than the long-term capital market rates.
That means that short-term financial instruments remain more attractive for
investors than long-term investments. The reason is a lack of adequate
demand for long-term money.
The DIW estimates that a reduction in the gap between short- and long-term
rates would not be adequate to revive long-term investment activity. 'Only
with a normalisation of the interest rate structure will the economy be
given the necessary impetus for growth,' it says.
Long-term rates have fallen because overall demand for capital has fallen
faster than the supply of capital: industry is looking for less long-term
capital to invest, because of depressed profit expectations.
As long as those profit expectations remain depressed, Mr Flassbeck argues,
there will be no revival in investment, and it is up to the public sector to
provide the necessary economic stimulus. Far from concentrating on reducing
the public sector share in national income, as urged by the other
institutes, the Bundesbank, and the government, it should be providing a
stimulus.
Structural cuts in public sector spending - such as the social spending cuts
proposed by the government - should be carried out as soon as economic
recovery is under way, but not before, he says.
The other five institutes - from Essen, Halle, Hamburg, Kiel, and Munich -
are still critical of the government's financial and economic policy, but
their analysis differs. 'For a long time such policy has consisted of no
more than ad hoc measures, without any medium-term concept,' they say.
'Financial policy is in an extremely precarious position.' They forecast a 5
per cent growth in public sector spending this year and next, with an
increase of only 3.5 per cent in tax and social security revenues. The
result will be an increase from DM78bn (Pounds 31.7bn) to DM107bn in this
year's public sector deficit (including the federal states as well as the
central government).
The key reason is the level of transfers to east Germany, rising from
DM150.3bn in 1992, to almost DM163bn this year and DM165.5bn in 1994, they
say, as well as soaring unemployment benefit as jobless numbers approach 4m.
At the same time, revenues will be squeezed by the economic downturn.
The five institutes call for a clear medium-term financial strategy, beyond
the scope of the immediate social spending plans agreed by the government.
They believe that the proportion of state spending must be clearly reduced
to allow the attraction of private sector investment to increase.
The DIW disagrees. The immediate danger is not of a lasting increase in
public spending. Such spending is dictated by the temporary needs of east
Germany. But the current recession will only be aggravated by excessive cuts
in public spending, before a recovery in private investment is in sight.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday doubled the value of
duty-free gifts which travellers within the Community will be able to bring
home from the beginning of next year.
The ministers agreed to increase the outdated Ecu45 (Pounds 35) limit on
duty-free purchases of watches, camera equipment and other gifts, to Ecu90.
They also increased the tax-free allowances for gifts bought outside the
Community from Ecu45 to Ecu175.
Yesterday's deal leaves the allowances for duty-free wine, spirits and
tobacco unchanged, but it will provide a consolation for EC duty-free shops
as they wind up their EC activities. Duty-free shopping on journeys within
the Community will end on June 30, 1999.
Brussels had resisted prolonging duty-free sales within the EC, because it
believed limits would be difficult to enforce once internal controls on
goods were abolished on January 1, 1993. However, ministers agreed last year
that duty-free shops could police the system themselves until its abolition
in 1999.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Yeltsin to open way for sale of land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, was expected last night to sign a
long-awaited decree allowing for the free sale and purchase of land - seven
decades after the Bolsheviks abolished private property and farming.
Despite numerous decrees and laws proclaiming the right to private land
ownership, introduced over the past two years, the Russian parliament had
inserted into the old constitution a moratorium of 10 to 15 years on the
right to resell land distributed to citizens by the state.
The decree will also lay the foundations for a mortgage system, enabling
banks to lend money to farmers. The state had previously given state and
collective farms, as well as fledgling private farmers, 'credits' which were
rarely returned. But commercial banks had steered clear of lending from the
own funds without collateral, and lending will remain difficult when
inflation is more than 1,000 per cent a year. Nonetheless, Russia already
has several thousand private farmers, who cannot sell their land freely.
Most of its urban dwellers already own small plots of land to build dachas
and grow vegetables, even though there is no well established market for
buying and selling land.
Although details of the decree were not yet clear, partly because senior
officials have been arguing over the final version, Izvestia newspaper
yesterday criticised a draft made available to it as giving too many rights
to collective and state farms. Part of the problem with agricultural reform
so far has been the absence of a mechanism to implement previous orders that
state and collective farms give land away to employees who want it.
The decree was also expected to lift limits on rent which can be charged for
land.
The main fear of opponents to a free land market was that foreigners and
other rich individuals would buy up the country on the cheap.

FT  26 OCT 93 / 'Social dumping' fears over Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's move to economic and monetary union threatens to
enshrine social inequalities between one country and another, according to a
draft European Commission policy paper on social policy, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
'It would be foolish to deny that Emu would be a serious challenge to social
policy matters,' says the green paper, drawn up by social affairs
commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn.
'The Community should pay the greatest attention to any possible negative
social effects of the integration process, in particular the risk of
dumping.'
The threat of adverse effects underlined the need to counter a spread of
'social dumping', whereby companies relocate to countries where social costs
are cheaper, by harmonising social legislation in step with convergence of
government monetary policies under Emu.
'Yes we are worried . . . We do believe that if we do want to avoid dumping
we need EC social legislation,' an official for the European Trade Union
Confederation said. He said 'social dumping' had taken place and could
spread under Emu. However, the European employers' group, Unice, said
complete harmonisation of social systems is not a necessary condition for
progress towards the objectives of the Maastricht treaty.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Air France retreat worries Italy

<TEXT>
The French government's climbdown over cost-cutting measures at Air France,
the national carrier, has been viewed with concern in Italy where the
government is planning similar cuts in loss-making, state-owned industries.
The government is committed to a broad programme of privatisation and
restructuring, and this autumn faces labour unrest over jobs threatened in
the chemicals, defence and steel sectors as well as public transport.
The position of Air France management has particular relevance for Alitalia.
The loss-making airline has seen its plans for an early return to profit
undermined by the recession and posted a half-year loss of L216bn (Pounds
90m). Last week plans were leaked of a restructuring scheme that involved
the loss of more than 1,000 jobs among ground staff in plus a renegotiation
of pay claims already agreed for 1994 for the flight personnel. Alitalia
presently employs 21,000 people. Pilots risk losing their bonuses while
cabin crew could have their pay frozen.
These moves are expected to be strongly resisted by Alitalia staff. The
latter claim that only since 1990 have their pay levels been brought up to
the norms of other European carriers such as Air France.
However, a strike planned for today by the air transport sector protesting
against proposed cuts in Alitalia and its subsidiary, Ati, was called off
yesterday. This was after assurances were received from IRI, the state
holding company that controls Alitalia, that a meeting would be held on
November 5 to hear the union point of view.
The protests over threatened job cuts across state-run industry have taken
the form of factory occupations and the blocking of roads and railways. Over
the weekend police removed by force a group of unemployed protesters who had
occupied Naples cathedral. A four-hour general strike is due on Thursday to
protest against the failure of the 1994 budget to provide sufficient funds
to combat unemployment.
Unlike his French counterpart, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister,
is not an elected politician and heads a government with a limited mandate
that is largely composed of technocrats. Mr Ciampi's room for political
manoeuvre in dealing with labour unrest is strictly circumscribed; while the
need to curb public spending has reduced the scope for financial
palliatives.
Trades union representatives said yesterday they were firmly against any
form of violent protest but could not always control grassroots frustration
over rising unemployment.
Last month, the union leadership was considerably embarrassed by the violent
take-over by workers at a petrochemical plant at Crotone in southern Italy.

PORTUGAL and Spain said yesterday they opposed any changes to European
Community institutions before four new members are admitted by 1996, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
The Portuguese foreign minister, Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said after
talks with his Spanish counterpart, Mr Javier Solana: 'The Community can't
function in the same way with 16 as it did with 12. But we don't think this
is a convenient time for great institutional changes,' he said. Mr Solana
said he agreed.
Mr Durao Barroso earlier expressed his opposition to immediate changes in
the EC's administrative structures in an article published on Monday in the
Lisbon newspaper Publico.
Some member states, including Britain, want changes in the way the EC
functions before it welcomes in Finland, Norway, Austria and Sweden. Britain
has argued that the rotation of the presidency of the EC should be changed
to ensure that the troika of present, previous and succeeding presidents
should not be dominated by a series of small countries or by countries from
the same geographical area.

FT  26 OCT 93 / London may host new Yugoslav talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations is considering whether to convene a new round of peace
talks in London to end the civil war in former Yugoslavia, the UN secretary
general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, said yesterday.
Mr Boutros Ghali said after talks in London with the British foreign
secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, that the conference would need careful
preparation as well as the approval of all the warring parties in
ex-Yugoslavia and the participants of last year's talks in London.
'We are still preparing the idea. We believe that this idea may help us to
find a solution,' Mr Boutros Ghali said.
He said he held exploratory talks on Monday with the Norwegian mediator, Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, who is the UN envoy in the Yugoslavia peace talks, and
would meet him again today.
Mr Hurd said the other mediator, Lord Owen, who is the representative of the
European Community, approved of the idea of a new London conference and
would discuss it with EC foreign ministers when they meet in Luxembourg
today.
'There's no good calling a conference tomorrow with no guarantee it is to
succeed. So it needs careful preparation and that's what its receiving,'
Hurd said.
In fighting in Bosnia yesterday a Danish lorry driver was killed and nine
other UN workers wounded when their relief convoy was caught in crossfire
between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia.
In Sarajevo, up to 13 people were injured in an attack on a market amid an
upsurge in shelling by Serb forces on Mount Zuc, north-west of the capital,
Bosnian radio said. The Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, yesterday
named his foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, to the vacant post of prime
minister and also included him in the republic's collective presidency.
His appointment may reflect intensified efforts to reach a settlement with
Serb adversaries as Mr Silajdzic, a Moslem, is the key figure for bilateral
negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. He was singled out at the weekend by Mr
Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian Serb leader, for 'having turned around and
understood reality'.
Meanwhile, relief operations of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
suffered a severe setback when two convoys, escorted by British armoured
vehicles, were hit by machinegun and mortar fire as they crossed a frontline
south of Novi Travnik.
Another Danish driver was wounded and eight Dutch soldiers accompanying the
military supply convoy were hurt.
Mr Nicholas Morris, a UN spokesman, said in Zagreb, the Croatian capital:
'Such an attack is totally unacceptable . . . everyone knows that this is a
vital road for the survival of all communities in central Bosnia.'

FT  26 OCT 93 / Major rules out deal with IRA on ceasefire: Adams banned
from entering Britain - Mayhew condemns 'sickening hypocrisy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government angrily rejected last night a proposal from Mr Gerry
Adams for a conditional IRA ceasefire and announced the Sinn Fein leader had
been banned from entering Great Britain.
It accused Mr Adams of 'sickening hypocrisy' and set an unconditional and
permanent end to violence as a precondition for the IRA and its supporters
to be brought into any negotiations on the future of Ulster.
The message was reinforced by the announcement that Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, had signed an indefinite exclusion order under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act. The order - signed before the latest IRA bombing in Belfast -
prevents the Sinn Fein leader from travelling from Ulster to any other part
of the UK.
As the weekend killing of Protestant civilians in Belfast's Shankill Road
was followed by a bomb attack on a mainland railway line, Mr John Major came
close to dismissing the initiative drawn up with Mr Adams by Mr John Hume,
leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. But the
government was careful not to extend its denunciation to Mr Hume's role in
preparing the proposals.
Last night Protestant terrorists claimed responsibility for the murder of a
Catholic in North Belfast. Earlier a Catholic taxi-driver died in hospital
after a revenge shooting in response to the Shankill Road bombing.
Mr Adams told the BBC a positive response from the London government to the
Hume-Adams proposals could bring an IRA ceasefire. But at the Commonwealth
summit in Cyprus, Mr Major retorted: 'I am not going to do deals with people
who plant bombs and kill innocent people.'
That view was echoed in the House of Commons by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland Secretary, as the latest IRA attacks brought universal
condemnation from government and opposition MPs.
In a sombre denunciation of the Belfast bombing - which killed nine
Protestant civilians as well as one of the terrorists - Sir Patrick said:
'Next to the sickening quality of what was done to people in the Shankill on
Saturday has been the sickening quality of the hypocrisy of Mr Adams.' The
condition for dialogue with Sinn Fein and the IRA was an end to violence
'without condition and forever'.
The Northern Ireland secretary, however, 'saluted' Mr Hume for his courage
in seeking a settlement.
Senior ministers said they saw no real prospect of the Hume-Adams proposals'
leading to a lasting settlement, but could not afford to reject them out of
hand before they had been formally presented by Dublin.
Mr Hume said the British government could not afford to reject a set of
proposals which had as their objective a 'lasting peace and total cessation
of violence'. But Mr Major underlined the gulf between the two sides by
accusing Mr Adams of blackmail: 'If Mr Adams can end the violence then he
should end the violence now without preconditions, without any delay . . .
and without any proposals which sound to me tantamount to blackmail.'
Sir Patrick's Commons statement was quickly followed by the announcement of
the exclusion order against Mr Adams.
The announcement from Mr Howard - who signed the order last Tuesday - said
that Mr Adams was or is concerned in the commission, preparation or
instigation of acts of terrorism connected with Northern Ireland. The
decision came after reports that the Sinn Fein leader was planning to visit
Great Britain at the invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP.
The rail network in southern England was in chaos after the IRA detonated a
bomb on the main line from London to the west of England. Two bombs were
placed in Reading, one of which exploded several hours after the first had
been successfully defused.
Police said the second blast had been calculated to kill workers from the
emergency services responding to a coded warning of the first attack.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Benefit fraud costs Pounds 5bn a year, say officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN Pounds 5bn a year of government money may be lost through
fraudulent benefit claims, according to Whitehall officials investigating
abuse of the social security system.
Officials say the investigation, launched earlier this year, has uncovered
far greater abuse of state welfare than had been thought, with many examples
of improper claims for old age pensions, unemployment assistance and child
benefit. Until recently, ministers had estimated that the state lost some
Pounds 1bn a year in fraudulent claims. But officials say the investigation
 -by four Department of Social Security officials under the aegis of the
Whitehall efficiency unit, set up to uncover wasteful government expenditure
 -has produced evidence of fraud on a much greater scale.
'The study shows that the amount of benefit fraud is much higher than
expected,' said one official yesterday. 'It would not be wrong to say that
the figure is in excess of Pounds 5bn per year.' That compares with an total
annual bill for welfare benefit of around Pounds 80bn.
The scale of benefit fraud is being cited by ministers as the principal
reason for considering the introduction of an identity card system for
benefit claimants. If implemented, this would be the first time the state
has required British citizens to carry any form of formal identification
other than a passport.
Civil liberties groups have strongly opposed such a move as an infringement
of individual rights. But DSS officials did not rule out the possibility
yesterday that the ID card system could be introduced for all 21m benefit
claimants.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday that the
introduction of an identity card system would depend on the final
presentation of the efficiency unit's report, due in a month. But Downing
Street officials say the introduction of an identity card system is backed
by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has closely monitored the
investigation.
Officials said that, to overcome civil liberties concerns, the information
stored on an identity card would be 'of no use to the police'.
The favoured identification method would involve social security and pension
claimants having some form of 'hand scan', he said. The hand image would
then be stored electronically on a card.
This would allow the cardholder's identity to be ascertained with an error
factor of one in 100,000 - enough to prevent an individual drawing money
with a stolen card, but a certainty factor too low to be used in a court of
law.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Air France chief appointed as strikers prolong protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE ground staff yesterday voted to continue striking at least until
tonight, in spite of the French government's decision to withdraw a
controversial cost-cutting plan that has triggered a crippling strike at the
airline.
Mr Christian Blanc, reputed to be an industrial reformer and friend of
leading socialist politicians, was meanwhile named as Air France's new
chief.
The vote in favour of continued action means that a broader protest planned
for today, dubbed 'Black Tuesday' by the French press, is expected to go
ahead. Ground staff are due to be joined in a 24-hour strike by Air France
pilots and cabin crew as well as many union members at Air Inter, the
national carrier's domestic airline subsidiary, and Aeroports de Paris, the
airports operator.
Today's protest may, however, represent the peak of the dispute. Force
Ouvriere, one of the union groups which has spearheaded the protest, said
its members could return to work tomorrow.
The task of resolving the dispute and negotiating a new recovery plan for
the lossmaking airline now falls to Mr Blanc, chosen by the French
government to succeed Mr Bernard Attali. Mr Attali resigned on Sunday when
the government scrapped his proposed austerity measures, which included
4,000 job cuts by the end of next year and pay cuts.
Mr Blanc is the former head of RATP, the urban transport authority which
runs the metro and bus system in Paris. He implemented a substantial
reorganisation at RATP before resigning last winter following a strike in
which he failed to win government support for a change in labour practices.
President Francois Mitterrand last night expressed sympathy with the
striking workers, saying their complaints about the recovery plan were felt
by many people to be good sense.
The decision to withdraw the original austerity plan represents a serious
blow to the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which was forced into a
climbdown in the first serious industrial dispute that it has faced since
taking office in March.

FT  26 OCT 93 / Canada's Liberals set to gain power

<TEXT>
CANADA'S Liberal party led by Mr Jean Chretien early today appeared headed
for a landslide victory in the country's general election.
Partial results indicated a resounding defeat for the Progressive
Conservative party of Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's first woman prime minister.
The Conservatives, who had held power for nine years under Mr Brian Mulroney
and then Ms Campbell, suffered a sharp drop in popularity because of
recession and high unemployment.
Soon after polls closed in the eastern and central parts of the country, the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation predicted the Liberals would have enough
seats in the 295-seat House of Commons to form a government without having
to rely on a coalition partner.
Liberal candidates were elected or were leading in as many as 170 seats as
counting went on early today, with the Conservatives ahead in only three.
The Liberals were expected to fare less well in western Canada, where the
polls closed three hours after those in Quebec and Ontario.
In Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois, whose main aim is to take the French-speaking
province out of Canada, won about 50 of the 75 seats.
The final outcome of the election was expected to hinge on results from the
western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
Support for the Conservatives in these provinces has been heavily eroded by
the right-wing Reform party, which was expected to end up with several dozen
seats in the new parliament.
The Reform party also split the vote in Ontario, allowing the Liberals to
sweep nearly all of the province's 99 seats.
Mr Chretien, 59, a Quebec lawyer, campaigned hard for the Liberals with a
pledge to create jobs with a public works programme. He also promised to try
to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the
US and Mexico.
A passionate believer that Quebec should stay within Canada, he easily won
his own constituency in the province, fighting off a challenge from a
separatist opponent. A veteran politician, he has held cabinet posts under
three prime ministers - Lester Pearson, Pierre Trudeau and John Turner.
With the Conservatives facing humiliating losses, it was not clear which
party would form the official opposition. The Bloc Quebecois appeared well
placed to take on this role - ironically, in view of its aim of breaking
away.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission's monopoly right to initiate Community legislation
should be removed under a new power-sharing arrangement among EC
institutions, according to a report published today by the London-based
European Policy Forum.
The report suggests that the European Council of ministers and the European
parliament should also have the right to initiate EC action or legislation.
But it rules out downgrading the Commission to a secretariat of the Council
or the new European Union created by the Maastricht treaty.
The report was written by Sir Michael Jenkins, a former senior UK Foreign
Office official who served as ambassador to the Netherlands and deputy
secretary general of the European Commission.
Sir Michael's other recommendations are that:
The rotating presidency of the EC should be extended from six months to a
year, to provide greater continuity, and be held by a larger and a smaller
state in partnership.
The European Parliament should be strengthened with a second chamber of
members nominated from national parliaments.
A second chamber of the European Court should be created to deal with
matters of Community competence.
The report is intended as a contribution to the post-Maastricht debate on
how the EC should evolve as it seeks to deepen integration while also taking
in new members.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Turkey promotes hardliners to cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government last night announced key cabinet changes, promoting
hardliners to both defence and interior ministries in the face of growing
public criticism of its handling of the Kurdish crisis.
Mr Mehmet Gulhan, a minister of state, is taking over as defence minister
and Mr Nahit Mentese, education minister and an old colleague of President
Suleyman Demirel, is taking up the law and order brief at the Interior
Ministry.
The announcement comes in the wake of bloody fighting near Lice in the
Kurdish speaking south-east, after the killing of the Diyabakir gendarme
commander on Friday sparked off a two-day battle. Security forces used tanks
and armoured personnel carriers to regain control of the town.
The cabinet changes appear to end any hope that the government may move on
further democratic reforms in a bid to undermine growing popular support for
the PKK Kurdish separatist party. The government move follows a weekend of
intense consultations in Ankara, with Prime Minister Mrs Tansu Ciller
meeting army chiefs and the National Security Council. The prime minister
says she will travel to the area herself in the next few days.
A curfew was still in place in Lice last night, after the government claimed
the PKK killed 14 children and eight women in their attack on the town. Mrs
Ciller is anxious to appease right-wingers in her party concerned the army
may use the latest crisis to call for the reimposition of martial law in the
region.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Rowland warns Bock over future direction of Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, who has effectively run Lonrho, the international
trading group, for more than 30 years yesterday warned Mr Dieter Bock, his
joint chief executive, they were on the verge of a fight that could tear the
company apart.
Mr Rowland, alternately poured scorn and vitriol on Mr Bock while insisting
he wanted to avoid conflict. Mr Bock wants to turn the secretive
conglomerate into a more conventional company, initially by bringing in the
first non-executive directors for two decades.
Mr Bock, who owns 18.8 per cent of Lonrho, also believes its 16-member board
should be slimmed down, which would probably start with the removal of
executive directors of pensionable age. These include Mr Paul Spicer and Mr
Robert Dunlop, supporters of Mr Rowland.
Mr Rowland said: 'If Mr Bock says the pensionable directors have to go, my
answer to that would be 'over my dead body' . . . I would say to him 'you
must be stark staring mad'.'
The 75-year-old entrepreneur said the removal of some of the oldest
directors would give Mr Bock unfettered control of the international trading
group.
Mr Rowland said: 'If he got rid of four or five people, Mr Bock would sell
everything for cash; there would be nothing left. He would get rid of
everyone, including the tea ladies.'
He compared relations with Mr Bock to his long-running feud with the Fayeds
over the 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser.
Following Friday's sudden end to the eight-year legal battle between Lonrho
and the Fayeds, Mr Rowland said he would also like to put his disagreement
with Mr Bock behind him. 'I do not want it tearing Lonrho apart.'
He said he had not tried to find another investor to buy the German
financier's 18.8 per cent shareholding. But he said good relations between
the two men depended on Mr Bock accepting the status quo on the board.
An adviser to Mr Bock said there were no immediate plans to change the
board. 'The main objective was to get non-executive directors appointed and
that has been achieved.'
Mr Bock is understood to be delighted that the expensive and time consuming
feud with the Fayeds has been ended.
The German financier has taken heart from the latest shareholder research
conducted by Lonrho's stockbrokers, James Capel. It shows that Mr Bock and
institutional shareholders command more than 60 per cent of the stock.
Mr Rowland cast doubt on his colleague's ability to run Lonrho's businesses.
He said: 'Mr Bock has sold assets which we were in the process of selling.
It was all agreed before he arrived. The only deal he has done is with Peter
Palumbo (over redeveloping a London site) and that was not with us.'
Mr Rowland said that the two men, who earlier this year described themselves
as 'indivisible', rarely communicated with each other. He only found out
about Mr Bock's recent partnership with Lord Palumbo by reading about it in
the newspapers.
For his part, Mr Rowland did not inform Mr Bock about the impending truce
with the Fayeds, deciding instead to first announce it in the Harrods' food
hall.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (25): On to the operating table - The
health service is ripe for financial surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY the year 2,000, one person in two in German hospitals is expected to be
aged 60 or older. Today, 42 per cent of hospital patients are near or past
retirement.
To finance health care for its ageing population, the German labour force
will continue to face increasing social security payments. Payroll
contributions to health insurance funds have steadily grown in the last 10
years, and equal nearly 7 per cent of gross earnings.
Shared equally between employees and employers, these surcharges are among
the ancillary costs burdening German businesses and undermining their
competitiveness. Keeping health costs under control is a key priority for
the Bonn government as it attempts to safeguard Germany's manufacturing
base.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the federal health minister, can claim considerable
success in reducing spending since his new health care law took effect on
January 1, 1993. By squeezing budgets for doctors and hospitals, the reforms
have curbed the amount of drugs and treatment being prescribed. For the
first six months of the year, per capita health spending decreased by 2.7
per cent, after a 9 per cent increase last year.
But politicians and medical personnel now agree that further reforms are
needed to solve the health service's structural weaknesses. A group of
experts in the health ministry is studying how to improve efficiency.
Without more reforms, it is claimed, financial cuts could lower the standard
of treatment.
In a rare show of harmony, *something in here (HP) *
German political parties agreed to support the new law which took effect at
the beginning of the year. Its reforms were directed mainly at the medical
profession - the law limits their ability to prescribe drugs and treatments
above the spending levels of 1992.
A series of penalties have also been introduced making doctors financially
responsible for over-prescribing. Doctors' associations must pay the cost of
excess prescriptions up to a total of DM280m, which is said to equal 1 per
cent of their combined annual fees. Moreover, hospitals which over-run their
1992 budgets will not receive subsidies and must incur debts at the banks.
The new bugetary limits had an immediate effect on spending. Per capita
health spending has fallen 2.7 per cent in the first six months of the year.
The sharpest drop affected drugs, with retail sales plunging by 21 per cent
for the period.
As a result, the state-subsidised health insurance scheme is back in the
black. Last year, the scheme, which offers nearly full coverage to 90 per
cent of the population, recorded a DM9bn loss. For the first six months of
1993, it achieved a healthy surplus of DM2.6bn.
Mr Seehofer was also trying to influence the public's behaviour. Germans
spend more on drugs and treatment than any other European people except the
French. 'A patient never wanted to leave a surgery without a prescription.
Doctors took advantage of this to over-prescribe. This has now changed,'
says Mr Frank Montgomery, from the independent Marburger association of
doctors. 'We have succeeded in changing the behaviour of everyone involved
in the health care system,' claims Mr Seehofer.
However, the reforms have horrified health workers. According to the federal
association of pharmacists, 20,000 jobs are threatened by the new law.
Doctors complain that their earnings have been hit by the ceiling on their
fees.
The biggest impact has arguably been on the established drug houses whose
sales fell by 11 per cent in the first six months of the year. By contrast,
sales of cheap generic drugs rose 12 per cent for the period.
Both health workers and the pharmaceutical industry say such developments
will harm their ability to prescribe state-of-the-art medicine.
Doctors, who face a moratorium on the opening of new medical practices
(except in understaffed areas), claim the law is too restrictive. The
moratorium was introduced to slow the rapid growth in the number of
Germany's doctors - over the last 12 years it doubled to the present
260,000. The pharmaceutical industry, meanwhile, warns that lower earnings
will hit research budgets.
Mr Michael Hansen, of the Boston Consulting group, says that 'reforms cannot
work in the long-term if they are against the medical profession. There is
growing awareness that better management must be introduced in the system.
And doctors have to see benefits in the package,' he says.
However, the present system of care is riddled with duplication and red
tape. Waste stems primarily from the system of payment, under which each
medical provider is paid for the service provided to the purchaser. In
practice, this means that doctors and hospitals have a a financial interest
in duplicating services.
Independent medical bodies have suggested that physicians should be allowed
to oversee the entire cost of a patient's treatment. Fees could also be
charged not on a service basis but for the treatment accorded to each
patient. An average fee per member of the national health care system would
be established, so that patients requiring little treatment would indirectly
subsidise those needing expensive care.
There is also a need for a better flow of information within the service, to
ensure the avoidance of duplication in examinations and diagnosis of
patients' ailments. This implies closer links between hospitals and health
services in the community. In some regions, local doctors associations have
introduced a patient card, which gives doctors private access to patients'
medical history. In order to win parliamentary approval - the opposition
Social Democrats control the Bundesrat (the upper chamber) - the
government's reforms will need the support of all German parties.
Germany will also have to tackle the looming problem of an ageing
population.
Recent efforts by the Bonn government to introduce new social security
payment to finance residential care for the elderly and chronically ill have
run into difficulties.
Social Democrats oppose the idea that employers should meet some of the cost
of additional surcharges out of employees' pay. Employers' associations for
their part oppose a move which would further increase their costs.
The new residential care plan would save money for hospitals. Ms Ingrid
Hasselblatt-Diedrich, of the Hartmann doctors' association, the largest
professional body of its kind, says that a quarter of elderly patients whose
care in hospital is covered by their insurance contributions, would not have
to be in hospital at all if alternative care was available for them in their
own homes.
But conflicting economic and political interests have so far blocked the new
residential care plan. It remains to be seen if there is still enough
political will to break the logjam.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (26): When the patron backs out - Theatres
are closing and orchestras slimming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA NAATZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE closure last month of two of Berlin's most famous theatres, the Schiller
and the Schlosspark, provided a grim illustration of how public funding for
the arts is under pressure as a result of the recession.
The Bonn government and the federal Lander say they want to preserve a wide
and varied range of cultural activities. But because of the strain on their
finances, they are having difficulty living up to their ambitions.
In contrast to Britain and the US, where the arts are financed by a mixture
of subsidies and private sponsoring, German theatres are largely publicly
supported. Ticket sales yield only about 15 per cent of their income, and
the rest comes from the public purse, overall a total of some DM4bn for
theatres, operas and orchestras.
At federal government level, the Interior Ministry is responsible for
cultural affairs. It promotes only cultural projects of national importance
 -such as the annual Bayreuth festival. The Lander and local authorities
account for the lion's share of public funding.
The Interior Ministry's culture budget is to be slashed next year to barely
half its current level - down from DM1.3bn to DM701m in 1994. If the
Bundestag passes the draft budget - and it has been sharply criticised from
both sides of the house - it will threaten a host of projects, above all in
eastern Germany.
Under the unification treaty, the eastern states were to receive cultural
aid of DM650m a year from 1990-94, to tide them over their immediate
financial problems. The Finance Ministry has axed that money from the 1994
budget in its latest round of drastic savings measures, and a decision is
still pending on whether it should be reinstated.
Also open is the question of which institutions will be faced by cuts in
1995. Among them could be the German Music Council, which supports young
musicians and sponsors national concerts and concert tours. The Bach
archives in Leipzig, the Society for the Promotion of the German Language,
the Berlin festival, and the Ruhr festival could all be affected, along with
film promotion activities, and the protection of monuments.
One thing is certain: sweeping cuts are on the way. But one area may be
spared. The Bayreuth festival, the Nuremberg national museum and Munich's
German museum are all thought to be safe: they are all prestigious projects
in Bavaria, the home state of Mr Theo Waigel, the Finance Minister in Bonn.
At the state and local level, most cities' cultural facilities have accepted
cuts. Art galleries have been unable to obtain new pictures, and have had to
put on fewer exhibitions. Some municipal theatres have been forced to close
for weeks at a time, and some orchestras, such as the Hesse state radio
light orchestra and the Berlin symphony orchestra, have disbanded.
The directors of the big opera houses have tried to form a joint plan to
face the crisis. Mr Gotz Friedrich, director-general of the Berlin opera,
said: 'Opera is no luxury. It is an integral part of the cultural
landscape.'
The end result of the directors' meeting, however, was very modest - an
agreement between the individual opera houses setting common salaries for
singers, thereby ending *something in here (HP) *
competition between them.
The federation of German theatres has argued that no other country has such
a variety of theatres and operas as Germany. They insist that they should go
on being publicly financed, because of the vital contribution they make to
the 'social and cultural fabric' of their towns and cities. But in one way
they do want to change their public status: as far as their employees are
concerned.
There are seven different agreements on wages and working conditions in
German theatres, with five different trade unions. Because they are in the
public sector, many employees enjoy the statutory privileges of public
servants. The theatre federation wants its members to become independent
enterprises, and then to have a single wage deal for all employees.
The one other way in which they hope to save money is in agreeing to more
co-productions, or exchange of productions between several theatres.
So how will a big opera house react to the financial squeeze? At the
Frankfurt opera, the city's plans will reduce overall cultural spending by
DM50m next year. Job cuts are inevitable. Personnel and administration costs
account for almost 85 per cent of DM65m total spending. The remaining 15 per
cent are earmarked for artistic purposes, such as guest stars.
Mr Martin Steinhoff, the managing director, says that as many as 350 of the
1,000 employees may have to be dismissed. This means that of 135 musicians
today, barely 80 will be kept on. It means that presenting a Wagner opera in
future would be out of the question, because the opera choir would be too
small. Repertory theatre would become impossible, because there would not be
enough stage hands to raise and dismantle the sets every evening.
The upshot is that only much more limited productions of short duration and
narrow scope remain feasible, and then only with guest performers, and not
with a resident ensemble.
The wholesale privatisation of cultural facilities is not seriously under
discussion. As revenues from ticket sales account for such a minor share of
theatre and museum budgets, the gap is considered too wide to fill.
In Berlin, the city's cultural department quite simply ordered the Schiller
and Schlosspark theatres to survive without subsidies. They had long been
criticised for poor management and boring performances. With a budget of
DM41m, they were the highest-subsidised theatres in the country - a daily
subsidy per seat of DM100]
The decision to close them was greeted in the theatre world as 'an artistic
assassination attempt'. There were appeals to President Richard von
Weizsacker, the former mayor of Berlin, to save them. To no avail. The
question is, where will the axe fall next?

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (24): From spa visits to communion dresses
 -Workers' perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHEN German industrialists gripe about high labour costs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as they do most of the time - they tend to harp about the unbearable burdens
of statutory extras such as health and unemployment insurance and taxes.
Government policy, they say, actively damages efforts to achieve full
employment.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister, smartly whacked the ball back into
the employers' court in his recent paper 'Securing the Future of German's
Economic Base'. Yes, indeed, he noted, 84 per cent of gross pay in
manufacturing industry was accounted for by ancillary costs. This reduced
the opportunities for pay policy to be more closely related to productivity.
But less than half of these extras were attributable to government: 56 per
cent stemmed entirely from deals between employers and unions. Lack of
strife and consensus between employers and unions was certainly an important
factor in Germany's attractions, he wrote. 'But when companies distribute
more than they earn, in the long-term more is put at risk than social
peace.'
Mr Rexrodt was making a non-too-subtle allusion to a tendency among
employers to pay up rather than risk strikes. Over the years basic pay deals
have been padded and embellished with a bewildering array of extras and
perks. Varying from industry to industry they include holiday bonuses,
payments for education, recuperation and having babies. Travel subsidies or
free transport to and from work are commonplace. Other benefits include
interest-free loans, bonuses for 10, 15 and 20 years' service, heavily
subsidised or free canteens and work clothing, paid-for visits to health
spas, and even, in the case of some Daimler-Benz workers, contributions to
the cost of their children's first communion dresses and suits.
Typically, the cash components have been included in the calculations of
annual pay increases. So, for example, a union deal on basic pay has usually
been applied to the basic rate plus all the extras.
It was Robert Bosch, the arch-conservative electrical and electronics giant,
which first tested the 'social peace' when, in April, it told its workforce
that this year's previously-agreed 3 per cent pay rise would apply only to
the basic rate. Non-union workers had their pay cut 3 per cent. Further, it
said, it wanted to cut other benefits.
Some 10,000 employees were bused into Stuttgart to protest as negotiations
started with the workers' council. To no avail. Last month the company
announced it had achieved its targeted DM180m savings on 'voluntary'
elements of pay. Economies on the basic pay rise arrangement brought total
savings to DM250m. That still left the group's ancillary labour costs at
around DM700m a year, but progress had been made.
At around the same time, the Mercedes-Benz management announced savings
through similar cuts in 'traditional' extras worth some DM200m a year.
Elsewhere, negotiations grind painfully on, and there is no shortage of
frustration on both sides. The head of one big engineering group, for
example, where paint shop employees have long enjoyed the right to a free
annual holiday in the mountain air, shakes his head. Under modern health and
safety regulations, paint shops are among the healthiest places in a
factory. 'We've had it checked,' he says. 'For goodness' sake, the air in
there is cleaner than in my office.'

welfare state is not faring too well

GERMANY'S generous social state is caught in a double bind.
On the one hand, the demographic trends are resulting in an ever increasing
aged population, needing greater health care, residential care, and
pensions, while the actual size of the working population is shrinking. That
is a problem common to virtually all the western industrialised world.
On the other hand, the traditionally generous German benefit system has been
knocked sideways by the sudden advent of 17m new potential claimants from
the former east Germany, wanting full benefits, but only just beginning to
make any insurance contributions now.
The result has been an explosion of costs, which has suddenly focused
attention on the capacity of the German economy to carry on paying so much.
When the total cost of social spending passed the DM1,000bn mark this year,
reaching rather more than one third of gross domestic product, it brought
the problem home to the ordinary citizen. Yet he already has a very precise
idea of what the rising costs mean to him.
The three pillars of the German welfare state - health insurance, pensions
and unemployment insurance - have always been generous in their benefits.
Unemployed workers, for example, have until now received two-thirds of their
former salary for 32 months, and then a few percentage points less,
indefinitely.
Unlike the British system, where social security payments and income tax
payments are effectively all part of a single kitty policed by the Treasury,
German insurance funds are self-financing, and contribution-driven. It is
only when payments outstrip contributions that the state must step in to
make up the shortfall.
It has always been easier in Germany to allow insurance contributions to
rise as social spending has soared, rather than switch a part of the burden
to the general taxpayer. The result has been a rising burden, not only on
individual workers, but on their employers, for they share the insurance
contributions for all three funds on a 50:50 basis.
The proportion of gross income which the employer and employee must jointly
pay in insurance has risen from just 26.5 per cent, in 1970, to an estimated
39.2 per cent next year, thanks to a two percentage point jump in pensions'
contributions.
According to the Economics Ministry's big policy paper on Securing the
Future of Germany's Economic Base, total labour costs in Germany are now
running at DM42 per hour, of which ancillary costs - mostly social
contributions - are no less than DM20. The comparable figures in France are
DM28 and DM13, and in Portugal DM9 and DM4.
'The limits of social policy should be set where the social framework and
redistribution of income starts to endanger overall economic performance,
because economic incentives are weakened and the individual responsibility
of both citizens and enterprises is undermined,' the paper says.
The aim it sets out is to stabilise contributions for health, pensions, and
unemployment, and in the medium-term, start to reduce them. It is much more
easily said than done.
In the first place, the government is committed to introducing a fourth
pillar to the social security system - an insurance system for residential
care for the old and handicapped, whether they need to live in homes, or be
cared for in their own homes.
At present such nursing care is financed by local authorities, but the rapid
rise in the elderly population has put a well-nigh intolerable burden on
their budgets, and the government has promised to find an alternative
system.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Labour Minister, Mr Norbert Blum, seem to see
the scheme as a vote-winner in next year's elections, although it will not
result in any improvement in nursing care in the near term. It will simply
transfer the financing to a new scheme.
Their problem is how to finance it without adding yet another brick to the
pillar of social contributions.
After three years of painful negotiations, the answer they have come up with
seems to have pleased no one: they suggest cutting the number of national
holidays in the calendar from 10 to eight, or instead, allowing workers to
choose to take a 20 per cent pay cut on those holidays. In this way, they
say, employers will be effectively compensated for the increased insurance
contribution.
The workers are furious, and the employers unpersuaded. The former are
simply mad to be paying more contributions, and losing precious holidays to
compensate their bosses. The latter believe that the scheme will anyway soar
in costs - one estimate puts it at DM13bn a year straight away - leaving the
'compensation' far behind.
As for the rest of the social spending, the real problem lies now with
unemployment benefit.
With the sharpest downturn since the war, and unemployment in the two halves
of the country expected to rise from 3.3m today towards 4m next year, the
costs of unemployment benefit, short-time working allowances, job creation
schemes and the like have rocketed.
The Federal Labour Office faces a deficit this year, in spite of its
increased unemployment insurance, of around DM27bn on total spending of some
DM114bn.
A huge share of that is the cost of labour market measures, retraining and
the like, in east Germany. Yet the cost is borne entirely by western workers
who pay unemployment insurance - which excludes all public servants, and all
the self-employed. That is another cause of deep bitterness among ordinary
workers and the trade union movement.
Provided the Germany economy soon rises from recession and eastern Germany
starts on the path of self-sustaining growth, the costs of unemployment
benefits will return to the manageable.
The long-term problem remains how to deal with the demographic change.
On that score, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, can only appeal
for a national debate.
As he points out, it is not just that the population is ageing, but that
there is a growing trend towards early retirement. So the shrinking
workforce, caused by the low birthrate, is further reduced by early
retirement, and the base for social contributions is smaller still.
'The present trend towards early retirement must be reversed in the medium-
to long-term,' he says. Quite apart from reducing the able-bodied workforce,
it results in 'the inhumane exclusion of productive and willing older
workers from the ranks of the economically active'.
The pensions burden stretches into the future, Mr Rexrodt's paper says.
'This question must be discussed now, and a decision reached on how in the
long-term old age care can be guaranteed, without overburdening the younger
generation.'
It is a question which will involve the length of a normal working life,
promotion of larger families, expected migration, pension reforms, the
development of the labour market, and future incomes. And it is a debate
which is only just beginning.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (22): Technology and green sites for sale
 -Bitterfeld was synonymous with the GDR's industrial pollution. Now it is
courting new investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF AN investor is considering locating in Bitterfeld in the eastern state of
Saxony-Anhalt, it would be best to ignore the raised eyebrows and comments
from those who have not seen this large 1,500 acre industrial site since
unification, writes Judy Dempsey.
Instead, it would be more useful to read a short novel, called Flugasche, by
Monika Maron. As a young writer and journalist, Ms Maron was commissioned in
1978 to write an article extolling the virtues of socialist state planning
in eastern Germany's chemical sector, which was concentrated around
Bitterfeld.
In those days, the only thing that glowed in the region was the flames
rising out of the vast furnaces, which in turn contaminated the atmosphere
and filled the air with a stench so foul that breathing was often difficult.
Ms Maron did not stick to her editor's brief. Horrified at what she saw, she
chose to tell the truth about Bitterfeld: the hazards; the working
conditions; the way eastern Germany's chemical sector was managed. She paid
the price. Three years later she had to leave for west Germany.
More than a decade later, the Treuhand, the agency charged with
restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, embarked on an
ambitious programme aimed at turning Bitterfeld into a site for tomorrow's
high technology entrepreneurs. The enormity of the challenge is obvious when
set against Ms Maron's novel. The question is whether the agency will
achieve its ambitious goal.
The agency inherited an extraordinary complex of chemical industries which
produced more than 3,000 different items ranging from chlorine, potassium
hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, to magnesium-aluminium alloy. It also
inherited a workforce of 29,000.
In 1988, Bitterfeld's annual turnover was about 4bn Ostmarks. The sales were
targeted on eastern Germany's large manufacturing sector, as well as exports
to eastern Europe. But monetary union, and the collapse of Comecon, the
socialist trading bloc, quickly exposed Bitterfeld's uncompetitiveness. By
1991, the workforce had been cut to 11,000, and turnover had fallen to
DM490m. By the end of this year, the labour force will have been further
reduced to 2,300, turnover will have dipped to DM300m, and losses will total
DM80m.
In order to make Bitterfeld attractive for investors, the Treuhand decided
not to sell the sector as one big block. Instead, as Mr Dieter Ambros, head
of Chemie AG, the Treuhand-backed holding company for this sector, explains:
'We decided to put up different parts for sale'. This meant first breaking
up the giant Kombinate, or original company, into 135 units, and then
preparing each one for privatisation by introducing an accounting system,
hiring managers to run them, and restructuring them. So far, the Treuhand
has privatised 45 per cent of Bitterfeld's assets, which total DM2bn. In
addition, it has attracted DM2bn in private investment. Above all, it has
managed to bring to the region some of western Germany's leading chemical
and pharmaceuticals, including Bayer, and Heraeus Quarzglas. The latter is
the first plant in Europe which will produce synthetic quartz glass for
semi-conductors, and for the optical fibre industry.
The 64-year-old Mr Ambros, a former manager of BASF, who came out of
retirement because he believed he could use his skills to modernise the
eastern German economy, has used every possible contact to bring investors
to Bitterfeld. 'Those who invest bring other people,' he says.
But there is still the nagging question as to why investors should come to
Bitterfeld, particularly when they can go to eastern Europe or remain in
west Germany.
Mr Klaus Schucht, a member of the Treuhand's board, who is responsible for
eastern Germany's entire chemical and mining sector, sums it up. 'We want to
turn Bitterfeld into a modern industrial parkand we want to make the region
competitive.'
To achieve this aim, the agency has adopted a four-pronged strategy:
modernising the infrastructure, maintaining a high level of incentives,
introducing a mix of industry, and minimising red tape.
Along with the costs of restructuring the chemical industry, the Treuhand
has allocated about DM11bn in cleaning up the site, installing new waste
water treatment plants, and a solid toxic waste disposal recycling centre
spread across 175 acres. 'A modern infrastructure is the key to attracting
investments,' says Mr Ambros.
He adds that Bitterfeld now includes, besides some of the most modern
recycling and waste disposal units, its own digital telephone and satellite
network. In other words, the fact that the region has had to be completely
restructured has meant that it is now equipped with some of the most modern
infrastructure.
The Treuhand has also put in place crucial investment grants. These include
8 per cent bonuses for procurement and production of new, depreciating
moveable real assets; subsidies up to 23 per cent for commercial
enterprises; and special depreciation allowances of about 50 per cent for
procurement and production of immovable assets, expansion, and subsequent
construction works. In short, an investor can write off 45 per cent of costs
through tax relief, investment allowances and subsidies.
Diversification is also important. As Mr Ambros argues: 'We are working
towards establishing here a mix of industry: a third concentrated on
chemicals, a third chemicals-related, and a third on other business, such as
services.'
But products produced at Bitterfeld need markets. At a time of world-wide
recession in the chemicals industry, and a recession in west Germany, surely
the idea of expanding to or locating in this potential industry park is
fanciful.
'In Germany, the problem is a structural one. The Germans are God-damn lazy.
They have the shortest working hours and the longest holidays. We do not
intend to repeat those traits at Bitterfeld,' says Mr Ambros.
In contrast, he cites the administration at Chemie which, with local
councils, has cut through bureaucracy, red tape and endless delays in
planning, a common feature in west Germany. Chemie will continue to
privatise local services, such as heating and maintenance.
The Chemie head concedes that investors can go across the border to eastern
Europe. 'But what we offer is very high technology. Greenfield sites here
will be turned into the most efficient and modern in Germany,' he says. 'You
have to remember that there is a century-old tradition of chemists in this
region.' (IG Farben, dissolved after the war because of its mass use of
slave labour to aid Hitler's war effort, was based at Bitterfeld.)
Mr Ambros reckons his work will end by the middle of next year. By then, a
new holding company structure will have been created, giving managers of the
privatised companies membership on the board. He hopes to privatise most of
the remaining services, which will have the effect of reducing the current
DM80m losses.
But the Treuhand's work at Bitterfeld is not yet over. About 15 per cent of
the site has still to be privatised. The agency might have to liquidate
those enterprises which have little chance of survival, thus pushing up the
unemployment rate, or else subsidise them for some time yet.
In the meantime, Mr Ambros remains confident that Bitterfeld can slowly
attract investment and expertise. 'We expect to have 3,200 new jobs by the
end of 1995 once some of the large plants are up and running,' he says.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (21): How the state withered away - The
rapid progress of history's biggest auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the history of the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and
privatising eastern German industry, is written, it will be recorded that
never before had an organisation been charged with privatising an entire
economy in such a short space of time.
It is one of the largest privatisations ever undertaken. No doubt, other
large sell-offs will follow - probably in Russia.
The economic historian will also show how the agency, hastily created in the
ebbing days of communist rule in eastern Germany, provoked ferocious
criticism from eastern Germans - even more criticism than the former
communist state received.
Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand, explains the intensity of that
criticism. 'Our bad reputation in eastern Germany results from our job to
reduce their jobs.' In pursuing its mandate, the agency in one sweep
effectively replaced a state-run economy with an institution committed to
the market economy. It believed there was no alternative: no half-way house
between a centralised and market economy.
In the early days, the Treuhand made terrible mistakes. When it started its
operations on Leipziger Strasse in Berlin in July 1990, west German
companies rushed in to make quick killings. These took two forms. They
bought the cream of eastern German companies to keep out foreign
competition. Also, they bought companies to secure the real estate, and then
closed them down.
Mrs Breuel does not deny any of these charges. However, the Treuhand had no
instruments for privatisating the 13,000 enterprises placed in its charge.
'We had nothing but the law at that time,' said Mrs Breuel. 'We had no
tools, no rules, not even a list of the companies for which we were
responsible. We had to do everything at the same time. Find out the
companies and all the other things for which we were responsible. Build up a
team and the manpower, and develop our own rules,' she adds.
The rules quickly evolved. Even if any investor bought an enterprise for a
token D-Mark, he or she had to guarantee a certain number of jobs and a
level of investments spread over several years. Through this system, the
agency has saved 1.5m jobs and secure investments totalling DM180bn after
privatising nearly 13,000 companies. But 2.5m people were made redundant.
For its part, the Treuhand agreed to pick up the enterprises' losses, and
environmental liabilities. The Treuhand debt stands at DM280bn - eastern
Germany's total GDP for this year is estimated to be DM220bn.
The debt consists of bank liabilities of DM90bn that have been, or are still
due to be taken over from eastern German state enterprises targeted for
privatisation; bonds already, or in the future, to be issued by the Treuhand
to finance its current activities, including the restructuring and operation
of unsold enterprises and debt servicing (by 1995, these will amount to
DM145bn); contingent liabilities, including the costs of environmental
clean-up, which will exceed DM45bn.
The agency's job is nearly complete. What remains of the Treuhand's work
includes a contracts department which will monitor the implementation of the
investment and job guarantee commitments; the real estate arm of the agency;
the sale, or renting and selling of agricultural and forest land; and the
remaining 1,390 enterprises still on its books. The latter employ a total of
259,833 people. But some of these enterprises will not be easy to privatise,
let alone restructure. They include the uncompetitive chemical, heavy
machinery, and engineering sector.
The Treuhand has set up five management companies under which several
enterprises will be placed to be restructured by western German managers
with the aim of eventually privatising them. But, along with Buna, the giant
chemicals plant, and Deutsche Waggonbau, the railway coach manufacturers,
the agency now finds that it is being pulled between the politicians,
economists and bankers about the fate of these companies.
For social reasons, the Treuhand cannot afford to close down these plants.
Neither the politicians in Bonn or in the eastern states would support such
a move; federal and state elections take place next year. On the other side,
economists and bankers are loath to see the west German taxpayer subsidise
enterprises which have no hope of ever becoming competitive.
It is no wonder Mrs Breuel believes the agency has become a scapegoat, or a
shield for the politicians. 'For quite some time (the agency was a
scapegoat). This was the idea of our job, actually: to have distance between
the politicians and the Treuhand's enterprises. No politicians in the world
could have taken our decision. I myself am convinced that it was a very
clever idea ..'
A debate about the fate of these 'core' companies which once formed the
backbone of eastern Germany's manufacturing and industrial base is now in
full swing. Furthermore, economists are asking about the impact the
newly-privatised sector will have in helping to create a basis for a new
competitive industry.
Perhaps it is too early to answer this question particularly since the
Treuhand's work has taken place against the backdrop of three factors: the
collapse of the markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; the
recession in western Germany, which has affected investments and orders in
eastern Germany; and the insistence of former east German managers, west
German employers, and IG Metall, the engineering trade union, to bring
eastern German wage levels up to west German levels by 1996. This is despite
the fact that productivity in the east is about 65 per cent below its
western counterparts.
However, some general observations can be made. First, the common complaint
made by investors is that the job guarantees and investment commitments are
too inflexible. Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist at the Berlin-based
German Institute for Economic Research, argues that managers cannot
rationalise further to generate higher productivity - and eventually profits
 -because of the contracts.
Mrs Breuel says contracts can be made more flexible - for example,
investments can be spread over a longer time span. So far, about 10 per cent
of the privatised companies are seeking the renegotiating of the contracts.
It is unclear how many will be unable to survive even if the contracts are
made more flexible. But Mrs Breuel is adamant the Treuhand will not buy back
companies. 'Our mandate is to privatise,' she said.
A key indication of the success of the privatised companies will emerge over
the next few years when the contracts expire. If they have weathered the
recession and the high wage levels, will they retain or indeed expand their
labour force; or, if they shed jobs, will there be sufficient growth in the
eastern German economy to absorb those who are made redundant? The Treuhand
would relish a Yes to both questions. It would confirm that it has laid the
basis for a new competitive industry. It would also answer the critics.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (20): Alternating currents - Electricity
faces commercial war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRIEDHELM GIESKE, the tough-talking boss of mighty RWE, Germany's sixth
largest industrial group, and its biggest electricity generator, does not
mince his words.
He does not like the sort of ideas being proposed in Brussels for more open
competition in the European electricity market. He does not think they are
fair. If it is going to happen, he is determined that all the operators in
the EC market should face the same ground rules.
'The German electricity industry, in so far as it falls under European
competition rules, must have the same operating framework, the same risks
and opportunities, as the rest of the European industry,' he said recently.
He does not think that is true today.
The industrial price of electricity in Germany is around six pfennigs per
kilowatt-hour more expensive than in France. 'Energy-intensive industry is
already looking for other locations outside Germany, because of the high
costs,' says Mr Thomas Klante, spokesman for RWE.
The German utilities - there are more than 1,000, but the industry is
dominated by the Big Three, Bayernwerk in Bavaria, PreussenElektra in
Hanover, and RWE in the Ruhr - insist the reason is not their inefficiency
or lack of genuine competition. They blame a series of 'special burdens'
imposed on the German industry which have made it clearly uncompetitive.
The first is the political uncertainty hanging over the future of nuclear
power generation in Germany, where all construction of such power stations
has come to a complete standstill. Nuclear power provides just 34 per cent
of German electricity, compared with some 70 per cent in France.
The second burden is the cost of supporting Germany's indigenous hard coal
industry, whose output costs around DM275 per tonne, compared with a world
market price of around DM85 per tonne. Most of the difference is made up by
German consumers, who pay an ill-named 'coal penny', now amounting to a 7.5
per cent surcharge on their bills, to subsidise domestic coal. But the
electricity utilities claim that, even with that cash, they still have to
cross-subsidise coal-burning power stations with their cheaper nuclear
power.
The third burden is the very strict environmental legislation in Germany,
which has imposed higher standards of pollution, health and safety than in
most other EC countries. Now the German government is a prime mover for a
carbon dioxide tax in the EC, which would ironically hit Germany hardest,
because it burns more coal, above all soft brown coal, in its power
stations.
Finally there is the unique burden of rebuilding the east German power
supply and distribution network, estimated to require an investment of at
least DM46bn over the next 10 years.
All of those issues are now on the table at an extraordinary round of
negotiations between the relevant government ministers, the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD), the electricity utilities, and the trade unions, to
thrash out an 'energy consensus'. It is peculiarly German, unstructured, and
unpredictable in its consequences.
The nuclear debate, for a start, looks hopeless. The Greens, who had earned
their seat at the table because they are part of ruling coalitions in at
least two key state governments - Lower Saxony and Hesse - where nuclear
power is generated, have walked out because they have been unable to force
through its total abandonment. The SPD is divided between outright opponents
of nuclear energy and cautious adherents. In the ruling coalition, the
Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) is strongly pro-nuclear, while
the rest are sympathetic but pragmatic.
The irony is that the pro-nuclear and pro-coal lobbies have a strong common
interest. Both sides argue that, as German coal is so expensive, the country
can only afford it if it compensates with cheap nuclear power.
'We are not in competition with nuclear energy,' says Baron Alfred von
Spies, head of the German coal industry federation. 'We believe in an energy
mix, because it is secure in terms of supply and in terms of risk.
Preserving an energy mix is the reason we can afford high subsidies for hard
coal.'
It is the reason the SPD is divided. Leaders from the big coal mining areas,
such as Mr Johannes Rau, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, 'know that the
end of nuclear power in Germany means the end of indigenous coal-mining,'
says Mr Thomas Roser, director of the nuclear lobby group in Bonn, the
Deutsches Atomforum.
On the other hand, the power industry is divided. Bayernwerk, in the south,
is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, which already accounts for about 70
per cent of its power. RWE and Preussen-Elektra, in the north, could switch
to other sources: they could go for coastal power stations fired by gas or
imported coal. So they are less committed.
The issues on the agenda of the consensus talks are daunting. They must
decide on the acceptable operating life of the 20 nuclear power plants which
are working. They must decide on an acceptable way of either reprocessing or
disposing of their nuclear waste. Nobody really expects them to succeed yet
in deciding whether to go ahead with a new generation of N-plants.
On the coal front, they must decide on a subsidy system to replace the coal
penny which is acceptable both to the European Commission, and the German
power industry. For once they are arguing in the same direction. The former
wants absolute transparency in coal subsidies, and a plan to phase them out.
The latter wants a system which will make the price of German hard coal
competitive with the world market price, so they pay no hidden subsidies.
The answer would appear to be some form of direct coal tax, payable to the
mines.
As for the environment, they must decide on the future of the carbon dioxide
tax. That is fiercely opposed by the industry, above all RWE, which gets the
largest portion of its power supplies from brown coal.
'If the CO2 tax is introduced here, then brown coal will be uncompetitive
(with imported coal) from that moment on,' says Mr Klante. 'It is currently
the only primary energy source in Germany which has been and will be
available in large quantities, and which is not subsidised.'
Brown coal is also the source of virtually all power generation in east
Germany: 95 per cent in 1992. For the preservation of jobs in east Germany,
and for its economic future, brown coal is essential.
The East may yet prove to be the soft underbelly of the mighty electricity
utilities' total domination of the German industry.
The Big Three thought they had the market sewn up with the Stromvertrag
(electricity contract) they signed with the transitional East German
government, even before unification. The contract was challenged by 164
local authorities in the German constitutional court, because it restricted
their rights to generate their own power supplies.
The two sides have limped towards a compromise, which allows the local
authorities guaranteed access to the utilities' grid.
At the same time, the Treuhand privatisation agency, backed by the finance
ministry in Bonn, has decided to bring foreign investors into the brown coal
mining industry, instead of leaving it all to RWE's Rheinbraun. A consortium
of Britain's PowerGen and NRC of the US looks set to buy Mibrag, the
middle-German opencast mining operation, and, with it, access to the east
German grid.
So the utilities are suddenly fighting on three fronts: in Brussels, Bonn
and Berlin.
Mr Gieske is angry. He insists that the east German brown coal industry will
only be economic as a single entity. But if the political authorities are
determined to bring in outsiders, so be it. They must live with the
uneconomic consequences, he says. Few who know him believe he will give in
without a bit more of a fight.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (19): Polluters in revolt - Industry
queries the cost of environmentalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD

<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL protection in Germany is like motherhood: no one would dare to
question it.
Environmental issues remained the number one public concern until last year,
when it was overtaken by crime and unemployment.
Green affairs cut across party lines. Some of the toughest environmentalist
laws were adopted in the 1980s under a conservative government. In the
September elections in Hamburg, the Green party saw its support double from
7 to 14 per cent.
But with the recession biting hard, the private sector has sent clear
signals to the government that environmental policies need to be rethought.
It argues that high environmental expenditure makes it harder for German
companies to compete internationally.
The debate is in full swing: the government reiterates the formula that 'the
polluter pays'; industry calls on the government to go easy on environmental
legislation.
'We need a breathing space to allow companies to implement existing
requirements,' explains Mr Manfred Schneider, member of the board at the
Bayer chemical group.
Other business leaders claim environmental requirements are slowing
investments. According to Mr Adolf Huttl, chairman of Kraftwerk Union,
Siemens' power subsidiary, investment is being diverted from new power
stations.
Problems also arise in the public sector. German municipalities, responsible
for waste water treatment, are increasingly unable to finance the last
stages of clean-up laws adopted in the early 1980s.
Assessing the share of total costs represented by environmental expenditures
remains difficult. Figures differ according to the speaker.
Government officials say environmental expenditure accounts for only 0.7 per
cent of total costs. Consulting groups estimate that they lie between 1 and
2 per cent. The OECD, in its report on the environment in Germany, reported
that such expenditures could be as high as 3 per cent in the manufacturing
sector. But a company such as Bayer, spent 8.5 per cent of its turnover, or
DM1.5bn, on environmental protection last year.
The German industry federation, the BDI, recently urged the government to
implement two changes in its environmental policies to ensure that German
enterprises were not put at a disadvantage.
First, it wanted a simplification of complicated and bureaucratic
environmental procedures. 'We end up with an information deficit which is
particularly dangerous for our small and medium-sized enterprises,' says Mr
Arnold Willemsen, director for environmental issues at the BDI.
Second, it says the government should set targets but let industry decide
how they can be met.
'Companies want more market-oriented solutions to the environment. They
don't want to just be pushed into a corner,' explains Mr Franz-Joseph
Fraundorfer, managing director for the environment at Arthur D. Little in
Germany.
Government officials have been on the defensive. 'Environmental protection
is not a luxury for sunny times. It remains an important goal even under
difficult economic conditions' says Mr Wolfgang Schaubel, leader of the
ruling Christian Democrats in parliament and a key adviser to chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
But the government has responded to some of the industry's demands. Earlier
this month, the parliament adopted a law which considerably simplifies the
procedures needed to conduct research in bio-technology. Previous
procedures, which were time-consuming and bureaucratic, had made research
companies prefer to open laboratories in other countries, such as in the US,
rather than in Germany.
The government is also considering allowing more choice over how to comply
with a proposed law on recycling of consumer goods. Rather than demand
recycling at any cost, the law should allow enterprises to burn refuse if
such methods are 'economically more viable'.
A lesson has been learned from the law which set high recycling quotas for
household waste packaging. The near-bankruptcy of Duales System Deutschlands
(DSD), the national collecting and recycling system set up by industry, has
provided food for thought. DSD has accumulated more waste packaging than it
can recycle partly because industry failed to develop the recycling
technology in time to meet the targets set by the law.
Such problems caused the government to think twice about how industry should
meet environmental targets. It is now considering incineration for household
waste disposal - a method long opposed by politicians who viewed it as
environmentally unaccceptable.
However, changing policies will meet public resistance. For example, local
pressure groups are opposed to the construction of waste incinerators in
their communities.
Government officials point out that the need to match high environmental
standards has led the private sector to develop the equipment to do so. The
manufacture of environmental products and technologies now provides jobs for
860,000 people in Germany, according to Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment
minister. The industry, which last year had a DM40bn turnover, is expected
to grow by between 6 and 8 per cent next year.
Environmental technology has also become a valuable export for German
companies who hold 21 per cent of the world market in this sector. In 1990,
the industry exported 40 per cent of its turnover, as compared with 10 per
cent in the US and 6 per cent in Japan.
'Environmental protection is a chance for German industry to show its
competitiveness,' says Mr Gerhart Baum, liberal deputy in charge of the
parliamentary environmental committee. That still reflects the mood of the
government.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (17): Students' salad days are over - Cash
warnings sound for Germany's over-crowded universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1960s, a book called 'The Educational Crisis' pointed out that only 5
per cent of young Germans went to university. It sparked a national debate
on reforming the country's elitist educational system.
Today, politicians and the entire educational community are again locked in
debate. But the situation has reversed: 30 per cent of young Germans, or
1.8m students, attend university, more than twice the number they can
comfortably accommodate. And 40 per cent of them drop out after two or three
years.
Just as alarming, a third of all university students study for more than
seven years, completing their courses well after the age of 28, the average
age at which most German students leave university.
The popularity of the universities is slowly undermining Germany's much
envied Dual System, which provides vocational training as an alternative to
higher education and has produced a body of highly skilled young workers.
From the end of the war until three years ago, more young Germans preferred
vocational training to university. The balance has since changed: there are
now 1.8m university students compared with 1.7m vocational trainees.
The trend has put financial pressure on the federal states, the Lander,
which are responsible for all education costs other than buildings and
infrastructure which are met by the federal government.
For the first time since the 1960s, the German states last year were forced
to cut education spending by DM1bn to DM29bn.
To bring the rising costs of education under control and adapt it to the
needs of a changing world economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has taken a
personal interest in the issue. Later this year he will chair a meeting of
all state premiers and members of the educational establishment to discuss
ways of narrowing the widening gap between the universities and the market
place.
He spoke recently of 'a worrying academisation of our society' and an
described the new balance between university students and vocational
trainees as 'unhealthy' for the prosperity of German businesses.
There is also pressure from the private sector to reform the educational
system. Together with some members of the educational establishment,
business associations are calling for a radical rethink of higher education
in Germany, including the fact that it is state-controlled, free and accepts
all students with a high school diploma. 'The whole system has to be changed
if we want to remain competitive internationally,' says Mr Tyll Necker,
chairman of the German industry federation, the BDI.
The reforms long favoured by the private sector have now been taken up by
the federal government which has outlined a series of measures to be
discussed at Chancellor Kohl's roundtable this autumn. However, the
influence of the federal government is limited to setting a general
framework and educational policy is the responsibility of the Lander.
To change the system coherently, a rare show of cross-party solidarity will
be needed between Lander of different political colours. They are about to
face a number of wide-ranging proposals from the federal government,
including:
Shorter study courses: Bonn wants secondary schooling to last 12 years
rather than 13 as is now the practice in western Germany. Students should
pass their Abitur, the comprehensive exam at the end of secondary school,
when they are 18 rather than 19.
This suggestion has been strongly criticised, especially by the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) and the teachers' unions. In eastern Germany, where
secondary schooling usually lasted 12 years before reunification,
Brandenburg, now controlled by the SPD, recently changed to 13 years. There
is also resistance on the right wing - from the Bavarian Christian Social
Union a junior partner in the Bonn coalition, which fears that the quality
of education would be diluted.
The federal government also intends to discuss shortening the length of
university studies. The idea is to charge students for spending more than
the average time needed to complete a course. The SPD objects that this
would discriminate against poorer students who interrupt their studies to
finance their living expenses.
More flexibility: The government suggests that university students who fail
to graduate should be able to apply for jobs held by apprentices. In
contrast, apprentices must be allowed to go to university at a later age. At
the moment, the separation between the two systems remains too rigid,
government officials say.
Education must to be closer to the needs of the market place. Technical
universities, or Fachhochschulen, will only qualify for new funds if they
offer courses in areas of industry which have growth prospects, (such as
recycling).
But this is proving difficult to implement at a time when Lander are cutting
their education budgets.
Universities must be reformed. The government is proposing wideranging
measures designed to make universities compete with one another. While some
universities are better rated than others, students at present tend to go to
their local ones. Now the government wants to introduce open entrance
examinations and to give universities more financial say over courses and
staff appointments.
However, there is enormous resistance to such reforms from the educational
establishment. Professors are public servants in Germany and enjoy special
privileges and job security. 'There is nothing you can do to a professor
unless he steals money,' says Mr Hermann Riehl, director of the Christian
Democratic parliamentary group in charge of education.
As a result, universities have tended simply to increase their courses
without distinguishing between purely academic and applied subjects. Closer
links between students and the working place. 'We need to make sure that
students are prepared for specific concrete jobs and that they get corporate
training in the work place,' explains Ms Anke Brunn, education minister in
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. However, the private sector, already
hit by recession, cannot easily devote more resources to education. Mr
Necker, from the BDI, stresses that businesses want to be involved in
formulating educational policy. But so far there is little private funding
for new programmes.
Private sponsorship of on-site training and university teaching fell for the
first time last year. Some 3,000 companies will offer 12,000 such programmes
in 1993/1994, as compared with 12,000 places the previous year, according to
the German Economic Institute in Cologne, the IW.
'Our educational system is not oriented toward performances but toward
diplomas,' says Mr Riehl. Government officials warn: without structural
changes, long and expensive higher education will undermine the
competitiveness of German companies.

THE mood at the annual meeting of Germany's aerospace industry federation in
September was sombre, verging on suicidal, Quentin Peel writes.
The venue was the splendid Petersberg hotel, overlooking Bonn from the
mountains across the Rhine, but there was no other good news for the top
executives, planners and customers of the industry.
The space men were the gloomiest: they are facing the probability of drastic
further cuts in Germany's international space programmes, such as the Hermes
space shuttle and the Columbus space station, which will put many of their
jobs in jeopardy.
'We have already stretched all our programmes to the absolute limit, by
slowing down spending,' according to one senior manager. 'From now on it is
going to hit our jobs. The latest American deal with the Russians will leave
us out in the cold.'
There was little of cheer for them from their colleagues in the defence and
civilian aircraft industries. Deutsche Airbus is laying off 2,700 workers in
Hamburg. And the Eurofighter 2000, the defence industry's prestige product,
has just had its maiden flight postponed by another six months.
Mr Wolfgang Piller, president of the federation, was apocalyptic. 'If you
know the strategic importance of the aerospace industry, and then consider
its public standing and apparent value in public opinion, and in wide
sections of the political establishment, you can only conclude that there is
a grotesque lack of proportion,' he said.
'In complete contrast to Japan, where aerospace has been declared a
'strategic industry', in Germany there is far more concern about the dying
industries of the 19th century than there is recognition of the unique
potential of aerospace.'
Throughout German industry, and not just in aerospace, there is a growing
fear that the country is becoming hostile to innovation.
Mr Paul Kruger, the new minister of research and technology, spelt it out in
a series of guidelines for future government policy last July. 'Fear of new
technologies, rather than creativity, dominates German society,' he warned.
'Our greatest efforts are devoted to 'fencing off' innovation potential,
rather than liberating and encouraging it.
'Our first reaction, even to quite small steps into technological virgin
territory, is far too often hysteria, rather than justified vigilance,
soberness, and confidence in our own creative power.'
Yet the government is by no means blameless in according the research sector
less than top priority. Mr Kruger, a new minister from east Germany, has
been unable to prevent his budget from being frozen in nominal terms, at
DM9.47bn, and therefore effectively cut. 'I am not content, but I can live
with it,' he said.
What he is trying to do now is focus his limited funds on key priorities -
with environmental research, health, transport and energy top of his list.
He wants to do far more to promote better links between the conservative
basic research establishments, and German industry. He wants to stimulate
more competition for cash. Above all he wants a debate on the benefits of
new technology, rather than the dangers.
As for the European Space Agency, to which Germany is supposed to pay
DM1.17bn next year, Mr Kruger believes he can still negotiate 'significant
savings'.
According to Mr Frieder Meyer-Kramer, head of the Fraunhofer institute for
systems technology and innovation (ISI) in Karlsruhe, per capita spending by
the federal government fell from DM126 for western Germany in 1989, to DM117
for the united Germany in 1993. The growth of R and D spending fell from 7.1
per cent in 1981-89, to 3.4 per cent in 1989-91. As a proportion of gross
domestic product, total public and private R and D spending has slipped from
2.88 per cent in 1989 to 2.66 per cent in 1991.
Much of the decline can be attributed directly to the huge cost of
unification, and the need to make cuts in virtually all other budgets.
Nevertheless, Mr Meyer-Kramer, whose institute is the country's leading
researcher in the fashionable field of technology foresight, fears that 'the
crumbling technological competitiveness of the federal republic will simply
worsen' if the spending decline continues.
Mr Konrad Seitz, former head of the planning department at the foreign
ministry, has argued that Germany is in danger of getting caught between the
twin millstones of low wage competitors and high technology competitors,
failing in both tasks. He argues for a huge effort to switch to 'new'
technologies such as information technology, biotechnology, new materials,
new energy sources, and aerospace.
Mr Meyer-Krahmer disagrees. 'I don't believe this is sensible, because it
makes no allowance for the traditional strengths of the German economy,' he
says. 'Germany's strength is concentrated particularly in engineering,
transportation, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. We should reinforce our
traditional strengths through the application of new technologies, like
information technology.'
He says it still needs a considerable change in industrial thinking. 'The
motor industry, for example, needs to see itself as a 'mobility industry',
dedicated to the goal of providing all sorts of instruments and systems for
ensuring mobility - with or without cars.'
ISI published a Delphi report earlier this year on the expectations of
German industry, suggesting 87 different 'critical technologies' on which
Germany should concentrate in the future. A key element is that technologies
can no longer be compartmentalised, because it is precisely in the
borderline areas that the most exciting advances are being made, as in
bio-informatics, and optical-electronics.
Mr Meyer-Krahmer also defends the fragmented state of the German research
industry, and rejects calls for bigger, more concentrated research centres.
But if the fragmentation remains, there is a big need for better
inter-disciplinary communication.
He knows there will not be any more public cash for the immediate future.
'The cash tills of the federal government and the states are empty, when it
comes to financing new costly initiatives in the coming years. Public
financing of research has reached its limit.'
One answer he suggests is increasing privatisation of the publicly-financed
research industry. 'If we are thinking about mobilising more private capital
for our transport infrastructure, why not for research infrastructure too? I
am sure this will become a central theme in the coming years.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (15): Slow birth of a watchdog - Tighter
share dealing rules are coming - and not before time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGNERS who live in Germany often complain that there are too many rules,
rules which prevent you walking across the road when you want, or going
shopping after 2pm on Saturday afternoons, or playing records at lunchtimes
or after 10pm at night.
In the financial services sector, the complaint from foreign investors is
paradoxically just the opposite - that there are not enough rules. In the
German securities business, almost anything goes, a fact which
Anglo-Americans used to highly regulated domestic financial markets tend to
find disconcerting.
This unteutonic state of rulelessness is set to change. Barring unforseen
mishaps, the German parliament will next year ratify the so-called Second
Financial Markets Enhancement Act, designed to fill the gaps in Germany's
investor protection environment.
As Horst Kohler, former state secretary in the German ministry of finance,
acknowledged when he introduced the draft of the new law in January this
year, the regulatory environment is not up to international standards, to
the detriment of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial services
centre.
'This is a breakthrough for Finanzplatz Germany's international competitive
position,' he said at the time, 'and it should secure jobs and income in
this fast-growing sector.'
The most important provisions of the law are as follows:
creation of a federal regulatory body for the securities industry. This
Bundesamt fur das Wertpapierwesen will employ at least 100 people. The new
body will be the German equivalent of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission,
the powerful watchdog of the US securities markets.
insider dealing will become a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment
or heavy fines. Financiers claim insider dealing is no more prevalent in
Germany than in the UK or the US, but a series of scandals has highlighted
the lack of such a law in Germany.
a set of new rules designed to encourage disclosure and transparency on the
German equity markets. These include a requirement for all price sensitive
information to be published without undue delay. Companies will have to
notify the German SEC about such announcements so the new authority can
decide whether the companies' shares should be suspended.
Companies will be obliged to disclose share-stakes when they reach or cross
5, 10, 25, 50 or 75 per cent. At present notification is only required when
a shareholding reaches or crosses 25 or 50 per cent.
a set of rules of conduct for participants in the securities markets. This
will define professionals' obligations to their clients.
The new law stops short of introducing a Takeover Code - although leading
bankers such as Rolf Breuer of the Deutsche Bank have started to call for
this too - but it will mean major changes for Finanzplatz Germany.
'As soon as we in Germany really start to take the problem of insider
dealing seriously,' commented Gerd Hausler, head of the Main Credit
Department at the Bundesbank reflecting on the implications of the draft law
soon after it was published, 'many German market players who are not
acquainted with the standard 'rules of ethics' abroad will experience
something of a culture shock, not least because of our extremely passive
attitude over recent years.'
In alluding to Germany's 'extremely passive attitude', Hausler put his
finger on a puzzling issue: if reform is recognised as being so important,
why does it take so long for it to be implemented? The draft law was first
floated in January, 1992; it took another year before the draft appeared; it
will not be enacted until the middle of next year; the German SEC is
unlikely to be up and running until 1995.
The lack of any sense of urgency is more pronounced in another, related
area: the reform of Germany's stock-market structure. It took decades of
squabbling between the country's eight regional exchanges before they could
bury their mutual rivalries deep enough to create the Deutsche Borse - the
German stock-exchange - at the beginning of the current year.
The slow pace of change suggests Germany is not unhappy with its financial
services sector, even if in some areas - for example regulation or market
fragmentation - the Finanzplatz is behind international standards.
This is understandable. The commercial banking sector - divided into private
commercial banks, state-sector banks and co-operative banks - is thriving.
Banks are weathering the current recession in Germany far better than their
peers in other countries.
Moreover, the Bundesbank's staunch defence of the value of the D-mark over
decades has turned the national currency into the world's second largest
reserve currency.
The Bundesbank has repressed innovation in the German financial markets  -
by blocking money-market funds, or holding out against derivatives or
commercial paper until very recently - but this has been in the name of
monetary stability. Many Germans feel that this has been a far greater asset
for the country than a UK- or US-style financial services sector. Indeed,
many Germans tend to assume that thriving, innovative financial markets - as
in the UK or the US - go hand in hand with a weak economy. The fact that
there are only 665 or so quoted companies in Germany, that the stock-market
plays only a limited role in the country's economic life, is viewed as a
structural strength rather than the opposite.
For as long as Germany has had the most dynamic manufacturing economy in
Europe, there has been little need to challenge this assumption. The current
recession, coupled with the costs of reunification, has changed this:
Germany's traditional capital account surplus has swung into a deficit and
companies are realising that they will be competing with the cash-hungry
state for capital throughout the 1990s.
The source of capital at the margin is the foreign investor, whose needs
have to be taken more seriously. Hence Germany has accepted the need for new
securities market legislation.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (16): Tug of peace intensifies - Thomas
Mayer warns of higher inflation and a weaker D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS MAYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the arrival of autumn, hopes have been falling that Germany's present
economic malaise - which was the result of an excessive increase in the cost
of labour - could be overcome by a concerted effort of all groups of
society. Instead, the country is bracing itself for another round in the
fight over distribution of income between capital and labour, and the
eastern and western regions.
The remnants of Germany's famous social consensus are likely to be destroyed
by powerful interest groups, impervious to the appeals of the political
establishment.
Social consensus between workers and employers was the secret force behind
west Germany's post war economic miracle. This consensus was forged in the
hardships after the war, which could only be overcome if frictions in
society were minimised.
The post-war social consensus came under attack for the first time in the
1975. The domestic social conflicts arising from a more aggressive union
policy coincided with raw material producing countries' claim for a larger
share in world income and the subsequent 'oil crisis'. At the same time, the
German political climate deteriorated as the post-war generation began to
challenge the social order created by the older generation.
The result of these conflicts was two recessions (1975 and 1982), a period
of volatile and high inflation, high fiscal deficits and, at the political
level, a bout of terrorism. The problems of the 1970s were eventually
overcome by an armistice between labour and capital - that cooled the
disputes over income distribution - and by integrating the rebellious
generation into the political establishment. There followed a period of
relative stability in the 1980s, with steady but mediocre growth, low
inflation, strong exports and low fiscal deficits.
Although the appearance of peaceful labour relations had been restored, the
strong social consensus between capital and labour of the 1950s and 1960s
had been lost.
Instead, there was collusion among special interest groups at considerable
cost for the economy at large. As companies benefited from a long upswing
and accumulating profits during the 1980s, German managers, who had been
under no strong pressure to distribute profits to share-holders, agreed more
readily to union demands.
Unions, who are represented in the supervisory boards of large companies, in
turn tended to be more peaceful and to support management's corporate
expansion plans. This cosy relationship between unions and management came
at the expense of shareholders and average workers. The former had to accept
more modest returns on their investment while the latter had to cope with
rising structural unemployment as unions were bidding up wages.
In 1990, unification shocked a west German economy where the dominance of
special interest groups had led to severe procrastinatIon. Instead of
rejuvenating it, as many optimists had hoped, the unification shock pushed
it into overheating and subsequent collapse. The accession of the eastern
states to the Federal Republic brought a limited increase in the national
capital stock, but a large increase in the labour force. Market forces would
have depressed wages relative to profits in response to the drop in the
capital-labour ratio. But this would have undermined organised labour's
position in unified Germany and possibly shifted the distribution of income
against it.
Thus, unions strongly resisted downward pressure on wages. Instead of
allowing wages in west and east to converge towards a new equilibrium (with
west German wages probably somewhat lower and east German wages higher than
before), unions succeeded in quickly pushing east German wages up to western
levels.
When the Bundesbank failed to accommodate wage inflation with an easy
monetary policy, profits and investment plunged and the economy went into
recession.
The unions' success in pushing up east German wages was made possible by a
weak political and industrial leadership and a rigid organisation of
Germany's labour market.
Especially at the beginning of the restructuring process, unions had to deal
with the old managers from the former GDR who were often on their way out.
Moreover, the managers of the largely state-owned companies were working
under a 'soft-budget constraint', that is, they could agree to excessive
wage increases well knowing that in the end the government - and not their
bankrupt companies - would foot the bill.
Nor did politicians resist excessive wage increases. Eager to win east
German votes, they avoided taking a stance against the idea of a quick
convergence of east German wages to west German levels. Last but not least,
as wage contracts were negotiated separately for west and east Germany and,
as they were generally binding in each region, arbitrage was reduced: an
east German worker who wanted to work in west Germany could not offer to
work at a lower (eastern) wage to compete with west German job holders.
With the recession, the Government tried to ease wage pressures and to
defuse the fight over the distribution of income by invoking Germany's
legendary social consensus.
But the strategy to reduce peacefully the conflict of interests between
capital and labour by forging a 'solidarity pact' failed. What was possible
in a society turned upside down by defeat in World War Two proved to be
elusive in a country in the grip of powerful groups determined to defend
their vested interests.
As the employers in the metal industry recently admitted when they took the
unprecedented step of ending the existing wage contract by year-end, there
is now little alternative to the containment of wage costs through open
confrontation.
With numerous elections due next year, economic policy is unlikely to give
much guidance. Thus, should employers and unions fail to correct past wage
policy mistakes, financial markets will enforce a decline in pan-German real
wage growth through higher inflation and a decline in the Deutschemark's
real exchange rate.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (14): Managers to blame / Interview with
Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERDINAND PIECH, chairman of the loss-making Volkswagen group, has disturbed
many within the conservative German corporate establishment by his manners
and way of doing business. But one habit of his in particular sets teeth on
edge from Hamburg to Munich.
He insists on saying repeatedly that only 20 per cent of industry's problems
stem from the labour force and that the rest is down to management. He
claims that VW is in a mess because the group's previous management 'failed
to do its homework'. The inference is that the same applies elsewhere in
Germany.
Piech's beliefs have led him to see himself as 'a coach for the protagonists
on the shopfloor'. He argues that management should encourage labour to play
its part in the restructuring of Standort Deutschland by transforming the
way ordinary workers look at their jobs.
At VW the process is under way partly through the application of the
established Japanese-based continuous improvement process, generally known
as CIP, but known at VW headquarters in Wolfsburg as KVP-squared.
The squared element in the formulation reflects the sense of urgency which
Piech wants to instil in his labour force. He says that the company, which
lost DM1.6bn in the first six months of this year alone, has two or three
years to match Japanese quality and productivity.
He brims with missionary zeal. 'I am very little in my office. Most of the
time I'm out in the plant. I am not there as an engineer. I'm looking on,
seeing what's going right and what's wrong,' he says.
Piech is quite open about his relationship with labour. His biggest
shareholder is the Social Democrat/Green coalition government of Lower
Saxony. The VW supervisory board which gave him the job is dominated by
trade union and Social Democrat interests. 'If I have to reduce labour costs
I cannot do it without their co-operation. I have to do it in a way in which
they can survive, I can survive, the company can survive,' he says.
He puts his fingertips together: 'It's a pyramid. If the lower level doesn't
believe in me, the higher level cannot trust me.'
Pyramid-building started on a trip to Japan in company with Gerhard
Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, and a member of the supervisory
board. 'I showed him Toyota's Lexus plant - you don't need to be a
technician to understand when something is wrong. I asked him to count how
many people he could see working.' Out of around 200, Schroder saw one idle
man.
'Go through any one of our European plants and you will see between a half
and a third of the labour standing around. And I can explain it]' Piech
wriggles with agitation. 'It's not the fault of the workforce: it's our
western organisation that's wrong. These people are not supplied with the
things and the means to work efficiently. 'It's disorganisation -
macro-computerisation of things that don't work.'
He has not been impressed by preceding VW boards' investment in automation.
'It is wrong for management to believe so deeply that automation, computers
and systems can help you overcome lack of competitiveness,' he declares.
'You have to organise and allow small groups of people to organise
themselves, their logistics  .. everything.' At Honda, he adds, logistics
costs amount to 0.5 per cent of group sales. At Audi, where he was boss
until last January, the proportion was 5.5 per cent.
Given the chance, he says, he could convince even Chancellor Kohl, who
'talks as though German labour does not work'. He could show him places
where for every four persons 'working' another one is running around keeping
them supplied with parts.
He moves swiftly on to deal with another of German industry's betes noires:
absenteeism. The standard Japanese rate is 2 to 3 per cent compared with
around 9 per cent at VW in normal circumstances. (It has fallen to 4 per
cent now as concern about unemployment has swept the labour force).
Once again, the fault lies with management, which forgets that factory
workers are human beings. As a result, motivation goes haywire. 'They think
we treat them like electrical appliances - plugging them in and unplugging
them as and where we like,' he says. A man or a woman ordered to a new,
unfamiliar place on the line will tend to feel stressed. 'Six hours later
they'll have disappeared.' Now, he says, people fearful for their jobs are
coming to work even though they are clearly unwell. 'We have to find a way
to restore normal motivation so they stay at home if they are sick and come
in if they are not,' he adds.
Piech, an engineer confronting the toughest turn-round challenge in Germany,
promulgates his philosophies with the fervour of the newly-converted.
Company officials say the new approach has already led to DM700m in real
savings. But it will be some time before these show up on the bottom line. A
loss of DM1.25bn at the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, has crushed all
hopes of break-even this year. And now management is in talks with the
German workers' councils to prepare for possible production cuts for next.
The favoured means is by introducing short-time working - a euphemism for
stopping production for as long as it takes to restore balance between
output, stocks and demand for cars.
Current plans, approved by Piech's political and union partners, allow for a
reduction of around 13 per cent in the German workforce in the two years to
the end of 1994. The jobs are being shed by natural wastage and early
retirement schemes. Management proposals for more radical measures are
unlikely to be welcomed by the supervisory board or the workforce, on whom
Piech so much depends for success.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (12): The consensus is under strain - The
spirit which forged Germany's post-war success is changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of September, Germany's most powerful employers' organisation,
Gesamtmetall, provoked cries of outrage from the country's most powerful
union, IG-Metall, by vowing unilaterally to cancel wage and benefit
contracts covering 3.6m metal-bashing and electrical workers. Two days
later, senior IG-Metall representatives sat down with leading machine-tool
manufacturers in Stuttgart to discuss a common strategy for saving jobs and
improving the industry's performance.
The two events illustrate the contrasting forces at work in Germany's highly
structured labour market as employers and unions struggle with recession and
with the need to face up to structural change. There is tension as
employers' organisations adopt a newly aggressive approach to negotiations
on pay and conditions.
But there is also a continuing will to co-operate in the search for more
flexibility in the organisation of work. Warnings that the 'social
partnership' that has kept the peace in German industry since the second
world war is under threat are thus premature. The real question is not
whether the two sides of industry will continue to manage their affairs
largely by consensus, but whether this approach is capable of producing an
adequate response to the structural dislocation now facing the German
economy.
That the labour market is an important component of Germany's problems
cannot be seriously in doubt. On the one hand the cost of labour has been
rising faster than productivity and than in Germany's main competitors,
while machinery running times and the working week are significantly shorter
than in most other leading industrial countries. On the other, unemployment
and short-time working have been growing rapidly, and an increasing
proportion of the jobless total of 3.3m has been out of work for more than a
year.
What is more, portions of the economy - such as agriculture and, in some
regions, construction - are becoming reliant on itinerant workers from such
places as Poland and the Czech republic who enjoy none of the protection
afforded the German workforce. The result is mounting polarisation between a
diminishing but highly-paid workforce and a growing number of people either
outside the formal labour market or with little hope of working again.
This, of course, is a pattern familiar elsewhere in western Europe. But
Germany's problem is more acute. Labour costs - including the social
contributions that have been growing especially rapidly in recent years  -
are already higher than in any other industrial country. In 1992, the
average cost of manufacturing labour in west Germany was nearly DM42 per
hour, of which DM20 constituted ancillary costs such as health and pension
contributions. The comparable figures in France, Germany's main trading
partner, were DM28 and DM13, and in Portugal, DM9 and DM4.
Moreover, Germany's system of industrial relations is among the most rigidly
organised in the world, subject to a bewildering battery of government laws
and centrally- negotiated collective agreements. Restrictions on working
time, for example, meant that the average German worked 1,700 hours in 1992
compared with 1,900 hours in the US and 2,080 in Japan.
It is a similar story with curbs on machinery running times: an average of
only 53 hours a week in west Germany, compared with 74 in the Netherlands
and 77 in Belgium.
In the good times, this tightly-drawn framework has had the advantage of
bringing order and stability to relations between employers and workers,
with the result that German industry has traditionally been freer of strikes
than any other in the Group of Seven with the exception of Japan. But it can
also be a drag on competitiveness. When things go wrong or when the economy
suffers an external or internal shock, industry and labour find it hard to
adapt.
As the economy ministry's recent report on Germany as a business location
points out: 'Social peace based on a productive consensus between industry
and labour is an important factor in attracting investment. But when more is
distributed than is earned, over time more than social peace will be
endangered.'
That is exactly what has happened with German unification, the consequences
of which are still reverberating through the labour market in both eastern
and western Germany. In the west, the economic boom unleashed by unification
led unions to push for high wage settlements without commensurate
productivity increases: west German unit labour costs increased by an
average of 4 per cent a year in the last three years, compared with 3.6 per
cent in the US, 2 per cent in Japan and 3.1 per cent in France.
The disruption was all the greater in the east. Rather than adjusting
settlements to the much lower productivity prevalent there, unions and
employers agreed to increase wages rapidly towards west German levels,
causing an employment shake-out of a scale and speed not seen anywhere in
the post-war industrial world. This goes to the nub of the issue confronting
Germany's 'social partners'.
To what extent is the corporatist approach to industrial relations that grew
up during the long years of prosperity in the west now appropriate? Can
employers and unions learn to respond more flexibly to the complex and
widely varying challenges posed by unification? The omens so far are not all
that good.
In the east, the agreement to raise wages towards western levels continues
to impose a crippling burden on industry, necessitating heavy government
subsidies to companies still owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency and
causing many others to close.
Earlier this year, the employers' organisation Gesamtmetall sought to
achieve greater flexibility in the eastern Lander by revoking the commitment
to equalise wages between east and west by 1994. IG-Metall furiously
denounced the move as an attempt to break the entire national pay bargaining
system, and called its members out on strike. Three weeks later, the two
sides compromised with an agreement to postpose full wage equalisation until
1996 and to introduce 'hardship clauses' allowing individual loss- making
companies to opt out.
But unless productivity rises dramatically, a two-year delay in full
equalisation will not make much difference to eastern industry's
profitability, and the hardship clause is in practice so tightly
circumscribed that it has barely been invoked so far. In the west as well,
the social partnership is under great strain, but not to the point of
breaking the mould.
While the squeeze on profits has prompted employers to take aim at wages and
perks, the unions are now sufficiently discomfited by rising unemployment to
focus more on the need to preserve jobs than on the pursuit of exorbitant
wage settlements. The result in coming months seems likely to be another
battle over working time and a moderate pay increase more or less in line
with inflation.
'If we can reduce working time further and distribute it more widely, that
would be an important step,' said Mr Walter Riester, deputy president of
IG-Metall.
The government, for its part, is making efforts to improve the climate for
industry. It has introduced measures to increase flexibility of working
time, for example by easing restrictions on Sunday working and allowing
longer machinery running times, and has cut generous unemployment benefit
payments in order to curb social costs.
Whether all this will begin to address the deeper structural problems that
many observers have identified in the German labour market, however, is
another matter. Apart from bringing in a raft of expensive job-creation
schemes in the east, for example, the government has shown little sign of
being ready to contemplate radical measures to get the jobless total down,
or to tackle the problem of the long-term unemployed.
There was a programme last year aimed at getting long-term jobless back into
work by offering them to employers initially at lower than normal wages. But
although quite successful in its own terms, it was small in scale and has
now lapsed pending further legislation. There are strong suspicions that the
unions would resist anything more ambitious for fear that lower wages for
the long-term unemployed would erode their own bargaining power.
As important in determining unemployment levels is the nature of wage
settlements themselves, and there are those who worry that in this area,
too, the German system is proving insufficiently flexible. Agreements on pay
and conditions reached through collective bargaining at national level, say
the critics, cannot make enough allowance for differentials between regions
and industries, however detailed and multi-faceted they may be. There are in
any case considerable impediments on workers' ability to move.
More particularly, national pay agreements by definition cannot reflect the
ability of individual employers to fund them. With an increasing number of
German companies in financial difficulties, there is pressure for more of a
profit-related component in wage settlements, or at least for a looser
national pay-bargaining framework which would set basic minimum levels but
leave employers greater flexibility than at present to fix precise pay
scales.
Here lies perhaps the most intriguing current pointer to how the German
labour market will evolve in the next few years. For one of the biggest
sources of stress at present is within employers' organisations such as
Gesamtmetall, with small and medium-sized member companies threatening to
break ranks.
For them, the modest degree of flexibility built into the national
pay-bargaining framework is no longer enough. 'Employers, especially in the
Mittelstand, are complaining that they cannot afford to pay the agreed
minimum,' says Prof Friedrich Buttler of the German labour office's research
institute in Nuremberg. 'They are threatening to leave the organisations and
make their own wage agreements. This is a challenge for the unions and for
the employer organisations.'
Some union leaders are already warning of the danger of growing inequality
between different tiers of manufacturing industry, drawing what they see as
an unsavoury comparison with Japan. 'Look at Toyota,' says Mr Riester. 'It
has good relations with its unions, but relations are worse in the supplier
companies and worse still in the suppliers of the suppliers. It leads to the
pyramid-isation of industry.'
Whatever you call it, as the cost squeeze on the Mittelstand companies
intensifies that is beginning to look like the shape of things to come.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (11): Ruthless self-examination - The
contents and importance of the Rexrodt Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE report published by the German government on 'safeguarding Germany's
future as an industrial location' is an attempt to launch a national debate
on the country's international competitiveness.
It is a report on the high costs of German labour; on the growing burden of
the welfare state; on excessive public sector involvement in the economy; on
resistance to change and suspicion of high technology; on inflexibility of
management as well as of labour; on short working hours and machine running
times; and on lack of competition in key areas of the German economy.
Some would argue that the entire subject, seized upon by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and his economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, as the most important
theme in Germany in the coming years, has been dealt with far too
negatively. The report fails to highlight the extraordinary strengths of the
German economy, its stability, and its capacity to change - slowly but
surely.
Yet all sides of the political and industrial spectrum now accept that the
subject must be urgently discussed.
The Rexrodt report seeks to address the issue not merely from an economic
standpoint, but also philosophically.
On the philosophical side, it calls for a return to old values of thrift,
initiative, competitiveness and creativity, combined with solidarity,
tolerance and humanity: in short, the values that have underpinned the
extraordinary post-war success of Germany's social market economy.
'After more than 45 years of reconstruction and growing prosperity, many of
these values do not have the same weight which they once had,' the Rexrodt
report says.
'Not least in connection with German unity, it is clear that the readiness
for innovation and change has diminished to an extent which presents the
economy and society with considerable problems.
'Structural changes are no longer perceived as chances for social and
economic advance, as well as for greater prosperity. They are seen as a
threat to rights and assets, a threat identified with unemployment and
social decline.'
The report, presented by Mr Rexrodt to the German parliament in September,
spells out a whole range of problems and challenges which contribute to the
concern over German competitiveness, and then sets out its own
recommendations for reform. At the same time it calls for a national debate
on the issues.
It sees seven major challenges to be accomplished:
to create up to 5m new jobs in both halves of Germany, and thus wipe out the
growing level of long-term, structural unemployment;
to prevent the inexorable rise in state spending as a proportion of national
income, and particularly to limit the rise in social spending;
to reverse the trends which leave Germany with the shortest working week,
the shortest working life, some of the longest holidays, and the shortest
machine-running times in its factories;
to invest more state money in research into new technologies, and less as
subsidies for uncompetitive old industries;
to cut back bureaucracy and red tape, which results in lengthy planning
approval times for new projects;
to cope with the dramatic changes in population structure, which will see
one third of the population over 60 by the year 2030; and
to reverse the trend towards purely academic training, instead of technical
and vocational training.
The environment in which Germany must seek to meet those challenges has also
changed markedly.
The most dramatic development internally is that of German unification, and
ensuring the recovery of the east German economy is clearly the government's
highest priority.
At the same time it recognises that Germany faces an ever more intense
competition for new investment, as the globalisation of world markets makes
it possible for manufacturers to base wherever they please. That competition
is increased by the need to open the western European market to ensure that
the new democracies of the east have a chance to develop.
The problems spelt out by the Rexrodt report cover the full range of
economic activity.
He believes that the state has become involved in too many activities which
could be carried out more efficiently by the private sector, and a
privatisation programme, both at the federal and at the state level, is an
important part of his plans.
He singles out the extremely high level not simply of wages, but of
personnel ancillary costs in Germany. Ancillary wage costs amount to 84 per
cent of direct wages today, thus almost doubling the costs of employing an
extra worker. Of those extra costs, 44 per cent are dictated by legal
obligations, in particular health, pensions, unemployment and social
security, and 56 per cent are various fringe benefits negotiated directly by
employers and trade unions, in addition to basic pay packets.
He mentions electricity costs for German companies well above the
international average; and indirect costs aggravated by red tape, long
planning procedures, extremely strict environmental legislation, and
building regulations.
He also criticises German companies for failing to invest enough in measures
to improve productivity and rationalise during the past 10-year growth
phase. And he criticises many German companies for a lack of innovation.
As far as state spending is concerned, Mr Rexrodt wants to reduce the
absolute proportion of GDP spent by the public sector from more than 50 per
cent today to the pre-unification level of around 45 per cent. Within that
amount, the emphasis should be switched to action which promotes investment,
innovation, and employment.
He calls for cuts in public sector staffing, especially in east Germany,
where remnants of the old communist system remain.
He wants new subsidies to be limited, in principle, to a maximum of five
years, or to be progressively decreased. And he wants to limit the public
sector deficit to less than 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 - in line with the
convergence criteria for the future European economic and monetary union.
As far as competition is concerned, he is seeking stronger powers for the
national cartel authorities to implement EC competition law, as well as the
establishment of an EC cartel office in Germany. He wants EC merger control
more strictly oriented on the principle of competition. And he wants action
against voluntary restraint agreements which violate cartel law.
The programme includes further reform of corporate taxation in Germany, to
remove disincentives to new investment. This includes further action to
dismantle taxes not related to earnings, such as the business capital tax
and the so-called operational wealth tax. It supports taxation which
encourages environmental protection - like the proposed EC-wide carbon
dioxide emission tax - provided it does not increase the overall corporate
tax burden.
On the employment front, the report calls for strict limitation on social
benefits, including stabilisation and if possible reduction in all the
contribution rates for health, pensions, unemployment and old age care.
It seeks rapid parliamentary approval of the draft law on more flexible
working hours, relaxing restrictions on weekend, holiday and shift-working.
It proposes legalising private employment agencies for a test period of two
years, to compete with the present state monopoly of labour offices.
In tackling excessive red tape and regulation, it calls for simplification
of the approval process for genetic technology research; simpler planning
requirements for new factories; and an overhaul of the complex of
administrative procedures companies are required to follow.
As for privatisation, it singles out federal government holdings in
Lufthansa, airports and seaports as a high priority, and the sale of real
estate owned by the state. It calls for speedy implementation of the reform
of the Post Office, with the aim of abolishing the telephone service
monopoly, and privatising the Deutsche Telekom, postal services, and post
bank.
It also covers the entire range of promoting research and development,
higher education, vocational education, and secondary school education.
'Safeguarding the future of Germany as an industrial location is for
politics, the institutions and the people of our country the main task to be
resolved in the years that lie before us,' the report concludes. 'When the
people in Germany reflect upon their common interests in safeguarding the
future of the economy, and act accordingly, Germany will master the
challenges of the future.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (10): A story of births, deaths and
marriages - The population is getting steadily older. The implications must
be faced now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE Germans are dying out'. Back in the early 1980s, the slogan was
popularised by novelist Gunter Grass in the subtitle of his short story
Kopfgeburten. Ten years on, the prospect of a shrinking and ageing
population is moving closer to reality - and is beginning to become a
central preoccupation for Germany's chattering classes.
All over the land, people are marrying later, having fewer children and
living longer, with the result that the number of Germans has already been
declining for some time, to a current 72m out of a total population of 80m.
Within another decade, however, it is certain that Germany's overall
population will embark on a steepening decline.
Suddenly, the experts fear, Germany will face a structural crisis with which
it is ill- equipped to cope, as a shrinking working population bears the
burden of an increasing number of old-age pensioners and as Germans
themselves come to terms with the proportional increase of foreigners in
their midst. The far-reaching consequences could affect every aspect of the
way the country organises its political, economic, social and external
affairs.
'It is like having termites in your house,' says Meinhard Miegel, co-author
with Stefanie Wahl of a study of the demographic problem just published by
the Bonn-based Institut fur Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft*. 'On the surface
everything looks fine, but all of a sudden it collapses. This house looks
sound at the moment and will continue to do so for some time to come. Then,
in the early part of the 21st century we will face a crisis.'
Mr Miegel uses colourful metaphors for effect. In a sense, the challenge
confronting Germany is the same as that faced by most of the developed
world. In all the leading industrial countries, pressures on the welfare
state are growing as a result of falling birth rates, longer life- spans and
increasing immigration.
But Germany's problem is still more acute than that of its European
neighbours and its American and Japanese trading partners, for several
reasons. First, it is further ahead in the population cycle: the number of
Germans started to decline 20 years ago, while most European nations were
still in a phase of gentle growth; as a result, Germany already has a
proportionately higher elderly population.
Second, although the problem has been disguised up to now by waves of
immigration in the 1960s and late 1980s, that in itself has created
difficulties thanks to Germany's failure to integrate most of the new
inhabitants into its society. Such difficulties can only proliferate in the
years ahead.
Third, Germany's history in this century has seen to it that population
decline in the early decades of the next will seem especially acute. In the
Nazi years, there was a sudden surge in the birth rate as Germans were told
it was part of their patriotic duty to procreate. The offspring of that baby
boom are now getting on in years and in another decade will be starting to
die off in significant numbers.
The numbers can be stated with almost predestined precision, for they
reflect a secular trend of falling birth rates and diminishing family sizes
dating back (with the notable exception of the Hitler years) to the early
1900s (see chart).
By the early 1970s, the generation of German children was less numerous than
that of their grandparents and the number of deaths overtook that of births.
Since then the margin has widened: at the turn of the century, Mr Miegel
estimates, deaths will exceed births by 300,000 a year, rising by 2030 to a
staggering 600,000 - equivalent to eliminating the city of Frankfurt every
year. Between now and 2030, the number of Germans will decline by about 15m
 -not far short of the current population of eastern Germany.
This is not a trend, say Mr Miegel and Ms Wahl, that can be reversed through
some governmental magic wand. The individualistic Germans of today are not
going to be persuaded to breed either through diktat or economic incentive.
Even in eastern Germany - whose apparently more youthful population results
mainly from a higher death rate under communism thanks to poor health care
and difficult working and living conditions - the birth rate has plunged
since unification.
Nor does increasing immigration represent much of a solution. True, the
arrival over the last three years of some 3.2m new inhabitants - including
asylum seekers and 1.4m 'Aussiedler' of German origin, mainly from the
former Soviet empire - has served to compensate for the declining number of
Germans. But that is unlikely to continue. Germany has now tightened up its
asylum laws, and in any case is having severe difficulties integrating the
newcomers, many of whom end up on the unemployment registers or outside the
formal labour market.
Simply to make up for the continuing fall in the German population, the
country would have to take 1.5m immigrants in the 1990s and 13.8m more
between 2001 and 2030. It is inconceivable that German society, or the
country's political system, could handle an influx of this magnitude.
One consequence of all this is an already perceptible 'greying' of Germany.
Today, one fifth of the population is 20 or younger and another fifth 60 or
over. In 2000, the under-20s will still represent a fifth but the over-60s
will have reached a quarter of the total; by 2030, only 16 per cent will be
under 20, 46 per cent will be between 20 and 60, and 38 per cent over 60. In
short, within less than 30 years, a diminishing population of working age
will have to carry a roughly equal, and rising, number of people either too
young or too old to work  - at least under current laws.
The effects will be felt in every corner of society. School and university
rolls will fall; the shrinkage in the population between 20 and 60 will
dictate changes in government policies towards the labour market; the
country's infrastructure needs will alter. Above all, the shifting shape of
the population will entail significant structural changes in the economy,
and in particular in the role of the state.
The most obvious burden will be on Germany's social welfare system. A rising
number of over-60s - and indeed, thanks to medical science, of over-80s -
spells increased spending on health care, pensions and old people's care.
Nobody seriously believes that Germany will be able to afford this without a
substantial restructuring of the welfare state, involving some increase in
private-sector provision.
The economy will undergo other - subtler but no less significant - changes.
Property values could fall as elderly people sell off assets to fund their
service needs; the manufacturing sector will diminish in relation to
services; capital for infrastructure projects will tend be raised on a
shorter term basis.
Mr Miegel and Ms Wahl even suggest that Germany's population shrinkage will
over time serve to reduce its economic might: 'In two generations, Germany
might under realistic assumptions only be a medium-sized European power. Its
population may not be, as today, the second largest in Europe after
Russia's, but perhaps the fourth or fifth largest after Russia, Ukraine and
possibly also France and Britain ..And its population will be among the
oldest in Europe and the world.'
What, then, is to be done? There are no easy answers. Ideally, says the
study, Germany would - while coming to terms with a some measure of
shrinkage in its population - seek to offset it by adopting sensible
policies on immigration and on the integration of foreigners, for example by
allowing a greater number to become German citizens.
Unfortunately, nothing like this is remotely on the cards. The word
Bevolkerungspolitik (population policy) acquired an ugly ring in German
politics as a result of its abuse during the Nazi period, and the current
generation of politicians tends to regard these issues as too hot to handle.
Nevertheless, they will not simply go away. If Germany does not start
sensibly to debate the structural questions raised by its shrinking
population soon, then it will find itself grappling with them in a much more
polarised political climate 10 years from now.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (6): Tense new world - Bonn's foreign
policy dilemmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS

<TEXT>
WHEN a phalanx of steelworkers descended on Bonn to demonstrate against
plant closures, they painted their hardhats blue. It was a joke of some
sophistication.
As blue is the colour of United Nations military headgear, the workers were
making a sarcastic comment on the obsessive, and sometimes arcane, debate in
the capital concerning German participation in UN peacekeeping operations.
Only if they wore blue helmets, they were saying, would Bonn heed them.
That small incident illustrates a wider problem for German politicians as
they struggle to define a foreign policy for their newly unified country.
With the ending of the division of Europe, Germany is having to contemplate
assuming a political role in the world and in Europe more commensurate with
its economic might. But its own citizens are more concerned with the bread
and butter issues of recession, job losses and immigration. The result,
rather than a clarification of foreign policy issues in the public mind, has
been continuing confusion.
The good news is that the German political establishment has begun for the
first time since the second world war to articulate clear arguments
concerning the country's national interests - itself a taboo phrase until
recently. The difficulty lies in putting these principles coherently into
practice.
The UN is an important symbol both of the country's need to find a world
role beyond the somewhat passive one it was assigned by the victorious
allies after the second world war, and of its difficulty in doing so: even
as the government pursues its low-key campaign for a permanent seat on the
Security Council, it remains politically - some say constitutionally -
hamstrung in doing more than taking a small part in peacekeeping in Somalia
and Bosnia.
To have sent a contingent of German troops to Africa for the first time
since Rommel and to have provided German personnel for Awacs reconnaissance
flights over the former Yugoslavia are already big steps in the direction
demanded by Germany's allies. But even those 'out of area' gestures remain
the subject of a tedious tussle between the coalition partners, the
opposition SPD and the constitutional court that illustrates how much
further Germany has to go before it will feel comfortable in its new guise.
'Given where we started from, it's quite astonishing how far we've got,'
says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman of Chancellor Kohl's CDU who
last summer produced a thoughtful paper on German foreign policy interests.
'But measured against what we need to do and against our own demands for a
common foreign and security policy in the European Community, it's still
much too little.'
For a variety of reasons, similar ambiguities apply in Germany's approach to
other multilateral organisations that are arguably of greater national
interest. In Nato, German politicians have to weigh their Angst over
developments to the east and their desire to maintain and strengthen the
transatlantic alliance - a complex balancing act that reflects Germany's
pivotal position on the fault line between eastern and western Europe.
Instability in the east affects Germany more directly than any other western
country: one fruit of that are the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers
that have flocked across its eastern border since 1989.
The imperative identified by all mainstream politicians as a result is to
integrate the eastern countries into western political and economic
structures as fast as possible: in Mr Lamers's catchy phrase, 'our future
does not lie in the east; the future of the east lies in the west'. That
means principally holding out the prospect of eventual EC membership to
Germany's central European neighbours - though until the violent events in
Moscow earlier this month prompted some careful backtracking, there were
also voices (notably that of Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister) suggesting
these countries should also be brought rapidly under the Nato security
umbrella.
In the European Community - cornerstone and central pillar of German policy
since the 1950s - the balancing act is becoming harder and more sensitive
still. On the one hand, as the Community's strongest member Germany is
discovering that it bears heavy political and economic responsibilities
towards its neighbours; on the other, its ability to fulfil them is
seemingly undercut by the domestic problems which have followed unification.
This is a thorny dilemma - not least for a man of instinctive pro-European
convictions such as Mr Kohl - and it is linked to the debate over Standort
Deutschland. Unless and until it sorts out its own economy, Germany will not
be able to play its full part as the engine of European integration; but if
German institutions accord priority to domestic problems - as has the
Bundesbank in repeatedly refusing to accelerate interest rate cuts this year
 -Germany stands accused by its partners of wrecking the game.
Prof Karl Kaiser, head of a leading Bonn foreign policy think tank, says
Germany's current difficulties are hampering its effort to come to terms
with the international consequences of unification: 'We are in the midst of
redefining our political role as the leading economy and currency of Europe.
But the structural and temporary weaknesses of the economy potentially
undercut such an effort.'
For Mr Kohl - who warns constantly of the dangers of a 'renationalisation'
of policy-making - and for his foreign minister, the Free Democrat leader Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the answer can only be more Europe, not less - a relaunch of
the EC now that Germany has been allowed by the constitutional court to
ratify the Maastricht treaty, a continuing push for economic and monetary
union, an eventual streamlining of EC institutions.
But in striving for all that, he faces formidable problems. First, there is
the relationship with France, which has in the past year suffered greater
stress than at any time in the past two decades. From monetary and exchange
rate policy to the future of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade
negotiations, significant differences of emphasis have emerged between Paris
and Bonn.
While these have not fundamentally impaired the Franco-German axis at the
heart of the Community, they mean that co-operation has been tinged with
mistrust and potential misunderstanding, and Mr Kohl is having to work hard
to prevent this from developing into something worse.
On the Gatt trade talks in particular, a damaging row among Community
leaders later this year cannot be ruled out - and Mr Kohl will be torn
between a desire to accommodate French concern over farm exports and
Germany's overwhelming interest as Europe's top trading power in seeing the
Uruguay Round completed.
Second, the prospects for Emu itself remain deeply murky. Behind the
exchange rate turbulence of the past year lies a deeper uncertainty as to
whether it will ultimately be possible to reconcile Germany's instinctive
attachment to monetary stability - and the Bundesbank's statutory duty to
uphold it - with its European partners' desire for genuine co-determination
in monetary matters. If as the 1999 deadline for phase three of monetary
union moves closer that uncertainty is not resolved, the whole project could
collapse.
Third, and no less important, Mr Kohl will have to contend with an
insistent, and growing, mood of popular scepticism towards aspects of
European integration in Germany itself - especially towards the replacement
of the D-Mark with a common currency. He badly miscalculated the degree to
which Emu would prove acceptable to his own people in the first place, and
accepts that the Bundestag will have the final say on whether phase three
will proceed.
With important voices to his right calling for a slowdown in the process,
the Chancellor will have to play his cards carefully to prevent the EC, and
foreign policy in general, from becoming an electoral issue.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (7): Slow awakening / A look at east
German democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN eastern Germany, the emergence of new, indigenous political elites has
been painfully slow in contrast to the rise of a small entrepreneurial
class.
But if eastern Germany is to be politically, psychologically, and socially
integrated into the concept of Standort Deutschland - Germany as an
investment centre - it will require local political elites in eastern
Germany to achieve this.
Throughout the five eastern states, a two-tier system of the organisation of
power at the highest level has emerged. With the exception of Mr Manfred
Stolpe in Brandenburg, the only Social Democratic prime minister in the
region, and Mr Berndt Seite from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the prime ministers
are all from west Germany.
Admittedly, the premiers are flanked by ministers, many of whom are
easterners. However, the state secretaries are westerners. The case can be
easily made that the cooperation between easterners and westerners on the
state level in eastern Germany has been crucial for politically integrating
the country, and for training a new administration.
But it is not as simple as that. Easterners have been wary about becoming
involved in politics at the state level because of the past - a past
dominated by the Stasi, the state security system.
It was an extraordinarily sophisticated and insidious system. In its final
days, as Fritz Stern pointed out in a recent article in the Washington-based
Foreign Affairs, the Stasi consisted of 97,000 full-time employees, and
perhaps as many as 140,000 unofficial collaborators. Moreover, about 2m out
of a population of 17m were members of the SED (Socialist Unity, or
communist party), thus ensuring some connection - however slight - with the
Stasi. The 100 miles of Stasi files are testament enough to its hold over
the society: the system was designed to implicate as many people as
possible.
Because of the ubiquity of the Stasi system, an emotional debate has been
taking place in Germany about the way the files have been used. The law
opening the files, which went into effect on January 2, 1992, allows
government agencies to request background checks on their employees.
Thousands have since been dismisssed. But precisely because the files are
still open, the easterners have been placed in a position where they have
been inhibited about speaking out about the process of unification, or about
being actively involved in the political process. They are never sure if
they will ever be deemed 'clean'.
For example, every civil servant has to take an oath of loyalty to the
constitution. If an easterner is regarded as 'clean' in the sense that no
incriminating evidence has emerged from the Stasi files, he or she can join
the civil service. But the files are not closed. A person is still under
suspicion for a further three years - just in case a separate file
implicates them with some connection with the Stasi. The shadow of the past
hangs over them. Paradoxically, the newly-found freedom has had the bizarre
and disturbing effect of silencing them.
The voice which speaks on behalf of the eastern Germans is the voice of the
western German official. Yet in a strange way some easterners are
perpetuating this unequal relationship by insisting that the files be kept
open. Some of the loudest proponents include Mr Steffen Heitmann, the
presidential candidate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian
Democratic Union party. Yet this entire process is having a debilitating
effect on political life in eastern Germany. The eastern Germans have been
made to believe that the past 40 years have been worthless.
Prominent west German politicians and intellectuals, including Egon Bahr,
the former Social Democratic federal minister, believe 'enough is enough'
and support an amnesty for those waiting trial, or already charged. They
argue that the constant judging - if not hounding - of a cross section of
east German society will not only perpetuate the paralysis of political life
in eastern Germany; it will deepen the sense of mistrust between eastern and
western Germans. The case of Mr Gerhard Riege, an east German deputy in the
federal parliament in Bonn explains why.
Mr Riege committed suicide in early 1992 after it had been reported that he
had been a Stasi informer during the 1950s.
His death provoked a passionate response from Mr Hermann Scheer, a west
German, and Social Democratic party deputy. 'We are living through a public
witch-hunt that is unworthy of a democratic state. A country that allowed
former SA members and Hitler Youth graduates to rise to high government
positions has no right to condemn a man like Gerhard Riege because he had
contact with the Stasi from the age of 24 to 30.'
President Richard Von Weizsacker has frequently added his weight to the
debate. 'The (Stasi) files always reflect the view of their masters. They do
not lie in this, but they are one-sided and must be evaluated. They are not
an objective or moral authority.'
The elections next year could well convey the sense of disappointment and
disorientation among eastern Germans, perhaps through a low turn out and a
swing from the established political parties.
The disappointment is caused not just by high unemployment, or failed
expectations raised by Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he said in 1990 that
eastern Germany would be a 'blossoming landscape in a few years', and that
'no one would be worse off after unification'. It is a sense of
powerlessness fuelled by the feeling of imposed shame; the loss of the Voice
because its words are not believed; the loss of the spontaneity and civic
courage which helped to break down the Berlin Wall. If Standort Deutschland
is to have any political meaning, it must help break the silence in the
east.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (9): Setting for an Opel - Westward
investment / Kaiserslautern on the Rhine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID HERMAN, chairman of Adam Opel, is not a man to sit quietly and brood
about the frustrations and disadvantages of manufacturing in Germany. Since
he arrived to take charge at General Motors' brightest subsidiary this year,
he has missed few opportunities - on a speaking platform or in interviews -
to grumble about absenteeism, high labour costs and inflexible working
practices.
And yet there he was in mid-August announcing that a DM500m investment in
diesel engine manufacture, employing 475 and with capacity for 250,000
low-emission power units a year, was to be made in the company's Rhineland
Palatinate plant at Kaiserslautern in preference to nine other options
including the UK, Australia and Hungary. The decision was, he proclaimed, a
signal that Opel still had faith in Standort Deutschland.
Apart from the 14 per cent contribution to the cost from the federal and
regional governments and the European Community regional fund (the Rhineland
Palatinate is being especially hard hit by the withdrawal of US forces from
Germany), there were plenty of sound and logical strategic and commercial
reasons why Kaiserslautern should be the natural first choice.
Employing more than 5,000, it has been built up since opening in 1966 as a
main supplier of important components to Opel group factories - including
Vauxhall and Saab - all over the world. Its staple output of engines, body
parts, plastics, and rear axles was expanded in 1989 by the start of
drive-shaft production. Power-assisted steering units joined the range in
June this year. Because of previous rationalisation, the site had the
necessary space available together with a reserve pool of experienced and
skilled engineers.
But the clincher was a benchmark agreement with the workers' council in
which group working was bundled together with other ideas relatively new to
Germany. As a result, the new production facilities will run round-the-clock
for five days a week, uninterrupted by the customary stoppages for shift
changes and breaks. Maintenance work will be carried out on Saturdays as a
part of the normal working week.
While none of the elements in the package can be described as new to
manufacturing practice, their combination and implementation in western
Germany marked something of a break-through.
Starting on a greenfield site with ample job-hungry former employees of the
old Wartburg works on hand, management was able to introduce
US/Japanese-style working practices from the start. As a result, the plant,
open for just over a year, has just hired a further 500 workers to man a
third shift. This made only a small dent in eastern Germany's unemployment
figures, but it was a notable achievement in a sector which has been
preoccupied for most of this year with arranging short-time working and job
cuts.
The Kaiserslautern deal did not go unnoticed among hard-liners elsewhere in
the motor industry.
It was denounced from Wolfsburg, headquarters of the rival Volkswagen group,
as an 'attack on the economic structure of Germany'. Opel officials thought
that was 'a funny thing to say' - especially since Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, the
former plant manager at Eisenach, who did all the negotiations with the
workforce, was promptly poached and made a main board director at VW's Audi
subsidiary.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (8): Why the Finns came to town - Eastward
investment / Eilenburg in Saxony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S and Europe's largest paper manufacturer, could have chosen to
build its new recycling plant in western Germany, or in another European
Community country. Instead, it decided on the eastern German state of
Saxony.
'We had looked around other states in eastern Germany. The decision was
close. In the end, we opted for Eilenburg, a small town near Leipzig,' said
Mr Jukka Hamala, the president of Enso-Gutzeit.
Many factors influenced the group's final decision to expand into paper
recycling in eastern Germany. It received investment grants of between 15
and 20 per cent for a greenfield site on which it will build a recycling
paper mill costing DM800m. And, taking into account tax relief and special
depreciation allowances, Gutzeit reckons its investment outlay will be about
55 per cent of the total amount.
But it was not only the financial incentives which brought the Finns to
Saxony. 'There was the minimum of red tape,' explained Mr Kari Vainio, head
of communications at Gutzeit. 'We started negotiations two years ago in
November. One year from now, we will be up and running. This is really fast.
We had the maximum of cooperation. None of it was fake. It was a really
constructive relationship with the local authorities,' he said. The site,
which cost about DM10m, was bought not from the Treuhand, the agency charged
with privatising and restructuring eastern German industry, but from the
local authorities of Saxony.
This time next year, Gutzeit will be on schedule to produce at Eilenburg
280,000 tonnes of newsprint, primarily from recycled paper and it will
employ about 350 people. By 1995, 100 per cent of the operations will be
based on recycled paper. The mill will have a capacity of 320,000 tonnes a
year.
But while investment incentives and a flexible local administration smoothed
Gutzeit's road to Eilenburg, there is little doubt in the mind of Mr Kai
Korhonen, managing director of Sachsen Papier, (the name of the plant),
about the importance of Saxony's geographical and cultural location. 'Think
about the traditions of this place,' he said.
For well over a century, Saxony, and Leipzig in particular, was one of the
great European crossroads. Today, it is two hours drive from Berlin,
slightly longer to Prague, and four hours to Munich.
'Look at the market out there,' said Mr Harmala, on the day he laid the
foundation stone at Eilenburg under a hot, cloudless day. 'The media and
newspaper market is growing in western Germany, and especially in eastern
Germany. We cannot ignore the growing demand in the countries of eastern
Europe. By being here, we will be in a position to capture these markets,'
he added.
The German market alone accounts for 15 per cent of Gutzeit's net turnover
which last year totalled DM3.2bn. The European Community countries together
account for 60 per cent of its net sales. Net sales and total exports world
wide account for 80 per cent of the group's annual turnover. 'With this
profile, it is clear we had to expand into the German market and also use it
as a stepping stone into eastern Europe,' said Mr Vainio.
Saxony's cultural traditions played an important role for Gutzeit's decision
as well. A major publishing centre in the last century, this proud and
increasingly self-confident state has retained its traditions and expertise
in this field.
There is also an infrastructure in place. Deutsche Telekom, for example, has
already invested DM850m in Leipzig alone to support the expanding graphics,
book publishing and printing sectors. Gutzeit is not alone in coming to
Saxony.
Since late 1990, when the Treuhand embarked on its privatisation programme,
the state, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, has attracted DM45.1bn worth of
investment commitments and has secured 426,661 jobs through these sales. Of
the 3,797 enterprises and property sold by the Treuhand, more than 230 have
been bought by foreigners who have invested DM3.7bn in the state, and have
guaranteed 30,000 jobs.
Mr Vainio's only comment in explaining the high level of investment in the
region was short and to the point. 'We believe in Standort Saxony.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (5): Political traffic jam may forge
coalition - A flood of elections will soon engulf the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of no fewer than 19 separate elections in Germany next year is
enough to strike horror into the heart of the hardiest party campaigner.
Worse than that, the outcome of the final vote in the 'election marathon',
the poll for the federal parliament itself, hangs on no more than a couple
of percentage points cast for the fringe parties.
The situation could scarcely be less predictable. And the country is
suffering from weariness with the political process.
The major parties are already manoeuvring for advantage, and the legislative
machine in the national parliament is rapidly running out of steam. By the
second half of 1994, when Germany is supposed to take over the rotating
presidency of the European Community, the country is going to be totally
involved in its own internal politics.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to talk about fundamental questions of
Germany's international competitiveness, its need for major structural
reforms, its place in Europe, and its international responsibilities. But
the recession, taxation, unification costs, and unemployment mean that the
agenda will be overwhelmingly domestic and near-term. Moreover, nobody is
ready to reach conclusions on those major structural questions when a change
of government could be coming next autumn.
So much for the downside. For the political analyst, however, next year's
plethora of polls will provide a fascinating insight into the shifting
allegiances of a united Germany, and some crucial indicators for the future
political direction of the country.
One thing is clear: there has been a steady drift from all the traditional
political parties, in favour of non-voting (the largest group), the Greens,
an assortment of far right-wing parties such as the Republicans, the
Democratic Socialist Party (PDS) - the former Communists in eastern Germany
 -and local interest groups.
In the latest opinion polls, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), and its sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union
(CSU), have slipped from a combined vote of 43.8 per cent at the last
election in December 1990, to popular support of less than 30 per cent. If
there were elections tomorrow, the pollsters say, they might recover
somewhat to around 36 per cent.
Their weakest support is in east Germany, key to the election victory last
time, where the CDU is running at barely 21 per cent support. Mr Kohl's
choice of the previously-unknown Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Justice Minister
of Saxony, to be his candidate for the state presidency, seems to have
alienated more easterners than it has won.
The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) is doing little better, in
spite of the sharp recession in the German economy, high unemployment, and
general dissatisfaction with the government. Current support stands at
around 35 per cent, and in an election the party would win around 38 per
cent, the pollsters say. What is most peculiar is that the opposition is not
doing better.
The big question is whether either CDU or SPD can recover enough support
over the coming year to put together a 'natural' coalition on the left or
the right - or whether they will be condemned to form a 'grand coalition'
together, because of the splintering of the vote to the protest parties.
The Greens, now allied with Bundnis-90, the loose left-wing alliance of
democratic parties thrown up in the wake of the east German revolution, are
clearly doing best of the protest parties. In the most recent state
elections in Hamburg, they almost doubled their vote from 7 to 13.5 per
cent, and are negotiating to form a coalition in the state parliament with
the SPD. Such a red-green coalition also appears a distinct possibility in
the national elections next year, for the Greens are currently supported by
at least 10 per cent of voters nationally.
The SPD leadership is torn. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the young and competent,
but thus-far uninspiring new leader of the party, knows that the issues
which will decide the 1994 campaign are parochial, and largely economic:
jobs, housing, social benefits, as well as law and order, and immigration.
On most of those issues, an alliance with the Greens might be an electoral
disadvantage. Only on popular environmental issues - no longer at the top of
the recession-hit political agenda - would an electoral pact obviously help
the Social Democrats.
The Free Democrats (FDP), the junior partner in the ruling coalition, and
the king-makers in German politics ever since the federal republic began,
are as affected by the anti-establishment mood as anyone. In Hamburg, they
failed even to gain the 5 per cent necessary to get into the city
parliament. In the national polls, they are bumping along with less than 10
per cent support. If neither they nor the CDU/CSU can improve significantly,
the current conservative-liberal coalition is doomed.
The most likely outcome is a grand coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD, just as
happened in 1969. Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping are similar politicians, albeit
of different generations. They are men of consensus, prepared to negotiate -
and both come from the same neck of the woods, in the Rhineland-Palatinate.
Indeed, Mr Kohl is said to have a sneaking respect for the way his rival,
through sheer hard campaigning at the grassroots, managed to displace the
Chancellor's own CDU from power in the state in 1991.
Mr Scharping is desperately trying to turn his party into one seen as
'capable of government', rather than the squabbling collection of teachers
and evangelists that it all too often appears to be in opposition. He is
seeking to move into the centre ground of German politics, vacated as Mr
Kohl moves to the right to head off the Republicans.
Neither wants to talk about a grand coalition. Both deny they want one. But
both know they may be condemned to live with one. The key lies with the
protest parties.
If the Republicans and the PDS, to name the two most likely contenders, both
just fail to make the 5 per cent cut-off point needed to get into the
Bundestag, then it might well be possible to put together a red-green
coalition, or a conservative-liberal coalition, with less than 50 per cent
of the votes. But if either or both of them do win seats in the Bundestag,
then a grand coalition becomes almost inevitable.
The Republicans are no longer picking up significant new support in the
polls. They failed to make 5 per cent in Hamburg, by a whisker - mainly
because their bitter right-wing rival, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), was
also running. They have been tarred with the brush of skinhead violence
against foreigners, which clearly loses them support, not the contrary.
The PDS is unlikely to win 5 per cent nationally on the basis of its
localised eastern support, but it could win three direct mandates to
parliament - an alternative route to the Bundestag. Then the party as a
whole can claim seats.
Even before the October poll, the main parties will face a gruelling test in
the European elections in June. German voters have traditionally used the
European poll as a useful chance to let off steam, and vote for the protest
groups. So the chances of big votes for the far-right and the Greens are
much better. Mr Kohl knows that a big pro-Republican vote in June will have
a terrible effect on Germany's image abroad, even if voters return to the
fold for the state and national elections.
Any or all of the state elections could start a tide running for or against
a particular party. Of the seven in prospect, the SPD rules in two, the CDU
in four, and the CSU, as always, in Bavaria. The chances are that all will
see a backlash against the party in power.
Mr Kohl is relying on his own solid stature, as the one familiar, reassuring
father figure, to bring the faithful back to his party, especially at a time
of economic recession. Judging by the steady haemorrhage of support he is
seeing at the moment, it will be an uphill struggle.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (3): Fickle barometers - Economists are
confused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER getting it so wrong last time, the myriad analysts of the western
German economy are demonstrating admirable caution - and confusing diversity
 -in their preliminary forecasts for 1994. The range extends from a further
decline of around 0.5 per cent in gross domestic product to growth of 1 per
cent.
Most optimists base their expectations on a heady mix of reviving demand in
European Community markets, low pay awards, and faith in government promises
to screw down public spending which, in turn, will encourage the Bundesbank
to screw down short-term interest rates.
The pessimists point to fading domestic demand, stubborn inflation, the
difficulties of persuading unions to accept further real income cuts and the
effects on export prospects of a strong D-Mark.
Since private sector analysts still cannot agree on the outcome for the
economy in the current year (although most have more than doubled their
early forecasts to a drop in output of more than 2 per cent) the degree of
variance is hardly surprising. The recession, by common consent, has been
the worst since the war, and to some extent the path out of the slump is
unknown.
The statistics do not offer much of a clear pointer, though the picture they
have given of performance over the past year is bleak enough. For four
consecutive quarters - from the second quarter of 1992 until the first
quarter of 1993 - west Germany's gross domestic product was actually
shrinking: reaching its most negative rate of minus 1.5 per cent at the
beginning of the year. Perhaps thanks to that particularly sharp downturn,
it showed a 0.5 per cent recovery in the second quarter, and the question is
now whether that does indeed mark a bottoming out of the recession.
Industrial orders in the west have shown conflicting signals: up 2.9 per
cent in May, down by 1.6 per cent in June, up again by 2.3 per cent in July,
and down a provisional 2.0 per cent in August, according to the Bundesbank.
West German industrial production, on the other hand, showed a 2.2 per cent
recovery in August, after two consecutive months of slight decline. The
economics ministry in Bonn firmly believes that the worst is over, citing a
very gradual improvement also in the mood of the business community.
Inflation looks set to ease gradually, after a peak of 4.3 per cent in the
cost of living index in the first quarter, reached again in July. It was
down to 4.2 per cent in August and 4.0 per cent in September. In east
Germany, it was again looking steady at around 8.9 per cent, reflecting the
continuing adjustment of low administered prices in the old state system.
As for the unemployment outlook, that is still unequivocally bleak:
seasonally adjusted unemployment has increased steadily throughout the year
in the west, from just under 2m at the turn of the year to 2.38m in
September, a rate of 7.7 per cent. In east Germany, it is sticking at around
15.2 per cent, or around 1.16m workers. Forecasts suggest continuing
lay-offs through 1994, leading to a possible jobless total of 4m by the end
of the year.
That all this translates into a structural crisis in which the German
economy has lost its attraction as an investment location is not universally
accepted. According to the local branch of the Arthur D. Little consultancy,
the Standort Deutschland debate is too introverted and tends to ignore
external views. A poll of 50 senior foreign executives discovered 76 per
cent saying 'yes' immediately when asked if they would invest in Germany.
While those questioned readily listed the familiar disincentives of high
labour costs and taxes, bureaucracy and economic and political uncertainty,
they had no doubts about the attractions: the size and wealth of the German
market; proximity to eastern Europe; qualified, motivated workers;
infrastructure, and a stable legal framework.
Nevertheless, there is no mistaking the new sense of realism that is abroad,
in both public and private sectors.
Economists expect overall industrial and public sector pay awards for 1994
to equal or even undercut the expected inflation rate, thus taking another
twist out of the inflationary spiral. They are less sure about the
politicians' efforts, especially since Germany will spend much of next year
in a frenzy of state and local elections, ending with the federal polls.
There has already been some progress. New rules on prescriptions and a
compulsory freeze on drugs prices, introduced last January, have already
saved billions of D-Marks in federal subsidies to the over-loaded statutory
health insurance schemes. Bonn has also saved by winkling out social
security fraudsters and tax dodgers. It plans cuts in unemployment and
welfare benefits, but has yet to implement most of them. Even if it does,
sceptics say, the planned economies seem unlikely to materialise because of
the rapid increase in unemployment stemming from industry's rationalisation
efforts.
Meanwhile, regional and local authorities, mostly controlled by the Social
Democrat opposition, and naturally loath to listen to pleadings from Bonn,
have tried to offset their still-rising deficits by cranking up charges for
local services such as rubbish collection.
Excluding the billions of borrowings by the post office, Deutsche Telekom,
railways and the Treuhand privatisation agency, the general government
spending deficit this year is expected to reach DM150bn, or 5.5 per cent of
GDP, although the proportion is scheduled to fall to 4.5 per cent in 1994.
Including the 'off-budget' extras, the figure rises to DM230bn. The
Bundesbank has made no secret of its concern that it is government borrowing
which is driving monetary growth to unacceptable levels. Looming increases
in taxes on fuel and insurance will tweak inflation further. Meanwhile, the
coalition continues to undermine its own credibility by nibbling round the
edges of major structural problems. One example is the extraordinary debate
about how best to pay for care for the elderly and infirm while the entire
old-age pensions system threatens to collapse under pressure of the rapidly
ageing population.
As Mr Michael Heise of the government's independent council of economic
experts has noted, fiscal policy is a determining factor for Germany's
attractiveness as a location for business.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (4): When Daimler is ill - Regional focus
/ Baden-Wurttemberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BADEN-WURTTEMBERG in the south-west of Germany has traditionally been the
Land with the highest income in Germany, the lowest unemployment, the
highest innovation and a greater proportion of exports than Germany as a
whole.
But Baden-Wurttemberg's fortunes have turned since the beginning of the
German recession in the second half of last year. Far from proving resilient
to the downturn, it has turned out to be more vulnerable than the country as
a whole. Within a year unemployment has risen from 4.6 to 6.7 per cent and
in the first six months of the current year the state's GDP fell by 4 per
cent compared with a downturn of 2.6 per cent for western Germany.
This sudden swing reflects the fact that Baden-Wurttemberg's former
strengths have become weaknesses. The Land is dominated by 'old' industries
such as machine-tool manufacturing, the automobile sector and its suppliers,
areas of the economy which are particularly badly hit in the current
downturn.
Baden-Wurttemberg used to export more than the average for western Germany -
now its manufacturers are suffering from the double impact of a strong
currency and a decline in world demand for investment goods.
Another former strength which has evolved into a weakness is the
predominance of family-owned businesses, the so-called 'Mittelstand' of
small to medium-sized companies which constitutes the backbone of the
regional economy. Baden-Wurtemmberg prides itself on being the home of the
so-called 'Tuftler', the person who refuses to stop trying to solve
apparently unsolvable problems. Combine this technical bent with a fierce
streak of independence and you have the classic Swabian Mittelstandler
(Swabia is the former Wurttemberg in the eastern part of the state).
Of course Baden-Wurttemberg is home to some of the giants of German industry
 -for example Daimler-Benz and Bosch. Less big but just as famous is the
Porsche luxury car company. Even these large and well-known enterprises grew
from Mittelstand roots: they were founded by technically-minded
entrepreneurs such as Claudius Dornier, Gottlieb Daimler, Carl Benz,
Ferdinand Porsche or Robert Bosch - all typical 'Tuftlers'.
The bigger companies have traditionally shared the Mittelstand ethos - 'a
unique combination of the traditional and the innovative' as researchers
from the University of Wales College of Cardiff recently described it (*).
Clustered around Stuttgart, in towns such as Ludwigsburg, Boblingen,
Sindelfingen, Esslingen and Gopingen , smaller companies have prospered from
supplying their larger neighbours.
But when Daimler sneezes, the state of Baden-Wurttemberg catches a cold.
Gripped by a massive recession in the European car industry, Daimler has
more than sneezed - it is suffering from a form of corporate double
pneumonia. It has reacted by chopping its workforce (in 1992-94 the group
will shed 60,000 jobs) and putting pressure on its suppliers.
The prognosis for Mittelstand suppliers to Daimler and to Volkswagen, the
other beleaguered giant of the German automobile industry, is bleak. In a
recent study, the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse predicts that only 500
out of the 3,000 German components suppliers will survive the current
shake-out.
The outlook for the machinery manufacturing sector is hardly brighter.
Baden-Wurttemberg has the largest number of machine-building and tool-making
firms, employees and per capita turnover anywhere in Germany, with 43 per
cent of the firms based in and around Stuttgart. Orders for the sector are
down by 70 per cent from three years ago, reflecting the disappearance of
traditional export markets in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in
eastern Europe as well as world recession and the strength of the D-mark.
The result is that manufacturers are obliged to join forces in order to
survive. For example Friedrich Deckel and Maho, two of Germany's best-known
machine-tool manufacturers which between them have 40 per cent of the German
market in milling and boring machines, have merged outright. Others have
embarked on cooperation strategies which bring an end to individual
companies' highly-prized independence. This would have been unthinkable even
two years ago.
So what does the future hold for Standort Baden-Wurttemberg? Will it be able
to regain its status as a 'Musterlandle' - the model little Land of the
local dialect? Or will it sink further into difficulties?
Pessimists point to the region's heavy dependence on old-fashioned
manufacturing industry and a comparative lack of service sector businesses.
Optimists herald the virtues of the hard-working, highly educated workforce,
the adaptability and resilience of the state's entrepreneurs, and the
matchless educational and scientific infrastructure (nine universities, 23
polytechnics, three large-scale research facilities, 11 Max Planck
Institutes, 14 Fraunhofer Society facilities  ....and so on).
In Baden-Wurttemberg as in the rest of Germany, companies have responded to
the recession by cutting costs. This is reflected in the climbing
unemployment statistics and in the decision of numerous companies - starting
with Daimler-Benz itself - to establish cheaper production locations abroad.
For all its enviable tradition as a manufacturing centre, Baden-Wurttemberg
will have to fight hard for its future.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (1): The need to tighten belts -
Chancellor Kohl has told Germans to tighten their belts and stop acting as
if Germany were 'a leisure park'. His warning reflects a mood of national
introspection as reunited Germany reviews its place in an increasingly
uncertain world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE slogan of the hour is Standort Deutschland. It does not translate
easily.
Literally, it means Germany as an investment location. But it also begs
questions about Germany's international competitiveness and its social
make-up - education, culture, social welfare, and population trends.
All these are under the microscope in the great debate on Standort
Deutschland launched by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his economics minister,
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, with their report on 'safeguarding Germany's future as an
industrial location'.
It is a rumbling debate which has been worrying German political and
economic analysts, and the business community, for 10 years or more. It has
suddenly hit the headlines with the simultaneous advent of German
unification, the European single market, upheaval and instability in eastern
Europe, and the sharp increase in industrial competition from the Far East.
The question is whether the doubts about German competitiveness represent
another bout of typical German soul-searching, inspired by a sharp but
temporary downturn in the economy, or whether they are a recognition of more
profound problems.
'Almost all our present problems are structural problems of the old federal
republic,' Mr Kohl said in Berlin last month. 'We would have to solve them
even if German unification had not happened. 'We are not in a traditional
recession. But tough times can make new thinking easier. German unity is in
that sense a great opportunity for new thinking.'
There are gloom-laden headlines in the media. Der Spiegel magazine proclaims
Germany's imminent relegation to the second division of manufacturing
nations and its population sinking under the burden of an inexorably
expanding social state.
There are few if any visible signs of such doom. In spite of the huge costs
of unification, and the sharpest recession since the war, Germany is
overwhelmingly prosperous.
The problem for Germany is in steering a sensible middle course between
incorrigible self-satisfaction and profound self-doubt. 'The sensible
question about Germany's attractiveness as a business location is not why
Germany has fallen behind ..but whether changes are appearing that could
relegate it from its high-level position and cause a lasting deterioration
in productivity and growth trends,' says Mr Michael Heise, secretary general
of the government's council of economic experts - the so-called five wise
men.
In spite of the fact that the debate has been launched by the government and
the business community, there is wide acceptance on the other side of the
house - in the trade union movement and the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) - that it is a debate which is needed. They only disagree on the
analysis.
The government's view, in the Rexrodt report, is fuelled primarily by a
liberal, employers'-eye concern at high costs and the inflexibility of
labour, compounded by worries over the soaring costs of the social state.
The trade unions, and a growing number of independent analysts, stress
instead their concern over the slow pace of innovation, lack of investment
in high technology, and the inflexibility of management thinking.
'The structural problems lie deeper than high costs,' says Mr Walter
Riester, newly-elected deputy leader of IG Metall, the giant engineering
workers' union. 'We have the wrong products.'
Mr Kohl himself is calling for all the sectors in the German economy to
tighten their belts, from central government, through the federal states and
local councils to the private sector. He also wants something called
'umdenken' - new thinking.
'Just a few kilometres east of Berlin and Munich, serious new competitors
are growing up, with great cost advantages and increasingly impressive
products,' he says. 'Yet we allow ourselves the luxury of being a country
with ever younger pensioners (average retirement age 59) and ever older
students (average matriculation age 30) ..With ever shorter working hours,
rising wage costs, and ever longer holidays, our competitiveness is in
danger.
'The simple fact is that a successful industrial nation cannot allow itself
to be organised like a collective leisure park.'
The questions he is raising do not simply concern the quality and duration
of education, the need to cap social spending with an ageing population in
which one in three people will be over 60 by the year 2030, and the need for
more flexible working hours and labour mobility.
German unification has to be made to work rapidly if the annual drain of at
least DM150bn in resources from west to east is to cease putting an
intolerable strain on the exchequer. The proportion of taxation and social
insurance contributions in the national income is expected to reach 52 per
cent this year.
'It was always obvious that unification would lead to an extraordinary
demand for taxation and social contributions,' says Mr Gert Haller, the new
state secretary in the Finance Ministry. 'As soon as possible, we must offer
the prospect of this tax burden coming down.'
How long it will take for east Germany to achieve self-sustaining growth is
the great unknown factor. In the meantime, there can be no let-up in the
belt-tightening in the west.
Tackling the inflexibilities - whether in working hours or energy supply -
requires political decision-making, which is one commodity in desperately
short supply. Political debate in Germany is eternal, as the parties, the
federal government and the 16 states, negotiate interminably to reach a
consensus.
The lack of decisions is a certain factor behind a growing political
disaffection in the population at large, demonstrated by rising support for
protest parties in the polls. And next year, Germany faces no fewer than 19
separate elections.
The great concern is that the dissatisfaction with the entire political
establishment will see a rise of the far-right wing parties, such as the
Republicans. So far it has been expressed more in non-voting, in support for
protest parties of the left, such as the Greens, or in votes for local
interest groups. The most dangerous moment for Mr Kohl is in next year's
European elections in June, when voters feel least constrained by
traditional loyalties. When it comes to the national poll in October, the
chancellor is adamant that the Republicans will fail to get the five per
cent they need for seats in the Bundestag.
Domestic issues seem certain to dominate and decide those polls: jobs, law
and order, housing and immigration are all key concerns. Mr Kohl remains
totally committed to the process of European integration, but he wins little
applause on the issue, even from his party faithful. The worry that the
mighty D-Mark may be replaced by a less stable European currency in 1999 is
certainly no vote-winner, and the far right parties are exploiting that
concern for all they are worth.
And yet for all the doubts and fears, the fundamental nature of the current
debate is seen by most as positive.
'I think it will work out as an advantage that we are publicly debating our
shortcomings,' says Mr Horst Kohler, chief executive of the German savings
banks' association, and Mr Haller's predecessor as financial state
secretary. 'I think we will be able to make some corrections. We have not
yet gone far enough. A lot of things need to be corrected in the direction
of more flexibility. I am convinced we have a problem with German
self-confidence. It is not very strong. In Standort Deutschland, we list all
our short-comings, and then people think: 'poor Germany'.
'But the basic structure of our economy is better placed than many,
especially with the high proportion of small businesses. The financial
sector is a major source of strength. It is decentralised, stable and sound.
It is not in our interest to be at the leading edge of financial innovation.
'We should encourage more transparency, and we need more competition. We are
too inflexible with regard to hierarchies. We need to organise society so
that everybody has the feeling of participation, of injecting ideas and
creativeness into concrete projects. That is the challenge, not simply
cutting costs.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / A parting of the ways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When people tell us that the European Community is in a bad way, they
usually recite the standard list of symptoms: the disarray of the exchange
rate mechanism, the failure to stop the war in Bosnia, the decline in voter
support for the Maastricht treaty.
There is, however, a much larger and more difficult structural problem
facing the Community than any of these transitional phenomena: as a result
of the end of the cold war the member states must rethink the nature of the
Community - its size, its purpose, its essential character.
The Community's nature is bound to change through wholesale enlargement.
There is now a throng of countries, in Europe and on its periphery, that
wants to join the Community. Four members of the European Free Trade
Association are negotiating now, and could join the Community by 1995. The
east Europeans do not yet qualify; but the 12 have already, in effect,
conceded that, if the east European states continue with democratic and
economic reform, their applications cannot be rejected nor long delayed.
Within a measurable time-frame, therefore, the Community could include most
of Europe up to the Russian frontier, including some countries in the
Balkans, plus at least a few in the Mediterranean, with a total membership
of 25 or more.
Expansion on such a scale, taking in countries with radically different
economies, cultures and recent histories, is obviously not like adding
pieces to a string of dominoes. Such enlargement cannot fail to change the
internal character of the group; more important, it cannot fail to change
its geo-political significance.
The cold war is certainly over; but we have no grounds for making optimistic
assumptions about the future course of events in Russia. One reason the east
Europeans want to join the Community is that they are pessimistic about
Russia, and they have experience on their side.
If the Community extends to the Russian frontier, the implementation of a
common foreign and defence policy will not be a dilettante hobby, as in the
Maastricht treaty; it will be an absolute necessity. Do the 12 member
governments underline this fact, when they blandly concede the notion of
future membership for east Europe? They do not. This is just another of
those dangerous truths about the choices facing the Community, about which
politicians prefer to keep quiet.
Yet it is obvious that wholesale enlargement will require the Community to
redefine its place, its size, its objectives, its constitution. In
particular, it will have to redefine its relationship with Russia and the
former Soviet Union; and partly as a result, it must redefine its
relationship with the US.
Paradoxically, it is the American relationship which is the more pressing
geo-strategic dilemma. For 50 years, the political geography of the world
was defined by the east-west confrontation; as a result, Europe's role was
largely defined by its alliance with the US. But with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the role of the Atlantic alliance is in doubt.
Working out a new transatlantic modus vivendi for the new era must obviously
be a two-sided affair. This is is what makes the erratic foreign policy
gyrations of the US administration so disconcerting for west Europe. In
several crises - Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti - the administration does not
seem to know what it is doing. But behind the accusations of incompetence,
there is the more serious worry that, in spite of his claims to the
contrary, the US president is giving a generally lower priority to foreign
policy - which, when it comes to peace-keeping, is apparently what Congress
wants.
The most immediate problem for the transatlantic alliance is how to keep
Nato alive. Since 1989 the allies have tried to inject life into Nato by
adopting a new peace-time strategy. But its credibility as a defensive
military alliance is bound to be uncertain, in the absence of an
acknowledged enemy. Nato's dilemma is parallel to that of the Community:
what does it say to the countries in east Europe which want to join?
In Germany last week, at a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers, Mr Les
Aspin, US defence secretary, gave a two-tone answer: on Wednesday he said no
membership and no security guarantees, but perhaps some bilateral
co-operation agreements. But on Thursday he said membership may be offered
to those which qualify.
The US clearly has not made up its mind.
The heart of Nato membership is the US nuclear guarantee to all European
members. Yet it is hard to see why the US Senate should ever agree to extend
this guarantee to new members at a time when Washington is reducing its
military presence in Europe. And the more the countries of east Europe
appear in real need of such a guarantee (against instability in Russia), the
less the US will want to provide it.
Some Nato members, such as Britain and France, would prefer to prevent
enlargement, for fear it could involve a weakening of the US guarantee to
west Europe. Yet the exclusion of east European countries from Nato would
raise serious questions about the consequences of their admission to the
Community.
It would be difficult to reconcile European defence with Nato defence if the
two organisations had different memberships. The significance of the
Community's probable expansion into east Europe, therefore, is that it could
mark the beginning of a parting of the ways between Europe and the US.

FT  25 OCT 93 / A moral realist speaks out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A gruesome front page story in the Los Angeles Times last week related how
inner-city violence was spreading to traditional safe havens such as sedate
Orange County. A gang had provoked outrage in a tranquil suburb by ramming a
metal rod through the head of a youngster. The victim was not expected to
regain consciousness.
The story made a fitting backdrop for an interview I had arranged with Mr
James Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles. Mr Wilson, an
avuncular intellectual, represents the opposite, civilised pole of US
society. The only kind of weapon you can imagine him wielding is a phrase
from Aristotle. But his remarkable new book, The Moral Sense*, throws light
on modern social problems.
His goal is to demolish one of the most entrenched myths of the 20th
century: the belief that there is no scientific or logical foundation for
morality. Just about every intellectual trend has undermined conventional
values. Marxists depicted morals as a bourgeois tool for suppressing the
masses. Freudians urged people to liberate themselves from a repressive
super-ego. Existentialists told us to invent our own moral codes. Logical
positivists, absurdly, claimed that moral statements were meaningless.
Market liberals proclaimed that, as an ought can never be derived from an
is, morality is a matter of convention.
The trend toward moral relativism was reinforced by changes in teaching
practice. Starting in the late 1960s, US schools began to embrace a doctrine
known as 'values clarification'. This required school teachers to stop
'moralising, criticising, giving values or evaluating'. The predictable
result, says Mr Wilson, is that people rapidly lost confidence in their
ability to make moral judgments.
Some of his own students, he relates with exasperation, are unwilling to
condemn even the perpetrators of the Holocaust. 'It all depends on your
perspective,' said one. 'I'd first have to see those events through the eyes
of the people affected by them,' said another. What worries Mr Wilson most
is that students typically begin their moral analysis by searching for
excuses for bad behaviour.
His book is designed to 'help people recover the confidence with which they
once spoke about virtue and morality'. He regards his work as an extension
of arguments first advanced by Anglo-Scottish Enlightenment thinkers such as
Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and, above all, Adam Smith, who was 'the
pre-eminent moral philosopher of his age'. The book's arresting title is a
trifle misleading: in practice Mr Wilson is not prepared to follow Hutcheson
in arguing for a moral sense on a par with sight or hearing. Instead he
follows Hume and Smith in defining it as 'an intuitive or directly felt
belief about how one ought to act when one is free to act voluntarily'.
Mr Wilson advances the arguments of Smith and others by showing that
empirical science in the past two centuries has confirmed rather than
refuted their belief that man is an intrinsically moral creature, with an
innate sympathy for his fellows. Thus he cites a classic study showing that
a lone bystander is more likely to help somebody in trouble than a group of
bystanders.
This undermines the argument that altruism is really a self-regarding
attempt to gain the approval of others. He cites research showing that young
children spontaneously develop a concept of fairness and seek to share their
possessions without the prompting or even knowledge of adults. And he argues
that the willingness of prisoners of war to endure torture, even when hope
of escape is remote, implies the existence of an inner 'voice of
conscience'.
In Mr Wilson's view, these moral predispositions are universal in nature.
Anthropologists are right to argue that different cultures have different
moral rules, but wrong to infer big underlying differences in moral values.
Different moral rules, he claims, mainly reflect differences in
circumstances. A truly virtuous man will be recognised as such everywhere.
The claim that morals have no validity outside of a given culture is thus
bunk.
But if the moral sense is innate and universal, how could intellectual
fashions have contributed to violence in Los Angeles and other American
cities? The answer lies in evidence cited by Mr Wilson suggesting that moral
development is linked to the quality of relationships formed in childhood. A
study of the people who risked their lives to help victims of the Holocaust
in the second world war, for example, shows that they were
disproportionately from close-knit families; sympathy for strangers, it
seems, is a byproduct of sympathy for one's kin.
Moral relativism and the associated view that lifestyles should be chosen as
freely as flavours of ice-cream has thus contributed to moral decay by
creating environments in which children are not properly nurtured. Mr Wilson
concludes that the collapse of the traditional family in recent decades (a
majority of American children are now expected to spend some of their
formative years in single-parent households) is 'at the core of our social
problems'. Sceptics should read the book before airily dismissing this still
unfashionable conclusion.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Discreet man of steel - Karel Van Miert,
EC competition commissioner, talks to Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Community competition policy seems to have gone quiet since Mr
Karel Van Miert took over from Sir Leon Brittan as EC competition
commissioner in January.
Mr Van Miert has taken fewer high-profile decisions than his predecessor,
delivered fewer speeches and had no 'rows' with his industry counterpart, Mr
Martin Bangemann, who last year merrily lambasted competition hard-liners as
over-legalistic 'ayatollahs and gurus'.
The difference is due partly to a dearth of important competition cases, but
mainly to a clear change in style. Mr Van Miert, affable former chairman of
the Flemish Socialist party, is no ayatollah - nor, however, has he turned
out to be as pliable as Europe's more interventionist governments perhaps
hoped he would be.
That should be little surprise to those who know Mr Van Miert. As
commissioner responsible for transport, Mr Van Miert helped cajole
governments and flag-carrying airlines into far-reaching liberalisation of
air transport last year.
But now, 10 months into his job, his discreet approach faces some of its
biggest tests. He has just returned from a trip to the US and departs for
Japan at the beginning of next month with the aim of challenging some of its
deep-rooted restrictive business practices. Before then, he hopes finally to
persuade some of Europe's largest publicly owned steelmakers to agree the
capacity cuts and reductions in state aid that will allow a restructuring of
the EC industry to go ahead.
Under such circumstances - with the European economy squeezed by recession
and lagging behind its competitors - Mr Van Miert, 51, believes the question
of whether he is strict or relaxed about competition policy is irrelevant.
'It's not a matter of soft-line or hard-line,' he says. 'The question is:
how can you balance and combine the legalistic approach (to competition
policy) with what's happening in the real world.'
As he moves out of the shadow of Sir Leon, Mr Van Miert has begun to answer
that question. In speeches during his US visit earlier this month, he argued
that recession and the increasing openness of world trade should change the
way in which the Commission examines competition cases.
In particular, Mr Van Miert is convinced the potential for job creation
ought to be a factor when deciding whether or not to clear deals hovering
between assent and prohibition.
This would appear to re-awaken the fears of competition lawyers, among
others, that Mr Van Miert might start to blur what they saw as a consistent
and orthodox line pursued by Sir Leon.
But Mr Van Miert says competition policy cannot stand on its own, even if it
remains the principal criterion in Commission decisions. Competition policy
is the motor of economic growth - but it is useless unless, as he puts it,
the 'bodywork' is also kept in good condition. 'My responsibility is to look
after the motor in the first place, but not forgetting that it's part of an
overall structure,' he says.
By taking into account employment prospects the Commission is only
responding to acute concern about the EC's growing unemployment rate, which
is bound to figure in debate between EC leaders at this Friday's special
summit in Brussels. 'It's hard to see how a society can survive with
unemployment of 15 per cent or more,' Mr Van Miert points out. (The average
EC unemployment rate is 12 per cent.) 'You can't just look at your
competition textbook and say: 'That has to be No, and that's it.' You need
to take into account the real situation.'
Mr Van Miert's other concern is that competition policy should adequately
reflect changes in the market for certain products. The Commission used to
examine the effect on competition in national markets or the European
market, but increasingly the world market is a more appropriate reference,
particularly for electronics products. 'There are no ready-made solutions,'
he says.
As an example, the commissioner cites the approval he gave earlier this year
to a joint venture between Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson and Sagem
of France to produce liquid crystal display screens. They were the only
producers in the EC, but competition on the world market is so intense that
the Commission decided it could allow them to co-operate in the research,
development and production of LCD screens for strategic reasons.
Internationally, Mr Van Miert is keen to promote a three-stage process for
removing the remaining barriers to free competition. First, he says a level
playing field must be created. For the EC, that would mean protecting EC
airlines and telecoms companies, for example, until they were strong enough
to face their US counterparts - 'who grew strong on the back of the biggest,
best protected market in the world' - on equal terms. Otherwise, he says,
'it would be like starting a boxing match between a heavyweight and a
featherweight'.
For the second stage, Mr Van Miert would take up an idea first mooted by Sir
Leon 18 months ago: to challenge restrictive business practices worldwide,
such as cartels, by setting minimum competition rules, enforced through the
disputes settlement procedure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
This is one topic which Mr Van Miert hopes to discuss with the Japanese next
month, building on what he claims is a new readiness by the Japanese
authorities to tackle collusion between Japanese companies. 'We should tell
them now: 'Really, enough is enough',' he says.
Finally, and most ambitiously, Mr Van Miert - who was briefly environment
commissioner last year - would like to prevent companies exploiting some
countries' inferior environmental or social standards, by imposing minimum
international rules in these sensitive policy areas.
Such environmental and social concerns have rarely been voiced with such
passion by an EC competition commissioner. But Mr Van Miert says that the
broad thrust of EC competition policy has not really changed since the days
of Sir Leon.
In fact, in spite of his more aggressive profile, Sir Leon's approach was
not always as strict as his most zealous fans would like to make out.
Several of the decisions cited by Mr Van Miert as examples of Commission
flexibility on job creation and markets were taken by his predecessor.
Moreover, Mr Van Miert has proved himself capable of using the textbook -
particularly against the public sector - when necessary.
He has demonstrated genuine toughness in regulating state aid, notably to
the ailing steel sector. This was the part of his job which he believed
would be most challenging.
Mr Van Miert insists on restricting state subsidies to some of Europe's
largest publicly owned steel companies. He has banned subsidised
construction of new capacity, and insisted on closures and job cuts in
exchange for approval of existing state aid.
In doing so, Mr Van Miert has faced down the Spanish government, which has
agreed to cut capacity in the sensitive Basque region of the country, and is
trying to manoeuvre the Italian and German authorities into a deal on their
restructuring plans.
Mr Van Miert hopes to table proposals for limiting state aid at a crucial
meeting of EC industry ministers next month. To persuade them to approve the
Commission proposals, he will warn ministers of what is likely to happen if
they fail to take a decision. If capacity cuts are not made, he says, and
state subsidies are not reduced, then recent modest price rises will be
wiped out, and a potentially crippling race for state aid could ensue.
'I'm rather optimistic,' says Mr Van Miert. 'The situation in the sector is
such that I think companies and governments will go for a deal. We're near
to the end, but the last centimetres are always the most difficult.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Stronger dollar seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS and foreign exchange dealers are expecting the US dollar to
confirm its recent strength if key economic data due on Thursday comes in as
forecast, writes Peter John.
US data has been slightly more positive for the economy following the recent
disappointing non-farm payroll figures and many hope that the figures for
third quarter US gross domestic product will consolidate that improvement.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston said the
figure would be skewed by the impact of the heavy floods around the
Mississippi so the headline figure should be adjusted up to get a true
picture. The market is looking for a rise over the past quarter of 2.7 per
cent.
'The dollar is on a bull run at the moment and if we get an good underlying
figure per cent we could go through DM1.70 this week,' says Mr Hoffman.
A rise in the US currency is likely to be particularly noticeable against
the German currency as the foreign exchange community scents further
interest rate reductions by the Bundesbank following last Thursday's cuts in
the discount and Lombard rates.
Additional impetus for lower lending levels, at least for the repo rate,
could come from the German CPI data due this week.
A shift below 4 per cent in the annual rate to between 3.8 per cent and 3.7
per cent, may well show the way to a another cut.
In the UK, market pressure for a one-point cut in base rates could continue
as a spate of reductions in continental Europe at the end of last week
suggested that the current UK level might be unnecessarily solid.
Economists will be looking at the CBI's survey of industrial trends tomorrow
for any clues to easier monetary policy.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Canadian Bonds: Prices overcome election uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERS of Canadian bonds have shown remarkable equanimity ahead of today's
general election.
Despite the prospect of a change in government and an unusually fractious
parliament, bond prices have regained almost all the ground they lost at the
start of the election campaign in September.
The spread between 10-year US and Canadian government bonds has narrowed
from 1.72 percentage points to 1.38 points. The benchmark Canada issue was
yielding 6.71 per cent at the end of last week. Short-term interest rates
have fallen even faster.
The Bank of Canada has intervened in foreign exchange markets, not to
support a sliding currency, but to brake its climb. The Canadian dollar has
soared by almost two US cents in the past week, closing last Friday at about
76.65 cents.
The recent rally in financial markets mirrors rising confidence that the
Liberal Party, presently in opposition, will emerge from today's poll as the
majority government.
Foreign investors' first choice would have been a third term in office for
the Progressive Conservatives. However, the Tories have had a disastrous
campaign. They may end up behind not only the Liberals, but also the two
fledgling regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the right-of-centre
Reform Party.
The prospect of a Liberal majority has dissipated fears of an unstable, hung
parliament in which the separatist BQ and Reform would call the shots.
Furthermore, the Liberals are perceived as more sympathetic to business than
they were during their last spell in office in the 1970s and early 1980s.
While Liberals still argue among themselves on the pros and cons of
government internvetion, some of the key economic portfolios in a new
Liberal government are likely to go to two MPs, Mr Paul Martin and Mr Roy
MacLaren, who each have substantial experience in, and sympathy for, the
private sector.
Their room for manoeuvre will be limited by the huge build-up in federal and
provincial government debt over the past decade, much of it held outside the
country. Canadian politicians of all stripes have become more sensitive in
the past year or two to the views of foreign bond holders and credit rating
agencies.
The odds have narrowed in recent weeks that a Liberal government will offer
Mr John Crow, the Bank of Canada's inflation-fighting governor, a second
seven-year term. Although the Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien, has said
that he will seek to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement,
there is a widespread perception that a face-saving formula will be found to
implement it.
Money managers tick off several reasons why the bond-market rally is likely
to continue for at least another month or two after the election. Canada's
economy is still in the doldrums and the annual inflation rate remains below
2 per cent. Despite the recent narrowing of US-Canada spreads,
inflation-adjusted interest rates in Canada are high.
'Canada is attractive at spreads anywhere above 100 basis points, and very
attractive above 150,' says Mr Will Sutherland, vice-president for fixed
income at Altamira Management, a Toronto-based mutual fund group.
Like many other bond-market players, Mr Sutherland says the attraction of
Canadian bonds is not so much a high yield as the prospect of a further
advance in the Canadian dollar. 'The opportunity for currency appreciation
is better now than it was a year ago,' he says.
Such optimism is harder to find however, among foreign exchange traders. Mr
John Nicholson, vice-president at Bank of Nova Scotia, says the dollar's
strength 'will probably continue over the near-term if there's a (Liberal)
majority. But over the long term, there are a lot of problems.'
These range from weak commodity prices to uncertainty about next year's
provincial elections in Quebec, which will be more important than today's
poll in determining whether Canada remains in one piece. Towering federal
and provincial budget deficits, which could lead to the downgrading of some
provinces' credit ratings, continue to cast a shadow over currency and bond
markets.
There is also the risk, of course, that the opinion polls may be wide of the
mark. One Canadian securities dealer in London says, with some
understatement, that 'the market could have a bit of a hiccup this week if
the Liberals are short of a majority'.

FT  25 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Decline exposes frailty of earlier bull
run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IT takes so little to knock the wind out of the bond market's latest bull
run, then how will the market react to some real evidence that the US
economy is picking up momentum?
That was the question left hanging in the air at the end of last week, as
bond prices continued their week-long slide, and the yield on the 30-year
long bond climbed back to nearly 6 per cent.
There was precious little new information in the market to justify a 20
basis point rise in the yield on the long bond. The yield ended on Friday at
5.98 per cent, from 5.78 per cent (a record low) at the end of the previous
week.
The pain was felt across the yield curve: 10-year bond yields climbed 23
basis points, to 5.39 per cent, while the yield on the two-year note rose by
some 13 basis points, to 3.9 per cent. Bullish data on inflation the week
before had fuelled the latest run-up in bond prices, but it took little to
prick the market's bubble of confidence.
On Monday, JP Morgan said it was cutting its prime lending rate by half a
percentage point, to 5.5 per cent. The move hardly seemed to pressage an
immediate round of rate cuts by banks hungry to attract new loans. Morgan
itself makes relatively few loans tied to prime, and other banks failed to
respond to its lead. Still, the move was enough to raise the prospect of
higher loan growth, one result of which would be that banks would slow their
purchases of Treasury bonds.
On Thursday and Friday, the bears had something firmer to bite on. The
Philadelphia Fed's latest manufacturing index - not usually one of the bond
market's most awaited pieces of data, to be sure - showed a sharp rise. A
quarter of manufacturers questioned in the Fed survey said the general level
of business activity had increased over the previous month, while only 9.9
per cent said it had fallen. This made a 'diffusion index' of 15.1, a sharp
jump from 8.7 the previous month.
The fall in bond prices on the data suggests the market expects the pick-up
to be echoed in the more significant NAPM index, due a week today The
Philadelphia Fed survey, though, also indicated little sign of inflationary
pressure picking up. The diffusion index of prices paid by manufacturers was
close to zero, while the index for prices received fell 11.5 (in other
words, more people reported a fall in prices they could charge than a rise.)
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, ended a poor week for the bond
market by announcing that the economic 'headwinds' which had checked growth
had lessened. The implication: any chance of an easing of short-term
interest rates, already a long shot, had become even more remote.
The next fortnight will give the markets some more significant numbers
against which to judge these straws in the wind.
On Thursday, third-quarter GDP figures are widely expected to show an
acceleration from the first and second quarters of the year (hardly
surprising, given the weakness of those periods). Analysts forecast the
figure at anywhere between 2.5 per cent and over 3 per cent, at an
annualised rate, compared with the 1.9 per cent of the previous quarter and
0.8 per cent in the first three months of the year. Even that figure may
understate the true increase in economic activity in many parts of the
country: the summer's flooding in the Mid-West could have held back the
growth rate by 0.5 per cent, according to one estimate.
After last week's falls, the bond market seems to have braced itself for an
acceleration in the growth numbers. The 30-year bond yield has held below 6
per cent pretty much consistently since the beginning of September, with the
occasional slide towards the 5.5 per cent level at which many economists
think it will trade in the medium term. It would take something
significantly out of line with market expectations to push the yield out of
this trading range and back above 6 per cent for a prolonged period.

FT  25 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Traders expect quiet spell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE Pounds 3.5bn gilt auction this Wednesday likely to be the last of
the year, the UK government bond market is looking ahead to a quieter period
after the recent runs of price rises.
Last week, gilts along the yield curve showed healthy gains on the back of
generally favourable economic data, the cut in interest rates by the
Bundesbank, and news that the Bank of England would not hold a gilt auction
next month because of a possible clash with the November 30 Budget.
With the Bank well ahead in its gilt-issuing programme for the financial
year, many gilt specialists reckon there will be no gilt auction in
December, leaving open the possibility of one auction a month in the final
quarter of the financial year ending next March.
Assuming the Bank sells all the 6 per cent Treasury bonds maturing in 1999
up for takers at Wednesday's auction, it appears the government will need to
find buyers for only about Pounds 10bn worth of bonds to meet its funding
requirement for the full financial year. These calculations are on the basis
that the Treasury is correct in its forecast of a public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 50bn for 1993-1994.
The strength of demand for gilts was illustrated by the ease with which the
Bank sold bonds from a stock of Pounds 400m worth of index-linked securities
released on Thursday. By the next day, roughly half of the bonds - Pounds
150m of 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2003 and Pounds 250m of 2 1/2 per cent
stock due 2020 - had found purchasers.
During the week, yields for most classes of gilts fell along the length of
the bond curve by about 10 basis points. On Friday night, yields of 10-year
gilts were quoted on a par basis at just over 6.5 per cent. Over the week,
the yield difference for 10-year gilts compared with the equivalent German
bonds narrowed from 103 basis points to 97 basis points.
Short-dated gilts were boosted by the Bundesbank's decision to cut by half a
percentage point its Lombard and discount rates, to 6.75 per cent and 5.75
per cent respectively.
The decision showed every sign of the Bundesbank bowing to pressure from
other countries for an easing in monetary policy to speed up European
growth, and was followed by a wave of rate cuts elsewhere across the
Continent.
In Britain, there was little sign that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
was inclined to follow suit in the near future. Even so, many gilt
specialists believe the German move will make it easier for him to cut base
rates from 6 per cent on or around Budget day, to offset an expected fiscal
tightening to bring down the PSBR in the next few years.
While the yield decline for short-dated gilts might have been expected to
lead to a fall in prices at the longer end of the gilt curve - on the basis
that falling official rates might trigger inflationary pressures - longer
maturing gilts also performed generally well.
This was largely because of the market's continuing perception that price
pressures will stay subdued for some time, a sentiment reinforced by
Friday's data on UK output which indicated that (excluding oil and gas)
gross domestic product climbed by just 0.4 per cent in the third quarter
compared with the second quarter, after three-monthly increases of 0.5 per
cent and 0.6 per cent in the second and first quarters respectively.
'The figures generally fitted in with the thinking that the pace of the
recovery is slackening, which is good news for gilts,' said Mr Simon
Briscoe, a UK economist at SG Warburg Securities.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Credit rating review clouds Turkey's
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC of Turkey returned rapidly to the international bond market
last week despite the decision by Moody's, the international rating agency,
to place the country's long-term credit rating under review for possible
downgrading.
Last Monday, Turkey raised DM1bn through an offering of five-year Eurobonds,
following on the heels of a Pounds 100m 10-year Eurobond issue the previous
week. This week, Turkey could launch a seven-year Y50bn issue in the Samurai
market, the domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers.
Moody's announcement, on October 8, could not have come at a worse time for
Turkey since it has been relying more on the international bond market to
fund its growing public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).
If Moody's does lower Turkey's credit rating from investment to
sub-investment grade, this would close off a whole range of institutional
investors who might otherwise take on Turkish risk.
Because of the shallow state of its domestic capital market, there is real
worry that Turkey could find difficulty financing its balance of payments if
its ability to tap international markets is impaired.
There already appears to be a growing reluctance among foreign banks to take
on new Turkish risk. They are concerned at the failure to bring down the
budget deficit and the current account deficit. The current account deficit
is expected to exceed Dollars 5bn by the end of 1993 compared with a deficit
of just under Dollars 1bn last year.
On both foreign and domestic borrowing, the government has sought to improve
the maturity of its debt in order to reduce its servicing costs, which
account for more than 20 per cent of recurrent budget expenditures.
However, Turkey's foreign debt measured in absolute terms - as opposed to
the effects of currency fluctuations - is rising. At the end of June, total
public and private debt stood at Dollars 59bn, up from Dollars 54.7bn at the
end of 1992.
Much of the increase relates to short-term borrowing as private Turkish
banks seek to fund their Turkish lira loan book with cheaper offshore
finance. Foreign government debt, however, has also expanded. Before the
latest spate of bond issues, Turkey's new foreign borrowings in 1993
totalled Dollars 2.3bn, the largest issue being a Y100bn Samurai issue.
The attractions of the Samurai market have seen a rise in the yen portion of
Turkey's debt, to 18.6 per cent from 13.6 per cent in 1990. Given the yen's
recent appreciation, this will also have added to Turkey's problems.
The success of Turkey's foray into the international bond market has always
depended on improvements in the fiscal picture. After the latest wave of
economic statistics, it remains to be seen how long Turkey can sustain this
strategy.
For 1994, the government envisages a budget deficit of TL192,000bn (Dollars
14.7bn). Taken with the projected transfers to loss-making state
enterprises, the government forecasts a PSBR of 14 per cent of GNP compared
with a 1993 target of around 9 per cent. However, PSBR is now officially
expected to reach 16 per cent of GNP this year.
Syndicate managers involved in Turkey's recent Eurobond issues have played
down the impact of Moody's announcement, noting that Standard &amp; Poor's, the
other leading rating agency, re-affirmed Turkey's triple-B rating on October
14.
They believe that any downgrading has already been discounted by the market,
and that in any case, it is not a foregone conclusion that it will happen.
In addition, current demand from investors for high-yielding paper has meant
that the spread - the margin over the yield on government paper - on both
issues has only widened by a small amount.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: New instrument blends bond and futures fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strong performance of futures funds this year, at a time when attractive
returns are increasingly hard to come by, has aroused fresh interest in the
sector. However, many investors are still afraid to take the plunge.
Although futures funds have had a good run this year - in the first eight
months the average total return was 17.45 per cent, according to the TASS
Management index, which tracks their movements - their performance is highly
volatile. In bad times, investors can see large portions of their
investments wiped out rapidly.
One solution has been to structure guaranteed funds - the bulk of the fund
is used to buy zero-coupon bonds, with a much smaller portion allocated for
trading. One criticism of these funds is that they are neither flesh nor
fowl: the investor may be protected from the potential losses associated
with futures funds, but the small size of the investment in futures will
also limit potential gains.
However, another option is available. On Friday, Citibank launched a hybrid
instrument which is part futures fund, part bond. The structure is designed
to attract investors, particularly bond investors, who would not feel
comfortable with buying futures funds outright.
The Ecu50m offering, called Fleetwings, is structured as a 10-year Eurobond,
and will be rated triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency. For
bond investors, this provides a high level of comfort. It also means that
some institutions which would not be allowed to invest in futures funds can
buy the triple-A rated bonds.
The concept is similar to a guaranteed fund: 80 per cent of the proceeds of
the offering is used to buy bonds issued by the Nordic Investment Bank,
while the remaining 20 per cent will be invested in a managed futures
trading programme operated by Waldner Financial, a futures specialist.
Waldner was chosen because of its long audited track record, and also
because it focuses on the currency and interest-rate sectors, with which
bond investors are more comfortable.
The NIB bonds act as collateral and also provide a minimum level of interest
for holders of the Fleetwings bonds. The minimum interest starts at 6 1/2
per cent in the first year, but by year five has dropped to 1 1/2 per cent
before falling to 1 per cent in years nine and 10.
The coupon declines because the expectation is that the performance of the
managed futures portion increases over time. On a historical basis, the
return on this deal would be an annualised 13.1 per cent, according to
Citibank, with gains concentrated in the latter years of the bonds' life.
Every quarter, half the trading gains are set aside and the other half
reinvested, to preserve some of the gains made in the trading account.
Nevertheless, the relatively long life of the issue gives a sufficient time
frame to substantially enhance the return.
So what is the downside for investors? If only the minimum interest rate is
paid, the investor will receive an average annual interest of around 3 per
cent. In this case, investors would have done much better by buying plain
vanilla bonds, since that is just half the current yield on 10-year Ecu
bonds with triple-A ratings.
However, according to a Citibank simulation, there is more that an 80 per
cent probability of receiving a return of more than 10 per cent. This
probability is simulated by taking the historical data points, and then
assuming the pattern may not be replicated, so scrambling them.
A handful of similar deals have already been launched. For example, in 1991
Waldner was involved in an Ecu100m deal, the proceeds of which were partly
invested in Swiss Bank Corporation bonds and partly managed by Waldner. The
decline in interest rates in the last few years may encourage more investors
to depart from their traditional approach.
Fleetwings is aimed at institutional investors and high net worth
individuals: the minimum investment is Ecu10,000. Similar deals in other
currencies could be launched. According to Citibank, most of the buyers of
the issue had not previously bought futures funds.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gencor turns in 12% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, increased attributable
income by 12 per cent, to R1.41bn (Dollars 420m) from R1.26bn, in the year
to August. This is the last set of results the company will publish before
before unbundling its industrial investments next month.
The results were boosted by one-off benefits from tax adjustments and the
sale of investments. Underlying operating income, excluding these effects,
fell by 6.3 per cent to R1.09bn, or by 13.1 per cent to 79.5 cents per
share. The dividend was maintained at 45 cents per share.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman, said although the decline was disappointing,
it reflected 'a sound operating performance in the circumstances'. Prices
fell in most of the export markets in which the group operates, and the
domestic operating environment was also difficult.
The unbundling, which takes effect on November 5, will see Gencor's net
assets shrink by about a third to R12bn from R18.6bn. The new group will
have no net debt, and cash and other liquid assets of R2.3bn. After
distributing to shareholders its stake in industrial groups Sappi, Engen and
Malhold, and investment arm Genbel, the rump Gencor will be a mining and
minerals group with investments primarily in gold, platinum, coal,
ferrometals and stainless steel, and aluminium.
The priority for Gencor at the moment is trying to conclude the purchase of
Billiton, the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Talks
have been under way for nearly six months. No figures have been announced,
but the deal could be worth as much as Dollars 2bn.
Mr Gilbertson said the deal was 'by no means done', but that the chances of
success were better than 50:50. The two main issues to be resolved are the
financing of the deal and the pre-emption rights that attach to many of the
assets, especially the better ones.
Mr Gilbertson said if all the 'plum' assets were stripped from Billiton,
Gencor wouldn't be a purchaser and Shell would find it difficult to make a
sale. However, he added that 'substantial progress' had been made in
resolving the pre-emption issue.
'There will be a degree of pre-emption, but in my judgment we will be able
to live with it,' he said.
He said this meant 'some parties will take up some of their rights'.
Finality should be achieved by the end of the year.
Mr Gilbertson said if the new unbundled Gencor structure had been in place
in 1993, it would have achieved underlying operating earnings of 37.5 cents
per share. He said he would be disappointed if these were not exceeded in
the coming year.
The dividend will be decided in the light of 1994 cash earnings, which will
be 'significantly lower' than the 1993 equivalent of 35.6 cents per share.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc warns of drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group due to be
privatised within the next few weeks, yesterday forecast that net profits
would show a decline of about 30 per cent in the first nine months of the
year, compared with the FFr1.11bn (Dollars 189.7m) reported in the same
period in 1992.
The group said full-year net profits were likely to be down by about the
same proportion on 1992 net profits of FFr1.52bn.
The company blamed the decline on what it described as the 'extremely poor
economic climate affecting the chemicals and fibres market', which continued
to depress volumes and prices. However, it said prices for several products
had now stabilised.
The agri-chemicals division also contributed to the decline in profits for
the first nine months, as depressed demand arising from the European common
agricultural policy and weakness in some geographical markets took their
toll.
On the bright side, its healthcare operations continued to show a strong
increase over the same period in 1992, despite an expected slowdown after
the first half.
Sales of specialty chemicals also continued to resist the poor economic
environment.
Overall group sales declined by an estimated 4 per cent during the period,
compared with the FFr61.95bn reported in the first three quarters of 1992.
Operating income declined by about 18 per cent to some FFr4.6bn.
Rhone-Poulenc said it had decided to release estimates of its results in the
first nine months because of the impending privatisation.
Currently, the company and the French government are in the process of
forming a group of stable long-term share-holders, which will hold about 25
per cent of the shares following the sale of the government's 43 per cent
stake.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Viacom raises bid to step up
battle for Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing
group, intensified last night when Viacom, the cable television company,
raised the value of its friendly bid to match a Dollars 4.8bn cash tender
offer for 51 per cent of Paramount announced on Thursday by hostile bidder
QVC Network.
Viacom, acting with the agreement of the Paramount board, said it too would
begin a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of the company's shares, starting
today, at a price of Dollars 80 a share.
The remainder of Paramount's shares would be acquired later in a stock swap,
also worth around Dollars 80 a share on the basis of Viacom's shares at
Friday's stock market close.
The new bid appeared to value Paramount at around Dollars 9.5bn, roughly the
same as QVC's offer, though last night Viacom claimed its bid to be worth
about Dollars 10bn. Viacom's initial bid was worth around Dollars 7.5bn.
The increased bid had been widely expected on Wall Street since QVC forced
the pace of the battle last Thursday with the announcement of its cash
tender for Paramount's shares, due to start by this Wednesday.
Viacom, by offering the same terms as QVC in its tender, will be hoping that
shareholders will be won over by the fact that its bid has the agreement of
the Paramount board, and by the claims of synergy made by the two companies.
However, many shareholders seem likely to hold back, in the expectation that
the bidding still has some way to escalate.
Viacom's new offer sharply increases the amount of cash in its bid, from
around Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 4.8bn. The stock-swap element of the deal
would involve 0.2048 of a share of Viacom class A voting stock, 1.08317 of
Viacom Class B non-voting stock, and 0.20408 of a share of new convertible
exchangeable preferred stock, for each share in Paramount.
The boards of the two companies said their amended merger agreement also
gave them the flexibility to go ahead with a single stage merger
transaction, rather than the new two-stage deal, if they wanted to do so.
Viacom said the new preferred stock would have the same yield, conversion
price and call protection as the Dollars 600m of preferred shares it
recently sold to Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain, and the
Dollars 1.2bn sold to Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company.
The financial backing of these two companies boosted Viacom's war chest,
helping it to launch yesterday's higher offer.

spin-off

<TEXT>
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, is to examine spinning off its
profitable offshore drilling subsidiary. The move marks a new phase in the
loss-making company's divestment programme.
Among the possibilities are merging the drilling division with another
company, putting it into a joint venture, or seeking a listing for it on an
international stock exchange.
The division, called Neddrill, rents out rigs used to drill for oil and gas
at sea and on land.
Although Nedlloyd does not publish specific turnover or profit figures for
its drilling activities, its 1992 annual report said the drilling subsidiary
posted a substantial increase in turnover and a clear improvement in
operating results.
In recent years, Nedlloyd has divested a range of businesses, including its
energy and air freight activities, as part of efforts to concentrate on two
core businesses.
The pace and scale of these divestments was the main point of contention
between Nedlloyd and Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sweden to merge forestry
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government has announced plans to merge its interests in three
state-owned forestry groups to create one of Europe's 10 largest pulp and
paper companies.
The move will assist the government's privatisation ambitions and lead to
the new company being quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange next spring.
The companies being merged are Assi and Doman, both 100 per cent
state-owned, and NCB, a quoted company in which the state holds 51 per cent.
Assi and Doman will combine at the year end before making an all-share bid
worth SKr1.1bn (Dollars 137m) for NCB next March.
Although the state will own 95 per cent of the combined group after the bid,
it plans to reduce its holding to 85 per cent by selling a 10 per cent stake
to Swedish institutions.
Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's industry minister, does not exclude further
limited privatisation, although the aim is to keep the company majority
state-owned.
The new group will have annual sales of SKr15bn, making it nearly as big as
MoDo, Sweden's third-largest forestry group. It will have 13,000 employees,
5,000 of them in eight European countries outside Sweden.
Mr Westerberg said the aim was to create a financially strong company,
capable of expanding further in Europe and guaranteeing employment in
Sweden.
The group's equity-to-assets ratio will be 53 per cent and profits after
financial items are estimated at SKr700m in 1993.
It will be Sweden's largest forest owner, with 3.2m hectares of productive
forest land, and its largest producer of sawn timber products. It will also
be one of Europe's largest producers of corrugated board. Synergy gains will
amount to more than SKr100m.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bank seeks to avert bail-out
with SKr3bn cash call plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORENINGSBANKEN, the Swedish co-operative bank, has announced plans to raise
nearly SKr3bn (Dollars 373m) in new equity in a bid to remain
privately-owned.
The move will be supported by a SKr2.5bn government guarantee to ensure the
bank continues to meet international capital adequacy requirements. The
guarantee can be used if the bank's credit losses prove larger than expected
over the next three years. However, if fully utilised, they would leave the
state as the bank's majority owner.
Foreningsbanken says it will issue shares to members and institutions and
convert perpetual debenture loans to equity to raise its capital adequacy
ratio above 9 per cent.
A consortium centred on the LRF, the Swedish farmers co-operative, will
guarantee SKr2.5bn of the issue, while institutions will be offered shares
worth SKr400m. The bank will also seek a listing on the Swedish stock
exchange.
Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, saw losses after
financial items shrink to FM44m (Dollars 7.6m) in the first eight months
from FM213m in the same 1992 period.
The group attributed the improvement to streamlining and the weaker Finnish
markka. Sales rose 40 per cent to FM7.07bn from FM5.03bn and new orders were
FM1bn higher at FM7.3bn.
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, has raised FM1.3bn from the sale of
15m shares in Repola, the country's biggest industrial group, to
international investors. It retains a stake of 16.6m Repola shares, equal to
11.1 per cent of its capital.
The disposal will give Metsa-Serla a FM290m capital gain, reduce its net
gearing to 89 per cent, and increase its equity-to-assets ratio to nearly 40
per cent.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Profits at Imperial Oil surge to
CDollars 84m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LOWER crude prices and wider downstream margins enabled Imperial Oil,
Canada's biggest integrated oil company, to post a 83 per cent jump in
third-quarter profit and a 56 per cent gain in the first nine months.
The quarter showed earnings of CDollars 84m (USDollars 62.6m), or 43 cents a
share, up from CDollars 46m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Included are
restructuring charges of CDollars 8m, against CDollars 63m. Revenues dipped
5 per cent to CDollars 2.24bn.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 225m, or CDollars 1.16 a share, up from
CDollars 144m, or 74 cents, on revenues of CDollars 6.7bn, down 1 per cent.
Resource profits declined because lower oil prices and volumes more than
offset higher natural gas prices and heavy oil output. Chemicals improved.
Analysts expect Imperial, which is 70 per cent-owned by Exxon, to report
lower fourth-quarter downstream profits and higher resource earnings, while
chemicals will break even. Full 1992-1993 net profit is estimated at about
CDollars 1.87 a share.
Suncor, another integrated group, reported a nine-month profit of CDollars
52m, or 96 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 237m, or CDollars 4.37
cents, including a CDollars 238m restructuring charge.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Unilever closer to Bertolli
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch group, has reached an advanced stage in
negotiations to buy Bertolli, the edible oils side of the Italian foodstuffs
group Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (Cbd).
This follows the privatisation two weeks ago of Cbd, controlled 62 per cent
by SME, the state-run agri-business group. The stake was bought for L307bn
(Dollars 190.5m) by Fisvi, an agri-industrial holding company with extensive
interests in southern Italy.
Fisvi is pressing ahead with the sale of the well-known Bertolli brands to
help fund its purchase of Cbd. According to trades unions monitoring the
negotiations, Unilever is likely to be asked to pay about L150bn.
This would give the Anglo-Dutch multinational access to a further 9 per cent
of the lucrative Italian olive oil market. Through Italian subsidiaries,
Unilever already has some 15 per cent of the market.
Unilever's bid for the whole of Cbd was turned down two months ago as being
too low. IRI, the state holding company which owns SME, also felt the offer
did not contain sufficient guarantees about the future of Cbd's operations
in southern Italy.
IRI, thus, was prepared to let Fisvi win on a revised bid despite the
holding having a mere L53bn in capital. Fisvi is 60 per cent-owned by
co-operatives in the Basilicata region; 20 per cent by state-controlled
financial institutions, including Banco di Napoli with 10 per cent; and the
remainder split between private shareholders dominated by the Tanzi family,
owners of the Parmalat dairy group.
Fisvi is in the process of raising a further L200bn in capital. However it
will also have to find another L190bn to buy Cbd's outstanding non-SME-held
shares as it is obliged by law. This, coupled with some L60bn needed for
investments, will bring the total of Fisvi's Cbd purchase close to L600bn.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Dutch insurer suffers as claims
soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION in Europe has bitten deep into the activities of NCM Holdings, the
Dutch-controlled export credit insurance group, according to interim
figures, writes David Dodwell.
As claims soared by 56 per cent during the first nine months of this year,
from Fl 189.9bn to Fl 310.7bn (Dollars 164bn), premium income rose by a
modest 5 per cent, from FL 415.8bn to Fl 437.7bn.
This boosted the company's 'claims ratio' from 42 per cent of premium income
in 1992 to 69 per cent in the first nine months of this year.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Legal action considered over B&amp;C
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, administrators to British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, which
collapsed in 1990, confirmed yesterday that it was con-sidering suing
'various parties' connected with the collapse of the financial services
group .
The Independent on Sunday yesterday reported that Ernst &amp; Young was planning
to sue Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, for
alleged negligence in advising B&amp;C on the take-over of Atlantic Computers in
August 1988. B&amp;C was subsequently forced to write off Pounds 550m against
its investment in the company, which it had purchased for Pounds 407m.
Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday that as administrators they were 'investigating
any rights of action they may have against various parties, but no decision
has been made as yet as to whether to sue'.
The administrators confirmed that they had held discussions with Stephenson
Harwood, their solicitors, and with leading counsel about legal action, but
that a decision was unlikely to be forthcoming in the 'very near future.'
However, Ernst &amp; Young would have to issue a writ before the six-year expiry
date on the bringing of civil actions under the statute of limitations runs
out.
Last week B&amp;C successfully sued another merchant bank, Samuel Montagu, which
was ordered to pay damages of Pounds 172m to B&amp;C creditors. The dispute
arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings which relied on
an agreement that Quadrex would then buy Mercantile's wholesale broking
division.
However, after the bid, Quadrex did not have the money to make the purchase,
which led to B&amp;C making a damages claim for breach of contract.
BZW said yesterday that the story was 'nothing more than speculation' and
said that it knew nothing about it.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: EDP puzzled over share price
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Electronic Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software
and services group, rose 15 per cent last week from 560p to 648p, puzzling
the group and its brokers, Henry Cooke Lumsden, who were at a loss to
explain the sudden movement.
EDP has been a solid but unspectacular performer in recent years. Mr James
Warhurst, electronics analyst with Albert E Sharp, said his company had been
buying EDP stock aggressively on behalf of institutional clients. The sharp
price rise was a consequence of a short market.
Mr Warhurst said he believed the prospects for EDP were excellent. Its new
product, UniVision, an advanced database management system using
object-oriented technology, was set to do well. A contract with NCR, the
computer company which is now part of AT&amp;T, was close to being signed, which
would yield substantial annual licence fees.
In the first half of the year, EDP's pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 2.34m
from Pounds 2.41m on revenues of Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 7.47m).
The company has spent heavily in recent years on moving away from low margin
hardware distribution towards software and services and has invested some
Pounds 2.5m in the UniVision product.

LONDON &amp; St Lawrence Investment Company is making an agreed offer for its
fellow investment trust, Practical Investment Company, creating a trust with
assets of about Pounds 58m.
London is offering shares based on the relative formula asset values. It
already holds 27.4 per cent and has irrevocable acceptances for a further
54.4 per cent.
Both trusts have similar investment policies and have been closely
associated since 1957. In 1990 London voted to continue until at least the
1993 annual meeting and in accordance with its articles a motion is to be
put to the next annual meeting to put Practical into voluntary liquidation.
London also reported that its net asset value per share at August 31 was
175.32p, against 124.82p a year earlier.
Net revenue for the 12 months to the end of August was Pounds 836,600
(Pounds 827,000). Earnings per share were 4.39p (4.34p).
An interim dividend of 3.64p has been declared, against last year's single
final payment of 3.36p, with an unchanged special dividend of 0.48p.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lloyd's broker coming to market
with Pounds 60m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NELSON HURST, an insurance broker which specialises in professional
indemnity in the Far East and Latin America, aims to list its shares on the
London Stock Exchange in the next few months.
The group expects to raise about Pounds 30m in fresh capital through the
flotation, which is expected to value it at about Pounds 60m.
The listing follows a management buy-out from Citicorp - Nelson's former
owners - two years ago, and is designed to give the group greater financial
flexibility. It is one of a number announced by companies in the insurance
sector in recent weeks.
One rival broker, the Fenchurch group, has announced plans to list its
insurance broking interests with a flotation expected next month. Separate
Independent Insurers will become the first insurance company to float since
the second world war.
About a dozen new investment trusts are turning to the equity market to
raise more than Pounds 1bn for syndicates of Lloyd's of London before the
end of the year.
Nelson Hurst, the 13th largest broker in the UK, and the 26th largest broker
in the world, derives about 30 per cent of its income from the Lloyd's
market.
It specialises in buying insurance for professionals such as solicitors and
accountants to cover them against legal awards for negligence. In addition
the group has expertise in Latin America, where its clients include the
operators of the Panama Canal.
Some Pounds 23m of the fresh capital raised through the flotation will be
used to repay loans made by Citicorp. Advent, the US venture capital company
which owns about 30 per cent of Nelson Hurst, is expected to reduce its
stake.
But Mr David Woodward, chief executive, does not expect management and staff
to sell shares in significant amounts.
After flotation, management and staff are expected to own about 30 per cent
of the group while Advent's stake will amount to about 15 per cent.
The group has steadily improved its performance in the past two years with
revenues rising from Pounds 26.9m in 1990 to Pounds 28.3m in 1991 and Pounds
31.3m in 1992. Operating profits reached Pounds 3.8m in 1992, compared with
Pounds 2.8m in 1991. Further improvement is on the cards this year with
operating profits for the first seven months amounting to Pounds 3.8m.

FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Flotations set to raise record
amount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than Pounds 2bn was raised through flotations in the first three
quarters of the year and the full year total looks set to exceed the Pounds
2.6bn record set in 1987, according to figures released today by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountants.
Commenting on the figures, which exclude privatisations and other issues
raising more than Pounds 1bn, Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG,
said: 'the amount of funds being raised on the markets is very encouraging
for an economy not fully clear of recession.'
In the third quarter 35 new entrants came to market, despite the impact of
the summer holidays, compared with 20 in the same period last year and 28 in
the 1991 third quarter.
The third quarter numbers boosted the total for the first three quarters
this year to 93 companies, back up to the levels seen in 1989 and 1990. Last
year 52 companies came to market in the first nine months.
However, the Unlisted Securities Market, which the stock exchange is
thinking of closing, only had one company join it in the third quarter,
bringing the total for the year to date to just three.
The KPMG report suggests, therefore, that the number of companies joining
the market as a whole will not recover to the levels enjoyed in the mid to
late-1980s, when substantial numbers of companies were joining the USM.
Mr Austin says he remains concerned about the needs of smaller growing
companies, which he does not believe are being catered for by the Official
List.
'The average capitalisation of companies coming to market remains low, with
some companies joining the market with capitalisations as low as Pounds
10m,' said Mr Austin.
'Past experience shows that smaller companies can have many problems with
the stock market when the boom is over, including lack of marketability of
their shares and difficulty raising capital at a sensible price.'
As a result he argues that 'there is still a pressing need for an
alternative market for smaller companies, one better suited to their needs
and capitalisation.'
KPMG's research shows that smaller companies join the market with the
expectation that their shares will be marketable and provide them with funds
for expansion, but are 'very often disappointed with the actual outcome.'
Mr Austin also sounds a note of caution about the number of companies
joining the market at present, arguing that there appears to be 'an element
of opportunism.'
He said a number of companies are floating for the traditional reasons,
either private companies wishing to raise capital for expansion, or
management buy-outs and institutionally-backed companies seeking an exit.
'There are however a number of opportunistic flotations seeking to
capitalise on the current high prices being paid by the market, he added. 'A
number of such companies may find that they cannot fulfil their ambitions
when the markets turn again, and such companies fall out of favour.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / US bank forced to cut further 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RENEWED round of cost-cutting at some of the US's largest commercial banks
was presaged last week as BankAmerica, the country's second biggest, said it
would shed between 3,000 and 3,750 jobs by the end of next year.
Other banks, while not pointing to specific plans to cut jobs, also
signalled they were putting renewed efforts into reducing their expenses.
The latest squeeze comes in the wake of results last week which showed that
some banks failing to maintain the momentum in reducing costs they
established at the start of the 1990s.
BankAmerica has already shed 20,000 jobs in the past 18 months as part of
efforts to rationalise its operations following its takeover of Security
Pacific. The next round of job cuts, on the other hand, are part of an
effort to bring the bank's costs more into line with competitors. The job
losses will be spread across the bank, which currently employs 98,000.
The California-based bank was reacting to a rise in its cost/ income ratio,
one of the key measures of a bank's operating performance, in the face of
only a negligible growth in its income over the previous year. Third-quarter
results released last week showed the ratio had crept up to 64.1 per cent,
from 63.4 per cent the previous quarter, and 61 per cent a year before.
While US banks owe much of their turnround in recent years to a favourable
interest-rate environment, they have also succeeded in bringing down their
operating costs sharply. Last week Mr Gerald Corrigan, who as chairman of
the New York Fed until last summer had been the US's top bank regulator,
pointed to the improvements in the banks' cost/income ratios as one of the
main factors behind the recovery.
Citicorp, the US's largest bank, also said it would concentrate more on
cutting costs, though it said it could not forecast how many jobs may be
lost.
Citicorp achieved one of the most drastic reductions in costs when it cut
its cost/income ratio from over 70 per cent to around 55 per cent by last
year. In the latest three months, though, the figure climbed back to 57 per
cent. Mr Tom Jones, in charge of financial reporting at Citi, said the bank
was making renewed efforts to bring costs down.

FT  25 OCT 93 / BTR to spin off Graham business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, plans to spin off the Graham
group of builders merchants and other businesses through a stock market
flotation in the first half of 1994.
The flotation is expected to value the Graham group at around Pounds 200m.
The timing is opportune since the share prices of companies like Tavis
Perkins and Wolseley, which have large builders merchant operations, have
been buoyed in recent months by the recovery in housebuilding.
Explaining the move yesterday Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said:
'BTR's stated strategy is to concentrate its resources on the development of
its core industrial manufacturing businesses. Today's announcement is 'a
further step in the execution of this strategy'.
Graham group includes Graham Builders Merchants, one of the largest
distributors of building materials in the UK; George Boyd, a large
ironmongery and tools distributor based in Scotland; and Goodman Croggon, a
specialist distributor of agricultural and fencing products.
Graham Builders Merchant's has 134 branches across the UK and supplies a
wide range of building materials.
Last year the group, which employs about 3,000 people, had turnover of some
Pounds 350m and BTR said it had continued to make 'substantial' profits
during the recession.
The proposed divestment underlines Mr Jackson's determination to push on
with the strategy adopted after he became chief executive in 1991.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Branson buys out Japanese partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD Branson has reinforced his control of Virgin Atlantic Airways by
buying out the airline's Japanese partner, Seibu Saison, for about Pounds
40m-Pounds 50m.
Seibu Saison, the Japanese hotel, retailing and leisure group, has held a 10
per cent stake in Virgin Traveller, the airline's parent company, since
1989.
It had an option to buy an additional 10 per cent stake to bring its holding
in Virgin Atlantic to 20 per cent. The Japanese company was planning to
exercise this option this month, but Mr Branson decided to buy them out to
regain 100 per cent control of the airline.
Virgin also confirmed yesterday that Mr Branson was investing an additional
USDollars 150m (Pounds 102m) in his airline operations to finance fleet
expansion, development of new long-distance routes to Hong Kong and San
Francisco next year, and the introduction of electronic entertainment
equipment on his airline services.
Mr Branson appears to have felt the Japanese company was no longer the best
partner to help him develop his airline business. Instead, he is considering
negotiating new marketing agreements with other big international carriers
in the US and Asia while consolidating his ownership.
Two years ago, Mr Branson considered selling up to 40 per cent of his
airline to outside investors, but he has now shelved these plans.
Since the Pounds 560m sale of his Virgin music business to Thorn EMI in
March, 1992, he has refocused his business interests on computer game
activities in retail operations and his airline.
The Dollars 150m he is investing in the airline from the proceeds of the
Thorn EMI sale will go towards financing an offer for two Boeing 747-500
jumbo jets he is taking on lease from the Californian-based ILFC aircraft
leasing group, and for four Airbus A-340 long range airliners he is
acquiring through lease-purchase agreements from the European Airbus
consortium. These lease-purchase agreements give him the option of buying
the equity in the A-340 aircraft when the lease expires.
Virgin is also investing heavily to upgrade the electronic entertainments on
board its aircraft, including the introduction of electronic gambling.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Emu still firmly on central bank agendas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major thinks that calls for full economic and monetary union in
Europe 'have all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency'.
Tell a continental government official about the prime- ministerial jibe in
a recent issue of the Economist and the reaction is one of pained surprise.
Britain's European partners are again working towards Emu, even if the
ambitious timetable of the Maastricht Treaty that envisages union by 1999
may slip.
Germany's ratification of Maastricht after its Constitutional Court found in
favour of the treaty on October 12 has brought Emu back up the European
agenda.
The special EC summit in Brussels on Friday this week will decide the
location of the European Monetary Institute, which, as forerunner of the
planned European central bank, will prepare for the third and final stage of
Emu with its single European currency and monetary policy.
Although August's changes to the European Monetary System mean that the
European exchange rate mechanism no longer exercises its former tight
discipline over EC currencies, Europe's central bankers are not ignoring
Emu.
Indeed, at a seminar on monetary policy, organised in Amsterdam last week by
the Dutch central bank and the Centre for Economic Research at Tilburg
University, both the Bundesbank and the Bank of England were making their
cases for how monetary policy should operate once European economic monetary
union is under way.
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and a member of the
Bundesbank board, put forward an uncompromising vision of Emu's operating
according to German rules and urged that a decision on such a programme
should be made now.
The planned European central bank should have a money supply target to steer
its policy, just as the Bundesbank steers German policy by reference to M3,
the broad measure of German money supply. In that way, the new institution
would inherit the counter inflationary credibility of the Bundesbank.
Worries that financial innovation might undermine such targetry on a
European level, as it has in the US or Britain, were probably overdone, Mr
Issing suggested. Innovations tended to multiply in periods of high
inflation and after regulation and deregulation in the financial sector. If
stage three of Emu were to begin with prices stable, the chances of
minimising the dangers of innovation would be good.
By advocating a European monetary policy 'made in Germany' in this way, Mr
Issing put the Bundesbank on collision course with the Bank of England. It
is not so long since Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, threw his weight
behind UK government efforts to scale down the EC's monetary ambitions by
suggesting that other European member states should emulate the British
practice of having an inflation target and use these to aim for economic
convergence.
In Amsterdam last week, Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's executive director
for international monetary affairs, argued in favour of mixing rules in
monetary policy with discretion.
It is fine, Mr Crockett argued, to have rules for the final objective of
policy such as price stability. But monetary authorities must use judgment
rather than intermediate targets such as money supply in pursuit of such
objectives. The pursuit of a broad money target to control inflation was too
vulnerable to economic and financial change.
If nothing else, the Amsterdam symposium highlighted the gulf between
Anglo-Saxon and central European thinking about how monetary policy should
be managed to achieve price stability. Canada and New Zealand also target
inflation rates rather than intermediate goals (and introduced inflation
targets before the UK) while the Bank of England's more judgmental approach
has support in US academic circles. Germany's near neighbours in what is
left of the ERM are keeping faith with the Bundesbank's counter inflation
record by not moving aggressively to cut their short-term interest rates.
Such a debate might appear abstruse. But the Bundesbank's credibility in
continental Europe gives it the confidence to set the monetary policy agenda
for Emu in other ways. Mr Issing made clear that a decision to use money
stock as an intermediate target in monetary policy in Emu 'would only be a
first step'.
He spoke warmly of the German experience of controlling money market
liquidity through minimum reserves - the non interest-bearing deposits that
commercial banks have to place with the Bundesbank. The adoption of such a
policy on a European scale could reduce the competitiveness of international
banks in the City, which at present face no such rule.
As Mr Issing does not look like a rain dancer, Mr Major should perhaps take
note of what he says. There is another point about the debate on future
monetary policy in Emu that should weigh with all 12 EC leaders when they
meet in Brussels at the end of the week.
Such issues as the ideal EC monetary aggregate, the merits and demerits of
inflation targeting and the best way of implementing a Europe-wide monetary
policy threaten to tie up some of Europe's brightest economic policy makers
at a time when more urgent questions, such as how best to tackle Europe's
high and rising unemployment, are crying out for an answer.
This risk became clear when Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of economics at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, noted that 20 of the
OECD's 24 member states are projected to have inflation rates below 3 per
cent and asked whether the industrialised countries should not now err on
the side of economic expansion rather than combating inflation. The absence
of growth, Mr Shigehara warned, was fostering trade tensions and
protectionism that threatened global prosperity.
Sadly, and perhaps significantly, his intervention was not followed up by
the 70 or so central bankers and academics at the Amsterdam meeting.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Prizefighter goes into the ring with Bock: Robert Peston and
Roland Rudd analyse the ongoing boardroom battle at Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Mr Tiny Rowland patched up his longstanding and highly expensive
quarrel with the Fayed Brothers, he has been swaggering around like a
prizefighter who has just made a successful comeback.
The reason for his euphoria is that for the past six months, his influence
at Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate he has dominated for more
than thirty years, has been on the wane.
Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier who at the beginning of the year
acquired 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares and became joint chief executive
of the company with Mr Rowland, has appeared to have been calling the shots.
The company's strategic moves have apparently been dictated by Mr Bock -
whether it was the disposal of businesses, such as the Observer newspaper,
property in Brussels or last week's appointment of independent
non-executives to the board for first time in 20 years.
But Mr Rowland believes that his success in ending the legal dispute over
the Fayed's 1985 purchase of the stores group House of Fraser - a truce he
negotiated single-handedly between Wednesday and Friday of last week - shows
that he is far from redundant.
'None of my colleagues knew (about the negotiations) and were surprised when
it was signed,' he said.
The two men rarely communicate with each other. Indeed by yesterday
lunchtime, Mr Bock had still not telephoned to talk to him about it. 'I am
sure Bock should be delighted with the deal,' Mr Rowland said. 'I am sure he
will want to ring and congratulate me.'
Furthermore, Mr Rowland denies that most of the disposals are the doing of
Mr Bock, who he says has failed to pull off a single deal.
Most of the disposals had, according to Mr Rowland, been planned for some
time. By way of example he said the sale of GewoG, a German holding company
with a portfolio of apartments, had been initiated by Mr Roger Badger, a
former Lonrho director, and not by Mr Bock. 'All these deals were agreed
well before Mr Bock arrived.'
He is also critical of the one sale he does credit Mr Bock with achieving -
the 50 per cent stake in the trading company which it owed jointly with
Krupp-Hoesch. 'This was a poor deal,' he says.
Though he insists he is not in conflict with Mr Bock - and says he has 'no
desire' that the German financier should leave the company - he makes no
secret of his discomfort with his management style.
Mr Rowland said: 'He thinks Lonrho joined him and not vice versa. He will
have to get used to working for Lonrho which is a public company.'
Mr Bock's reply would almost certainly be that his aim over the past few
months has been to transform Lonrho into a far more conventional public
company, rather than the vehicle of Mr Rowland's will.
He campaigned to secure the appointment of three non-executive directors -
including two nominated by him, Mr Stephen Walls of Albert Fisher and Mr
Peter Harper of Hanson - as part of a plan to make Lonrho more open and
accountable to its shareholders.
Whether by chance or design, the appointment of non-executives also changed
the balance of power on the board to the point where he is convinced that he
has more support than Mr Rowland.
Mr Bock has also been bolstered by the support of the group's four big
shareholders: Fidelity, with 8.9 per cent; PDFM, the fund management arm of
UBS, with 2 per cent; Postel with 1.5 per cent; and Genting, a Malaysian
plantations and gaming group, with 3.9 per cent.
His plans to make the company more open and to increase the number of big
institutional shareholders have been welcomed in the City of London.
Nonetheless, in his attempts to make Lonrho a more 'normal' company, there
was one deal he could never achieve. The dispute with the Fayeds was very
much Mr Rowland's personal fight, because of his bitterness at having seen
the stores group he longed to own being bought by Fayeds, whom he had
regarded as close associates and friends.
Because the fight was so personal, only Mr Rowland could end it, even though
Mr Bock has been desperate that the group should cease spending millions of
pounds on it - as much as Pounds 50m has been spent by the Fayeds and Lonrho
on the dispute to date, according to Mr Rowland.
Now that peace has broken out with the Fayeds, Mr Bock may become less
frightened of open war between him and Mr Rowland. Mr Bock does not believe
that Mr Rowland's famous network of political and business contacts in
Africa and the Middle East contributes as much to profits as many believe.
Were Mr Rowland to leave Lonrho, it would not do terrible damage to the
group, Mr Bock believes. He would be delighted to buy Mr Rowland's stake, on
which he has a call option, which is to be exercised at the end of 1995 or
when Mr Rowland decides to leave the board, if he decides to go earlier.
Mr Rowland made it clear yesterday he had no desire to quit: 'I started the
company with six people and I have no intention of leaving it,' he said.
'I have no sense of when I will be less hands on. I have not given a second
thought to being less executive.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Russian banks enter an era of bombs and bodyguards - The new
market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A BOMB explodes at the central bank in the dead of night. Commercial bankers
have private armies to protect themselves and their property: less fortunate
colleagues have been gunned down.
This is not Colombia or Sicily, but Russia.
With the collapse of the old communist order, the banks in this fledgling
market economy are more than ever before a target and vehicle for fraud,
money-laundering, and extortion. Although some banks are unwitting victims,
others have been set up by mafia-style organisations to launder ill-gotten
gains.
Until now absorbed with more basic problems, such as setting up a more
efficient payments system, the Russian authorities are finally turning their
attention to the need to clean up the banking sector. The central bank badly
requires reforms to reduce its vulnerability to fraud.
'The real money in the country is with the banks,' says Mr Sergei Rodionov,
the 32-year-old chairman of Bank Imperial, whose black Buick is said to be
bullet-proof. 'Why should racketeers rob small stores when they can get
millions of roubles from banks?'
Mr Rodionov declines to say how many people guard him and his family in
addition to the 60 men who protect his bank. But the Most (Bridge) banking
and construction group openly admitted last week that it had a security
force of 650 men.
In contrast, Mr Dmitry Tulin, the 37-year-old deputy governor of the central
bank, who has just been given the thankless job of trying to improve
supervision over Russia's 2,000 banks, has no bodyguard.
'We are all under a certain pressure coming from . . . underground banking
activities and the bosses of the underground economy,' Mr Tulin says. 'But
many Russians have become fatalists.'
This summer, Mr Sergei Panov, the official responsible for on-site
inspections of banks, had his hand smashed and his dacha set on fire after
he tried to investigate a Moscow commercial bank. One night in September, a
bomb went off at a central bank annexe next door to the Interior Ministry,
responsible for law and order.
It is still extremely easy to set up a bank in Russia.
'Many of our well-to-do citizens have a choice between buying a new car and
setting up a bank,' says Mr Tulin, who describes as 'ridiculous' the central
bank's Rbs100m minimum capital requirement for operating a bank - at present
exchange rates, the equivalent of Pounds 53,000, less than the cost of an
imported American limousine. Although he foresees political problems in
raising this limit, he hopes that a start in closing insolvent banks will
dampen the enthusiasm for setting up new ones.
Mr Tulin also wants to change the central bank's arrangements for
refinancing commercial banks. In June, the management of one bank
disappeared from Russia with Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) borrowed from the
central bank. 'All we can do in such cases is see if there is anything left
to compensate ourselves and shareholders.'
Nor does the central bank even have guidelines against money-laundering  - a
problem Mr Tulin plans to start tackling by inviting leading international
experts to a seminar in Moscow next month.
Mr Sergei Rayevsky, a former finance minister who is now deputy chairman of
one of the more conservative institutions, Neftekhimbank, claims that the
'problems start when banks accept dirty clients'. And when criminal clients
ask for more 'loans', bankers either pay up or suffer.

FT  25 OCT 93 / China plans financial overhaul: Next phase of reforms to
focus on banking sector and tax system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA PLANS the most radical financial reforms in its post-revolution
history with new tax arrangements and an extensive overhaul of the banking
sector.
Mr Li Lanqing, a vice-premier, said in a Financial Times interview that a
Communist party central committee plenary session before the end of the year
would approve a blueprint for further economic reforms. His remarks
represent the most authoritative outline yet of the next phase of China's
reform programme.
The reforms would be carried out in six areas: banking, finance, taxation,
investment, foreign trade, and enterprise management. These measures would
build on the market-oriented reforms of the Chinese system introduced over
the past 15 years, which have brought a growing tide of foreign investment
into the country.
The latest moves would complement those made earlier this year to restrain
inflation and cool the economy through, for example, credit restrictions and
interest rate increases. They would focus among other things on:
Enhancing the regulatory and policy-making role of the People's Bank,
China's central bank;
Strengthening the archaic tax system, which the World Bank and other
international institutions have been urging China to overhaul to increase
revenues;
Improving management of loss-making state enterprises, which are proving a
huge drain on central government finances.
The plans coincide with an intense debate within the leadership over the
16-point austerity package introduced in July to curb the overheating
economy. Officials are urging a loosening of credit restrictions to cope
with a crisis in the cash-starved state sector, where some enterprises have
almost run out of money and are unable to pay workers.
Mr Li said the authorities would make credit available to 'profitable' state
enterprises, and for purchases of agricultural products. But 'strict
control' would be maintained over money available for 'overheated areas'
such as real estate development.
He said that although the 1993 economic growth rate would match last year's
13 per cent, the austerity measures had brought inflation under control,
reduced money supply growth and stabilised the exchange rate at a reasonable
level.
The vice-premier indicated that the centre-piece of new tax reforms would be
the introduction of 'federal style' tax-sharing arrangements. The formula
would divide tax revenues between the central government and the provinces,
with a portion to be shared between the two. Under the present contract
system, provinces are able to retain revenues beyond those they have
'contracted' to remit to Beijing.
This has meant that wealthy coastal regions, such as Guangdong province in
the south, have reaped a revenue windfall while the centre has been starved
of funds, weakening its control.
Mr Li said that as well as strengthening the regulatory authority of the
People's Bank, reforms would involve shifting 'policy-lending'
responsibilities, such as financing big capital works projects, from
commercial banks to new 'policy-lending' institutions.
Foreign trade reform would focus on fulfilling requirements for accession to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Heseltine in strategy talks with TV chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has called together
Britain's leading broadcasters to try to draw up a co-ordinated industrial
and export strategy for the industry.
Those invited include Mr John Birt, the Director General of the BBC, Mr Greg
Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend
Television, Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Mr Michael
Green, chairman of Carlton Communications and Independent Television News,
and Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television.
The meeting to be held on November 3 symbolises a sea change in the
government's attitude to UK broadcasting. It contrasts with a notorious
meeting in 1987 when the then prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher gave
broadcasters a dressing down and denounced ITV as 'the last bastion of
restricted practices'.
In contrast the emphasis of next week's meeting will be to encourage the
export potential of a UK industry seen as high quality and internally
competitive. Mr Heseltine's search for an industrial and export strategy
could have significant policy implications for ITV and the BBC.
The big ITV companies arguing for changes in the rules of ownership to allow
the largest nine ITV companies to take each other over see Mr Heseltine as a
powerful likely ally. They argue that ITV is too fragmented to compete
internationally. They are opposed by medium-sized companies who emphasise
the importance of regionalism. A ministerial committee chaired by Mr John
Major, prime minister, will decide on the ownership issue later this year.
The implications of the present trend in policy could be just as important
for the BBC whose Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996.
Mr Heseltine has been looking at the export potential of an integrated BBC
with a world-famous brand name and the corporation's fast-moving plans to
take BBC World Service Television around the globe.
As a sign of the reduced hostility to the corporation, the National Heritage
Department has proposed the BBC licence fee should be linked to retail
prices for three years - but this has to be approved by other ministers.

FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland may have the disadvantage of the black pieces in his battle
with his co-chief executive Mr Dieter Bock, but he is clearly still playing
to win. Until last week Mr Bock seemed to be developing unstoppable
momentum. He is Lonrho's largest single shareholder and has assiduously
courted such institutional investors as the company could muster. His drive
to open up the company, sell the Observer, and realise value for the Western
Platinum and Ashanti holdings has won applause.
Yet it never does to underestimate Mr Rowland, and he has now upstaged Mr
Bock twice in three days. The compromise over non-executive directors will
make it harder for Mr Bock's camp to vote through changes. And the
jaw-slackening peace deal with the Fayeds means that Mr Rowland does not
have to fight on two fronts simultaneously. He has other advantages, most
notably a hard core of support among small shareholders, intimate knowledge
of Lonrho's African businesses and an ability to come up with genuinely
surprising deals. Worse for Mr Bock, recent developments suggest that Mr
Rowland can still dictate Lonrho's strategy without even bothering to inform
his business associates.
Attempts to take Lonrho out of Mr Rowland's hands have failed before, as Mr
Alan Bond can ruefully confirm. While the odds favour an eventual victory
for Mr Bock, it is not secure yet. Lonrho's share price will probably bounce
now the cash flow to the lawyers has dried up. But if a protracted trench
war is in the offing, the two men could still damage what is left of
Lonrho's prospects.

FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Warrants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to know whether the recent flurry of warrants on UK equities
should be taken as a sign of encouragement or as a warning. Most have been
call warrants, giving investors the right to buy the underlying stock. At
first glance, that does not suggest a market on the brink of retreat. Yet
many have been warrants on hitherto unpopular sectors such as food retailers
and drugs companies, often accompanied by bullish research notes. On a
cynical interpretation such issues are part of an increasingly desperate
search for value in an over-stretched market.
While it can be unsettling to see the market led higher by derivatives, such
instruments are increasingly a feature of day-to-day investment management.
Unit trust managers have gained in confidence since the Securities and
Investments Board clarified the rules in 1991. The manner in which pension
funds should account for derivatives has also been standardised.
Importantly, pension fund trustees no longer regard futures and options as a
black art to be avoided at all costs.
The current fashion for warrants is unlikely to form part of this process,
though. Pension funds have been using them for some years. BTR, a core
holding for many UK funds, started issuing them in 1988. On that basis the
latest spate of warrant issues looks like a response to peculiar market
conditions rather than part of a secular trend. The taste for highly-geared
investments will not outlive the bull market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of both the Canadian dollar and its bond market suggests that,
having long since given up hope of a Conservative victory, financial markets
are discounting an outright Liberal win in today's election. If they are
right there may be more to play for. At over 5 per cent, according to
Goldman Sachs, Canadian government bonds carry the highest real yield of any
in the group of seven leading industrial countries.
A large part of the premium reflects the fear of separatist movements in
both Quebec and Western Canada. This would abate with a Liberal victory that
excluded both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party from a stake in a
coalition government. Canadian bonds would then be particularly attractive
to international funds on the look-out for high returns, especially after
the latest cuts in European interest rates.
An overall majority for the Liberals would leave their leader, Mr Jean
Chretien, free to concentrate on mundane issues like curbing the budget
deficit. Even this, though, is no easy task. Bad news as it would be to
Westland, cancellation of the CDollars 5.8bn EH-101 helicopter order would
be little more than a down payment. Concerted action on the budget, coupled
with the reappointment of the anti-inflationary Mr John Crow as governor of
the Bank of Canada in January, could shrink the 140 basis point spread
between Canadian government bonds and US treasury issues. But Mr Chretien
would need a long track record of fiscal rectitude to re-establish the 50
basis point differential last seen in the summer of 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The embarrassment of riches in the regional electricity companies must be
giving rise to some discomfort in a number of boardrooms. Strong cashflows
mean that many RECs will have net cash within the next couple of years. Yet
financing such utilities with equity alone gives rise to an unacceptably
high cost of capital. The RECs thus need to find ways of increasing gearing
and returning the excess equity to shareholders.
Possibilities include share buy-backs and one-off mega-dividends, but the
companies argue that they cannot consider change while the current
regulatory review is under way. Offer, the electricity watchdog, however, is
likely to view cost of capital as an important component of its review, and
may not take kindly to RECs which agree price caps one week and radically
alter their capital structures the next. There must be kudos for the REC
which comes forward with capital reconstruction proposals that benefit both
shareholders and customers.
Interestingly, gearing would also be increased if one REC bid mounted a cash
bid for another. Some company managements have ambitions, and a merger would
certainly produce cost savings. However, the premium one REC could afford to
pay for another would be limited. A bid battle might well tempt in a more
highly rated raider who could afford to pay more for a REC's cash generation
and stable UK earnings. That leaves the question of the government's golden
share, which does not expire until 1995. Given the history of previous
golden shares, though, that might well prove a paper tiger.

As Lady Thatcher's victims bite back, former minister Alan Clark duly
pitches in with his own review of that book. But his contribution, in the
Sunday Telegraph, is informed with a degree of bile that derives from
another source.
Laying into this 'global package . . . that is gonna be marketed', he senses
an act of 'literary and historic vandalism', before concluding that 'the
book is incomplete: and somewhat polluted by the attentions of hacks'.
This particular Thatcher-worshipper's frustrations are not entirely what
they might seem, for turning to his own Diaries, one finds that Clark
himself auditioned for the part of biographer. In an audience with the Lady,
he is told first of all she wants him to do the book 'because you are a
believer'.
He makes a play not for memoirs, scripted by a ghost, but for the Official
Biography by himself. Quickly realising that he has queered his pitch, he
goes on to console himself with the fact that she is, wrongheadedly in his
view, anyway sold on the 'autobiographical' approach to tell her story.
And what does New Republic editor John O'Sullivan, one of the chosen ghosts,
think of Clark's verdict? 'No valet is a hero, especially to another valet,'
he snapped, far from inanimately, out of New York yesterday.

Seeing the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'
Federation are expected to tie the knot over the next few months, who is
likely to emerge as the combined entity's mouthpiece on economics?
Now that Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, has handed in his
notice in favour of a job at the London Business School, the choice could be
a straight tussle between the affable Sudhir Junankar, Sentance's deputy,
and Ian Thompson, the cerebral but somewhat retiring economic adviser at the
federation.
Should the revamped body decide to look elsewhere, it might consider Ford's
head of economics, Kate Barker, one of the brighter economists currently
working in British industry.
Alternatively, there are at least two possible candidates from the CBI old
boy network: Leslie Gunde of GKN and Graham Burgess of BAT are both alumni
of the economics department.
The job could also suit Richard Freeman, the well-connected and heavyweight
chief economist at ICI who must be considering pastures new after the
demerger.
Any footloose Treasury economists, though, would presumably be questioning
how far the views of Neil Johnson, the outgoing EEF director-general whose
less-than-glowing assessment of the department has been amply aired, are
reflected in his colleagues' thinking.

Well done the Toronto Blue Jays. Last year, Canada's constitutional

players became the first non-US team to win the World Series. In an encore
this weekend, they comfortably retained the title ahead of today's general
election.
Sadly, Blue Jay-induced euphoria bodes ill for the ruling Progressive
Conservative party. Last year, Brian Mulroney's constitutional proposal was
firmly rejected, and now it looks as if Mulroney's successor, Kim Campbell,
is poised for a resounding defeat. She could always take up baseball.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Observer: Buying the BIS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors in the Bank for International Settlements will be watching
carefully the change of guard when Andrew Crockett, international director
of the Bank of England, takes over as general manager.
Investors? Yes, strange to tell, some 16 per cent of the stock in the
secretive central bankers' central bank can be bought and sold in a European
stock exchange.
When the institution was created in 1930 to recycle German reparations after
the first world war, the equity was divided up between member central banks.
But the US declined to take up its share allocation, and part of the French
and Belgian tranches were also released, all to be traded publicly, though
without voting rights.
Last Friday, in the 'over-the-counter' section of the Basle stock exchange,
one BIS share, from the most liquid, American quota, was trading at SFr9400
(Pounds 4,335).
The share, which by virtue of the bank's vast gold reserves is one of the
safest and cheapest gold-related securities around, can currently be bought
at a 31 per cent discount to net asset value. When the precious metal is
really hot, the shares have historically commanded a small premium.
The intriguing part for the true optimist is, that, if the bank's hidden
assets, including tracts of valuable land around Basle, are included,
brokers actually calculate the shares to be worth nearer Dollars 18,000
each.
As a prudent central banker, Crockett will no doubt be wise to the sirens
who whisper that the over-capitalised bank ought one day return some of its
enormous wealth to shareholders via a special dividend.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Welfare versus wealth of nations: Governments are anxious to
cut the cost of pensions, healthcare and benefit payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world's
advanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck. The immediate cause is its
increasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member
states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Rising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average
increase in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the
OECD between 1989 and 1992.
In the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could
become insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.
While short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more
fundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine
the economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since
the second world war.
Reform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on
the political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in
government spending. Total government spending in the OECD countries has
risen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990. The
biggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare,
unemployment benefits and family support. Social security payments more than
doubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent. Health
expenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
The largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of
publicly provided pensions. Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades,
more than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.
Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public
expenditure over this period.
The growth is largely attributable to three factors:
The increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second
world war mature.
The rise in the number of elderly people.
Improvements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match
rising earnings.
The maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the
doubling of health expenditure since 1960. Countries such as Spain, Ireland
and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to
provide universal coverage.
As with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of
economic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were
previously regarded as experimental. The ageing of the population has also
contributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.
Rising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both
unemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.
But it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity
benefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older
workers.
Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main
areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to
tackle the underlying causes. For example, governments have become much less
willing to offer improvements in pensions. Moves are afoot in countries such
as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age. Automatic indexation of
pensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in
the UK for the basic flat-rate pension.
Healthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to
bear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. Although there are considerable
differences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries
such as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models
that use competition and price incentives to control costs.
Many countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with
reductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify. Active
labour market policies have been introduced to promote a return to
employment.
Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures
such as these. But what most concerns those responsible for public finances
is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push
costs upwards in the future.
The most important of these is demography. Increases in life expectancy have
already increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions. The
number of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to
more than 100m in 1990.
The growth is accelerating, with the number projected to rise to more than
115m in 2000, 131m in 2010 and 156m by 2020. Only halfway through the 21st
century will the number of over-65s peak, at about 190m.
The strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by
relating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age. The
standard measure for this is the age dependency ratio, the population over
65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64. For the OECD as a whole,
the age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990
to 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040.
Some countries face much greater pressures from the ageing of their
populations than others. Germany and Japan, for example, will both have age
dependency ratios of 34 per cent by 2020 - one person over the age of 65 for
every three people between 15 and 64. By 2040, almost half of Germany's
population could be over 65, though the proportion will fall thereafter.
Age dependency ratios will climb more slowly in the UK and US, to about 25
per cent in 2020 - four people of working age to support every elderly
person. In both countries, ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040.
The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions,
where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature.
Overall, the OECD estimates that the pension burden could double over the
next 50 years. Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would
be needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the
pensions do not increase in real terms.
In practice, increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to
sustain if earnings rose faster. The growing gap between pensioners and
those still at work that would result could be politically unacceptable.
However, raising pensions by more than prices would either require much
higher growth rates or higher taxes for those in work to pay the bill.
The impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clear-cut.
Experts differ on whether increased longevity inevitably means more medical
care: while more might be required for the very elderly, less might be
needed for younger people as chronic diseases become less common.
Additional costs of new drugs and advances in medical technology could be at
least as important as demography in pushing up healthcare bills.
However, there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social
services for the elderly. This will be encouraged by social changes, such as
the decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by
younger relatives.
Other changes in social structure are also pushing up the demands on the
welfare state. Throughout the OECD, for example, the number of lone-parent
families has been rising since the 1960s. In some countries, the increase
has been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as
France, Japan and Switzerland. At the other extreme, the increase has
exceeded 50 per cent in the UK and Australia. In the US the number has more
than doubled. Lone-parent families now typically constitute 10-15 per cent
of of all families with children in OECD countries. In the US it is one in
four families.
The reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and
divorce. But inevitably lone-parent families rely on welfare provision to a
far greater extent than two-parent families.
Added to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the
increase in unemployment levels across the OECD. Over the past two decades,
jobless levels have risen during recessions but not fallen back to the same
extent in the following recovery period.
This ratchet effect has worried the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by President
Clinton in the coming months. Continuing rises in the base level of
unemployment would further undermine countries' ability to pay for their
welfare states.
Responses to these cost pressures vary from country to country. Germany, the
UK, France, Italy and the US are among countries that have already raised
tax and social security contribution levels.
However, the scope for such increases is limited by voters' reluctance to
pay higher taxes. Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers -
as in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by
business, which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of
higher costs. In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden
business with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.
An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in
borrowing to fund the welfare state. But that would also have deleterious
effects, according to the OECD. Average government debt in OECD countries
has risen from 23 per cent of GDP in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992.
Without either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare
spending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points
over the next 40 years, according to one OECD study. It says this is 'a
situation which most would think unsustainable'.
This is why the OECD's half-yearly Economic Outlook repeatedly stresses the
importance of controlling welfare spending in improving economic
performance. The OECD's immediate priorities for reform include charges for
the use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the
efficiency of those services.
But the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate
the funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people.
Tackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with
charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.
Significant cuts in benefit levels, for example, may be needed - including
greater targeting of benefits on the most needy. User charges could become
increasingly widespread, especially for the better-off. They could rise to
cover a much larger part of the costs of welfare services. And the demands
put on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private
provision of pensions and healthcare.
Measures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare
state, however. From providing support 'from the cradle to the grave', it
would become a safety net for those who could not afford to provide for
themselves.
As countries become wealthier, moving the boundary between the state's
responsibilities and those of the individual in this way may be a natural
step. But it would be politically controversial.
Yet it is increasingly clear that there is no alternative to fundamental
reforms if advanced economies are to protect their most vulnerable citizens
without imposing unacceptable burdens on economic performance. The welfare
state may have effectively bound societies together through the ups and
downs of the economic cycle for the past 40 years. But a new glue will be
needed over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the
welfare state.
This is the first in a series of articles analysing the pressures on the
welfare state across the world, and examining policy options for relieving
the strain

FT  25 OCT 93 / Leading Article: High times on newer markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING markets are becoming popular, and to match the flurry of new funds
in the west to cash in on the interest of investors there is a corresponding
wave of flotations and bond issues in developing countries. Last week's
proposed offer of Dollars 400m worth of shares in Telecomasia in Bangkok is
a case in point.
Is this flood of money becoming dangerous? US closed-end funds alone have
raised nearly Dollars 4bn this year to invest in these suddenly glamorous
opportunities. There is an obvious element of marketing man's gloss even in
the title emerging markets itself: these are in fact high risk or immature
markets, and certain of them, especially in Latin America, have been
emerging for at least 150 years.
Behind the hype, however, there are some solid reasons at present for
investors to look outside the investment mainstream. Economic growth in the
G7 industrial countries has averaged only about 1 1/2 per cent a year in the
1990s so far, and many investors in the US, for instance, appear to have
concluded that shares on Wall Street have become overpriced in relation to
corporate growth prospects. Yet many developing economies have been
expanding at 6 per cent or more. There has been a general extension of
market-oriented capitalist economic systems. China has been a sleeping giant
but is now undergoing rapid change and has far greater potential than the
various smaller emerging markets that have occupied investors' attention in
the past.
Advanced technology
Improved communications have made it more practical for foreign investors to
manage their portfolios in far-flung territories. Advanced technology has
also transformed the dealing and settlement aspects of investment in
securities, at least in the better markets. A general relaxation of
financial restrictions has made the international movement of capital
easier. In addition, moves towards privatisation are making available for
investment substantial companies of the kind which institutional investors
often find more comfortable to hold in their portfolios than they do the
creations of colourful local entrepreneurs.
More fundamentally, it is arguable that the whole balance of the world
economy is shifting, as developing world labour is harnessed to the
exploitation of imported technologies. But whether the political structures
in developing countries can cope with the stresses is another matter.
'President overthrown' is the kind of news story which tests the nerves of
an emerging markets investor; it is even alleged by police in Caracas that
stockbrokers and other financial professionals took part in a terrorist
bombing campaign in Venezuela this summer in order to force profit-making
opportunities in the financial markets.
Potential bubbles
The immediate problem is one of potential bubbles, with market prices being
pushed sky-high by the sheer volume of inflowing capital, creating a
self-feeding spiral. This appears to be happening in Hong Kong, where after
a previous bubble, in October 1987, share prices crashed by 42 per cent in a
single day.
Selecting the sound from the unsound is no easy task. Once the US was an
emerging market, and much more recently so was Japan. But some of today's
burgeoning markets will not make the transition to maturity. Values to an
overseas investor depend not only upon the achievement of economic growth
but on whether a country considers it important to honour liabilities to
foreigners. Where hyperinflation exists, as it still does in too many Latin
American and east European countries, it is a sign of unwillingness even to
recognise domestic obligations. In China, the source of the most ambitious
projections among emerging markets promoters, the suspect quality of
information makes reading economic developments even more difficult than in
London and New York.
The fear is that when money is plentiful investors become less
discriminating. Indeed the riskiest markets will, for a while, tend to be
the best performers: Nigerian bonds head this year's league table. Investors
in emerging markets will find life dangerous in anything but the very short
term if they fail to recognise the right balance between risk and return.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Leading Article: British Gas and the MMC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR of investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has not
ended debate over the future of the UK gas industry. Argument still rages
over the main questions: whether British Gas's domestic monopoly should be
abolished and whether the company's trading arm should be divested from its
pipeline business. With public consultation on the MMC's recommendations due
to end this week, it is unclear what ministers, who have the final say, will
decide.
The snag is that there is little support for the MMC's line that British Gas
should be broken up in 1997 and its monopoly abolished three to five years
later. The Gas Consumers Council is suspicious of both break-up and
abolition of the monopoly, fearing they would result in higher prices,
particularly for the poorest customers. Independent gas suppliers want the
market opened up much sooner than the end of the century but care little
either way about break-up. Ofgas, the industry regulator, is taking a
similar line ' reversing its earlier position that break-up was necessary
for competition to flourish. The only party reasonably content with the
MMC's package is British Gas, which previously argued against being broken
up.
In bringing this tangled debate to an end, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, should hold fast to the golden rule: competition
wherever possible and regulation only where necessary. Competition is the
most effective tool for driving costs down and widening consumer choice.
Regulation can strangle the benefits competition brings.
Such considerations mean priority should be given to abolishing the domestic
monopoly. It is not acceptable for consumers to be denied a choice of gas
suppliers until the next century.
Higher bills
But this does not mean concerns over competition leading to higher gas bills
can be swept aside. British Gas's charging structure is riddled with
cross-subsidies, which would be eroded by competition. Ministers will not
want a similar row to that which has greeted the imposition of VAT on fuel
bills.
An acceptable way must therefore be found to protect those most in need
while harnessing market forces. Such a combination is not, as many suppose,
a contradiction in terms. Social obligations can be maintained in a
competitive market, as experience in telecommunications has shown.
There are different ways of achieving this. In choosing, ministers should be
guided by the need to keep regulation in check. Such an imperative counts
against Ofgas's proposal that onerous social obligations - equivalent to
those currently borne by British Gas - should be imposed on all competitors.
This could deter potential rivals from entering the market.
Social obligations
A better approach would be to conduct a proper analysis of which social
obligations are desirable and then cost them. At present, there is much
fuzzy talk about cross-subsidies between different types of customer but
little analysis of how well these are targeted on those most in need.
Once social obligations had been costed, it would be possible to require one
supplier to meet the obligations and the rest to pay their share. Initially,
it would be natural for the obligations to remain with British Gas. But in
the longer run, the role could be put out to competitive tender and given to
the operator requiring the lowest subsidy.
The need to keep regulation to the minimum is also the most persuasive
reason for splitting British Gas's trading and pipeline operations. Although
the MMC probably overstated the case by arguing that self-sustaining
competition would be impossible without break-up, such a structure would
certainly enhance the prospects of competition. So long as British Gas
remains an integrated group, there will be a need for constant regulatory
intervention to ensure rivals gain fair access to its pipelines.
Some think it impractical to press ahead with abolition of the domestic
monopoly and break-up at the same time. If that were the case, ministers
should give priority to opening up the market. But it is not clear why there
has to be such a trade-off. Ideally, Mr Heseltine should give the green
light to both.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Portraits of families at war: India's economic reform is
exposing splits in family-run business groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Siddharth Shriram, a 49-year-old Indian businessman locked in a family
row with his 76-year-old father, says: 'My father's got the wrong mind-set.
His mind-set is that elders in this country are always right.' Mr Charat
Ram, the father, retorts that his son may be 'intelligent and dynamic' but
should 'pay more attention to his responsibilities'.
The two men are quarrelling over the running of a loss-making,
family-controlled company that makes sewing machines. Previously they might
have tried to settle their differences in private. But the onset of economic
reform, launched by the government in 1991, is putting pressure on the
family-run groups that dominate Indian industry and is straining even strong
family loyalties.
The impact of the feuding goes beyond the founding family - disrupting
relations with other shareholders and outside partners, including foreign
companies. Those families that cannot keep their arguments from hurting
their businesses will suffer.
Indian companies are usually run by a patriarch who employs his relatives in
an extended family enterprise. In theory, the family lives in harmony and
holds everything in common. In practice, there have often been rows, as in
family businesses in any country. India is particularly prone to such
disputes because it has no primogeniture, so potential heirs squabble over
their rights, sometimes for years.
Also, tough tax and foreign exchange control laws discourage families from
making cash settlements for fear of disclosing their wealth. So, large
numbers of heirs have to be accommodated. Even after a family has launched
companies on the stock market and diluted ownership to 20 per cent or less,
family members usually dominate management. Directorships, chairmanships and
even whole companies are created to accommodate personal whims.
But a generation of businessmen now in their 40s, typically heirs of ageing
fathers, is challenging these traditional values. These men have often
worked abroad and want to promote foreign-trained managers. They believe the
principle of family-first cannot survive the competitive pressures of
economic deregulation.
The fathers do not necessarily dispute this view. But they often lack the
younger generation's sense of urgency. They do not want to retire, at least
not yet. Mr T. Thomas, a former director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
multinational, and a top Bombay businessman, says: 'The people at the top
love to hold on to power.'
Four father-son power struggles have come into the open this year. The
first, involving Mr Shriram and his father, is being fought in a family with
a long history of arguments over sharing its wealth. The most recent split
was in the mid-1980s when the group's interests, including sugar, oils,
chemicals, textiles and engineering, were divided between Mr Ram and his
brother, and Mr Ram's two sons.
Mr Ram got control of Jay Engineering, the troubled sewing machine maker.
However, it performed so badly after the share-out that Mr Ram turned to his
son Mr Shriram for help. Mr Shriram agreed - as long as he was given a free
hand. Mr Ram promised to hand over the chairmanship to Mr Shriram, but has
so far not carried out his pledge. Businessmen who know the family say the
real bone of contention is the favour Mr Ram has shown over many years to Mr
NR Dongre, a group manager who has been given substantial blocks of shares
by Mr Ram. Mr Ram has told journalists that Mr Dongre is 'an excellent
top-ranking manager' and that Mr Shriram should 'take a lesson or two from
Mr Dongre'. Mr Shriram does not take kindly to such advice.
The atmosphere is even more tense at Apollo Tyres, one of India's largest
tyremakers with annual sales of more than Rs5bn (Pounds 106m) and the core
of a group headed by Mr Raunaq Singh. Mr Singh is Apollo's chairman. But
daily management has for the past decade been in the hands of his son - Mr
Onkar Singh Kanwar, the vice-chairman. Mr Kanwar now wants to take over as
chairman but his father refuses to budge.
Mr Kanwar is widely credited with transforming Apollo from a sleepy company
into a professionally run unit. He wants to respond to economic
liberalisation by concentrating his resources on tyremaking. His father
wants to diversify into fields that are being opened up by deregulation.
The arguments are so bitter that Mr Singh has accused his son of making
undisclosed investments such as a Rs50m loan to Mr Harshad Mehta, the
stockbroker at the centre of last year's securities market scandal. Mr
Kanwar disputes the accusations.
Meanwhile, in the family of Mr Mohan Singh, a 76-year-old Delhi-based
pharmaceuticals entrepreneur, the arguments have reached such a pitch that a
former chief justice of India has been asked to arbitrate. The quarrels
began three years ago when Mr Mohan Singh divided his business between his
three sons. Mr Parvinder Singh, the eldest, was given Ranbaxy Laboratories,
the family's flagship. However, the gifts came with strings attached. As Mr
Mohan Singh says, without a touch of irony: 'I gave everybody freedom. The
only condition was that they work under my supervision and control.'
Mr Parvinder Singh has refused to acknowledge his father's supremacy. To
make matters worse he has managed Ranbaxy Laboratories so well that, with a
turnover of Rs5bn a year, his business is now twice the size of his two
brothers' combined interests.
Mr Kedar Nath Modi, patriarch of one branch of the Delhi-based Modi business
family, is embroiled in a similar argument with his middle son Mr Yogendra
Modi. The elder Mr Modi divided his businesses - including cement, textiles
and chemicals - between his three sons a decade ago but insisted on a
redistribution in the late 1980s after it emerged that his middle son was
making far more money than his two brothers. Mr Yogendra Modi reluctantly
agreed to a new settlement. But once more he proved better at managing his
portion than his brothers - so this year his father has tried to impose a
second redistribution. Even a former cabinet secretary, called in to
arbitrate, has failed to resolve the dispute.
These arguments hurt business performance. At Apollo Tyres, senior managers
and accountants are now spending time and energy investigating the charges
levelled by Mr Raunaq Singh against his son. At Ranbaxy Laboratories,
foreign technology suppliers have expressed concern to the management about
the stability of commercial ties.
It is no accident that the most successful family-controlled groups have
generally avoided public arguments. Tata, India's largest industrial
combine, has for decades fostered good relations between family and
non-family managers. Family members have always headed the group, but
non-family executives have chaired important operating companies. However,
Tata's recent past has also been blighted by a family-style struggle between
Mr Ratan Tata, the 56-year-old scion of the founding family who took control
in the late 1980s, and a slew of older executives in their 70s. Mr Ratan
Tata won.
As long as the family is in charge the temptation remains to put family
interests first. As Mr N. Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India, a development bank, says: 'The problem is
that decisions are geared not to business needs but to family needs.' He
believes that, as in the west, professionals will gradually take over from
family managers. But, judging by this year's rows, not all groups will
manage the delicate transition.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Criticism of banks over-heated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Prodhan (Letters, October 22) joins the ranks of those whose
criticism of 'the banks' contains more heat than light.
Charges levied upon retailers are often far less than 4 per cent and are
negotiable. The cost and security implications to such retailers of dealing
with increased cash far outweigh the modest costs involved in accepting card
payments.
Some finance houses offer credit cards which allow monthly charging by
direct debit and involve no membership fee. Perhaps your correspondent
should transfer his allegiance.
Unfortunately, it seems that critics of the banks expect them to provide
their services free of charge. Perhaps Mr Prodhan will next be campaigning
for interest-free loans? Adrian Martin,

FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Reporting reminiscent of an
Eisenstein movie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUCE FELDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a new subscriber to the FT in Akashi City, Japan, I was rendered
breathless upon receiving my first issues containing the riveting articles
by Mr John Lloyd about the clash resulting from the commandeering of the
Russian parliament building by foes of President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Lloyd's vivid writing, reminiscent of an Eisenstein movie, conveyed
dramatically the exhilaration to pandemonium to terror to despondency which
must have been felt by the participants.
What also emerged clearly in the articles was the considerable danger to
which Mr Lloyd must surely have exposed himself in order to bring us these
closely observed stories - passing blood-splattered bodies in smoke-engulfed
hallways as people run wildly around, and the like.
He deserves a nice tranquil assignment writing about interest rates.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Theories behind the UK fiscal debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should the next UK Budget contain tax increases - or spending cuts - in
spite of a modest and fragile recovery from a prolonged recession? Behind
this over-familiar question are issues of principle which affect every
advanced industrial economy and which have never been resolved since the
second world war.
The chart shows a familiar stylised picture of booms and slumps around an
upward underlying trend of output. The first point to note is that the
upward trend, shown by the dotted line, remains unaffected by fluctuations.
Some economic analyses state this explicitly, for instance the Bank of
England Working Paper No 13, from which I have adapted the chart.
Granted the central assumption, the risks of doing nothing beyond Norman
Lamont's deferred tax increases are overwhelming. The risk of inaction is
that the UK will end up with a high burden of interest payments, or even a
debt trap in which that burden rises out of control. (The latter is still a
remote risk for the UK.)
Suppose that the UK is at point C on the chart after a prolonged recession.
Then a relatively lax fiscal policy might make some contribution to ensuring
that the economy does indeed recover along the path CD, instead of carrying
on longer in a depressed condition below trend. But the gains will be very
limited. Output will end up, in any case, in a few years at point B on the
trend line. All that chancellors can hope to do is to reduce the oscillation
of the wavy line around the trend. Given all the difficulties of fine tuning
and the well-known dangers of doing 'too much too late' or 'too little too
late', anti-cyclical fiscal policy is as likely to aggravate fluctuations as
to flatten them out.
Now, however, let us make the different assumption that the long-run course
of output - or supply potential - is not predetermined, but can itself be
reduced by a protracted recession or period of below-trend growth. There are
many ways in which this can happen. Human beings can lose valuable work
habits if unemployed for too long. Investment will be held back if final
demand is not there, especially investment in increased capacity. (If you
want to show that you are up with economic writing while making these
commonsense points, you can use the word 'hysteresis'.)
Thus, after a prolonged recession, aggravated by perverse fiscal soundness,
the economy may not be able to go back to the dotted line and stay there
without overheating and explosive inflation. After a series of such episodes
the British economy (or more seriously the combined economies of the
industrial world) may end up instead at point E. If the trend itself is
deflected downwards, national income is lower and less revenue raised at any
given tax rates than if the economy had remained on the dotted line.
The argument is still not resolved without some estimate of how much
long-run loss of output is incurred by overtight financial policies - that
is how far E is likely to be below B. If it is by only a modest amount, it
might still be worth correcting the budget deficit in good time to avoid the
process of collecting large sums of tax from citizens just to hand them back
in the shape of debt interest. This is a costly irritation involving
distortionary taxation which could itself inhibit supply potential. Gavyn
Davies, in the Goldman Sachs Economics Analyst which provides the thinking
behind the IFS Green Budget, hints at such a cost benefit analysis but does
not provide it.
Of course, if the economy continues to face a threat of depression for years
on end it would be sensible to try to reduce the deadweight burden of
interest payments under national debt, by trying to switch the weight of
stimulative policy to the monetary side, that is by cutting interest rates
so much that tax rates can safely be edged upwards. But whether one likes it
or not, monetary policy has an international dimension; and it would be more
prudent to allow fiscal policy to continue to bear some of the weight of
economic stimulation until we have seen how far international interest rates
are likely to fall, after the German cut.
These are highly important details, which have caused ministerial
resignations and prime ministerial tantrums. But the point of principle is
whether fiscal policy can affect the path of output to any worthwhile
extent; and, if so, whether the short-term path of output can affect the
underlying trend. Learned treatises on the need for budget tightening which
do not consider these matters should go into the bin.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Review must protect local democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN BRISCOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Authers' piece ('Up the pole at the town hall', October 20) is an
excellent summary of the problems and costs of the proposed review of local
government. There is another point of national importance which may well be
overlooked in the piecemeal review of local government structures. Some may
argue that unitary structures will improve public accountability. Perhaps
so, but only if the gradual accretion of powers from local democracy to
Whitehall is halted.
Local government exists to enable local choices to be made between competing
and often irreconcilable demands. How do you choose - within limited budgets
 -between the needs of the elderly and the young, the demands for better
maintenance and nursery schools? It is the job of local politicians to
decide these issues and to be publicly accountable for their decisions. As
we review structures we need also to buttress local democracy against the
tide of Whitehall's bureaucracy.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: High prices are strangling
energy-intensive UK manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I J BLAKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Both Michael Smith in his article 'Fears of more pit closures
increase', and the Leader 'Cutting Coal' (both October 19) failed to make
the important connection between the predicament of the coal industry and
the unique and untested electricity market structure that the government
imposed when electricity was privatised.
As is well known, there is a growing surplus of coal-fired electricity
generation capacity. The marginal cost of base-load electricity generation
on this capacity is less than 1.5p/kwh, yet new generation capacity costing
about 2.8p/kwh is being approved, built and prospering within the 'market'.
How is this possible?
By exercising their dominant market power within a highly artificial market
structure National Power and PowerGen have been able to raise electricity
prices far in excess of costs, thus creating headroom for the construction
of electricity generation plant using natural gas - the cheapest form of new
generation plant.
As a consequence, the UK's asset of large efficient coal-fired power
stations fuelled by increasingly competitive UK coal is now being
squandered, and energy-intensive manufacturing industry is being
strangulated by high electricity prices which have increased by up to 70 per
cent since electricity was privatised.
It is truly demoralising to see how slowly the government is acting to
rectify these self-inflicted wounds - particularly at a time when economic
recovery appears to be faltering and there are severe problems with the
balance of trade and the public sector borrowing requirement.
It has taken two years of intensive lobbying by large electricity consumers
for the Department of Trade and Industry even to acknowledge that there is a
problem; and it seems increasingly likely that the government will rely on
Offer to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as
its agent in effecting a solution. If this were to happen, it is likely to
be mid-1995 at the earliest before any material changes will emerge, by
which time the manufacturing base will have been further debilitated, and
few coal mines will be left in production.
The government has the power to act now in the national interest to arrest
the artificial decline in the use of coal for electricity generation, and to
reform the electricity market so that the declining costs of coal in
efficient base-load stations are reflected in internationally competitive
prices to electricity-intensive manufacturing industry. In essence these
were the recommendations of the trade and industry select committee in its
report of January 1993, which was largely ignored by the government. Now
that the adverse consequences for the coal industry and electricity
consumers are clearer we can only hope that the government will listen and
act.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Capitalist formula for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D B ROBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government having successfully suppressed (but not cured) inflation
over a period of some years, now faces the harder challenge of achieving
growth without stimulating renewed inflation. If the chancellor were to have
the unusual courage to pursue a capitalist solution, the challenge might be
met.
My formula would include: sharply lowered interest rates, the main benefit
of which would be felt by hard-pressed companies currently working only for
their banks; greatly increased and simplified incentives to persuade the
earning population to divert their expenditure from consumer goods into
wealth creating investments; and a measure to allow wages paid by private
people to be tax deductible - which would be widely interpreted as according
benefit to the rich, but which would go a long way towards providing a
solution to the unemployment problem. Finally, these measures should be
matched by harsh cuts in public sector employment.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Mozart and Donizetti comedies - English Touring Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem difficult to keep track of the touring opera companies in
Britain. This is a world in a constant state of revolution: Kent Opera was
guillotined a few years ago and the axe now hangs threateningly over the
activities of Glyndebourne Touring Opera, despite the widespread success it
has always enjoyed.
English Touring Opera (formerly called Opera 80) has so far kept both its
head and its grant. The company would seem to want to cheer up its audiences
in the regions and this autumn's tour, which started last week at the
Theatre Royal, Bath, again features a pair of comedies. The not very
successful version of Mozart's Cos fan tutte from the spring has been paired
with a new production of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore.
They work in virtually opposite fashions. For the Donizetti, Stephen Medcalf
has based his production on an unpromising premise, which turns out more
entertaining than by rights it should. He has set Donizetti's Latin comedy
among the golden fields of the American corn-belt. The villagers have become
farm-hands working on the harvest. The army platoon commanded by Belcore
rides in as the cavalry, with distinctive dark blue jackets and red
neckerchiefs.
None of this has any significant point to make and Medcalf soon loses
interest in it. What makes English Touring Opera L'elisir d'amore an
enchanting and amusing evening is the very natural performances of the lead
roles, especially the delightful Nemorino of Niall Morris. Boyish, tender,
unspoilt in every way, he has everything this part demands, except the top
notes, which arrive more by dint of determination than technique. Every
scene between him and Mary Plazas's bright Adina touched the heart.
The one link with the American theme is Belcore, strongly sung by Adrian
Clarke and played as a bubblegum-chewing, super-confident man of action,
whose idea of winning a woman is to lassoe her with his riding whip.
Jonathan May's Dulcamara, less a sharp operator than a shambolic no-hoper,
did not really work; more of the Italian buffo's traditional role, to
sparkle with his patter and entertain, should have been retained.
So long as he held stage and pit together, Andrew Greenwood was in charge of
a lively performance. By English Touring Opera generally praiseworthy
standards it was not an impressive production and yet it touched a nerve.
One sensed that Donizetti felt for Nemorino - a shy, unassuming young man,
always ignored, always undervalued - and a serious social issue lurked below
the comic surface.
The production of Cos fan tutte operates in reverse. A clever idea is there
at the start: to play out this 'school for lovers' in a present-day art
school, where students of life drawing learn about the different anatomy of
the sexes. But within a couple of scenes its dramatic potential has been
frittered away, reducing all Mozart's depth of emotion and understanding
into the shallowest of silly farces. The English Touring Opera cast has a
couple of practised comic performers, but also its share of weak singing.
Fortunately, Martin Andre whips the music along so fast that the end is
always in sight.
The tour moves on via Halifax, York, Buxton and Canterbury, and continues
until 4 December

FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Live Like Pigs - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival of John Arden's Live Like Pigs at the Royal Court Theatre
Upstairs 35 years after it was first performed on the Court's main stage is
a must both for students of drama and of social history.
The most interesting aspect of it is the way it is rooted in the immediate
postwar past, yet uncannily looks forward to a rebellion against the welfare
state. The date is 1958 or thereabouts; British standards of living were
rising rapidly and bureaucratic controls were being reduced.
Yet that is not how it comes out in the play. Bureaucracy is seen as
all-powerful, whether from the Town Hall, which allocates housing, or the
National Insurance Office, which checks indirectly on people's movements.
The intention behind the welfare state may be benign (Arden doesn't overtly
concede even that); his play suggests that it was feared, not loved, by
those whom it was set up to help.
As for rising affluence, the only visible consumer good in Live Like Pigs is
an old-fashioned gramophone which plays 78s. Possession of this is enough to
pin a suspicion that it may have been stolen. There are no telephones, no TV
and only a reference to cars, though there is a regular bus service.
The underlying idea of Arden's play is a good one and has stood the test of
time. An extended family of travelling people who used to live in a caravan
by the railway siding is moved into a new housing development. Next door is
a more conventional family where father and daughter have jobs, the mother
does the washing, and there is a settled way of life. The two families
clash, just as the inflow of migrants has continued to lead to clashes with
the more established community.
Live Like Pigs is more subtle than outright confrontation. There are sexual
exchanges between the families. The conventional working class man remembers
the experiences he had during the war and falls for Big Rachel,
sensationally played by Kathryn Hunter as one of the travellers.
In the end, the established community turns on the outsiders. But there have
been some striking changes in attitudes. The policeman who enters is not
automatically presented by Arden as chief villain. If anything, he is rather
less culpable than the man from the Town Hall: simply out of his depth in
the new order. The female doctor who comes fom the National Health Service
is shown as utterly useless. In those days there were no social workers.
Theatre styles have changed, too. Live Like Pigs is three hours long and has
an unnecessary chorus. The influence of writing for TV has made this kind of
play much shorter and tighter. Yet produced by the Classics on a Shoestring
Company and directed by Katie Mitchell, Arden's work is still a classic of
its kind.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Pure melodrama - South Bank's Czech Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 18th and 19th centuries, 'melodrama' meant something quite specific:
spoken declamation over purpose-designed music. Mozart liked the idea, and
intended to explore it more than he found time to; Violetta's letter-reading
in the last act of Traviata is melodrama; at late as 1897, Richard Strauss
set Tennyson's Enoch Arden for recitant and florid piano.
Czech composers took to the genre with enthusiasm, and it has not been
forgotten in the South Bank's Czech Festival. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Friday, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment treated us to Georg
Benda's complete Medea, as fully cast, costumed and staged as this
three-quarter-hour piece requires. If it failed to draw the full house it
deserved, it excited the audience who were there. It made a rare experience,
fascinating and gripping beyond expectation.
Harriet Walter's Medea ' strong, angular, wracked by grief ' made an
indelible impression, with absolute fidelity to Benda's accompanying score.
Benda was ten years older than Haydn, but his score is astonishingly subtle,
flexible, succinct. One would never have imagined that his 18th-century
idiom could be deployed with the precision of a modern film or TV score. Nor
does it sound bitty: while the music gets to expand in its own right only in
a few places, it boasts an iron consistency and purpose, and more variety of
colour and character than many an opera of its time.
In John Abulafia's production, Chris Baugh's designs and Timothy Heywood's
costumes, lit by Clare Tattersall, the rest of the cast ' notably Vincenzo
Nicoli as the faithless Jason ' met the standard set by Miss Walter's
scathing portrayal. The orchestra, under Ivan Fischer's alert direction, let
nothing slip; what we saw and heard formed a seamless whole. Might not
Benda's orchestral music have expected a little more candid surface-emotion?
The OAE never indulged in string portamenti, for example (sliding from one
note to the next), though that was a standard period device. A few more
'Expressionist' touches would have been in order, without prejudice to
Classical decorum.
Two more Czech composers figured in the first half of the concert. Franz
Krommer's E-flat Clarinet Concerto was full of solo virtuosity ' knit-two,
purl-two stuff at manic speed, efficiently delivered by Antony Pay ' and
mindless good cheer. A G Minor Symphony by Leopold Kozeluch was spare,
shapely, original, harmonically adventurous (and extremely well played
here). Another real discovery, despite the fact that most of us have
probably heard a little Kozeluch on Radio 3; we must start paying him better
attention.

In tonight's episode of Cracker (ITV, 9.00), we see Fitz (Robbie Coltrane)
taking on hard nut Tina Brien (Susan Lynch), one of the more compelling
female roles on television at present. Brilliant acting all round and
interesting drama.
The Thatcherfest continues this week. In The Incredible Shrinking
Politicians (BBC2, 8.30), Martin Jacques investigates the poor standing of
politicians not only in the UK but abroad. Bob Geldof, strangely enough,
airs his opinions.
It is a case of the incredible scarpering cauliflower-cutters on tonight's
Cutting Edge: Rich Pickings (C4, 9.00). When the Department of Employment's
inspectors arrive down on the vegetable fields of East Anglia and
Lincolnshire, dozens of dole-fiddlers run like rabbits. However, it is the
crooked gangmasters employing them and growing fat on the pickings who make
the harder targets in this film of under-cover operations.
On Radio 3, The Marquesa's Memoirs (9.00) run all week. Tim Eastwood talks

Stravinsky, and dozens more.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Campus cathedral designs to enshrine Ruskin's legacy -
Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Ruskin (1819 - 1900) had a slightly confined view of architecture. He
had an acute perception but sometimes his interest in the separate parts
obscured, or at least clouded, his view of the whole.
In his calmer periods he would often say that architecture had lifted him
out of his depression. Towards the end of his life he was elevated out of a
degree of gloom by visits to the great cathedrals of France - Rouen, Amiens,
Chartres and Beauvais. Only one book came of all his enthusiasm for these
cathedrals as repositories of history, religion, and architecture - it was
called 'The Bible of Amiens'. It was much admired by Proust who, in a
curious way, shared with Ruskin that poetic sense of perception, memory, and
meaning. It was his extraordinary facility as a descriptive and emotive
writer that brought the stones of Venice to life. His writings on the close
relationship between architecture and sculpture demonstrate his intuitive
understanding of both those arts.
It is encouraging news for anyone interested in Ruskin as an intellectual
and artistic influence to learn that a new foundation is being established
to unify the care of two important Ruskin collections and to build a new
Ruskin Library.
The owners of the large collection of watercolours,manuscripts printed books
and other material associated with Ruskin are The Education Trust Ltd. The
Trust owns Brantwood, near Coniston, in the English Lake District, which was
Ruskin's home, as well as the great collection of Ruskiniana that has been
housed for a long time at Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight.
The fact that the mass of material cannot any longer remain at the school
has precipitated the need for the new Ruskin Foundation, which is a
partnership between the Education Trust and the University of Lancaster.
A new Ruskin Library will be built on the campus of the University of
Lancaster to house the Bembridge material, thus bringing it near to
Brantwood and the Lakes. The University of Lancaster is the leading centre
for nineteenth century studies and is a natural home for all the Ruskin
material.
Professor Michael Wheeler is the Professor of English and Director of the
Ruskin Programme at the University of Lancaster, and with the chairman of
the new Ruskin Foundation, Sir Richard Parsons, he is masterminding the
building of the new library and the future for all the elements of what will
undoubtedly be the world's foremost Ruskin Collection. He has already
reached the halfway point in his fundraising and he needs to raise another
Dollars 500,000 in the next six months so that the building of the library
can start.
Ruskin was undoubtedly the greatest British art critic and social
commentator of his time and his spirit is bound to be observing the efforts
which are being made to design a suitable home for this internationally
important collection.
It is a difficult task for the architect and the University of Lancaster
have chosen Mr Richard MacCormac, the immediate past President of the Royal
Institute of British Architects.
I have always admired the work of Mr MacCormac and I last wrote in this
column about him when his brilliant new chapel for Fitzwilliam College
Cambridge was completed. He has produced a remarkable design for the Ruskin
Library.
The site for the library is on an escarpment on the western boundary of the
university campus. From the site there is a remarkable view of the sea.
Lancaster is one of the new universities of the 1960s and it was designed by
Bridgwater, Shepheard and Epstein and Tom Mellor and Partners.
The masterplan allowed for a pedestrian spine and randomly grouped concrete
and brick buildings along and around it. It is not unsuccessful and has some
good pedestrian areas, such as the main Alexandra Square.
The Ruskin Library clearly comes from the same architectural stable as the
Fitzwilliam chapel and, like that chapel, it is designed to enshrine some
eternal truths. Ruskin's truths were about art and architecture rather than
about religion but it is right for the architect to plan a building based
upon the idea of tall, curved encircling and enclosing walls sheltering a
rich treasury.
The elliptical building will be seen on its site as an island - the
architect decribes it as a metaphor for Ruskin's Venice. Within the outer
walls is an inner enclosed archive which will appear as a giant treasury for
the archives, paintings and other Ruskin relics.
Not for nothing is the plan of the whole building like that of a church -
the entrance, archive and reading room can be seen as the narthex, choir and
sanctuary. There is an upper gallery for exhibitions and a meeting room
which will have a dramatic high view of the sea.
The final choice of materials is yet to be made but the architect is
thinking of ways to suggest something of the stratified appearance of some
of the Italian cathedrals and churches that Ruskin liked and drew. The
general plan of the library promises to be an example of what Ruskin would
have said 'depends for its dignity upon arrangement and government received
from human mind'. But architects today find it difficult to conceive of the
kind of ornament that Ruskin so passionately admired and understood. No
building can do more that suggest the richness of what lies within.
Mr MacCormac has been wise not to try to imitate Ruskin. His new library
promises to have a clarity, dignity and a sense of light and drama within
that Ruskin would have liked and understood.
All any architect can do is to create the appropriate memorial presence in a
building like this and to trust that it will also throw light upon the great
mind of Ruskin.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Trinidad work goes to Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 58m scheme to upgrade an oil refinery in Trinidad heads a list of
contracts totalling more than Pounds l00m awarded to WIMPEY Construction in
the past four weeks.
The project - for the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago - is one of
two contracts secured by Wimpey in the area, bringing the total value of new
work in the country to Pounds 77m.
Mr Dennis Brant, chairman of Wimpey Construction said: 'We have been
established in the Caribbean for more than 37 years but have seen little
activity in the area for the past decade.
'Recently, however, there has been a substantial increase in the
construction workload. It is a similar story in other ports of the world,
for example, the Middle East and the Far East.
'Wimpey has seen a noticeable upswing in activity in these areas.'
The company's other contracts are in the UK. They include three schemes
totalling Pounds 16m for projects in the retail sector, two health care
projects and a Pounds 10.5m design and build leisure development in
Hertfordshire.
'Retail, leisure and health care remain among the most buoyant areas of
activity for the UK construction industry,' Mr Brant says.

FT  25 OCT 93 / People: Former Securiguard duo move into Business Technology
Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Baldwin, former chairman of Securiguard before it was acquired by
Rentokil this summer, has been appointed chairman and chief executive of
Business Technology Group, which sells and services office equipment.
He succeeds Tony Berry, founder and former chairman of Blue Arrow, who has
resigned from BTG to pursue private interests but retains his 8 per cent
interest in the group.
Baldwin says he and Peter Dunckley, former finance director of Securiguard
who is also joining BTG, had been approached as a team by Tony Berry and his
board. He says he sees BTG as a 'platform from which to develop in the
service sector'. He will, however, be somewhat restricted in his areas of
operation by an agreement with Rentokil which lasts until the end of 1994,
but says 'there are opportunities'.
Baldwin's defence against Rentokil's cash bid earned him a number of friends
in City institutions who watched Securiguard's share price rise from 180p
before the bid, to the 345p at which it was recommended.
In July Baldwin accepted a Pounds 375,000 settlement from Rentokil after the
Pounds 76m takeover and said it was his intention to acquire companies.
A non-executive director, Bernard Goodall, has resigned and a replacement
for him will be appointed in due course.
BTG's share price rose 4p to 23p.

Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities has hired David Cohen, a City

Cohen knows all about bull and bear markets, having started out in the City
in 1962 as an electricals analyst at Simon &amp; Coates, the now defunct UK
stockbroker. In 1969, at the age of 27, he became one of the youngest-ever
partners in the firm.
By 1984 he had built up such a reputation for bringing companies to the USM
that the FT ran a profile on him. In the same year he was one of the senior
partners who presided over the sale of S&amp;C to Chase Manhattan Bank.
For the past 3 1/2 years, Cohen has headed the smaller companies corporate
broking unit at Robert Fleming Securities, where his biggest claim to fame
was managing the flotation earlier this year of David Lloyd Leisure, the
tennis and fitness chain run by the former Davis Cup player.

FT  25 OCT 93 / People: Siemens' Dolan signals to Cowes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems is one of the largest employers in Cowes,
Isle of Wight, but whether Clive Dolan, the company's new managing director,
will have much time to indulge in his hobby of sailing is open to question.
Dolan took over the company, which has offices spread over the south of
England with outposts in New York and Germany, at the beginning of the
month. With 3,500 people worldwide and sales of Pounds 300m, it is the UK
arm of Siemens' defence electronics group.
His principal challenge is to find new opportunities for growth in a company
traditionally tied to the now declining defence market.
Dolan's most recent experience should prove invaluable. Since 1991 he has
been managing director of Siemens' newly formed air traffic management
division, the fastest growing part of the group.
Siemens Plessey has special skills in multifunction radar - a new kind of
system which can combine surveillance, tracking and targeting in a single
instrument through ingenious electronic control of the sensing beam. It is
also bidding with Racal for 'Bowman', the next generation British Army
communications system.
Dolan, 47, read applied science at Newcastle University and worked initially
for Marconi and Philips with spells in France and the Netherlands, during
which he rather took to the continental way of life. He has been with
Plessey since 1983 and was involved in repulsing GEC's first bid for the
company. But he has no intention of letting work get in the way of the
occasional game of rugby, he says.

a Buddhist shrine.
Thirty of the company's Northern Ireland staff will be drafted in to
supervise the project which will employ up to 700 workers. It is expected
that completion of work will take 16 months.
Mr Henry Johnston, Mivan overseas managing director, said: 'We are delighted

FT  25 OCT 93 / Management (Tips from the top): The four principles of
corporate giving - Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, executive chairman of Kingfisher,
offers advice on selecting good causes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIR GEOFFREY MULCAHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are more than 170,000 registered charities in the UK and many of them,
in marketing terms, have advanced some way beyond the box-rattling stage.
Alongside this growing sophistication of demand is our corporate need to
make donations work positively for us. So we have had to think clearly about
what we are doing in this department and why.
In many companies charitable involvement is moving out of the chairman's
office - where it took the shape of the traditional chairman's fund - and
into the marketing and human resources departments.
Certainly, the causes backed by Kingfisher have a wider scope and sharper
focus than they did 10 years ago. We have moved from the idea of 'charitable
donations', through 'community investment' to 'corporate social
responsibility', which embraces issues such as employment practices and the
environment.
Underpinning our policy is the belief that a healthy business needs a
healthy community. Policy is directed by a social responsibility committee,
which includes our corporate affairs and human resources directors, as well
as one of our non-executive directors, Lady Howe. It meets quarterly and
each of our businesses reports to it twice a year.
As a group, Kingfisher spent around Pounds 1.3m on social responsibility
programmes in 1992. One of the things our strategy has to do is take account
of the individual needs of our relatively devolved business units, while
maintaining an overall corporate shape and consistency.
We have four guiding principles. The first and firmest is that any issue we
support must be relevant to our mainstream commercial objectives. It may be
by addressing social problems which ultimately affect our profitability, for
example, or by improving our corporate reputation. We support crime
prevention because this ties in with the high street environment. The safer
people feel, the more likely they are to come out and shop.
The second principle is that we are very clear about the target audiences we
are trying to reach. While our businesses will focus cause-related marketing
on their customers, our audiences at the centre include opinion formers,
shareholders, employees and national and local government. We support
women's issues, because two-thirds of our employees are women. We are also
active on critical health issues and education, because these too affect our
employees.
Principle number three is to limit ourselves to a manageable number of
issues instead of trying to cover the field.
Finally we try to build up a leadership position, to give us a competitive
edge with particular target audiences. This may be by anticipating issues
that will become important, or by not shrinking from those that may prove
controversial. We are helping, for example, to fund a Stonewall study on
attitudes of and towards gay men and lesbians in the workplace.
It is important to recognise that the objectives of a voluntary organisation
are different to those of a commercial one. The essence of successful
projects is to identify the mutual benefit for each of those involved and
then for them to work in partnership. Once we have identified a particular
cause - such as homelessness or equal opportunities - choice of project
becomes the next key step. This is as important as the choice of charity,
which must be well-run and have an acceptable brand.
We will ask ourselves how material the project is to our business
objectives. How innovative is it? What value can we add? How much support do
they want, relative to what we can afford? We will look at the quality of
the organisation's management and operating plan and at how they will
evaluate and report back. We may also seek the attitudes of the relevant
government department.
Pressure from public figures and other business people to support pet
projects can be considerable. Where the project has no relevance to our
commercial objectives, policy dictates we should decline, but some
occasionally sneak through. I'd prefer not to list them here]

FT  25 OCT 93 / Management: The Russians are coming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British-based companies seeking to develop their sales or establish an
operating presence in Russia, the Ukraine and the other independent
republics could do worse than contact Philip Crossland.
The ex-chairman of Racal Chubb - he left the group in April last year - is
running a scheme aimed at training young managers from the former Soviet
Union.
Similar to an initiative organised by the Koerber Foundation in Hamburg, it
has three elements:
Selection process followed by English language instruction and proficiency
testing in Moscow (funded by the Reforms Management Foundation, a Moscow
institute).
Management instruction in the UK. A seven-week course at Kingston University
designed to provide participants with a solid foundation in the theory and
practice of management and an understanding of the market economy.
Secondment to a western company for approximately three to nine months.
The first 10 managers - whose backgrounds are a mixture of industrial and
commercial - have just completed the first part of their course. They are
now set to join the participating companies, which include National Power,
Sea Containers, Bristol Myers Squibb, the Wellcome Foundation, and the
Anglo/French computing services group Sema.
Crossland, who says the benefit for companies will be a greater
understanding of business opportunities in the new states, is eager to hear
from potential sponsors. His aim is within two years to match the Koerber
Foundation, which will have 80 Russian graduates passing through its doors
in 1993. 'We are dealing with western companies which already have
operations in Russia, or who just see Russia as a prospective market,' he
explains, 'but we are happy to consider companies which have a joint venture
and want to put one of their own Russians through the programme.'
Crossland can be contacted on 0420-87251 (Fax 0420-541067)

FT  25 OCT 93 / Management: A meeting of minds - Christopher Lorenz sheds
fresh light on strategic alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Common sense would seem to support Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British
Airways, in his declaration that a strategic alliance between two companies
is more likely to last if at least one of them has an equity stake in the
other.
It would appear obvious that such a link not only increases the partner's
influence, but also makes it more likely that both sides will make an
all-out effort to resolve any problems which arise, rather than just
abandoning their collaboration.
Sir Colin's comment was made in response to this month's deal between
Lufthansa and United Airlines. Initially, this is merely a marketing
arrangement. But United's redoubtable boss, Stephen Wolf, seems to agree
with Marshall, since he wants to buy shares in the struggling German airline
when it is privatised next year.
Whatever the past experience of BA and United may be - including an abortive
attempt to ally with each other - their bosses are seriously misguided on
the matter, according to Jordan Lewis.
Lewis is an alliance expert who flies constantly around the world from his
Washington base advising large companies how to get together, repair a shaky
relationship, or end it with the minimum of pain. His hands-on book on
alliance management, Partnerships for Profit, has been translated into 10
languages, including Japanese. *
Among a catalogue of general misconceptions about how to mount, manage and
protect alliances, Lewis rates the 'equity stake' issue pretty high. Its
popularity with many airlines 'reflects a misunderstanding of alliances', he
says.
The truth, he claims, is that 'alliances survive as long as each company
regards the other as its best partner. Many equity alliances have ended,
usually because that condition was no longer met. But many non-equity
alliances have continued for years because it continued to be met'. One
instance is the link between GE of America and France's Snecma in aero
engines, which is now more than 20 years old.
Lewis's comments were made just after the Lufthansa-United announcement, at
a two-day Management Centre Europe briefing on alliances.
His other tips included the following points:
Mutual need. Controversially, Lewis says this is much more important than
who controls an alliance. Each partner must take what steps it can to ensure
that the other continues to need it.
Shared objectives. Most companies are used only to buy-sell relationships.
In alliances, they must agree clearly 'on what they intend to maximise
together'.
Shared risk. Both (or all) partners must accept the bearing of a
considerable degree of shared risk - it cannot be loaded onto one partner,
'as in other commercial relationships'. The risks can be personal, as well
as economic.
Relationships and trust. These are at the heart of the success of an
alliance, 'but companies don't invest nearly enough effort in building them
 -which takes years'. Many partners don't realise the need for investing in
relationships until they hit a significant problem, says Lewis. 'They don't
think that way - they think in terms of deals.'
Trust starts between the people immediately involved, 'and hopefully spreads
slowly into both organisations'. Hence Lewis's insistence, in contrast with
other alliance consultants, that it is impossible to put everything on paper
at the start. 'You can't write contracts about enthusiasm', he says. 'You
need a keen, two-company team. But I don't see that very often'. 'When GE
and Snecma got started, there were only two people who trusted each other,
but they gradually buried this deeper and deeper in each organisation'.
Disputes. Partners should agree at the start that 'tough issues' can and
must be raised with the other side.
Exit strategy. This also should be negotiated upfront, in case mutual need
disappears, or the shared objectives change. 'Otherwise you end in court'.
Lewis's emphasis on deep relationships should not be taken as advocacy of
links between parent companies, such as the almost barren one between
Daimler Benz and Mitsubishi. He warns that 'corporate-to-corporate alliances
are a mistake - they should be between business units'.
Extolling the general advantages of what he calls 'alliance-thinking', Lewis
says it 'forces companies to focus themselves - you can't be good at
everything'. It reinforces the growing tendency of managements to narrow the
definition of their companies' 'core competences', and to 'outsource' or
'partner' the rest of their activities.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Economics: European statistics in focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a busy week for European economic figures with several statistics
likely to throw light on the state of the recession afflicting many European
Community countries.
Most economists are forecasting that German inflation in October fell below
4 per cent. Import price figures are also out this week and are expected to
reflect the appreciation of the D-Mark which has led to virtually continuous
import price deflation.
In France unemployment figures on Friday will highlight the wisdom of last
week's French rate cut by nudging closer to 12 per cent. France has one of
the highest rates of unemployment among OECD countries. The jobless total
has risen by an average of more than 30,000 a month since the start of the
year.

FT  25 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group in the latter stages of a three-year
restructuring, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds
48m on Monday. Now that the group is better managed, cash is being generated
and its balance sheet is under control, investors will focus on whether BET
has yet formulated a plan that will inject some more excitement into its
portfolio of businesses.
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, reports full-year results on Thursday.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits to come in at between Pounds 640m and Pounds
690m, compared with Pounds 504m last year. The company will benefit
substantially from favourable exchange rates, so attention will be focused
on underlying sales growth. Of particular interest will be the progress of
Zovirax, the shingles and herpes treatment that is Wellcome's best-selling
medicine.
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports its
third-quarter results on Thursday. The group is expected to report pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds 70m during a difficult three
months. Demand on the continent was slow during August, and recovery in the
UK and US has been hesitant.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Lords attack EC packaging scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY proposals on packaging could lead to 'waste mountains' of
unwanted recycled materials, a Lords committee warns today.
A directive drawn up by the European Commission would set recycling targets
without taking into account whether the saved materials were useful.
The Lords committee on the EC report on packaging and packaging waste calls
instead for a tax on packaging with funds raised going towards environmental
improvements.
Taxes, such as a packaging charge levied by producers, could be used to
encourage a reduction in the amount of wrapping used for each item.
But they rule out charging individual households for the collection of their
rubbish, saying this could have a harmful effect on the environment.
Germany comes under attack for dumping its surplus recycled paper and
plastics in Britain and other EC countries at below cost.
The report also criticises the proposed EC directive for imposing
unreasonable restrictions on the use of landfill and incineration and giving
too high a priority to recycling when this was not best for the environment.
It says that while there is a clear case for recycling steel and aluminium,
plastic is less useful because it can be difficult to recycle.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Heseltine in talks with TV chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has called together
Britain's leading broadcasters to try to draw up a co-ordinated industrial
and export strategy for the industry.
Those invited include Mr John Birt, the director-general of the BBC, Mr Greg
Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend
Television, Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Mr Michael
Green, chairman of Carlton Communications and Independent Television News,
and Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television.
The meeting to be held on November 3 will be divided into three parts
looking at programme production, distribution, and technology and research.
It symbolises a sea change in the government's attitude to UK broadcasting.
It contrasts with a notorious meeting in 1987 when Baroness Thatcher, the
then prime minister, denounced ITV as 'the last bastion of restrictive
practices'.
In contrast the emphasis of next week's meeting will be to encourage the
export potential of a UK industry seen as high quality and internally
competitive. Mr Heseltine's search for an industrial and export strategy
could have policy implications for ITV and the BBC.
The big ITV companies arguing for changes in ownership rules to allow the
largest nine ITV companies to take each other over see Mr Heseltine as a
likely ally. They say ITV is too fragmented to compete internationally.
Meanwhile, the National Heritage Department has proposed the BBC licence fee
should be linked to retail prices for three years.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Entrepreneur avoids advance-fee disaster: What happened to a
young businessman when he tried to raise funding for his computer company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NAJAM Ul-Hasan Kidwai, fresh out of university, was one of the lucky
ones. Like most of Turnberry Underwriter's customers he paid them a retainer
to procure finance. Unlike many others, he managed to reclaim his fee.
Within days of being put in contact with Turnberry, Mr Kidwai, 24, found
himself embroiled in a saga which took him from the sober setting of
Sunderland to Miami's flashy financial districts where businessmen
hypnotised him with talk of multi-million pound loan schemes.
Mr Kidwai's story begins with Cybereye, a computer development company he
set up earlier this year to exploit the potential for virtual reality in the
medical, education and computer-aided design fields. Cybereye needed cash to
take its ideas from the drawing board to reality.
With little prospect of help through conventional means - largely because of
his youth and lack of a track record, according to those who turned him down
for financing - Mr Kidwai turned to classified advertisements in national
newspaper columns. Here he came across EFG, a New York company which acts as
an agent for Turnberry.
Mr Kidwai was asked to fly to Miami to discuss his business proposal with a
team from Turnberry. Mr Kidwai was impressed by Turnberry's image. The plush
Miami office was sited next to US investment bank Smith Barney.
The next day, after examining his business plan, Turnberry offered to
syndicate Dollars 8m in funding for Cybereye in return for a retainer of
Dollars 100,000. The retainer, to cover Turnberry's costs, was to be held in
escrow by a Florida solicitor, Mr Jerrell Breslin. It has emerged that at
that time Mr Breslin was under investigation by the FBI. He has since been
arrested and charged with conspiring to sell US Treasury bonds stolen from a
New York savings bank. He is on bail.
Mr Kidwai was told that Turnberry could provide collateral in the form of
treasury bills, cash or other instruments which would allow Cybereye to
raise a one-year bank loan of Dollars 8m. However, the security would not be
available until the UK company had arranged a letter of credit payable to
Turnberry for Dollars 1.5m - or 20 per cent of the total loan. This was to
be Turnberry's return for providing the collateral.
At the end of the year, if Cybereye was unable to repay the loan, the
collateral would belong to the lending bank. But Cybereye's ability to repay
the loan would be virtually guaranteed by a flotation of 35 per cent of the
company on a Latin American stock exchange arranged through a financial
company introduced by Turnberry, Les Mersky Associates. The financial
company would be able to float the stock at whatever price it wished and
keep anything in excess of Dollars 8m.
Mr Kidwai was unaware that Mr Leslie Mersky, of Les Mersky Associates, was
president of Turnberry. Nor did he know that Mr Mersky, like Mr Breslin, was
under investigation for alleged fraud, this time by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Last year Mr Mersky and several others were accused of
allegedly distri-buting and manipulating shares in a shell corporation,
which was said to have made a fraudulent stock offering. The case is still
pending.
Mr Kidwai believed the deal he was being offered was flawless. For a mere
Dollars 100,000 he would get a one-year bridging loan. Turnberry would get
Dollars 1.6m, including the retainer, out of the Dollars 8m loan and the
collateral would revert to the US company after a year.
Cybereye, which only ever intended to draw down Dollars 1m of the Dollars 8m
facility, would be able to repay the loan through proceeds raised by the
flotation. Cybereye's bankers also had a gold-plated guarantee, since they
would hold collateral provided by Turnberry worth Dollars 8m, and could
foreclose after a year if the loan was not repaid from the flotation
proceeds. Further comfort was taken from the fact that only Dollars 2.6m of
the Dollars 8m facility would be drawn in the year.
However, this was a deal which - even given an unusually extended deadline
for completion of 40 days - proved impossible to complete. While Cybereye
managed to find bankers prepared to issue the letter of guarantee and
provide the banking loan, everything hinged on proving that the collateral
was ready to be transferred. No bank would issue a letter of credit to
Turnberry until it was sure the collateral was on its way.
Cybereye's bank contacted the Guardian Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd, a
private bank based in the Cayman Islands, which it had been told was
Turnberry's bankers. It was informed over the phone that funds for the
collateral were available. But the bank needed more precise details before
releasing the letter of credit. It sought reassurance that Turnberry's
collateral came from 'good, clean funds of non-criminal origin, and that
this statement was issued under the penalty of perjury'. But Turnberry
insisted there was 'no bank in the world . . . who can legitimately' make
such a statement.
Several attempts by Cybereye and its bankers to find a compromise to end the
deadlock were rejected by Turnberry. It soon became apparent that no deal
would be completed in the time allowed.
Mr Kidwai, frustrated by repeated fruitless attempts to contact Turnberry
and faced with the almost certain loss of his Dollars 100,000 retainer,
contacted the authorities. He issued a letter headed 'fraud alert'
containing his account of his dealings with Turnberry, Mr Breslin, Guardian
Bank &amp; Trust (Cayman) Ltd, and Les Mersky. Guardian Bank &amp; Trust (Cayman)
Ltd then threatened Mr Kidwai with legal action unless he retracted the
statements made in the letter. Mr Kidwai demanded the return of his retainer
from Turnberry who notified him he was in default of the agreement, which
would result in the loss of his retainer. Mr Kidwai eventually issued a
retraction and his retainer was returned.
Today Mr Kidwai is still searching for a backer. The months of delay in
negotiating with Turnberry have almost crippled his company, which operates
out of the Industry Centre in Sunderland University. But he is determined
not to give up, nor to let others get into the difficulties which he so
narrowly avoided.
Other companies in the US and UK have had similar experiences with
Turnberry. Such difficulties have now attracted the interest of the FBI and
UK authorities, who are investigating Turnberry's activities.

FT  25 OCT 93 / FBI probes financing company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US COMPANY being investigated by the FBI and Florida authorities is
offering to help cash-strapped companies in the UK and Ireland raise
finance.
Turnberry Underwriters, which now appears to be operating out of Miami,
Florida, under the name Bond Street Commercial, has been offering to provide
UK and Irish companies with collateral for bank loans in return for a
payment described as a retainer.
This is similar to an advance fee for the procurement of expected finance,
which is illegal in Florida but not in the UK.
US authorities estimate that Turnberry, and companies and people associated
with it, have taken up to Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) in retainers from
companies in the US. They believe that companies outside the US, principally
in the UK and Ireland, have paid a further Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m in
retainers.
British authorities are investigating Turnberry and its associates in
conjunction with the FBI following complaints to the Serious Fraud Office.
The Financial Times has talked to companies which paid retainers of between
Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 140,000, in the expectation that the US group
would put up collateral against which they could procure finance. However,
the deals were never completed within the time allotted. In most cases known
to the FT, the companies were alleged to be in default and the retainer was
kept by Turnberry, in accordance with the agreement.
At least two people involved in the fundraising schemes are facing fraud
charges in the US on separate matters.
Turnberry has been put in touch with prospective clients by agencies which
have placed advertisements in the business sections of national newspapers,
both in the US and UK. These advertisements have proved particularly
attractive to small companies which are desperate for finance.
In one case, Turnberry did repay a Dollars 100,000 retainer to a UK company,
Cybereye, after it agreed to withdraw a 'fraud alert' it had previously
circulated to banking regulators in the Cayman Islands and accountants,
bankers and fraud authorities around the world.
Banking regulators in the Cayman Islands are now investigating Turnberry's
relationship with some of the directors of a bank in their region, Guardian
Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd, including its chairman Mr John Mathewson.

FT  25 OCT 93 / BBC plans bi-media staff shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is pushing ahead with plans to make news and current affairs staff
interchangeable between radio and television through the creation of a
single management structure.
Mr Peter Bell, now editor of television news programmes, will from the
beginning of January head all news programmes across radio and television.
A new bi-media head of all weekly programmes will be appointed later this
year.
Mr Tony Hall, managing director of news and current affairs, believes the
move will increase efficiency and get more programmes made for the same
money.
He added: 'There is no increase in management at all. We have re-allocated
people's tasks.'
Mr Hall became convinced of the wisdom of the bi-media approach the night Mr
John Major won the Conservative leadership battle.
A television outside-broadcast unit and a radio car were simultaneously
dispatched to cover the story. The radio car broke down and the OB unit
provided the necessary sound interviews.
Mr Hall believes the bi-media policy will lead to 'a free market in ideas'
throughout BBC news and current affairs and improve strategic planning
across both radio and television.
With investigative stories the most appropriate medium will be chosen, he
said. A successful radio programme could lead to a television programme.
'I don't see this approach happening at ITV. No one else can do this,' said
Mr Hall.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Scots urge curb on Norwegian salmon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALMON farmers in Scotland and the Irish Republic want their governments
this week to persuade the European Commission to take action against Norway
to stem a flood of Norwegian salmon on to the EC market.
In the past three weeks the price of salmon in EC countries has fallen
sharply. Salmon farmers in Scotland mainly blame an influx of Norwegian
salmon caused by unexpectedly high production in Norway.
The crisis is a re-emergence of the problem caused by Norway's dominant
position in European salmon production. The issue is complicated by the fact
that Norway is not a member of the EC, but has applied to join.
In 1991 the EC temporarily imposed a minimum price on salmon imports from
Norway. Norwegian salmon output was cut by measures to take surplus fish off
the EC market and reduce production. Many Norwegian salmon farmers went
bankrupt.
Norwegian output this year may reach 180,000 tonnes, according to the
Scottish Salmon Growers Association, compared with original predictions of
120,000 tonnes.
About 35,000 tonnes of Norwegian salmon have come on to the EC market
recently, pushing prices down from Pounds 3.80 per kilogramme - at which
salmon farming is very profitable - to less than Pounds 2.50.
Scottish salmon output is also expected to rise this year to 45,000 tonnes
compared with last year's 38,000 tonnes.
The Scottish and Irish salmon producers are urging their governments to
persuade the European Commission to limit the tonnage of salmon that can be
imported into the EC from Norway. British and Irish officials are expected
to meet the commission on Thursday.
The collapse in salmon prices is also causing concern in Norway because of
the threat it poses to fish farmers.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Barclays to launch direct-mail venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, Britain's biggest bank, is setting up a company to produce
direct-mail marketing material for other companies. The bank will use the
computer hardware and software it employs to send information to its own
customers.
The move is part of an effort by its computer operations division to earn
money by offering 'facilities management' to other businesses. Earlier this
year it made a bid to provide computing services to the Department of
Transport.
Barclays is to run the operation from its print works at Gloucester, one of
its three computing centres. The company, called Edotech, will use IBM print
technology and software, and IBM will also help market the company.
Mr Bruce Hotter, managing director of Barclays computer operations, said
advances in software meant that it could print higher-quality statements and
invoices which include customised marketing material.
Edotech is to start with 28 IBM laser printers, but Mr Hotter said that if
there was enough demand from other companies, it would invest in additional
capacity rather than simply offering facilities it was not itself using.
Mr Hotter said Barclays hoped that Edotech would be a way of 'coming round
the back door' to companies which might want other computer facilities
management services, and could be persuaded to consider this by a print
contract.
He said the company would aim to sell services to companies which already
had mailing programmes. These would include direct-marketing agencies,
financial-services companies and local and central government agencies.
Barclays failed to win the contract to buy DVOIT, the company which provides
computer services to the Department of Transport and executive agencies, but
Mr Hotter said it was likely to bid for other government contracts next
year.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Employers fear rise in industrial unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE in six of Britain's largest and mostly unionised private-sector
employers expect to see industrial conflict in their companies during the
next 12 months, says a survey published today by Dibb, Lupton and Broomhead,
the solicitors.
'Employers fear a marked increase in industrial unrest as the economy pulls
out of recession,' said Mr Paul Nicholls, head of the firm's employment
team. While 16.4 per cent anticipated industrial unrest in their companies
over the next 12 months, 82 per cent did not.
As many as 98.4 per cent of companies surveyed thought it useful to have the
option of using the law in an industrial dispute, and the government had
'got it about right' in its labour legislation. But 90.2 per cent preferred
to resolve disputes through negotiation rather than using the law.
A third of the companies surveyed said they would consider using the
provisions in this year's Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act that
permit the offer of financial inducements for workers to leave their union.
Large employers are prepared to use the law against unofficial strikes - 95
per cent they would do so to stop unlawful picketing. The survey covered 100
large private-sector companies employing a total of 1.5m workers.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Barclays sets up direct-mail venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS, Britain's biggest bank, is setting up a company to produce
direct-mail marketing material for other companies. The bank will use the
computer hardware and software it employs to send information to its own
customers.
The move is part of an effort by its computer operations division to earn
money by offering 'facilities management' to other businesses. Earlier this
year it made a bid to provide computing services for the Department of
Transport.
Barclays is to run the operation from its print works at Gloucester, one of
its three computing centres. The company, called Edotech, will use IBM print
technology and software, and IBM will also help market the company.
Mr Bruce Hotter, managing director of Barclays computer operations, said
software advances meant that it could print higher-quality statements and
invoices which include customised marketing material.
Mr Hotter said Barclays hoped that Edotech would be a way of 'coming round
the back door' to companies which might want other computer facilities
management services, and could be persuaded to consider this by a print
contract.
He said the company would aim to sell services to companies which already
had mailing programmes.

FT  25 OCT 93 / A few home truths from Clarke's backyard: Michael Cassell
listens to the advice being offered to the chancellor by his Nottinghamshire
constituents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE can dismiss the pre-Budget petitioning of his 'seven wise
men'. As for the avalanche of advice from 57 varieties of vested interest -
who needs it?
But if the chancellor wants a few home truths before Budget day, he knows
where to go to have his ear bent: to his own Nottinghamshire constituency of
Rushcliffe and to Mr Ray Cook, a 64-year-old retired bank manager rich in
anecdotes and homespun philosophy. Like his MP, Mr Cook speaks his mind.
'You couldn't have a better person pulling the cart; he can take the flak.
But he must cut interest rates, concentrate on measures to help wealth
creation, then take a deep breath and wait for the benefits of the upturn to
work through.
'There is no point in imposing extra taxes now and wrecking the recovery
just to start paying off the interest on Pounds 50bn worth of debt. The only
real way to cut the deficit is to get the economy growing.'
Mr Cook has more than a passing interest in the chancellor's performance,
given his role as leader of Rushcliffe borough council.
The councillor's call for a 'softly softly' Budget - he has known Mr Clarke
for 20 years - wins widespread support across the constituency, representing
157 square miles of rich farmland and busy villages which stretch south and
east from the Trent Bridge county cricket ground on the edge of Nottingham.
Last year its voters gave Mr Clarke a near-21,000 majority. These from the
Cuckoo Bush pub in Gotham to the Fish Bar in Ruddington, where locals claim
the chancellor has queued for his fix of chips, are telling Mr Clarke to lay
off.
Rushcliffe - 'all fur coats and Waterford crystal' to its neighbours - has
not been as badly savaged by recession as many other areas. White-collar
redundancies have helped push up unemployment to about 9 per cent, although
it is twice that level in Nottingham.
Earlier this year, however, the Cotgrave pit - which a decade ago employed
nearly 2,000 people - mined its last coal, and miners have left the area or
signed on.
But there are some indications that employers in Rushcliffe are again
recruiting, that shops are busier and that a housing market which avoided
the full horrors of the slump has started to move. Mr Jim Collinson, a
member of Rushcliffe's planning team, said: 'Architects have been sitting on
their hands for two years but now they are getting lots of inquiries.
Development plans are being dusted off.'
Recovery, however, remains a fragile affair which the locals believe could
easily be smashed by too heavy a hand from the ordinary
bloke-turned-chancellor who lives out along the Melton Road.
'He must not meddle. There is an improvement under way but the picture
remains very mixed and vulnerable,' said Mr John Moy, finance director of
NSK-RHP (Europe), the Japanese-owned bearings manufacturer. The company
recently announced that Ruddington is to be home for its European
headquarters and sales organisation, a decision which could mean more than
170 new jobs.
Mr Moy added: 'We need still lower interest rates to help maintain new
levels of investment. Our domestic sales are up but there are big problems
in Europe. We need continuity. Mr Clarke must do nothing to upset shaky
confidence.'
Mr Alec McKee, managing director of the UK arm of John Deere, the US
agricultural equipment makers, based in the village of Langar, said:
'Uncertainty is the enemy of investment.'
Mr McKee reports a 20 per cent increase in sales this year but remains
uncertain about recovery: 'At this stage, any increase in the tax burden,
direct or indirect, will be harmful to consumer demand. The less Mr Clarke
does in the short term the better.'
He said the temporary improvement in capital allowances announced in the
last Budget should be maintained, but insists interest rates have fallen far
enough.
The 'hands off interest rates' campaign is joined by Mr John Wood, a
Cotgrave resident, Tory party activist, fabric manufacturer and master of
the Worshipful Company of Glovers.
Mr Wood, who helped select Mr Clarke for the Rushcliffe seat in 1970, says
lower interest rates would not help British companies sell in important
European markets where customers are not buying.
Outside the post office in Clifton, a neat thatched village, Mrs Audrey
Welling, a Tory-voting retired legal clerk, is one of many to round on the
chancellor's plans for putting value added tax on heating fuel.
She said: 'He will commit suicide. People will remember every time they pay
the bill. The government will live to regret it even more than us.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Industry will argue against tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS are expected to put more pressure on the government this week
to refrain from increasing taxes in next month's Budget on the grounds that
this would damage faltering signs of an upturn.
The message is to be delivered at a private meeting on Thursday between
Treasury and Department of Trade and Industry officials and representatives
of about 20 companies including Grand Metropolitan, TI, Unigate, Marks and
Spencer, J. Sainsbury, British Steel and Barclays Bank.
The gathering is expected to feature arguments that any rise in taxes in the
November 30 Budget, coming on top of tax increases of nearly Pounds 7bn
already announced for next April, might damage confidence and delay the
recovery.
Two Treasury officials at the meeting will relay any substantive messages to
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Government figures on Friday showed that the pace of growth in non-oil gross
domestic product slowed in the third quarter of this year.
Chairman of Thursday's gathering will be Mr Walter Eltis, economic adviser
to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. It is being held
as part of a general effort by the government to form closer links with
companies to follow better their perceptions about the recovery.
The most senior person from the business world will be Mr David Barnes,
chief executive of Zeneca, formerly the speciality chemicals subsidiary of
ICI. Northern Foods, the Weir pumpmaking company, ICL, Rover and the Meggitt
engineering group are due to send their finance directors. Other businesses
to be represented at the meeting are Courtaulds Textiles, George Wimpey and
the Post Office.
Executives from the companies involved have fed data to Mr Eltis to enable
him to gain a better feel of the recovery independently of the Treasury.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, who has been closely
involved with Mr Eltis's project, said he was 'extremely nervous' about the
recovery. Mr Martin Beer, a Unigate executive, said the business world was
worried about tax increases.
Mr Clarke is meeting Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation
of British Industry, and Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, at the Treasury
on Wednesday to hear their ideas for his Budget strategy. They are expected
to add to warnings about how tax rises could harm business.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Building chiefs warn of job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 100,000 further jobs could be lost in the construction industry if
next month's Budget fails to maintain capital spending, industry leaders
have warned.
Mr Ian Dixon, chairman of the Construction Industry Council, and Mr Tony
Jackson, chairman of the Construction Industry Employers Council, said the
'unique spectre' of a second Budget in one year had restricted the
industry's recovery.
They said any improvement in this recovery was so fragile that it could
easily be shattered if there were signs of reductions in capital spending.
'More time is needed for the private sector to recover,' they said.
Employment in the construction industry has fallen by more than 500,000
since the middle of 1989.
They also warned that the prospect of private-sector finance going into
public works was still distant, although the idea was strongly supported by
the industry.
There were fears in the industry that privately funded schemes might be seen
as an opportunity to replace publicly financed infrastructure projects, when
they should be used to accelerate infrastructure improvement.
Meanwhile, the Federation of Master Builders reported a small improvement in
workloads in its third-quarter state of trade survey.
It said 18 per cent of companies reported an increase in work, 55 per cent
stayed at the same level, and 27 per cent recorded a decrease. The
second-quarter figures were 15, 55 and 30 per cent respectively.
Mr Ted Evans, national president, said the improvement came mainly among
companies doing repair and maintenance work.
He added: 'However, the reports of improvement are so lean and patchy that
little or no encouragement can be drawn from the figures.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Portillo hints at end to universal state pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR hint that a future Conservative government might phase out the
universal state pension yesterday reopened the debate in Mr John Major's
government about the future of the welfare state.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned that on present
trends the growth of welfare provision would 'crush' the wealth-creating
sectors of the economy.
In an interview on BBC Television, the rightwing cabinet minister called
also for a greater role for private-sector insurance companies in assuming
responsibilities now accepted by the government.
Asked about reports that the government wanted to cut the social security
budget by obliging home-owners to take out mortgage indemnity insurance, he
said: 'I don't believe that the state should be in the business of offering
individuals insurance that they could get in the outside world and I think
that is one of the areas where we have got to move.'
Mr Portillo said the government must seek to tilt back the balance between
state and individual responsibility for the well-being of the old.
He was careful to stress that the 'entitlements' to state pensions already
built up by individuals at work could never be swept away. The government is
committed to preserving universal pensions during the present parliament.
But he offered a clear hint that those at the beginning of their working
careers should be expected to make private provision for their old age.
Referring to the expected increase of pensioners to 13m or 14m during the
early 21st century, he said: 'I don't think the state can be there to do
everything.'
Mr Portillo, developing the theme of greater individual responsibility he
set out at the Conservative party conference earlier this month, suggested
that the reform during the 1980s of the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme could be a model for more radical change.
He gave implicit backing to the idea that individuals might opt out of the
basic state pension as they can now do from Serps.
On the National Health Service, the chief secretary said the state would
find it impossible to keep up with 'infinite' demand. He said that the
government must not be 'dogmatic' about the line between public and private
provision.
Mr Portillo's remarks drew an immediate attack from Labour which accused him
of seeking to undermine the welfare state.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said: 'The crisis that the
Conservatives have created in the public finances is now being used as an
excuse to press on with their long-term objective of dismantling the welfare
state.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Lloyds cuts small business charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK yesterday announced it was cutting charges for small businesses.
About 350,000 such customers will see transaction charges cut by 13 per cent
from November 10.
Customers on the bank's standard business tariff will pay 65p for each debit
and credit item compared with the present charge of 75p.
Mr Mike Shaw, head of business banking, said: 'This is good news for most of
our small business customers. The changes are possible because of cost
reductions and other improvements in our internal efficiency.
'We have decided to share the benefits with our small business customers,
many of whom have been going through difficult times, but who have a vital
role to play in the economic recovery.'
Lloyds has also decided to introduce pre-notification of charges for small
businesses from January. Small businesses, defined by Lloyds as those with
annual turnover of up to Pounds 1m, will get a breakdown of transaction
charges and debit interest before they are debited to accounts.
At the same time Lloyds will drop the Pounds 4 charge on cheques returned
because of lack of funds. Charges for unauthorised overdrafts will be cut
and simplified and bankers' draft and electronic funds transfer payments
will also be made cheaper to small businesses.
The bank said: 'We have come under criticism. Niggling charges are being
streamlined or got rid of.'
Charges for larger businesses are not being altered.
Lloyds' move comes a month after Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, called in executives of the big four clearing banks and urged them
to do more to support small businesses.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Welsh business confidence grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELSH BUSINESSES remain optimistic in spite of clear signs that the recovery
is 'both fragile and modest', the Institute of Directors says today in its
latest bi-annual survey of the principality.
Mr Meirion Lewis, director of the institute in Wales, said: 'Although
conditions in Wales remain tight, the survey offers some glimpse of improved
company performance in Wales compared with the previous survey.
'There is some increase in profitability, a small rise in optimism and only
one in six are reporting company performance as unsatisfactory.'
The survey, which covers more than 100 companies in the principality, found
that the proportion showing a rise in business volume in the past six months
has risen sharply, with the increase most marked in manufacturing - up from
a third to 54 per cent. But nearly a third of manufacturers reported a
decline.
The number of companies reporting increased profits has almost doubled since
the previous survey, with profitability in the service sector showing
virtually no change.
Mr Lewis said that only one in eight of Welsh directors was less optimistic
than a year ago, and almost half of the directors surveyed expected improved
performance in the next six months. Half of the exporting companies were
more optimistic than they were a year ago.
There were also better prospects for employment, with 38 per cent of
manufacturers and 52 per cent of service-sector companies expecting to
increase staffing by 2 per cent during the next six months. There was a
substantial fall in the proportion of companies working at very low levels
of capacity.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Ministers may hasten end of gas monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT consultations on the gas market end this week amid expectations
that ministers will move faster to end the British Gas monopoly on domestic
supplies than the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has recommended.
There is, however, considerably less pressure for the government to accept
the commission's recommendation that the company be broken up.
The Department of Trade and Industry is likely to rule on the commission's
report later this year, although a delay is possible because of the
political sensitivities of a decision and the illness during the summer of
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Ministers are determined
that any adverse consequences of their decisions, particularly on prices, do
not coincide with the next general election due by April 1997.
The report recommended a timetable for ending the dominance of British Gas,
starting with divestment by the company by March 1997 of its supply arm and
abolition of its monopoly in the domestic market by 2002.
However, the DTI has always placed greater priority on introducing more
competition than breaking British Gas up. Ofgas, the industry regulator,
which once championed splitting up the company, also believes that
competition is more important.
The problem for the government with adopting the commission's approach is
that it may lead to price rises around the time of the next election. The
commission said the cost of a break-up, put by British Gas at Pounds 870m
over 10 years, should be met by consumers.
Introducing more competition, however, opens up the possibility of price
cuts to offset the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
Independent gas companies said last week that bills would fall by 8 per cent
as a result of ending British Gas's monopoly.
However, British Gas said many of its customers would face higher prices.
The government may therefore be tempted to put off full liberalisation until
the election. One possibility is that ministers will opt for 1998, when
households will also for the first time be able to choose from which company
to buy their electricity supplies.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Law lord urges cheaper justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAPER access to justice and a bill of rights to prevent governments
nibbling away at individual freedoms were called for yesterday by Lord
Woolf.
Speaking for the first time since he prompted controversy by attacking
government policies to get tough on crime as short-sighted and
irresponsible, the law lord said he believed British justice was basically
sound.
Lord Woolf, who carried out the official inquiry into prison riots in the
early 1980s, warned there were dangers in justice being too expensive. A
system of justice was fatally flawed if private citizens and the corporate
sector could not afford to invoke it, he said in a lecture to the
Association of Jewish Ex-Service Men and Women.
Pointing out that this year's bill for legal aid would approach Pounds
1.3bn, he said efforts should be made to make justice available at an
affordable price within existing resources.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Major rejects US view on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday re-opened the transatlantic war of words over the
west's approach to Bosnia by rejecting demands from Washington for a lifting
of the arms embargo, Philip Stephens writes.
In a brusque dismissal of recent public criticism by the US of Britain's
stance, the prime minister directly contradicted comments by President Bill
Clinton.
Mr Major denied he had told Mr Clinton that he would find it impossible to
sustain his government if he acceded to US requests to allow the resumption
of arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems. Instead he had simply pointed out
there was no political support for the idea in the UK.
Displaying some irritation, the prime minister suggested that criticism by
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, of Europe's role in
preserving international peace reflected the US administration's domestic
problems.
He said on BBC Television that a resumption of arms supplies to the warring
factions in the former Yugoslav province would add to the bloodshed. It
would also end the humanitarian aid effort.
He added: 'I believe the policy we are adopting in Bosnia is the right one.
I know it is controversial. That does not mean it is wrong. We have done
more in Bosnia than any other great nation and we will continue.'
Mr Major rejected suggestions that the difference over Bosnia had damaged
irreparably Britain's relationship with the Clinton administration.

THE NUMBER of women directors and executives has begun to creep up while the
number of accountants in these positions has dropped sharply, according to a
survey by Hemmington Scott, the corporate information publishers, Andrew
Jack writes.
Just 3.6 per cent of the 12,310 executives and officers of quoted companies
are women, although the proportion has increased from less than 2.7 per cent
four years ago. The number with fellowships of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales has declined from 1,721 to 1,448 over the
same period.
The number of directors and executives who are masters of business
administration has increased from none to more than 100 since 1989, with
Harvard proving the most popular of the business schools.
The most frequent jobs for women in senior business positions are in finance
and administration. There are 16 finance directors and a quarter of the
women identified are chief accountants or company secretaries. Nearly half
of the 442 women identified in the survey as in senior positions are board
members.
More than 700 directors are aged over 65, and 654 have been awarded some
form of honour.
