FT  25 OCT 93 / Lord Grimond dies of a stroke aged 80
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Grimond, who led the Liberal party for 11 years from 1956, died last
night aged 80. His family said at his Orkney home that he had died in
hospital from a stroke.
Last night Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: 'We have
lost a lion of the Liberal cause. Jo Grimond's death will be mourned by
millions who shared his beliefs and by all who value the strength of our
democracy and integrity in our politics.
'He brought the Liberal cause back from the verge of extinction, introduced
new ideas which have today become commonplace in the agenda of all parties
and inspired a whole new generation of liberal thinkers and activists.'
Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat MP for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale,
and a former Liberal leader, said: 'Jo Grimond brought me into politics and
he was the inspiration of an entire generation of Liberals.
'But his gift was that he reached out beyond the ranks of Liberals. His were
the grand themes of European integration and of Scottish self-government
within it.
'He was a great debunker of pomposity and bureaucracy, a cultivated man who
enjoyed literature and art and had a glorious sense of humour. I do not
believe that the Liberal party would have survived at all but for his
leadership in the late 50s when it was down to five MPs. We all owe him an
immense debt.'
Lord Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, said he was 'very
upset' at the death of his former adversary.
He added: 'Although he was an opponent in politics I always held him in very
considerable regard for his ability and indeed for his charm. I always liked
him very much indeed and admired him immensely.'
Lord Grimond, a barrister, entered parliament in 1950 as MP for Orkney and
Shetland. He held the seat for 33 years and became a life peer in 1983.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Howard set to ease police fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, is expected this week to go a
considerable way towards meeting the police objections to the Sheehy report
on police pay and conditions.
Senior police officers are confident that after their intensive lobbying of
the government, Mr Howard will dilute proposals on fixed contracts so that
they apply only to senior ranks, as at present. The report recommended an
initial 10-year contract, with subsequent five-yearly renewals.
Officers argue that bright candidates would be discouraged from applying to
police forces if they knew their initial appointments were to be for a fixed
period only.
Mr Howard is also likely to agree that the Sheehy criteria for
performance-related pay are too complex. Instead, a simpler scheme is
expected to be implemented.
Mr Howard will be concerned to defuse the concerns raised among police and
the public by the recommendations.
One fear among police officers is that any attempt by the government to try
to relate pay to performance, along the lines used in industry, could
backfire.
Many types of police work, such as those involving work in the community
rather than the pursuit or arrest of criminals, cannot be monitored in pure
performance terms, they argue.
In response to the proposals to streamline management, police groups have
said that many of the force's cumbersome administrative structures have
already been dismantled.
In a further attempt to head off some of the recommendations, Mr Paul
Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, has announced plans for a
shake-up of senior ranks at Scotland Yard. He said the quickest and most
cost-effective way of achieving this would be for the government to pay for
a redundancy scheme.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Hurd challenged on Malaysia aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR last night demanded that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, spell
out whether a Pounds 234m aid package for Malaysia had been linked to sales
of British military equipment.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the Commons should
investigate whether the aid - criticised last week in a report from the
National Audit Office - had been a quid pro quo for a Pounds 1bn arms order.
The public-spending watchdog's report said that Pounds 56m of public money
had been wasted in the funding of a hydro-electric project on the Pergau
river. Mr Hurd is to be called before the public accounts committee to
explain his decision to overrule official advice that the aid should not be
granted.
Last week he defended the 1991 decision on the basis of an 'understanding'
reached some years earlier with the Malaysian government that the aid would
be given.
He said that it would have been 'very damaging' to Britain's commercial and
political interests if he had broken the agreement.
The undertaking was given by Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister. In
1988 she personally negotiated the sale of Pounds 1bn worth of arms with Mr
Mahatir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, during a visit to Kuala
Lumpur.
The aid package was announced within weeks of the military deal and both
were discussed in the talks between the two leaders. Labour has long argued
that the price for the arms sales, which included 12 Tornado ground attack
aircraft, was the promise of assistance for the Pergau project.
Last night Mr Cunningham said: 'Mr Hurd appears to have clearly breached his
fiduciary duty over a very large amount of taxpayers' money. His action is
all the more questionable given the controversial nature of the Malaysian
project.'
He added: 'The House of Commons will want to investigate the reports that a
British aid decision was contingent upon a major British arms sale to
Malaysia.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Energy efficiency deteriorating in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S performance in using energy efficiently is showing signs of
deterioration after two decades of almost continual improvement, the
Association of Conservation for Energy has found in an analysis of
government statistics.
The 'energy ratio' - the amount of primary energy needed to produce a unit
of gross domestic product as measured by the Department of Trade and
Industry - declined every year but one between 1970 and 1989. But Mr Andrew
Warren, association director, said: 'Since 1989 there has been a 3.7 per
cent rise in the ratio.'
Ironically it was in 1989 that the government called for a 2 per cent annual
improvement in energy efficiency, against the average of 1 per cent.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Plans for ID cards attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is considering the introduction of identity cards to help
crack down on social security fraud totalling more than Pounds 1bn a year,
but has come up against strong opposition from civil liberties groups.
Although other European countries such as France and Germany have ID cards,
any discussion of their introduction in the UK has raised Orwellian visions
of the all-seeing, ever-prying state.
However, a recent poll carried out for the Police Federation showed that a
majority of Britons favoured some form of ID card system to help combat
crime.
Responding to weekend reports that Mr John Major, the prime minister,
favoured such a scheme, Liberty, the civil liberties group, said ID cards
could be used to discriminate against some sections of society.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP on the Commons social security committee, said
that the idea was part of the government's obsession with cutting social
security spending. He added: 'It is another smack of the Big Brother state.'
The Department of Social Security said there were no plans to bring in an ID
card system to help beat fraudsters, although this was being looked at as
one of a range of measures.
The Home Office, whose interests in any ID scheme would cover its impact on
crime, terrorism and immigration, also said nothing was planned immediately.
The DSS is tightening up anti-fraud procedures for payment of benefits.
These include redesigning books for each type of benefit to make these
harder to forge, and encouraging electronic transfer of funds directly into
bank accounts.
The DSS believes the last method, known as automatic credit transfer, is the
most effective against fraud; it is also cheap to administer. But recent
government proposals to highlight this option more clearly on benefit books
raised strong concern about the possible closure of local Post Offices.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Power companies warned on long-term deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER COMPANIES have been criticised by the industry's regulator over
attempts to tie customers to long-term contracts in the run-up to market
de-regulation next April.
The Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) has warned that some of the
contracts may be anti-competitive and has instructed companies to re-draw
them to provide consumers with escape clauses.
The problem has arisen because of the impending introduction of competition
in the power market for medium to large consumers. This has 50,000 users,
ranging from schools to medium-sized business sites, which have to buy from
their local monopoly power distributer.
From April they will be given the right, already enjoyed by the 5,000
largest power consumers, to choose from any electricity company which is
prepared to supply them.
In an effort to keep customers, some regional companies have been offering
discounts for electricity consumed before April to customers who agree to
sign long-term deals lasting up to four years.
In a letter to the companies Offer has ruled that this behaviour takes
advantage of the present monopoly market to preclude other suppliers from
competing effectively after April.
It has told the 12 regional companies in England and Wales and two Scottish
distributers that 'to avoid suggestions of anti-competitive behaviour' it
expects each contract signed before April to include a clause enabling a
customer to be released from the deal after a year. Offer wants contracts
already signed to be amended to reflect this change.
Disclosure of the long-term contracts has prompted concerns about how the
discounts are being financed. Industry regulations prevent regional
electricity companies from cross-subsidising between various parts of their
business.
It is thought that several regional companies have 'over-recovered' in their
monopoly markets this year - they may have charged too much because
inflation estimates have proved incorrect. The regulations require that this
money is not used for discounts in the new competitive market and is
returned to customers in rebates. Offer said: 'Companies must demonstrate to
us that there is no cross-subsidy. Deals should be self-financing.'
Offer has also reminded regional companies that under their licences they
must not discriminate between similar customers when they offer contracts.
It could not say yesterday which of the distributers had been offering
discounts tied to long-term contracts.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Big drop in wage freezes reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of pay freezes has dropped sharply since the start of the year
and more than two thirds of pay awards remain in the 2 per cent to 4 per
cent band, says the latest pay survey from independent analysts Incomes Data
Services.
The Confederation of British Industry's pay databank continues to report
that nearly a quarter of all manufacturing settlements are freezes. But
according to IDS, of 119 private-sector deals concluded from July onwards,
only five were freezes, 'a much lower number than at the start of the year'.
The apparent decline in freezes and the bottoming out of pay settlements in
the private sector will increase pressure on public-sector managers to offer
employees some sort of pay rise next year in spite of the government's
freeze on public pay bills.
Average pay settlements could also start to shift upwards next month with
the second stage of two-year agreements of 4 per cent at Jaguar, 3.6 per
cent at Rover Group, and 3 per cent at Iveco Ford Trucks following a
six-month deferral.
Some of the higher rises concluded from July include 7.5 per cent (including
bonus payments) for 2,500 employees at Severn Trent Water, and 5.5 per cent
at Calor Gas, which was partly to compensate its 1,800 employees for moving
from a non-contributory pension scheme to a contributory one.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Woolf calls for cheaper justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAPER access to justice and a bill of rights to prevent governments
nibbling away at individual freedoms were called for yesterday by Lord
Woolf.
Speaking for the first time since he stirred controversy by attacking
government policies to get tough on crime as short-sighted and
irresponsible, the law lord said he believed British justice was basically
sound.
Lord Woolf, who carried out the official inquiry into prison riots in the
early 1980s, warned that there were dangers that justice was too expensive.
A system of justice was fatally flawed if private citizens and the corporate
sector could not afford to invoke it. Lord Woolf quoted a friend whose legal
bills were now greater than the cost of repairing a faulty roof over which
he had gone to court in the first place.
Pointing out that this year's bill for legal aid would approach Pounds
1.3bn, he said efforts should be made to make justice available at an
affordable price within existing resources. Given the choice between a
luxury service which only a few could afford and a 'rough-and-ready model
that does not produce such a refined product', he argued that the latter was
preferable.
The existing small claims courts were along the right lines, he said.
Describing his ideal as 'fast-track' justice, he suggested a court would be
presided over by a judge who would act as inquisitor and who would have
total control of the proceedings, including whether or not legal
representation would be allowed. He accepted that a 'director of civil
proceedings' would have to be appointed to monitor the system.
Lord Woolf, who was giving the George Bean Memorial Lecture to the
Association of Jewish Ex-Service Men and Women, said he was concerned about
the number of cases being referred to the European Court of Human Rights. It
did nothing to build confidence in British justice if people believed their
last hope lay with a European court.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Executive pay rises edge up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of average pay rises for executives is beginning to edge up again
after falling consistently since 1991, the latest index produced for the
Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and
actuaries shows.
The October survey shows that the average increase over the past 12 months
was 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to July.
Before that, the annual rate had declined every quarter from the 13.8 per
cent recorded in 1990.
But the upturn in the average rate, which covers all ranks of executives,
conceals variations for different levels of management, with the advantage
going mainly to those at board level.
For chief executives, the rate has increased from 5.4 per cent to 6.3 per
cent in companies with sales turnovers of up to Pounds 100m, and from 5.7
per cent to 6 per cent in companies with turnovers from Pounds 101m to
Pounds 600m. In bigger concerns, the chiefs' rate has gone on falling from
5.9 per cent to 5.7 per cent.
The rate for other directors has risen in both the bigger sizes of company -
from 5.5 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the Pounds 101m-Pounds 600m band and
from 5.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent in the Pounds 600m-plus category - while
falling from 5.4 per cent to 5.0 per cent in the smallest group.
Among executives below board level the only upturn has been for senior
managers in companies with turnovers under Pounds 100m, with an increase
from 5.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent. The rates of rise for senior and middle
managers in all the other categories have continued to slow by three or four
percentage points.
The index, which includes benefits such as cars and pensions as well as
salaries and bonuses, also shows that companies are trimming the cost of
executives' cars at all levels of management.
The average value of company cars stood at Pounds 8,836 in July,
representing 10.6 per cent of the average total pay of Pounds 83,245. This
month the car value is Pounds 8,538 or 10.1 per cent of the increased total
of Pounds 84,457.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Algerian extremists kidnap foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIAN Islamic extremists yesterday kidnapped three employees of the
French consulate-general in Algiers, appearing to intensify a new campaign
to force foreigners out of the country and increase pressure on the
government.
The abductions follow the murder of seven foreigners in the past four weeks.
They were the first direct attacks on members of Algeria's 70,000-strong
expatriate community since Islamic extremists launched a violent campaign to
topple the military-backed government nearly two years ago.
Algerian authorities also disclosed yesterday that they thwarted the
attempted abduction of two Japanese on Saturday.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for yesterday's kidnappings. But
a group calling itself the Armed Islamic Group - one of many extremist
Islamic cells operating in Algeria - said last week it killed three
expatriate workers for ABB Sae Sadelmi, a Milan-based oil group.
The group said the killings were part of a campaign to target foreigners
working for the Algerian regime, and warned expatriates to leave the
country.
Two French citizens and two Russian military trainers have been killed this
month.
The attacks signal a new phase in a 21-month-old campaign which has claimed
about 2,000 lives since the government cancelled elections to deny almost
certain victory for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which had pledged to
establish an Islamic state.
They are of particular concern for the thousands of foreigners working in
Algeria's crucial oil and gas industry - which accounts for more than 90 per
cent of hard-currency earnings - whose numbers have swelled in the last two
years following government encouragement of foreign participation in the
sector.
Diplomats are urging all foreigners to tighten security.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Burundi coup plotters waver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUTSI paratroopers who murdered President Melchior Ndadaye of Burundi in a
coup last week appear to be ready to surrender power in return for an
amnesty, writes Leslie Crawford.
Lt-Colonel Jean Bikomagu, Burundi's army chief of staff, disowned the
plotters, in a radio broadcast at the weekend, saying: 'The military men
have accepted that the government of Frodebu (Ndadaye's party) should rule
again, but it should examine the question of amnesty for those who
participated in the coup.'
Members of Mr Ndadaye's government who have taken refuge in western
embassies said they would not negotiate with the plotters while the
Tutsi-led army continued to massacre Hutu peasants.
Aid agencies said more than 200,000 Hutus - Burundi's main ethnic group -
had fled into Rwanda and dozens of people, including children, had died
since Thursday's coup.
Diplomats said the coup plotters had lost control of the army and were now
frightened of the violence they had unleashed. But they could not see a
return to civilian rule while the Tutsi tribe continued to dominate the
army.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Asian city pollution 'at danger levels'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Asian cities are dangerously polluted, and sulphur dioxide and
suspended dust levels can be tens or hundreds of times worse than in US or
Canadian cities, according to a report prepared by the United Nations.
'Air pollution statistics point to the special risks of living in a large
Asian city,' says a study of Asian urbanisation from the UN Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap).
'Many Asian cities have high rates of lung cancer, tuberculosis and
bronchitis,' Escap says.
'In Bangkok, average blood lead levels are 40 to 45 microgrammes per
decilitre, four times the US standard. There is evidence of permanent brain
damage in children because of lead poisoning.'
Bangkok dust levels in 1989 alone are estimated to have cost 26m lost work
days and 1,400 extra deaths. The Thai capital is notorious for its traffic
congestion and for its uncontrolled construction boom. Escap says the
single-minded pursuit of economic growth has made several cities into
'pollution havens' afflicted by water and air pollution and inadequate waste
disposal.
The agency rejects the commonly held view that developing countries must
first pollute to become rich and then pay for protecting the environment
later. 'While appropriate environmental protection imposes minimal
short-term costs, it produces substantial long-term economic and social
gains,' the report says. It calls for the introduction of various forms of
taxation and effective laws and institutions to restrict pollution.
Water contamination, which kills thousands of Asian children each day, is a
particularly serious problem. 'Rivers that flow into Asian cities are
already laden with pathogens, sediments and pesticide residues,' Escap says.
'They then become increasingly polluted with sewage, industrial effluent and
solid wastes.'
Many Asian cities generally dispose of solid wastes in open landfills, which
pose pollution problems in themselves.
In Manila, about 20,000 people live on and around a rubbish dump known as
Smokey Mountain, although the fact that they make money by selling the waste
is often regarded as environmentally beneficial.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Japan fumbles for a nuclear stance: Russian waste dumping
highlights an uneasy internal debate
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY WILLIAM DAWKINS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN anxious crowd gathered one evening last week on a pavement in central
Tokyo beneath a giant television screen on the wall of a tower block.
Home-bound commuters had stopped to watch a news film of a rusty Russian
navy tanker wallowing in the sea off northern Japan, as it pumped liquid
nuclear waste into the water.
The commuters were not the only ones to be worried by the dumping, denounced
as 'deplorable' by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister. The issue has
dominated newspaper and television coverage for much of last week and
outraged the environmentally sensitive, fish-eating Japanese.
This is not the first time the issue has arisen. Last March the Russian navy
admitted it had routinely dumped nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. It was
'unbelievable' and a 'disgrace', Japanese government leaders said at the
time.
In the end, last week, Moscow was persuaded to cancel plans to dump a second
load of waste - low-level coolant and cleansing water from decommissioned
nuclear submarines - after a phone call from Mr Hata to his Russian
counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials correctly guessed that the dumping was
as much of a surprise to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who only a week
before had been in Tokyo on an official fence-mending visit, as it was to
them. In return for Russia's co-operation, Japan will consider giving
financial help for nuclear waste disposal on Russian territory.
Yet like many environmental rows, this one is more complex than it seems.
For a start, the radioactivity of the liquid dumped last week appears to be
weak, and the International Atomic Energy Agency was informed in advance.
The Russians claim they were acting within international guidelines, even if
outside a voluntary international moratorium on dumping nuclear material at
sea. A Japanese research vessel has been dispatched to the scene to check.
Whatever the truth, the row highlights an uncomfortable internal Japanese
debate about how the country should develop its own nuclear industry.
Governments have struggled, not always successfully, to balance the need to
reduce Japan's present complete dependence on energy imports, with the
imperative of satisfying environmental concerns.
Like Russia, Japan has a nuclear problem, even if it is of a different
order. There is a parallel, for instance, between the row over Russian
dumping and the international outcry that greeted last year's shipment of
1.7 tonnes of plutonium fuel from a reprocessing plant in northern France to
a port near Tokyo.
The protests from countries along the route, alarmed by Japan's fumbled
attempts to keep the cargo secret, have prompted the government to review
its plutonium policy.
Yet Japan needs the fuel, supposed to be the first of 30 such shipments, for
use in a fast-breeder reactor under development.
Japan hopes it will no longer have to use French reprocessing in 10 years,
when its own reprocessing plant is completed. But until then, Japan faces
the same dilemma every time it needs a load of reprocessed plutonium.
In another parallel with Russia, Japan once had a bad environmental record,
a cost of its fast post-war industrial growth.
This started to become unacceptable in the late 1950s, when mercury
pollution in the sea off the southern coast led to deformed children and
adult diseases in Minamata, a fishing town.
Even today Japanese courts are working through the queue of Minamata
compensation suits, providing the public with repeated reminders of Japan's
polluted past.
It is no surprise, then, that Russian waste dumping has given the Japanese
government a few uncomfortable moments.

FT  25 OCT 93 / How the changed ERM might affect bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR, MIRROR on the wall, which are the best bonds of them all? Among the
leading industrial countries France would appear to have particularly
attractive bonds. That at least was the conclusion of Jeremy Hale in a
presentation last week on the occasion of the launch of this year's Green
Budget from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs*.
As is shown in the charts, the tendency in the old ERM was for nominal
long-term interest rates of core participants to converge, because of the
growing credibility of the fixed exchange rates. Meanwhile, 'real' bond
yields diverged, when real yields are defined in relation to short run
inflation. Real interest rates, thus measured, have been twice as high in
France as in Germany, which has imposed a painful burden on the former, at
least in the short term.
The opposite picture emerges for the bond markets of the big three
industrial economies. In this case, nominal bond yields have not converged.
But measured real yields have done so. This would make sense if investors
had no strong views on the likely movement of real exchange rates, saw one
currency as no riskier than another and believed current inflation was a
reasonably good predictor of future inflation. In this case, nominal
interest rate divergence would reflect divergent views on inflation and
expectations of offsetting movements in nominal exchange rates.
Alternatively, if investors were to expect long-term inflation to fall below
current inflation in any particular country, they would also expect a real
depreciation of its currency. This may well be true of the D-Mark vis a vis
the US dollar, since the Bundesbank has imposed relatively high short-term
real interest rates precisely in order to reduce German inflation.
Suppose the pattern observed for the big three were to apply to the newly
flexible ERM. Real yields in France should then move towards those in
Germany. A reason for French real yields to fall quite sharply is the
recession, which is not offset by high government indebtedness, despite the
cyclical deterioration in the government's fiscal position. The recession
also means that lower real interest rates are most unlikely to be brought
about by higher inflation.
There is no obvious reason why France should go on suffering higher real
interest rates than Germany. But if it is to enjoy lower real rates now it
must first stop trying to convince the markets that its exchange rate
remains fixed. By cutting short-term nominal interest rates, the French
franc would presumably experience a step depreciation. But an expectation of
a subsequent appreciation against the D-Mark could permit French long-term
nominal interest rates to fall below German ones. Real interest rates would
then converge.
It sounds wonderful: a short-term depreciation of the exchange rate against
the D-Mark, followed by long-term appreciation; lower short-term real
interest rates; and lower long-term real interest rates as well. But all
this depends on convincing the markets that French inflation would stay low
even if French short-term interest rates were to be cut below German levels.
Can France retain its credibility without shadowing the Bundesbank? It might
do marvels for French self-confidence to find out.

1993, Goldman Sachs International, London.

FT  25 OCT 93 / ADB economists forecast continuing rapid growth in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS at the Asian Development Bank have forecast continuing rapid
growth in China, which they describe as the 'engine of growth' for Asia,
writes Jose Galang in Manila.
However, the Manila-based bank notes that 'emerging bottlenecks' - in
transportation, energy and raw-material production - and continued tight
monetary policy will slow China's expansion in 1994. In an assessment of
short- and medium-term development prospects in the Asia-Pacific region, the
ADB predicts overall growth in Asia's developing countries at 7.1 per cent
this year, slightly higher than the 6.9 per cent last year. A slight
slowdown next year is also forecast.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Tokyo nears rice decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN is close to a decision on whether to lift its controversial ban on
rice imports, a government spokesman said at the weekend.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said Japan needed to make a
decision to open its rice markets soon, to avoid isolation at the Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade talks. 'Discussions between Europe and the US
are making headway, and we cannot resist (tarification) much longer,' he
said.
Mr Takemura's comments follow last week's three-day visit by Mr Peter
Sutherland, director-general of Gatt. Mr Takemura said Mr Sutherland had
responded positively to a plan that Japan accept tarification of rice
imports after a six-year grace period.
His statements reflect the government's efforts to build public consensus
over the rice issue. Until now Tokyo has repeated its protests against the
opening of the market, and has avoided any suggestion that the import ban be
lifted.
However, earlier this month reports that Japan was offering a compromise
plan were leaked to the press. The offer included a six-year moratorium
period for tarification on rice imports, during which it would import 3 to 5
per cent of its domestic rice needs.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, faces the arduous task of convincing
other members of the coalition government who oppose rice imports.
The Socialist party, which depends heavily on rural votes, has threatened to
leave the coalition if the government were to open the market.
Meanwhile, Japan's farm co-operatives are planning to stage as many as 14
rallies throughout the country next month on the issue.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Liberals set for Canadian poll victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADIANS set aside their political differences yesterday to celebrate the
Toronto Blue Jays' second consecutive victory in the World Series baseball
championship. But the exuberance of the hundreds of thousands of fans who
clogged downtown Toronto will not prevent Canadian voters exposing the
widening fault-lines in their society today when they go to the polls.
Mr Jean Chretien, whose Liberal party is almost certain to end nine years of
Progressive Conservative rule, saw the Blue Jays' nail-biting win over the
Philadelphia Phillies as a good omen for the success of his own party.
If opinion polls are correct, the Liberals will be left as the only national
party with significant representation in the 295-seat House of Commons.
The Conservatives, led by Ms Kim Campbell, and the left-of-centre New
Democrats are bracing themselves for some of the most devastating setbacks
in Canadian political history.
Ms Campbell, who took over as Canada's first woman prime minister four
months ago, has had a disastrous campaign. Her inexperience and an
unconvincing policy platform have wiped out hopes that she would erase
voters' memories of her unpopular predecessor Mr Brian Mulroney.
Most of the opposition seats are expected to be occupied by two fledgling
regional parties, the secessionist Bloc Quebecois and the populist Reform
party, whose main strength is in western Canada.
An unusually large number of three- and four-way contests make it difficult
to predict the precise result. But the Bloc is set to win the vast majority
of Quebec's 75 seats, while Reform candidates will probably pick up several
dozen Alberta and British Columbia constituencies now held by the
Conservatives.
The potential for growing friction between Quebec and the rest of the
country was underlined over the weekend by suggestions that the
Conservatives should ally with Reform to prevent the BQ from forming the
official opposition.
Many English-speaking Canadians wonder whether MPs whose main goal is to
break up the country should become Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Mr Lucien
Bouchard, BQ leader, said he would fight any attempt to stop the BQ forming
the official opposition if it gains the most seats after the Liberals.
'People better not come and tell me that they will not respect the
democratic will of Quebeckers,' he said. Mr Bouchard indicated however, that
he would not move into the leader of the opposition's official residence in
Ottawa.
Predictions that the Liberals will gain enough seats to form a majority
government have brightened the mood of financial markets. The Canadian
dollar soared by almost two US cents last week, and bond prices have
regained most of the losses they suffered at the start of the campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday prepared to release a first batch of Palestinian prisoners
in a gesture of goodwill towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but
the move was overshadowed by the killing by Islamic fundamentalists of two
Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip.
Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, said yesterday's weekly cabinet
meeting had agreed to start a gradual release of 760 prisoners over the
coming days. Under an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation last week, the first batch will include the old,
sick, women and children.
The PLO, seeking to boost its support among Palestinians who remain
sceptical of the self-government peace agreement, said the freed prisoners
would include members of the Hamas fundamentalist group and would mark
merely the beginning of the release of up to 14,000 Palestinians held in
Israeli jails. The PLO said it would continue to press for the release of
more prisoners at talks which resume in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba
tomorrow. The PLO is demanding the immediate release of all prisoners held
for membership of a banned or 'hostile' organisation or imprisoned for minor
activities such as demonstrating, rock throwing or hoisting of the
Palestinian flag.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday sought to reassure
anxious Israelis about the release of prisoners, saying the PLO had kept its
word to suspend violence against Israelis and attacks had been reduced by 50
per cent in the occupied territories since the peace agreement was signed
last month.
But continuing attacks by Hamas will anger Israeli public opinion and raise
opposition to the release of Hamas activists. Mr Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a
right-wing opposition member of parliament, yesterday criticised the release
programme and said Israel was rushing to free 'terrorists' without demanding
anything in return.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after talks with President Hafez
al-Assad that Syria was not hardening its line on Middle East peace and
Damascus wanted a peace pact with Israel, Reuter reports from Damascus.
'I am impressed by the seriousness here and I am sure that Israel is
serious, it is a matter of finding the right time for them to come together
again and have the right flexibility on both sides once they come together
to reach an agreement.'

MR Robert Malval, prime minister of Haiti, and Gen Raoul Cedras, the head of
the army, will meet today in an effort to end the country's political
crisis, five days before the scheduled, but unlikely, return of Mr
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president.
In a meeting on Saturday between Mr Malval and Gen Cedras, the army leader
said he was willing to step down to allow the president's return, but he and
other military officers wanted parliamentary ratification of a general
amnesty for all who led and supported the coup against Mr Aristide two years
ago.
Gen Cedras also repeated the army's desire for a broader-based government to
include civilian supporters of the coup. Mr Malval had indicated a
willingness to compromise on this, but Mr Aristide's aides have raised
objections.
Mr Dante Caputo, the UN mediator, said on Saturday he had received from
pro-military parliamentarians 'important' new proposals for ending the
crisis. Diplomats said yesterday that the proposals coincided with the
demands which Gen Cedras is making of Mr Malval.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Wheat exports to US face trade sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US congressmen representing northern wheat-growing states may be close to
success in their push to impose emergency curbs against Canadian wheat
imports into the US.
The congressmen, led by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad, have been
campaigning against agricultural provisions of the US/Canada free trade
agreement for a year, and see a fresh opportunity to push their case in
Washington as President Bill Clinton's search for votes in support of the
North American Free Trade Agreement becomes more desperate.
Wheat growers in North Dakota, Montana and Idaho say Canada unfairly
subsidises rail transport for its wheat exports, leaving US producers at a
disadvantage. However, they were unsuccessful in pressing their case before
a US/Canadian arbitration panel in the summer.
Mr Michael Espy, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, indicated in mid-September that they supported using an
emergency section of the US Agricultural Adjustment Act against Canada. The
section would impose either tariffs or quotas on Canadian imports.
Mr Espy so far has not imposed sanctions but could do so soon, after
Canadian elections today. 'I think the general sentiment is, we don't want
to make a decision on a trade issue that could have a potential impact on
the outcome of the elections,' said a spokeswoman for Mr Conrad.
The wheat dispute is another example of special interest farm groups'
pressure on national trade policy.
It centres on durum, a variety of wheat used to make pasta. US production
has fallen as farmers choose to plant hard red spring wheat, which is a more
profitable crop. Durum comprises only 3 per cent of the entire US wheat
crop.
However, the US Department of Agriculture has been aggressively exporting US
durum to countries such as Turkey and Algeria using its export enhancement
programme subsidies. It plans to sell about 816,000 metric tonnes of durum
under the programme this year, at an average cost to the US taxpayer of
about Dollars 1.75 (Pounds 1.15) a bushel.
The outflow of durum under the programme has boosted prices paid to US
farmers to a near-record Dollars 4.50 per bushel, and left US durum
processors scrambling for high-quality grain.
Canada has filled in the deficit, selling about 398,000 metric tonnes of
durum to US processors last year.
While North Dakota wheat interests say tariffs against imports will further
raise prices for US farmers, their critics contend that sanctions will
either put domestic durum processors out of business, or force them to
relocate to Canada.

FT  25 OCT 93 / CIA labels Aristide a murderer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has sprung to the defence of Mr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the exiled Haitian president, after a Central Intelligence Agency
assessment described him as a mentally unstable murderer, writes George
Graham.
Mr Clinton said the evidence from Mr Aristide's brief spell as Haiti's
president before he was forced out in 1991 by a military coup tended to
undermine those reports. 'During the time he served as president, political
terrorism and abuses went down in Haiti, not up,' Mr Clinton said.
In an assessment that has been seized on by the right wing, a CIA analyst
told members of Congress last week that Mr Aristide had ordered the murder
of an opponent and spurred mob violence, and cited medical evidence that he
suffered from manic depression.
Mr Aristide has denied the allegations, and has countered with charges that
the military leaders who now control the country are involved in drug
trafficking.
The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has been placed in the embarrassing
position of having to discredit its own intelligence analysts.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Brazil's budget moves backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, has won limited
support from President Itamar Franco for a set of measures designed to
balance the country's budget.
But there is concern among business groups and foreign investors that Mr
Cardoso is acting too slowly and that his measures will be insufficient to
tackle Brazil's annualised inflation rate of close to 2,000 per cent.
Following a meeting of senior ministers late last week, President Franco
said he would support the extension of Brazil's privatisation programme and
stressed the need to wipe out the government's budget deficit, otherwise
expected to reach Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) next year. Details of the new
measures are due to be published soon.
The president's announcement was seen as only a partial victory for Mr
Cardoso, who faces strong opposition from other ministers. The privatisation
programme, which has successfully sold off Brazil's steel industry, is now
expected to be extended to the electricity sector as well as the state
railways.
But Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce, the state-controlled mining concern, is
unlikely to be included, as it appears to be too divisive politically. The
two most sensitive state monopolies, the telecommunications and petroleum
companies Telebras and Petrobras, are protected from privatisation by the
1988 constitution.
A constitutional revision now under way has been delayed by a corruption
scandal and Congress is divided on whether the companies should be opened to
competition.
Mr Cardoso and his economic team are expected to try to wipe out this year's
budget deficit of about Dollars 6bn immediately through tax measures. Steps
to address next year's shortfall will need the approval of Congress, which
will be difficult in an election year. One idea being considered is a new,
higher-rate tax bracket to target the country's wealthy.
'The minister felt he was successful. He would have liked more, but that is
politics,' one of his assistants said.
Mr Cardoso's moves were cautiously welcomed by the business community,
although there is concern about the privatisation programme and that
spending cuts are more important than tax-raising measures.
'Brazil is already one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world.
What we need is political agreement on cutting government's costs,' one Sao
Paulo businessman said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is expected to throw its weight today behind
measures that would allow trade retaliation against countries with
restrictive financial services markets.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, is expected, in a speech outlining the
administration's approach to banking legislation, to back the Fair Trade in
Financial Services bill, which would compel government regulators to prevent
the US expansion of banks and financial companies from countries which do
not offer equal access to US companies.
Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary in charge of international
affairs, is due to testify on the issue tomorrow to the Senate banking
committee, whose chairman, Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan, is the chief
sponsor of the retaliatory legislation.
Some Washington banking specialists wondered whether Mr Bentsen might also
address the question of interest rates, possibly urging other banks to
follow the lead of Morgan Guaranty in cutting its prime rate last week by
half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent.
The Fair Trade in Financial Services legislation has been debated in
Congress for years. The measure was backed with some reservations by the
Bush administration, but the strongest opposition has come from the Federal
Reserve Board, which has contested the desirability of limiting access to US
financial markets.
While the primary target of members of Congress has been the Japanese
securities market, US commercial bankers say that in their sector the
legislation would be most likely to come into play against such countries as
South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Brazil.
Mr Bentsen is also expected to voice support for legislation authorising
banks to expand outside their home states - a measure now being discussed in
a House of Representatives sub-committee.

<TEXT>
BOSNIAN government forces, in the absence of a political settlement,
yesterday sought to enlarge their territory, launching an offensive on the
Croat-held town of Vares, central Bosnia.
UN officials said the mainly Moslem army was trying to link up with soldiers
trapped in the Croat enclave, mostly spared in the 19-month war.
'The Bosnian army opened up a route to relieve its people within the pocket.
Having done that, the Bosnian army is pressing ahead with an assault along
the northwest-to-south-west flank of the Croat forces,' said Colonel Bill
Aikman, UN spokesman.
Sarajevo radio said the offensive followed the destruction by Bosnian
Croatian forces of Stupni Do, a Moslem village on the outskirts of Vares.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) 'burned houses and killed civilians,'
said the radio.
'The village of Stupni Do is still burning. There will soon be an offensive
to liberate this part of Bosnia.'
Vares, under the control of the HVO, lies on a key road from Sarajevo to
Tuzla, one of the biggest government strongholds, in the northeast.
Bosnian government forces, under President Alija Izetbegovic, are trying to
re-open the route to Tuzla, blocked since the collapse last May of their
alliance with the HVO against the Serbs.

FT  25 OCT 93 / First Soviet leader suffers the final ignominy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a year of being knocked off pedestals across the former Soviet Union,
Lenin has suffered the final Russian humbling. An unnamed German businessman
has offered DM1m (Pounds 406,500) for his embalmed body.
According to Russian officials, he wants to display it as a tourist
attraction in Europe.
The proposal will almost certainly be rejected. Although Moscow city
officials say they have received other western offers, they stress they have
no plans to sell the body.
Last week, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the hard-nosed mayor of Moscow, suggested to
President Boris Yeltsin Lenin's body should be removed to be given a 'proper
burial' with his mother and sister in St Petersburg.
'The return of Lenin's body would be an act marking the return of national
burial traditions, as historically stipulated by the spiritual and cultural
influence of the Russian Orthodox church,' he said.
Any reburial of either Lenin or Tsar Nicholas II, shot by Bolsheviks in the
Urals in 1918, would require the blessing of the Church - a factor that
could delay the process and add an extra note of political controversy.
Few officials openly admit that they are considering moving Lenin's body
specifically in response to recent events, such as this month's revolt by
communist hardliners. In public, at least, they argue that Lenin's family
themselves requested that his body be buried in St Petersburg.
But, with the Lenin Mausoleum on Red Square a key focus for anti-communist
demonstrations in recent years, the suggestion of closing it is undoubtedly
intended as a symbolic boost to the reformers  - and has already provoked
bitter protests.
Lenin's niece, Mrs Olga Ulyanova, has denied he asked to be buried in St
Petersburg, and insists on being consulted before any reburial. All the
same, the mausoleum's warders say they have been besieged by calls from
anxious relatives of the deceased, concerned by rumours of a secret removal
of the body.
For the moment, the reformers have the upper hand - although only 45 per
cent of Russians in the summer supported removing Lenin's body, the figure
shot to 62 per cent after the failed revolt, according to a recent opinion
poll.
But Mr Yeltsin's officials say that the reburial is unlikely to occur before
the parliamentary elections in December -not least because, in the best
Soviet tradition, there is now a queue for reburial.
Top of the list, says Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, is the
Tsar's family. Others potentially awaiting reburial include Leonid Brezhnev,
Josef Stalin and the American Bolshevik sympathiser John Reed.
Meanwhile, across the square from the mausoleum, the official Lenin Museum
last week opened an alternative. Tourists can now visit a political waxworks
featuring not just Lenin, but also deathly-looking figures of Messrs Yeltsin
and Mikhail Gorbachev.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Belgian PM rules out social pact

<TEXT>
BELGIAN Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene yesterday ruled out a new social
pact with unions, political parties and employers and said the government
would go it alone with its own package of austerity measures, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
Mr Dehaene's decision to go ahead with his own plan could place the shaky
four-party coalition government in conflict with the country's powerful
trade unions.
Talks on a new social pact, aimed mainly at boosting flagging
competitiveness and shaving the social security budget, foundered last week
after the socialist trade unions pulled out, saying the pact favoured
employers.
The socialist FGTB union, which had threatened to launch a strike on Friday
over the social pact, said it would meet today to decide what action to take
over Mr Dehaene's latest plan.
The prime minister said in a statement that he had abandoned the idea of a
social pact after weekend consultations with those involved in drawing up a
pact had failed. 'It is impossible to continue with all the social partners.
. . the prime minister and the vice-prime ministers have decided that the
government itself will establish its own global plan,' the statement said.
Mr Dehaene said the gravity of the international economic crisis had forced
the government into the decision. 'This has affected Belgium by a dramatic
increase in unemployment, a loss of competitiveness and a growing deficit in
social security, necessitating immediate action.'
Political analysts had thought Mr Dehaene would be unlikely to win over his
socialist ministers in the coalition, which is made up of socialists and
Christian Democrats from the French- and Dutch-speaking regions. Mr Dehaene
is a Christian Democrat.
However, a spokeswoman for Mr Dehaene said yesterday the socialist parties
had agreed with the premier's decision to draw up his own plan.
The main components of the social pact had been a three-year wage freeze;
cuts in social security, healthcare and child benefits; higher excise
duties; and new taxes on property and investment income.
Mr Dehaene did not indicate whether his new plan would include all these
measures. He indicated the measures should be in force by the year's end.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Commonwealth plans to assist in South Africa poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

COMMONWEALTH leaders will today finalise a plan to send up to 70
representatives to assist South Africa prepare next April's general election
and help monitor the poll itself, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's
secretary general, said last night.
It will be the largest such exercise in the Commonwealth's history.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior African National Congress official attending the
conference as an observer, has raised the prospect of a longer-term
Commonwealth role, inviting the body to act as a human rights 'watchdog' to
help protect minority rights after a new government is installed.
South Africa, out of the Commonwealth since 1961, is expected to be
readmitted after the elections.
Together with further discussions on world trade and debt, South Africa was
one of the main items on the agenda during the heads of government retreat
over the weekend at the historic centre of Paphos.
Mr Mbeki's suggestion will be welcomed by many Commonwealth leaders keen to
ensure that the association's principles are put into practice. British
officials have always been cautious about such proposals, however, aware
that British policy in Northern Ireland would come under scrutiny.
Leaders were also preparing the conference communique, to be issued when the
five-day summit ends this evening. It will confirm that the membership
application from the west African state of Cameroon will be provisionally
accepted, subject to implementation of political and human rights reforms by
the time the summit reconvenes in New Zealand in 1995.
One of the most difficult sections being drafted for the communique is the
reference to Commonwealth policy towards Cyprus itself.
A Cypriot government spokesman last night described as 'premature'
speculation that President Glafcos Clerides, who is pressing a more
forthright denunciation of Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus and
renewed international efforts to resolve the dispute, had failed to win the
backing of Mr John Major, the British prime minister.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Regional campaigners quick to learn electoral tricks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHELYABINSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS Russian President Boris Yeltsin's allies lay their plans for the coming
elections, Mr Boris Mizrakhy, a pro-Yeltsin official in the distant city of
Chelyabinsk, has been poring over electoral maps.
For, as the campaign for the December parliamentary elections gets under way
in Russia, pro-Yeltsin forces in cities such as Chelyabinsk are already
using every electoral trick for the battle.
'We (in the government) have the right to set the electoral boundaries. So
we will set them in a way that is good for the Yeltsin parties,' says Mr
Mizrakhy, who works in the local pro-Yeltsin administration and is himself
planning to stand as a candidate.
Judging from the political climate in Chelyabinsk - an industrial region in
the Urals 1,800km east of Moscow, with 3.6m people and many key nuclear
missile sites - it seems that the pro-Yeltsin forces may not need to resort
to such ploys to win.
Following Mr Yeltsin's crackdown on anti-Yeltsin officials in recent weeks,
his opponents in the regions are in disarray.
The chief opposition to Mr Yeltsin in Chelyabinsk, and in most of the 88
regions and autonomous republics of Russia, has been the regional council,
which was elected four years ago at the same time as the now-defunct Russian
parliament, and dominated by Soviet era officials.
The Chelyabinsk council has vociferously supported parliament - during the
recent battle in Moscow it thrice passed resolutions condemning Mr Yeltsin's
actions, and has repeatedly demanded economic autonomy for the region.
And although Mr Yeltsin appealed to the regional councils last week to
dissolve themselves, the council has so far defied the decree.
'We will fight on. You in the west have one standard for democracy for the
west and one for Russia - where else would you allow a president to sack all
its elected councils?' says one council leader.
But in spite of the bitter words, the anti-Yeltsin forces are in confusion,
with many claiming that they have been 'betrayed' by extremists in the
Russian parliament.
A decree from Mr Yeltsin has stripped the council of most of its powers and
budget. And although the council plans to participate in the elections, the
local media remains pro-Yeltsin, and most of the anti-Yeltsin parties
banned.
Some in the council hope the Unity and Accord party, founded by Mr Sergei
Shakrai a week ago, will provide an alternative platform, particularly since
Mr Shakrai's party is now organising in the provinces.
In recent months, Mr Shakrai has been at pains to cultivate support from
regional councils and repeatedly telephoned the Chelyabinsk council last
week.
But though the Chelyabinsk council believes that a large proportion of the
population still supports it, it will have an uphill fight against the
pro-Yeltsin forces, who have already organised themselves around the
'Russia's Choice' party - the party headed by Mr Yeltsin's close ally, Mr
Yegor Gaidar. In the last year Mr Gaidar has taken pains to court
Chelyabinsk's administration - he twice made the two-hour flight from Moscow
to visit the local governor, Mr Vadim Solovev.
Meanwhile, the Russia Choice group has already started selecting its
candidates and providing finance for their campaign.
'I am taking part to defend my business and defend the reforms,' says one
candidate, who fears that if the Communists came back to power they would
strip him of the private meat factory he owns.
But, as in most other regions of Russia, the ideological labels of
'communist' or 'democrat' conceal a host of private rivalries.
The 'democrat' side, headed by Mr Solovev, for example, is far from
'democratic' in some of its attitudes.
Mr Solovev, for example, believes that if too many Communists are elected to
the parliament, Mr Yeltsin must dissolve it, and strongly opposes elections
for his own post as governor.
'If we had elections an old Communist might win. Would America and other
countries want a Communist controlling a region with thousands of nuclear
warheads?' he says.
Meanwhile, Mr Solovev - like so many of his counterparts across the country
 -has a personal vendetta to wage.
His main rival, Mr Pyotr Sumin, the head of the local council, was
originally an ally of Mr Solovev. Until the end of the 1980s the two men
worked in the local Communist party, and were such friends they built their
dachas next door to each other.
However, when Mr Solovev was selected by Mr Yeltsin to be governor, the men
became deadly rivals, with Mr Sumin taking the anti-Yeltsin side.
The political rivalry has now led to the two men building a two-metre-high
wall between their gardens.
And as the bitter battle for the elections get under way across the country,
it seems that personal power struggles such as this one - rather than
ideological abstractions - could yet be the key force in much of the
election.

FT  25 OCT 93 / GM agrees three-year labour deal
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS backed away from confrontation with the United Auto Workers
union over the weekend as it agreed to a new three-year labour deal closely
echoingthose reached by its Detroit rivals Ford and Chrysler.
The deal, subject to approval of 241,000 UAW workers, heads off the strike
threat at the world's biggest carmaker. But it could also hit the share
price of GM, which faces higher pension costs as a result of the agreement.
The deal was reached at 1 am on Sunday morning, after 16 hours of talks, and
more than a month after the company's last labour agreement expired. The UAW
said it closely resembled the deal struck between the union and Ford last
month, which had set the pattern for the Chrysler agreement, though GM
refused to comment.
Pensions and job security clauses were the main sticking points over which
an agreement almost foundered. Under the Ford agreement, workers with more
than 30 years' service will get a 13 per cent rise in their monthly income,
to Dollars 2,030 (Pounds 1,365). GM, which already faces an unfunded pension
liability of Dollars 19bn and would be harmed more than its rivals by higher
pension costs, resisted a similar rise.
Mr Gerald Knechtel, vice president in charge of personnel for GM's north
American operations, said the deal would allow the carmaker to maintain its
'momentum in improving its operating performance in the US'.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Christopher will press Kiev to give up missiles

<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will today arrive in Kiev
bearing gifts and reassurances, as part of Washington's new tactic to press
Ukraine to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.
Since the summer the US has shifted its approach towards Ukraine to
conditional economic assistance, encouraging Ukraine's nuclear disarmament
through small carrots of financial aid and high-level diplomatic contacts.
Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with 176 strategic
missiles and 1,656 nuclear weapons. Inherited from the former Soviet Union,
this is larger than the arsenal of Great Britain, France and China combined.
Though President Leonid Kravchuk has already obliged Ukraine to accede to
the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) and become a non-nuclear
power according to the 1992 Lisbon protocol, Ukraine has not ratified or
implemented these agreements, which would transfer all its nuclear weapons
to Russia.
Instead Ukraine has been hanging on to them as bargaining chips with the
west for economic aid, security guarantees and international attention.
Only last week Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine should keep its 46 modern SS-24
missiles because the west is not doing enough to help Ukraine. Kiev is
asking for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to dismantle their nuclear arsenal.
In addition Ukraine is looking to the west for security guarantees to
protect its borders, and membership in Nato. Kiev is wary that Nato might
expand into eastern Europe to include former Warsaw Pact neighbours, such as
Poland, but leave Ukraine to fend for itself within Russia's sphere of
influence.
During Mr Christopher's one-day stop in Kiev on the tour of the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe, he is expected to announce a Dollars 330m
aid package of agricultural credits and technical assistance. Leyla Boulton
writes from Moscow: On his way to Ukraine, Mr Christopher stopped in Almaty,
the capital of Kazakhstan, where he received assurances from President
Nursultan Nazarbayev that the republic would stick to commitments to
dismantle its nuclear weapons.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andreas Papandreou, Greece's newly elected Socialist prime minister, has
outlined a set of moderate economic policies, pledging to reduce inflation
and the rapidly rising public-sector deficit and 'create a stable climate
for investment'.
In his policy statement to parliament at the weekend, Mr Papandreou diluted
his opposition to privatisation, saying that minority shareholdings in state
enterprises would be floated on the Athens stock exchange.
'Privatisation is not incompatible with our policies, provided that it
doesn't lead to private monopolies,' he said.
Mr Papandreou singled out OTE, the state telecoms company, as a candidate
for a partial flotation, to raise funds for investment.
However, he repeated that the Socialist government would repeal a law passed
earlier this year providing for the sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to an
international telecoms operator.
Mr Papandreou also underlined that the Socialist government was still
committed to major infrastructure projects launched by its conservative
predecessor.
He said a project to build a new airport for Athens, awarded to a
international consortium led by Hochtief of Germany, would go ahead 'with
special attention being given to transparency'.
Despite trying to dispel fears that fiscal prudence would be abandoned, Mr
Papandreou did not propose any new revenue-raising measures to offset the
loss of an estimated Dr330bn (Pounds 922m) in privatisation income this
year.
He said the Finance Ministry would intensify efforts to speed tax collection
to make up a projected revenue shortfall of at least Dr500bn, the result of
worsening tax evasion as recession deepens.
Domestic borrowing will be increased to cover the widening deficit, which
may exceed the budget forecast of 10.8 per cent of gross domestic product by
almost three percentage points, according to independent analysts.
On foreign policy, Mr Papandreou stressed Greece's commitment to European
economic union.
He said Greece would try to build good-neighbourly relations with Turkey,
its traditional enemy, and would work to re-establish multilateral
co-operation in the Balkans.
However, Mr Papandreou did not clarify how Greece could play a constructive
role in the Balkans while refusing to recognise Macedonia under that name.
He accused the Macedonian leadership of 'showing intransigence' over the
name dispute.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN government forces, in the absence of a political settlement,
yesterday sought to enlarge their territory, launching an offensive on the
Croat-held town of Vares, central Bosnia.
UN officials said the mainly Moslem army was trying to link up with soldiers
trapped in the Croat enclave, mostly spared in the 19-month war.
'The Bosnian army opened up a route to relieve its people within the pocket.
Having done that, the Bosnian army is pressing ahead with an assault along
the northwest-to-south-west flank of the Croat forces,' said Colonel Bill
Aikman, spokesman for the UN Protection Force.
Sarajevo radio said the offensive followed the complete destruction by
Bosnian Croatian forces of Stupni Do, a Moslem village on the outskirts of
Vares.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) 'burned houses and killed civilians,'
said the radio.
'The village of Stupni Do is still burning. There will soon be an offensive
to liberate this part of Bosnia.'
Vares, under the control of the HVO, lies on a key road from Sarajevo to
Tuzla, one of the biggest government strongholds, in the northeast.
Bosnian government forces, under President Alija Izetbegovic, are trying to
re-open the route to Tuzla, blocked since the collapse last May of their
alliance against the Serbs with the HVO.
Mr Fikret Abdic, a local leader from the dense Moslem heartland in the
northwest, last week signed 'peace agreements' with Serb and Croat
nationalists.
Mr Izetbegovic now fears that other enclaves, cut off from the Bosnian
capital, may broker separate deals with Serb and Croat adversaries in an
attempt to end their isolation before the onset of the second winter of war.
Mr Abdic's peace pacts appeared to prompt a 500-metre advance at the weekend
by Serb troops. Sarajevo radio said it was joint assault by the 'Serbian
aggressor' and forces loyal to Mr Abdic aimed at weakening Bosnian
government control over the Moslem pocket.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Attali departs, the stables still uncleaned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an old joke in the airline industry that Air France could fire half
its workforce and still operate perfectly smoothly its entire fleet of
aircraft and airline services.
Of all the big international carriers, Air France has always suffered from
some of the heaviest costs in the industry. But its entrenched union
structure, coupled with the reluctance of successive governments to force a
showdown with the unions, has prevented managements from introducing the
necessary restructuring to make the French national flag carrier competitive
in an increasing global and liberalised world airline market.
Mr Bernard Attali, the airline's chairman who resigned last night, had been
no exception. For four years after being appointed by the former Socialist
government he attempted to navigate a delicate flight path to improve the
carrier's competitive position without forcing a showdown with the labour
unions.
But after initially concentrating on strategic issues to strengthen the
airline's domestic and international position by absorbing Air Inter, the
French domestic carrier, and UTA, the French independent long-distance
airline, acquiring stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA of Czechoslovakia,
and forming a marketing partnership with Continental Airlines of the US, Mr
Attali could no longer escape the need for a radical restructuring.
Some previous, timid attempts at reducing the workforce and improving
working efficiency had clearly not been sufficient to carry the airline
through the worst post-war recession in the airline business and the
emergence of new, fiercer international competition as a result of
deregulation in Europe.
Mr Attali finally announced a sweeping restructuring plan involving 4,000
job cuts, including some compulsory redundancies, and route cuts last month
after close consultation with his government shareholders. The government
also agreed to provide an additional FFr5bn (Pounds 583m) in support to back
the airline's recovery.
Air France was continuing to see its losses grow (they totalled FFr3.8bn in
the first half of this year alone) while other competitors appeared to be
already well on the way to recovery. British Airways, one of the world's
most profitable airlines, tackled the problem back in the early 1980s with a
restructuring programme before and then after privatisation which took out
more than 20,000 people. Lufthansa, the state-controlled German carrier,
also embarked successfully on a restructuring programme 18 months ago.
Mr Attali's task was further complicated by his difficult relationship with
the French government following the victory of the centre-right in the last
election.
As somebody always close to President Francois Mitterrand's camp - he is the
twin brother of Mr Jacques Attali, controversial former head of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development - his days were always seen as
numbered once the Socialists lost power. But Mr Edouard Balladur, the new
prime minister, has been reluctant to engage in one of the 'witch hunts'
that have characterised French politics with a general clear-out of state
industry bosses after an election.
However, Mr Attali was under pressure to deliver results as his airline
plunged deeper and deeper into the red. Indeed, many felt he was being kept
on in his job to 'clean the stables', in the words of a French airline
industry analyst, to be replaced once the airline was deemed to have turned
the corner and be ready for privatisation.
A few weeks ago in Paris Mr Attali made it clear that there was no
alternative for Air France but to go ahead with stringent restructuring.
He clearly miscalculated the government's resolve to back him up in the face
of the furious union protests that have paralysed French air transport all
last week. But his resignation and the government's decision not to support
his original restructuring plan has simply delayed the day of reckoning at
Air France.
'The only hope for the airline's future viability is swingeing
restructuring, even if this will entail a long and painful labour
confrontation,' said another analyst last night. 'Whoever takes over from
Attali will face exactly the same problem.'

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Rocard yesterday promised an overhaul of France's Socialist party
and launched an attack on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, following his election as Socialist leader on Saturday, writes
John Ridding in Paris.
Mr Rocard, former prime minister who has provisionally led the Socialist
party since its crushing defeat in March's general election, won 80 per cent
of the 587 votes cast in a secret ballot for the post of the party's first
secretary. He called for a reorganisation of the party and a rethink of
policies aimed at reviving support.
In his attack on Mr Balladur's centre-right government, Mr Rocard focused on
its conduct of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of Gatt international trade
talks. He said the government had acted irresponsibly and warned that
failure to conclude an agreement with trading partners would have dramatic
consequences.
Mr Rocard also said he was willing to lead a list of Socialist party
candidates in next year's elections for the European parliament. But he only
would do so, he added, if women were given half the places on the list.
Despite Mr Rocard's unopposed victory, however, the divisions within the
party which have contributed to its electoral decline remained in evidence.
More than 100 delegates to the weekend party congress cast blank ballots in
the secret vote and there were 51 abstentions.
The abstentions are believed to have included Mr Roland Dumas, former
foreign minister and an ally of President Francois Mitterrand, who is an
opponent of Mr Rocard.

<TEXT>
MR Michel Rocard yesterday promised an overhaul of France's Socialist party
and launched an attack on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime
minister, following his election as Socialist leader on Saturday.
Mr Rocard, a former prime minister who has led the Socialist party since its
crushing defeat in March's general election, won 80 per cent of the 587
votes cast in a secret ballot for the post of the party's first secretary.
He called for a reorganisation of the party and a rethink of policies aimed
at reviving support from voters.
In his attack on Mr Balladur's centre-right government, Mr Rocard focused on
its conduct of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of Gatt international trade
talks.
He said the government had acted irresponsibly and warned that failure to
conclude an agreement with trading partners would have dramatic
consequences.
Mr Rocard also said he was willing to lead a list of Socialist party
candidates in next year's elections for the European parliament. But he only
would do so, he added, if women were given half the places on the list.
Despite Mr Rocard's unopposed victory, however, the divisions within the
party which have contributed to its electoral decline remained in evidence.
More than 100 delegates to the weekend party congress cast blank ballots in
the secret vote and there were 51 abstentions.
The abstentions are believed to have included Mr Roland Dumas, former
foreign minister and an ally of President Francois Mitterrand, who is an
opponent of Mr Rocard.
Mr Mitterrand sent a message to the congress stressing the importance of
party unity but failing to endorse Mr Rocard.
Mr Rocard defeated Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Mitterrand's protege, in the
leadership struggle following the collapse of the Socialist vote in the
March elections. The Socialists won just 54 parliamentary seats, compared
with the 252 they held before being forced out of office.
Both Mr Rocard and Mr Fabius lag behind Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, in opinion polls forecasting support in next year's
French presidential elections. Mr Delors, who has declined to comment on the
presidential elections, appears in polls as the only Socialist able to
defeat right-wing candidates in the elections.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Economy in Germany 'to grow 1.5%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN economy will rebound from recession next year, growing 1.5 per
cent after shrinking by the same proportion in 1993, according to a majority
report from the country's six leading economic institutes.
In their traditional autumn forecast, published today, they predict 1 per
cent growth in the west and a 7 per cent rise in the east, based mainly on a
recovery in trade and on assumptions that average pay will rise 2 per cent.
However, dissenters at Berlin's DIW institute expect a further fall of 0.5
per cent in the west and growth of only 5 per cent in the east.
The institutes, which last year underestimated the strength of the slump and
forecast 1 per cent pan-German growth, said exports and imports would each
grow 3.5 per cent, after declines this year of 8.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent
respectively.
On the deficit side they warned of a sharp rise in unemployment and were
sceptical of the government's plans to cut public spending. Driven mainly by
a rise of 340,000 in the jobless total in the west to 8.4 per cent,
aggregate unemployment was likely to rise to 9.8 per cent, or 3.8m.
The report added that the federal budget deficit was likely to rise by DM3bn
to DM110bn (Pounds 44.5bn). 'The ratio of state spending to gross domestic
product will probably rise to 51.5 per cent,' it said, noting that this
compared with around 45 per cent before unification in 1990.
Warning Bonn that investor confidence would be harmed if it did not act, the
report said: 'So far there is no convincing medium-term consolidation
strategy.' The coalition government's fiscal policy was based on increased
tax revenues and welfare contributions, it charged. There was no alternative
to forcing spending cuts and reducing consumption-oriented hand-outs.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said at the weekend that the report
confirmed the government view that the economy was recovering, although in a
routine monthly study, published yesterday, the Ifo institute from Munich
reported waning optimism in industry after a further decline in capacity
utilisation in September.
Orders on hand had fallen despite reduced output, investment goods
manufacturers reported a clear worsening, gloom was spreading among building
contractors, and retailers reported falling demand.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Accord near on future of nuclear power industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTLINES of a compromise on the fraught future of Germany's nuclear power
industry, allowing the current generation of power stations to keep
operating for up to 40 years, have been worked out in top-level talks
between the government and opposition.
The plan would mean a switch from reprocessing nuclear waste to direct
disposal - provided a new direct disposal site can be found by 2005. This
would mean the current reprocessing contract with Britain's Thorp plant at
Sellafield would not be renewed after the first phase, ending in about 2005.
However the chances of the plan being approved by the full Social Democratic
party (SPD) opposition, committed to abandoning nuclear power generation
within 10 years, are still regarded as slim. SPD leaders are angry that the
government is seeking to link any accord on long-term subsidies for the coal
industry with a deal on future use of nuclear energy.
The compromise has been thrashed out by a four-man working group
representing Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, who is a member of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Mr Gerhard
Schroder, SPD prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony.
Mr Schroder is expected to present it today to a meeting of the SPD national
executive in Bonn, ahead of the next round of cross-party 'energy consensus'
talks on Wednesday.
The compromise represents the first sign of a breakthrough in the
long-running battle over the future of nuclear energy in Germany, which has
been in effect frozen since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former
Soviet Union.
The deal is understood to include:
a switch from waste reprocessing to direct disposal after the current
reprocessing contracts (with France's Cogema and Britain's BNFL) expire;
a search for alternative sites for direct disposal to the Gorleben salt
mines in Lower Saxony (Mr Schroder's greatest concern);
no moves to finalise Gorleben as a direct disposal site before 2005, but
agreement on a 'long-term temporary storage' plan for high-level nuclear
waste;
a deal on a 35- to 40-year working life for the present generation of
nuclear power stations - less than the industry wants, but much more than
the SPD has hitherto been willing to concede;
the go-ahead for one new 1,500MW nuclear power plant of the new generation,
currently being developed by Siemens of Germany and France's Framatome, to
be sited in Bavaria.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Government braced for escalation of strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government is bracing itself for an escalation of the strikes
surrounding Air France this week, following the failure of weekend
negotiations aimed at defusing the dispute.
The strike by ground staff, protesting against an Air France recovery plan
which includes 4,000 job cuts, is due to be joined tomorrow in a 24-hour
strike by Air France pilots and cabin staff and by unions at Aeroports de
Paris, the airport authority, and at Air Inter, the domestic airline
controlled by Air France.
The dispute, now in its second week, represents a dilemma for the government
of Mr Edouard Balladur, which faces its first serious industrial dispute
since taking office in March and which fears a spread of public-sector
unrest.
The government is seeking to restructure inefficient state-owned industry to
ease pressure on the budget deficit - targeted at FFr317bn (Pounds 36.5bn)
this year - and to enable the sale of state-owned groups it has slated for
privatisation. But such measures threaten to fuel protests within the public
sector and add to widespread anxiety about the unemployment rate, which is
11.7 per cent.
A number of other public sector protests are planned. In addition to the Air
France strike, unions have called for a day of mass action on November 18
which is expected to hit France's railways, postal and telecommunications
services.
France Telecom and the railways are not on the privatisation list, but a
one-day strike earlier this month drew wide support from workers at these
groups, reflecting fears about job cuts and opposition to the government's
employment bill, which is aimed at increasing flexbility in French labour
law.
The threat of broader public-sector actions has prompted the government to
step in quickly at Air France. In negotiations on Friday night and Saturday
morning, Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, offered a series of
concessions to Air France's unions, including a proposal that pay cuts be
limited to 1 per cent for the airline's lowest-paid workers and that
reductions in overtime pay could also be revised.
But the unions rejected the compromise offer and demanded renegotiation of
the recovery plan announced last month by Mr Bernard Attali, Air France's
chairman. 'This dispute cannot be ended unless Mr Attali's plan is
completely redrawn,' a spokesman for the CGT said yesterday.
The government and Mr Attali, however, argue that the plan is vital for the
survival of Air France, which lost FFr3.8bn in the first six months of the
year.
The situation at Paris' main airports was relatively peaceful yesterday
following the clashes between riot police and strikers on Thursday and
Friday. But Air France continued to be severely affected by the dispute,
with only a handful of medium- and long-range flights leaving from Charles
de Gaulle and Orly airports.
Air France said it hoped that tomorrow would see the peak in the dispute and
that negotiations with the unions could be reopened following the planned
24-hour strike by Air Inter and Aeroports de Paris.
The government took some encouragement at the weekend from a pay agreement
with four civil service unions. Under the terms of the agreement, civil
servants will receive a pay rise of 5 per cent for 1994 and 1995, slightly
less than the expected level of inflation.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Delors tries to give treaty kiss of life

<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, will today begin a
campaign to breathe life into the Maastricht treaty to build up momentum
ahead of Friday's special EC summit in Brussels.
Working with the Belgian Presidency of the EC, Mr Delors will call for
closer macro-economic co-operation and a strengthening of the faltering EC
'growth' initiative at a meeting of EC finance ministers today in
Luxembourg.
The meeting marks the start of an intensive round of European diplomacy
which could end on Friday with a decision on the site of a future EC central
bank, more openness in the Community, and new 'joint actions' to intensify
humanitarian operations in former Yugoslavia and monitor the parliamentary
elections in Russia set for December.
However, the summit could still be clouded by disagreements over
implementation of economic and monetary union. Mr John Major, the British
prime minister, yesterday dismissed attempts by some of Britain's European
partners to re-establish the Maastricht timetable for a single currency as
'folly'.
He also indicated Britain would strongly resist any watering down of the
economic convergence criteria for economic and monetary union, saying the
criteria - covering such things as relative inflation rates and the size of
public sector deficits - were 'desirable in their own right'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, is expected to reinforce that point at
today's meeting of Community finance ministers by telling colleagues that
the criteria have a role independent of the proposed timetable for a single
currency in promoting sustainable economic growth.
Elsewhere, the pre-summit mood has been improved by the Bundesbank's
unexpected decision to trim short-term interest rates by half a point.
However, member states such as Belgium and France remain wary of cutting
rates for fear of breaking their link with the D-Mark in spite of the
increased flexibility offered by wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the
European exchange rate mechanism,
Mr Delors views Friday's summit as a chance to relaunch the Community after
months of drift caused by the delay in ratification of Maastricht. He wants
EC leaders to agree to closer macro-economic co-operation exploiting the
provisions of the treaty.
At today's Luxembourg meeting, finance ministers will put the final touches
to legislation allowing the second stage of Europeon monetary union to begin
on January 1 1994. This would also create the European Monetary Institute,
the precursor of the European Central Bank.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Squabbles over EC goodies near an end: This Friday's summit
is likely to send nearly everyone home with an institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS, LIONEL BARBER, HILARY BARNES, TIM COONE, DAVID MARSH
and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLEX exercise in EC lobbying is approaching a climax. Two years of
wrangling on choosing sites for nine institutions designed to enhance
European co-operation have shown how that commodity can be in short supply.
However, Friday's special summit in Brussels should produce a deal which -
barring last-minute surprises - provides benefits for nearly everyone.
One UK official in Brussels compares the parcelling out of institutions to a
children's party ritual in which all the guests go home proudly clutching a
bag of sweets.
Governments have to choose homes for a rich variety of agencies. The most
difficult horse-trading has focused on the well-publicised struggle to
select the city to host the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the
forerunner of the planned European central bank.
Also seeking a home are institutions aimed at harmonising Community policies
on cleaning up the environment, fighting drug dealers, licensing
pharmaceuticals, breeding plants and registering trade marks.
The key to the likely compromise is that Britain has dropped its
long-standing opposition to placing the EMI in Germany. Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, will reiterate London's attractions - but this will
be for form's sake only.
After the French and Spanish governments this month came out publicly in
favour of Germany, Frankfurt - heavily promoted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and the Bundesbank - seems the probable choice.
Mr Kohl claims this would buttress the German electorate's declining support
for economic and monetary union (Emu). France in particular opposes a city
which is already a financial centre. Bonn, Mainz, Kiel, Wiesbaden and Berlin
have been mentioned as alternatives.
But Mr Kohl has signalled strong opposition to anywhere but Frankfurt. In
view of Germany's pivotal role in the politics of Emu, he is likely to have
his way.
Pointing to what they see as the slender possibility that the EMI will grow
into a fully-fledged central bank in coming years, British officials say the
institute will have mainly 'academic' significance.
That interpretation was strengthened by last week's announcement that Mr
Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements, is likely to be the first EMI president.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of the Dutch National Bank, was backed by
several countries as a much more high-profile choice to run the EMI. But he
turned the idea down, partly because the job would offer him only limited
scope.
Underlining the links between different parts of EC decision-making, there
are several other reasons why the Dutch government has not pressed Mr
Duisenberg's candidacy.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, is bidding to become the next EC
Commission president when Mr Jacques Delors departs at the end of next year.
The Netherlands reckons that Mr Lubbers's chances would be impeded if Mr
Duisenberg were given the less important EMI post.
On a still more Byzantine level, the Netherlands believes that nominating Mr
Duisenberg as EMI chief would undermine its separate candidacy of Amsterdam
as the EMI site. The Dutch know that Frankfurt has the upper hand. But they
want formally to maintain Amsterdam's bid as a means of ensuring that the EC
agrees to their alternative objective - opposed by France - of bringing to
The Hague the planned Europol Drugs Agency.
Several EC members are backing Frankfurt's EMI candidature in a blatant
attempt to win German support for bringing other sought-after institutions
to their capitals. Denmark - which, like Britain, has won an exemption from
Emu - says it supports Frankfurt as the price for awarding the Environment
Agency to Copenhagen.
The Spanish government has backed the German line for precisely the same
reason. In case either city fails to win the Environment Agency, Madrid and
Copenhagen have their eye on a consolation prize: they are also maintaining
fall-back bids for the Trade Mark Office.
Ireland, which strongly supports putting the EMI in Germany, wants to host
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which would investigate the safety
and effectiveness of medicines across the EC.
Mr Brendan Howlin, the Irish health minister, says Dublin is concentrating
on winning the medicines agency, having given up earlier plans to lobby for
the trade marks and environmental agencies.
The stiffest competitor here is the UK government, which now believes the
medicines agency would be a greater source of employment than the EMI.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the UK health minister, has recently visited
Brussels to press London's application. She points to evidence that Swiss
and US drugs companies, as well as British ones, support London's
application.
A key component of Britain's case is that southern England offers a more
liberal environment for pharmaceutical research than competing areas on the
continent. If Mr Major this week can persuade Mr Kohl of this salient point,
Britain's chances of stitching up a deal will increase.
THE NEW NINE: WHAT THEY WOULD DO
European Monetary Institute: harmonising monetary policies
Europol Drugs Agency: handling data on narcotics.
European Plant Breeders' Rights Office: registering plant strains.
European Trade Mark Office: registering trade marks.
European Medicine Evaluation Agency: testing pharmaceuticals.
European Work Health and Safety  Agency: Improving work conditions.
European Veterinary Inspection Agency: testing animal health.
European Drugs Observatory: analysing data and trends on drugs.

THE MAASTRICHT Treaty's convergence criteria for economic and monetary union
(Emu) should be rewritten next year if economic recovery fails to take hold
in the European Community in 1994, according to Mr Vitor Martins, Portugal's
secretary of state for European affairs.
'Next year will be crucial for a re-evaluation of the convergence criteria,'
he said in an interview. 'If the European economy begins to recover I think
we can live with the present criteria. But if the situation does not
stabilise, we will push for a rewriting of Maastricht.'
Portugal's own economy is far from on course to meet the convergence
criteria. Last week, the government announced a supplementary budget for
1993 because the budget deficit had almost doubled from the 4.7 per cent of
gross domestic product originally forecast to 8 per cent.
The rewriting of the treaty could take the form of changing the timetable or
simply altering one of the criteria, such as the budget deficit, Mr Martins
said.
'It is important for public opinion to maintain the major goals of
Maastricht. But if things are not going in the right direction we need to
admit it and pursue it politically,' he said.
Mr Martins said Portugal was in favour of the enlargement in 1995 to include
the four European Free Trade Association (Efta) states, but firmly against
any constitutional change in the wake of enlargement that could lead to a
twin-track Europe. 'To open up the institutional debate in the EC now would
be like pouring petrol on a fire.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / Brussels warns on steel restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC COMPETITION commissioner Mr Karel Van Miert has warned that Community
steel prices could slump if EC industry ministers delay a vote next month on
restructuring the Spanish, Italian and east German steel industries.
Mr Van Miert wants to present Commission proposals on state subsidies and
capacity cuts for the publicly-owned steelmakers to a meeting of EC industry
ministers on November 18.
But to do so, he needs first to agree a deal with the governments concerned.
So far only the Spanish authorities have reached agreement with Brussels.
The Italian government is still negotiating with the Commission about the
proportion of debt which should be injected into a new privatised steel
company, and the formula for calculating aid and capacity cuts. The German
government has yet to disclose its formal plans for private sector
investment in the Ekostahl plant in east Germany.
In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Van Miert said the
German case was now 'mainly a political issue', but he agreed it was likely
to be the most difficult problem to solve. Bonn is insisting that it should
be allowed to subsidise Ekostahl because its privatisation is an important
element in the overall restructuring of eastern Germany.
The EC is trying to put in place a rescue plan for the Community industry,
to relieve problems caused by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC
imports. So far the Commission has taken measures to restrict unfairly
priced imports, monitor the steel market, and provide financial support for
redundancies in the steel sector. But if it cannot present proposals to the
November 18 meeting of ministers, Mr Van Miert fears that a 10 per cent rise
in the price of EC steel products over the last few months will be wiped
out, because the benefits and credibility of other elements of the EC's
rescue proposals will be undermined. '(The current steel price) is still
considerably below the price needed in order (for the industry) not to lose
money any more.'
Private-sector steelmakers will also be reluctant to cut production if they
know that their state-owned counterparts are still receiving subsidies.
Mr Van Miert said it was particularly important in this respect that
closures at Ilva, the loss-making Italian steelmaker, were implemented
quickly. 'That would be a sign to the market that the operation is really
under way, and then the private companies will put their cards on the
table,' he said. Three weeks ago Ilva announced plans to cut 11,600 jobs
between 1994 and 1996.
If Bonn and Rome do come up with restructuring plans in time, the
commissioner believes ministers will reach unanimous agreement next month.
Mr Van Miert is under particular pressure because he will be in Japan next
week, and will therefore be unable to seek Commission endorsement for
proposals on the Italian and German industries. That would leave very little
time to prepare for a vote at the ministers' meeting.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Bomb puts Ulster peace talks in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hume-Adams initiative to end the fighting in Northern Ireland appeared
doomed last night as Mr John Major led a fierce denunciation of the IRA's
bombing of a busy Belfast street.
As the death toll from Saturday's attack in the Protestant Shankill Road
rose to 10, including one of the terrorists who planted the bomb, Mr Major
ruled out early dialogue with the Republican Sinn Fein movement.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring,
Ireland's foreign affairs minister, announced they had postponed a meeting
of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference on Wednesday. Mr Spring had
been expected at that meeting to pass on to Sir Patrick details of the
Hume-Adams plan.
Sir Patrick is expected to make a House of Commons statement later today.
British ministers expect that the London and Dublin governments will now
press ahead with their own efforts to devise a new constitutional settlement
to provide an umbrella for fresh talks between the legitimate political
parties in the province.
In the wake of Saturday's massacre Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the
so-called peace initiative framed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist
Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.
Mr Hume called on the two governments to speed up their consideration of the
proposals, which he said offered the best hope in 20 years of ending
sectarian violence in the province. However, Mr Major, who is expected to
hold talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, during
Friday's European Community summit in Brussels, said the bombing had
seriously undermined hopes for dialogue.
Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major said he wanted one
message from the IRA: 'We have given up violence for good.' He added: 'The
message I want to hear is quite clear. It is quite simple. But I haven't
heard it yet.'
Apparently dismissing the Hume-Adams proposals, the prime minister said: 'I
have read about it, I have heard about it, but I have not seen it.'
Senior ministers added the bombing had reduced to 'practically zero' the
already slim prospect that Mr Hume's efforts could lead to participation by
Sinn Fein in talks to secure a political settlement in Ulster.
One member of the cabinet said the government would be accused - and rightly
so - of bowing to the terrorists if it opened contacts with an organisation
which explicitly supported IRA terrorism.
Mr Reynolds said the bombing was another atrocity which showed that the path
of violence led nowhere.
He said: 'All sides, even at this late stage, must desist from killing and
allow the dialogue to develop between those who believe in peace.'
Mr Adams said last night that the bombing had been 'wrong' after the IRA
indicated that it had intended to give a warning before the bomb was
detonated, but that it had exploded prematurely.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 40,000 commuters faced disruption today after an IRA bomb at Reading
damaged the British Rail main line between the West and London last night,
police said. No casualties were reported.
The blast, which followed a coded warning, came hours after the army
disabled bombs at Reading and Basingstoke railway stations. BR laid on
contingency plans for commuters if the route remained closed this morning.
Guildford station was also shut after a warning, and a controlled explosion
was carried out at Waterloo, but police said the item was not a bomb.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Air France chief quits as recovery plan is withdrawn:
Government seeks to preserve 'social peace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, resigned last night after the
French government said it was withdrawing a controversial cost-cutting plan
which triggered a week of strikes at the state-owned airline.
The withdrawal of the plan reflects the government's fear of an escalation
in the dispute and concern that it could prompt wider unrest in public
sector industry. The strike, mainly involving ground staff protesting
against the recovery plan, was due to be joined tomorrow by Air France
pilots and cabin staff and by unions at Aeroports de Paris, the airport
authority, and at Air Inter, the domestic airline controlled by Air France.
The government's decision also raises questions about its ability to push
through the restructuring of state-owned companies which are to be sold as
part of its ambitious privatisation programme. Air France is one of 21
publicly owned groups due to be sold by the centre-right government of Mr
Edouard Balladur.
The government stressed a restructuring plan would still be implemented at
Air France, which suffered losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first
half of the year. But it said that amendments must be made to take account
of union grievances.
'Because we must have social peace we must change the plan,' said Mr Bernard
Bosson, the transport minister, said in a statement on French television. He
said that the 4,000 job cuts involved in the original plan could be achieved
without compulsory redundancies and that it was necessary to re-establish
trust with the airline's employees. Mr Bosson gave himself three months to
draw up a new recovery package for the ailing airline.
Mr Attali's continued insistence that his plan was necessary for the
survival of the airline made his position increasingly untenable. His
position was further weakened by the fact that he was an appointee of the
former socialist government, and his future had been in doubt ever since the
centre-right won power at the last election.
Mr Attali, the twin brother of Mr Jacques Attali, who recently resigned as
head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said: 'The
public authorities have decided to withdraw the programme to return to
financial equilibrium that I consider indispensable.'
The strike at Air France is the first serious industrial dispute faced by
the French government since it took office in March. Yesterday's climbdown
illustrates the dilemma it faces in its conflicting demands of restructuring
inefficient state-owned companies, many of which it is seeking to privatise,
while trying to avoid social unrest created by an unemployment rate at 11.7
per cent.
A number of other public sector protests were planned before yesterday's
announcements. In addition to the Air France strike, unions have called for
a day of mass action on November 18 which is expected to hit France's
railways, postal and telecommunications services.
The threat of broader public-sector actions prompted the government to step
in quickly at Air France. In weekend negotiations, Mr Bosson had already
offered concessions to Air France's unions, including a proposal that pay
cuts be limited to 1 per cent for the airline's lowest-paid workers and that
reductions in overtime pay could also be revised. Unions representing Air
France ground staff rejected the compromise, demanding that Mr Attali's plan
be abandoned. It was unclear after last night's withdrawal, whether the
unions would now call off the strike.
The original plan, which included the sale of the group's hotel interests
and cuts in overtime pay, was aimed at returning the airline to the black by
the end of 1994.

FT  25 OCT 93 / Rowland attacks Bock over Lonrho changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, who has effectively run Lonrho for more than 30
years yesterday warned Mr Dieter Bock, his joint chief executive, they were
on the verge of a fight that could tear the company apart.
Mr Rowland, alternately poured scorn and vitriol on Mr Bock while insisting
he wanted to avoid conflict. Mr Bock wants to turn the secretive
international conglomerate into a more conventional company, initially by
bringing in the first non-executive directors for two decades.
Mr Bock, who owns 18.8 per cent of Lonrho, believes its 16 man board should
be slimmed down, which would probably start with the removal of executive
directors of pensionable age. These include Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert
Dunlop, supporters of Mr Rowland.
Mr Rowland said: 'If Mr Bock says the pensionable directors have to go, my
answer to that would be 'over my dead body' . . . I would say to him 'you
must be stark staring mad'.'
The 75 year-old entrepreneur said the removal of some of the oldest
directors would give Mr Bock unfettered control of the group.
Mr Rowland said: 'If he got rid of four or five people, Mr Bock would sell
everything for cash; there would be nothing left. He would get rid of
everyone, including the tea ladies.'
He compared relations with Mr Bock to his long-running feud with the Fayeds
over the 1985 takeover of the House of Fraser.
After Friday's sudden end to the eight-year legal battle between Lonrho and
the Fayeds, Mr Rowland said he would also like to put his disagreements with
Mr Bock behind him. 'I do not want it tearing Lonrho apart.'
He said he had not tried to find another investor to buy the German
financier's 18.8 per cent shareholding. But he said good relations between
the two men depended on Mr Bock accepting the status quo on the board.
An adviser to Mr Bock said: 'There are no immediate plans to change the
board. The main objective was to get non-executive directors appointed and
that has been achieved.'
Mr Bock is understood to be delighted that the feud with the Fayeds has been
ended. 'Now that the legal action has been terminated Lonrho can concentrate
all its resources on continuing to improve its businesses' said Mr Bock's
adviser.
Mr Bock has taken heart from the shareholder research by Lonrho's
stockbrokers, James Capel, showing that he and institutional shareholders
command more than 60 per cent of the stock.
Mr Rowland cast doubt on his colleague's ability to run Lonrho's businesses.
He said: 'Mr Bock has sold assets in which we were in the process of
selling. It was all agreed before he arrived.' The only deal he has done is
with Peter Palumbo (over redeveloping the Mansion House site) and that was
not with us.'

FT  25 OCT 93 / VW opts for four-day week in move to cut wage costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume car maker, plans to introduce a four-day
working week in its six German plants next year with the aim of cutting its
wages bill by about 20 per cent.
The proposal will be approved at a board meeting today, against a backdrop
of gloomy forecasts for motor industry sales and of the company's failure to
meet its target of breaking even this year.
Four-day working is almost unheard of in German industry. That it is being
introduced at such an important company is another clear indication that
German trade unions are becoming increasingly amenable to flexible working
practices under the influence of the worst recession since the second world
war.
Although workers will work four days, the factories will continue to produce
for five days a week at reduced capacity.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, industry associations and the Bundesbank have all
demanded increasing flexibility from employers and employees to avoid
unemployment's reaching levels that might endanger the 'social peace'.
Unemployment in Wolfsburg, where VW is based, is at present about 13 per
cent of the local workforce. There are few alternative industrial suppliers
in the town.
The group expects sales of Volkswagen brand vehicles to stagnate in 1994 at
this year's level of 1.4m vehicles, compared with 1.66m in 1992. Its Spanish
workers were told last Friday that 9,000 jobs - 40 per cent of the total
payroll - were to be lost at Seat, and one of the company's three factories
was to be closed.
In Germany, management is bound by an agreement with the government of Lower
Saxony, its largest shareholder, and the company's workers councils, to
limit job cuts to the 18,000 agreed last winter, when Mr Ferdinand Piech
became chairman. That foresaw a domestic workforce of 100,000 by the end of
1994. Union officials said last week that the payroll had already been
reduced to 108,000, and would be down to 103,000 by the end of this year.
A nominal four-day week would allow the introduction of more flexible
working, and the rapid reintroduction of longer hours if demand improved, a
VW spokesman said yesterday.
The project has been developed by Peter Hartz, VW's labour director since
October.
Volkswagen's employment needs are also being reduced by the efficiency
improvements introduced since the arrival of the group's controversial
production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
New working methods have already increased productivity by 23 per cent,
company officials said at the weekend. The impact on incomes of a basic 20
per cent pay cut in the pay bill would be softened by lower tax obligations,
and possibly by spreading the payment of traditional Christmas and holiday
bonuses over the full 12 months.
Board and senior management salaries have been frozen at VW for the next 12
months; middle-managers are to have a 2 per cent rise; and a
previously-agreed 3.5 per cent pay increase for hourly-paid workers will
take effect on November 1.

FT  25 OCT 93 / China plans wide reforms of banking sector and taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA PLANS the most radical financial reforms in its post-revolution
history with new tax arrangements and an extensive overhaul of the banking
sector.
Mr Li Lanqing, a vice-premier, said in a Financial Times interview that a
Communist party central committee plenary session before the end of the year
would approve a blueprint for further economic reforms. His remarks
represent the most authoritative outline yet of the next phase of China's
reform programme.
The reforms would be carried out in six areas: banking, finance, taxation,
investment, foreign trade, and enterprise management. These measures would
build on the market-oriented reforms of the Chinese system introduced over
the past 15 years, which have brought a growing tide of foreign investment
into the country. The latest moves would complement those made earlier this
year to restrain inflation and cool the economy through, for example, credit
restrictions and interest rate increases. They would focus among other
things on:
Enhancing the regulatory and policy-making role of the People's Bank,
China's central bank;
Strengthening the archaic tax system, which the World Bank and other
international institutions have been urging China to overhaul to increase
revenues;
Improving management of loss-making state enterprises, which are proving a
huge drain on central government finances.
The plans coincide with an intense debate within the leadership over the
16-point austerity package introduced in July to curb the overheating
economy. Officials are urging a loosening of credit restrictions to cope
with a crisis in the cash-starved state sector, where some enterprises have
almost run out of money and are unable to pay workers.
Mr Li said the authorities would make credit available to 'profitable' state
enterprises, and for purchases of agricultural products. But 'strict
control' would be maintained over money available for 'overheated areas'
such as real estate development.
He said that although the 1993 economic growth rate would match last year's
13 per cent, the austerity measures had brought inflation under control,
reduced money supply growth and stabilised the exchange rate at a reasonable
level.
The vice-premier indicated that the centre-piece of new tax reforms would be
the introduction of 'federal style' tax-sharing arrangements.
The formula would divide tax revenues between the central government and the
provinces, with a portion to be shared between the two. Under the present
contract system, provinces are able to retain revenues beyond those they
have 'contracted' to remit to Beijing.
This has meant that wealthy coastal regions, such as Guangdong province in
the south, have reaped a revenue windfall while the centre has been starved
of funds, weakening its control.
Mr Li said that as well as strengthening the regulatory authority of the
People's Bank, the reforms would involve removal from the commercial banks
of 'policy-lending' responsibilities such as financing big capital works
projects. This task would instead be undertaken by new 'policy-lending'
institutions.
He indicated that the government planned to 'get tough' with loss-making
state enterprises by continuing to give preference to profitable
market-oriented institutions in the provision of credit. 'Enterprises should
run their businesses independently, responsible for profits and losses,
expansion and development.'
Foreign trade reform would focus on fulfilling requirements for accession to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said Mr Li, whose
responsibilities include overseeing China's foreign trade.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rail telecoms move threatens union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reorganisation of British Rail Telecommunications before its planned
privatisation threatens the only single-union deal established in British
Rail.
RMT, the main rail union, which has no members inside BRT, said yesterday it
would be pressing for recognition or for a new ballot on union recognition
when more than 1,500 RMT telecommunication workers join BRT before April
1994.
BRT employs about 650 people but over the next few months this will rise to
2,700 as it absorbs staff from BR, most of whom are RMT members.
BRT managers may want to retain the single-union recognition which could be
attractive to potential buyers.
RMT also warned that splitting the telecommunications function from
signalling could threaten safety. The functions were often carried out in
the same cables and could affect each other, the union said.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Tiny decides to put away the blunderbuss: A look at the
ending of a long business battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST TIME the Fayed brothers offered to end their long-running dispute
with Lonrho over their 1985 acquisition of the House of Fraser Stores, it
elicited a blunderbuss response from Mr Tiny Rowland.
In a reply to a 'peace letter' from Mr Royston Webb, legal director of House
of Fraser Holdings, Mr Rowland said: 'The company you represent is now so
sunk in debt that Harrods, the once proud flagship, can barely be said to be
trading at all.'
As recently as this summer Mr Rowland remained confident that court actions
against the Fayeds would result in the award of massive damages to Lonrho.
On Thursday it was Mr Rowland's turn to offer peace and the Fayeds were only
too happy to accept.
Mr Rowland's change of heart can be partly explained by his age - he will
soon be 76 - and partly because he has a joint chief executive in Mr Dieter
Bock, who has an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho.
Mr Bock has been determined to settle the long-running dispute. By ensuring
that Lonrho sued for peace he has further stamped his authority on the
conglomerate which has in effect been run by Mr Rowland for more than 30
years.
The main legal action, alleging a conspiracy between the Fayeds and
Kleinwort Benson - which had been the brothers' financial adviser during the
takeover - to deprive Lonrho of House of Fraser, began in 1987.
The latest court action against the Fayeds and Kleinworts was due to start
on January 30. In July Lonrho won the right to sue the Fayed brothers for
financial loss over an alleged dirty tricks campaign fought since the
brothers gained control of the House of Fraser.
Each side would have been spending Pounds 1m a month during a court case
that could have lasted for six months.
Mr Rowland said last night that the peace had been brokered by Mr Hassan
Yassim, a Saudi businessman and cousin of the Fayeds by marriage.
Mr Michael Cole, a director of House of Fraser Holdings, said that Mr Yassim
spoke to Ali Fayed. 'A meeting between Tiny and Ali then took place at the
Saudi's London house on Thursday,' he said.
Yesterday Mr Cole insisted that there was no monetary element to the
settlement.
The dispute was costing each side Pounds 10,000 a day in lawyers fees, Mr
Cole said - but insisted that House of Fraser's expenses has been less than
Pounds 10m. Mr Rowland said he thought that between them the two sides had
spent up to Pounds 50m in legal costs and that he thought the Fayed's
expenses had been greater than those of Lonrho.
The pact was agreed 'without reference to the Lonrho board' by Mr Rowland
and with no lawyers present. Mr Rowland has now instructed his solicitors,
Denton Hall Burgin, to make the agreement legally binding - which should be
done by lunchtime on Monday.
Both companies have suffered from the dispute. When the three Fayed brothers
 -Mohamed, Ali and Salah - paid Pounds 615m for House of Fraser, owner of
Harrods, they incurred the deep enmity of Mr Rowland, who had first bought
shares in the stores group in 1977.
Mr Rowland unleashed a ferocious campaign to overturn the acquisition which
led to many court hearings.
The battle was described by Mr Justice Macpherson in his 1992 court ruling
as 'a public, unpleasant and vitriolic vendetta'. Ordering a High Court
action for damages by Lonrho against the Fayed brothers to be struck out, he
went on to liken it to a 'prolonged public warfare with no holds barred'.
Over the past eight years Mr Rowland has been intent on discrediting the
Fayeds and has spared no expense.
In 1984 Mr Rowland sold two large parcels of House of Fraser shares to Mr
Mohamed Fayed, who had been an associate and Lonrho board member, in the
mistaken belief that the brothers did not have the money to buy the group.
Mr Rowland was also bitter that Lonrho's earlier takeover bid for House of
Fraser in 1981 was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but that
the Fayeds' 1985 takeover was not similarly obstructed.
Mr Rowland's persistent complaints about the Fayed takeover - and his
allegation that the source of their fund for the bid was unclear - earned
him a DTI investigation into the purchase.
The DTI inspector's report published in March 1990 accused the Fayeds of
dishonestly misrepresenting 'their origins, their wealth, their business
interests and their resources'.
The end of the feud marks a milestone in Lonrho's turbulent history and is
an indication that Mr Rowland may have finally lost his appetite for
long-running battles.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton will travel to Moscow for a summit meeting with
president Boris Yeltsin in mid-January, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, on a visit to Moscow, said
the summit would take place after the Nato summit meeting in Brussels
scheduled for January 10 and 11, with a tour of eastern Europe by the US
president squeezed in between.
Mr Yeltsin was said to have supported a US plan to expand Nato to include
former Warsaw Pact countries. The plan, which will be discussed by Nato
foreign ministers next month, calls for former east bloc countries to start
with joint military exercises and eventually help with peace-keeping
missions.
Mr Yeltsin characterised these proposals as positive and as deserving
support in principle. It is not clear whether Russia will need pressing to
join Nato itself.
Mr Christopher said he was reassured by the Russian foreign minister Mr
Andrei Kozyrev on fair media coverage in the run-up to parliamentary
elections on December 12. But later Mr Kozyrev refused to even answer a
question on censorship from a correspondent of Pravda newspaper, suspended
by Mr Yeltsin earlier this month.
Mr Christopher said he hoped Congress would lift trade restrictions against
Russia by the end of the year.
President Yeltsin moved yesterday to assert Kremlin authority over Russia's
provinces by changing a draft constitution and ordering new local elections,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
A presidential decree said elections to new-style local parliaments in
Moscow, St Petersburg and more than 60 regions would be held between
December 1993 and March 1994.
But Russia's 20 ethnic republics suffered a serious blow when the
Constitutional assembly drafting a new basic law struck references to their
sovereignty from a new draft.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Private View: A Wren with the will to shoot and kill - This
week, the government announced that the Women's Royal Naval Service would be
scuttled. Despite initial protests, however, Wrens have been serving at sea
for three years. Christian Tyler meets one of them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE DAYS of sail, girls who yearned to go to sea would cut their hair and
dress up as cabin boys. There is something boyish, too, about the brisk gait
of a certain slim lieutenant on the aircraft carrier Ark Royal.
Lieutenant Deborah Heesom trained as a weapons analyst and is the only
female officer aboard the Royal Navy's flagship. At the end of the month,
this smart and feminine 28-year-old will lose, officially, her sexual
identity.
For the senior service has crossed the gender bar. The armed forces minister
confirmed this week that the Women's Royal Naval Service is to be merged
fully with the navy. The retiring commandant, Anne Spencer, will not be
replaced.
Wrens have been sent to sea for the past three years, and there are 800
afloat today on 27 vessels. In spite of protests by navy wives, occasional
complaints of sexual harrassment, and lavish media coverage of what the
minister this week tactfully called 'incidents,' the navy continues to
proclaim mixed manning a success. Privately, it has commissioned a
sociological study.
But should women go to war with men?
Heesom has just returned from patrolling the Adriatic in support of British
troops in Bosnia. For seven months, Ark Royal's crew of 90 Wrens and 1,000
sailors were squashed together like the beef and chicken filling of a
multi-decker metal sandwich. The lieutenant appeared unbruised by the
experience - although not, as she later revealed, unaffected.
Ark Royal was berthed at Portsmouth for an overhaul and I was invited to
lunch in the wardroom. There, we met one of Heesom's colleagues in the
aircraft support section, a male officer confusingly named Lyn. Afterwards,
accompanied by a chaperone Wren from the Ministry of Defence, we adjourned
to a vacant cabin.
For thousands of years, I said, all the fighting has been done by men. Isn't
there something inappropriate about women going to war?
'No, I don't think so,' Heesom replied. 'Only really this century have women
started to stand up and be noticed. If we are capable and intelligent enough
to do the jobs, there is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't.
'OK, you may think we should have babies and stay at home and look after
them. But there are an awful lot of females who would argue that point. We
want to have the same opportunities, do the same things.'
If you were required - it's not going to happen to you - to shoot a man with
a rifle, would you do it?
'You say it's never going to happen but, if you are trained to do it, it
becomes automatic. It's the camaraderie, it's the unit that's fighting, not
you as an individual.'
Would you knowingly kill another human being?
'I don't think anybody would like to answer that easily, male or female. If
it was me or him, then most definitely.'
Would you like to see action?
'I don't think anybody likes war, do they?'
Then why join the navy?
'To defend the country in peace time. If war did occur, then we'd go and
defend our country. But nobody wants to go to war.'
I mentioned the case of a United States army woman driver in Panama who was
said to have cracked up under fire.
'It could happen to a man, too. I don't think you can separate it by gender.
It can affect people in the strangest ways, be they male or female.'
The fact that you are capable of bearing children makes no difference?
'No. I don't think so.'
Heesom eventually conceded that men and women - she calls them males and
females - might have a different attitude to the job.
Some men quite like fighting, I observed.
'So might some women. I don't know. But I think it's a strange individual
who wants to go to war and kill people.'
You make it sound like an office job.
She laughed. 'No, not at all.'
Debbie Heesom wanted a vocation, considered the police, and joined the Wrens
10 years ago with A-level maths, further maths and physics from a Cheshire
grammar school. She took a degree in naval engineering and trained at
Dartmouth.
I asked if she were the tomboy type.
She laughed, warily. 'I wouldn't say tomboy but I liked doing some things
boys did. I was in a big marching band, which was mixed gender. I never felt
competitive. I never felt I was out to achieve and prove something.
'The fact that I'm in the military doesn't mean I'm a tomboy. And I think
the majority of Wrens aren't. They're very feminine. We don't walk around
with sort of bovver boots and jeans on.'
(Some do. Later, I read that Commandant Spencer was startled to meet a Wren
stoker with 'Mum' tattooed on her shaven head).
Seagoing Wrens are allowed to wear make-up if it is discreet - some choose a
shade of eye shadow to match the blue of their stripes. They can even wear
nail varnish. They may sunbathe when they are free and the flight deck is
open. Topless? 'Er, no. I don't think the girls would want to. They have
pride and standards.'
Suppose the ship took a direct hit, I continued, and there was a lot of
blood and guts and twisted metal about. Would you be able to do what the men
would?
'Yes, because I'm trained as thoroughly as they are.'
Wouldn't they want to get you out of the way?
'That is a possibility, I've got to be honest. They may feel that. However,
we are trained to a degree where everything becomes automatic.'
In fact, Heesom could not be removed in an emergency. She is in charge of
two of the carrier's fire-fighting teams.
Are women actually better at some things, then?
'Yes. Some Wrens are smaller and more agile, or they have smaller hands to
do intricate work on aircraft maintenance. It's a matter of choosing the
right man for the right job, as always.'
Do you cry?
'Don't all females?' Her laugh was a rebuke to the male chauvinist before
her. 'Er, no. If I feel down, I've got my own cabin to skulk away in. I have
friends on board to talk to. We have a camaraderie that's second to none.
Everybody has their ups and downs at sea, being away for such long periods
of time.'
Do you say to yourself: 'I am a Royal Navy officer and I must not cry?'
'Not because I'm a Royal Navy officer. If I was the manager of any company,
I wouldn't crack up in front of my employees.' But she would, she admitted,
quite like another senior woman to talk with.
Have you encountered hostility?
'No, I haven't'
Do you encounter male chauvinism?
'Yes, you do, but not often. There's bound to be the odd one or two that do
feel anti-female. Generally speaking, we don't get it to our faces. The
jokes we have are gender-free. I think they are very aware of the situation,
appreciate it's very new. We are professionals doing a job at the end of the
day. I personally don't think there's a problem at all.'
We had talked about gender. Now I had to ask about sex.
Were you not apprehensive about being locked up with a lot of men for so
long? Don't people fall in love?
'It does happen. There are three couples getting married from this ship from
the last deployment. But people are generally very sensible, professional.
'The no-touching rule exists. So people wait till they get shore-side. When
they get into port, they're able to go off as a couple. When they come back
on board, they are just able seamen and they do their jobs.'
There must be cases where they touch each other, I said.
'Yes, and they get trooped for it - taken in front of the commander. We had
two couples fined on the last trip for kissing and cuddling.'
What about harrassment?
'People are very aware and it's really up to them, male or female, to know
how much they will tolerate before they report it.'
Has anyone ever made a pass at you?
'No, no. They don't get the chance.'
Have you made a pass at anyone else?
'No, wouldn't dream of it,' she laughed.
I asked about the complaining wives of Portsmouth.
'They musn't trust their husbands very much, then, that's my opinion. We are
not promiscuous little so-and-so's who are going to go running off with
their husbands. Far from it. We have standards and morals as well. But I can
see their worries, apprehensions. Nobody likes change.'
Is it like a co-ed school, where there is an undercurrent of sex but
discipline to prevent it?
'No, we're adults. We're mature human beings. We've joined the service and
we accept the rules.'
Heesom was not, I thought, trying merely to put the best gloss on things for
the benefit of her audience. A naval vessel, especially one the size of Ark
Royal, is more like a factory-cum-hostel than a ship.
'If I worked in an office with a guy that I really liked,' she pointed out,
'I wouldn't start groping him in the office.
'I might go out for a drink with him in the evening, away from work. It's
the same thing.'
Earlier, I had asked Heesom about her marital status and she told me she was
divorced.
Have you thought of getting married again?
She paused for a second. ' . . . em, yes,' then laughed. 'Yes, I have.'
It emerged that she was talking about an observer stationed at Culdrose
naval air station in Cornwall.
You met on this ship?
The lieutenant wriggled but agreed. She said he had been assigned to a
fighter aboard Ark Royal for the duration of the Adriatic tour. She saw him
every day.
You fell in love with him, not to put too fine a point on it?
At this point, the ministry's chaperone intervened with some haste. 'She met
him at sea but the relationship itself has blossomed since.' Heesom agreed
that was it.
Still, given the subject we had been discussing, I thought it was a
courageous admission.

FT  23 OCT 93 / As they say in Europe: British time, gentlemen, please
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE area where the British seem prepared to sell out to 'Europe' is the
one where there is no external pressure for them to do so. Tonight, the
clocks go back in Britain, returning it to the lap of Greenwich Mean Time.
There are, however, many voices demanding that daylight saving time should
become standard time despite the failure of an experiment on those lines 25
years ago.
Last weekend, the Mail on Sunday ran a poll which, it said, showed that 'a
clear majority favours keeping our time in line with Europe, which has
summer time the year round.' So, we are reminded of those long, balmy
January evenings in Hamburg where the sun does not set until about 1600
hours while poor Londoners have to put up with it disappearing at 4 pm.
The Mail's dream of permanent summer time is not the only argument deployed
in favour of 'moving an hour ahead.' There is the usual dreary thesis about
'giving a boost to tourism' - code for a vested interest wanting more of my
money.
Then, there are the Policy Studies Institute and something called Daylight
Extra, which say more than 100 lives would be saved by the change. But the
number killed on British roads actually rose, compared with the previous
three-year period, during the last experiment with continental time in
1969-71. Road deaths started to fall soon after GMT was restored and have
dropped steadily ever since.
And, finally, there is the argument of the Confederation of British
Industry: its members need frantic commercial intercourse with their
continental counterparts for eight hours a day. Seven are not enough. The
Japanese are seven hours ahead of Europe and 11 from the Atlantic coast of
North America; we all know of the failure of their commercial forays in
those areas.
When time zones first were agreed, Greenwich was fixed as the mid-point of
its zone, which meant that its eastern border was on the river Rhine. But
the French today are on central European time because of a last act of
collaboration. The Germans imposed l'heure allemande during the second world
war occupation and the French failed to change back when they left.
As a result, the morning rush hour in Paris is even more hellish than usual.
In December, darkness reigns until well after the offices fill and shadowy
figures in bars fortify themselves with extra glasses of cognac before they
are steeled for the so-called day. Road deaths are twice the level of
London. What it is like on the western edge of Brittany, I can only imagine.
The pressure to move the clock forward reflects the familiar vanity that
reality is ours to change. But the earth turns on its axis, and Belfast is
in a different time zone from Belgrade because it is in a different place.
If Britain were to change, would the republic of Ireland, on the western
edge of GMT, also change? If not (and why should it?), there would be a
north-south time zone across the island, so that the Londonderry sun would
not rise until nearly 11. But perhaps the north would stay with the
republic, thereby creating two time zones within the United Kingdom - and
handing a propaganda victory to the IRA.
The clock jugglers reflect a traditional British belief that fundamental
improvements can be gained through apparently painless institutional change.
A poll tax can distribute the cost of local government fairly; summer time
can be achieved by sleight-of-clock hand.
One hour saves a hundred lives. So, why not move forward two hours and save
200? Then, move a mere three hours more to Pakistan time: the dead would
doubtless rise from their graves, it would never get dark until nine in the
evening, and tourism would flourish.
There remains a rule which, however, has stood me in good stead on my
travels over the years. The sun rises in Berlin one hour before it is seen
in London. Yet, strangely, there is no organisation like Daylight Extra in
Berlin. No German minister is plagued with calls to move the clock forward
so as to cut the accident rate, reduce energy costs and achieve 'summer time
all year round just like they have in Lithuania.'
Think, though, what would happen if the Germans indulged in such fads.
Suppose Britain were to move an hour ahead and the Germans did the same at
the behest of Tageslicht Extra. The Confederation of British Industry would
then demand that Britain move again - just 'to keep up with the continent.'
When the Baltic states regained their independence, their first act was to
move their clocks one hour back from Moscow time. Single time zones across
huge areas are totalitarian phenomena - the Nazis imposed them, China has
them today. The diverse European Community covers three time zones. But one
of London's greatest strengths is that it is not anywhere else - so let us
not pretend it is.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A puff of fresh air on Tiwi beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY have been the sun, or it may have been the joint of Malawi gold - a
blissful and saintly substance - on which I had been puffing. Either way,
last Sunday afternoon on Tiwi beach, south of Mombasa, found me in a mood of
transcendent happiness. Mellow-yellow from tip to toe. Yet locked in the
grip of a powerful idea.
Before I describe the idea, I ought to tell the story that had planted it in
my head: a story about pygmies in the Central African Republic.
Sometimes at night, when their fire is low, these pygmies cover their bodies
with phosphorescent mould and dance on the forest floor. Some years ago a
French film crew showed up to make a TV special about the pygmies. The
French had heard about this phosphorescent dance and wanted to film it, but
the pygmies weren't interested. There was no reason for the ceremony; they
would be dancing just for show.
The film crew persisted. They upped and upped their offer until the pygmies
agreed to dance. The pygmies rubbed on some mould and went through the
motions. An interviewer approached a pygmy. 'Tell us what the meaning of
this dance is,' he demanded, wielding his microphone. The pygmy shook his
head. The interviewer persisted. 'This is very important. What is the dance
about?' At last the pygmy solemnly replied: 'This is a dance we are doing
for money.'
I love that story because it celebrates simplicity. It cuts through the
flimflam, boils things to their essence. As a result, on Tiwi beach, I was
gripped by the notion that the biggest thing wrong with this sad and weary
planet is that we think that our problems, many of them complex, can only be
resolved by complex solutions. This strikes me as a fallacy that could
strangle us.
Here is an example. A lot of people are horrified at the way we are chewing
up species. It is thought that more than 5,000 species are becoming extinct
annually. We are running out of time even to catalogue this living wealth.
Yet we dither and we faff.
The challenge sounds monumental. Yet its solution could be simple - just
collect these threatened species and throw them in the freezer. Gregory
Benford, who teaches physics at the University of California, writes, in
Earthwatch magazine, that we ought to collect samples of plant and animal
species from threatened habitats and freeze them in liquid nitrogen for
long-term storage. Just post them to the future. The cost would not be
great, perhaps a few billion.
'Because gene pools will shrink in a ravaged environment,' says Benford,
'reintroducing diverse traits from frozen tissue samples could help species
bloom anew. With such a Library of Life, we may be able to recover lost
ecosystems ..
'For us to imagine and anticipate the Library of Life's potential uses would
be as hard as it would be for the Wright brothers to imagine a moon landing.
Many biotechnological feats will emerge within a few decades - many ways of
reading and using genetic 'texts.' But no advanced 'reader' and 'editor' can
work upon lost texts.'
Pondering this idea, on Tiwi beach, led me to conclude that other problems
could be solved, painlessly and quickly, by keeping things simple.
Drugs? Legalise the lot of them. Efforts to combat drug-taking are costly
and futile, so let us cut out the humbug. We let people drink or smoke
themselves to death, or kill themselves in cars, so why not the druggies? We
should not be sentimental.
Crime? I would treat all minor crime seriously and all serious crime with
vengeance. I am in favour of capital punishment. The arguments against it
are flimflam.
My reverie on Tiwi beach came to a brutal end when a young girl ran up with
an item of hot news. She said: 'Things are looking tricky. The tribe that
lives on the hill has just declared war on the tribe that lives near the
beach. Those who live on the hill but are presently at the beach are
returning to the hill, while those who live at the beach but are presently
on the hill are returning to the beach. What should we do?'
I said: 'There is bound to be a solution - something incredibly simple. We
must jettison all flimflam.'
But I couldn't think of a thing.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Dream fails for Paris dealer - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING PARIS antique dealer Bernard Steinitz is having to auction off a
large part of his colossal stock of 17th and 18th century furniture and
furnishings in order to empty his warehouses and make way for a council
housing project.
Steinitz bought the 200,000 square feet of warehouse and workshop space in
the heart of Paris's flea markets at Saint Ouen in 1986 from the firm
Wonder, formerly owned by billionaire asset stripper and chairman of
Marseilles football team, Bernard Tapie.
Five years later Steinitz finally obtained planning permission for an
ambitious scheme to develop the site into a European auction house complete
with offices for a transport company plus a bank and a hotel employing a
total of 1,000 people.
The deal obliged Steinitz to give half his warehouse space to local
authorities to build council homes; in exchange the council undertook to
build a road network. Steinitz auctioned the contents of his country home, a
Loire chateau for Pounds 2m last year to raise capital for his auction house
dream which, owing to the recession and France's failure to lift restrictive
national auctioneering practices, has failed to become reality.
Steinitz has obviously been rushed into this latest sale to honour his
obligations to the council of Saint Ouen. Experts working for auctioneer
Joel-Marie Millon, who will hold the sale at Saint Ouen on November 9, 10,
11 and 12, have been sifting through the huge accumulation of parquet
flooring, wood panelling, furniture and furnishings, including over 100
chimneys and 150 chandeliers crammed into the dealer's warehouses.
An estimation of between Ff30m and Ff50m has now reached. The sale will
contain anything between 500 to 1,000 lots ranging from vases, statues,
wrought-iron balconies, banisters and screens and parquet flooring to a huge
quantity of furniture.
Outstanding items include four marble statues of the Four Seasons by turn of
the century artist Raoul Verlet, which Steinitz sold to a Japanese collector
for Dollars 2m only to have an export licence refused by the socialist
minister for culture, Jack Lang. Auctioneer Millon will also sell a large
and very rare Louis XV terracotta fountain in the shape of two dolphins and
a mask of Neptune. Probably made for the chateau of Versailles, the fountain
is depicted in the painting 'Le Bain de Venus' by 18th century artist
Francois Boucher.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Marvellous monsters from Mexico - From the Oltecs to
Frida Kahlo, Patricia Morison finds them all in Belgium at the Europalia 93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM Antwerp to Zonhoven, cultural events with a Mexican accent spatter the
map of Belgium from now until Christmas. Mexico in Europe is the title of
Europalia 93. Events span the conventional arts and go beyond to include
horsemanship, numismatics, literature (presided over by Octavio Paz and
Carlos Fuentes), and papel picado or paper-cutting. Free to all comers is an
seven-day linguistics seminar on Mexican Spanish at Antwerp.
But what is Europalia? The unkind answer would be, a Belgian arts festival
which leaves the French cold and blank looks from most culturally aware
Britons. Yet Europalia has quite a pedigree. It was set up in 1969 as a
non-profit making, multi-disciplinary biennial arts festival to provide a
cultural window onto the member states of the EC. In 1989, it drew 1,660,000
visitors. A measure of devolution has crept in and events now spill over to
Maastricht, Rotterdam, even Paris.
Certain EC countries have yet to take the stage - Luxemburg for one, Ireland
for another. In 1989, Portugal declined on grounds of expense (her turn came
in 1991). The foundation's invitation to Japan threw Europalia open to all
comers; Scandinavia and Turkey currently contend for the 1995 slot.
Staging Europalia is not cheap. Belgium covers all costs within the country,
the guest nation pays the rest. This year, Mexico's costs were approximately
Dollars 20 million while Belgium's were roughly half, which is the standard
proportion. Where formerly there was a plethora of sponsors, this year, in
addition to the National Lottery, the Belgian end has six 'structural'
sponsors, each contributing BFr10 million: Alcatel Bell, Batiments et Ponts
Construction, Bekaert, Belgacom, Generale de Banque, and Swift.
So much for the Europalian nuts and bolts. In my own area of the visual
arts, Mexico has fielded some sumptuous exhibitions and others which sound
promising but I had no time to see. Sinister and heavy with the reek of
blood, Mayan archaeology is the festival's glory. Two large exhibitions must
be seen; The Eagle and the Sun, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts until December
19, and Maya-Metropolis at the Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in
Cinquantenaire Park until December 24.
A statue out of a nightmare, lifesize on a high plinth, stands guardian to
'The Eagle and the Sun'. It is made out of modelled and cast sections of
blackish-red like a ghastly mechanical toy. A human torso and legs balance
on feet with triple talons curved upwards. The face and huge ears of this
god of Oaxaca are clearly those of a bat. With its gaping mouth and four
great canine teeth, there seems every reason to believe that the three clay
bells on its neck sounded the death-knell for human sacrifices.
'Anthropomorphised mouse, Zapotec culture' is as far as the label goes and
the catalogue, beautifully photographed though it is, is not much more
informative. This is not an exhibition which seems to want to instruct its
public nor is it stylishly displayed. Yet despite this, the show is a
memorable introduction to pre-Columbian art.
It aims to be more, the theme being 3,000 years of Mexican art from the
Oltecs (1200-600 BC) to Frida Kahlo. However, Mexico after its conquest by
Hernan Cortes in 1521, is on the whole only thinly evoked with certain
exceptions from New Spain. My favourites were a remarkable 17th-century
painted genealogy of the family of Mendoza Moctezuma and four paintings by
Miguel Cabrera in the genre of scenes illustrating New Spain's rigid caste
system.
The pre-Columbian rooms are surely where you will want to linger. More than
100 pieces have been sent by museums all over Mexico, for the most part
sculptures, some of them large and of superb quality. A number of the best
pieces stand free of glass cases like the vampire-god, which increases the
almost palpable air of menace.
Many figures peer through rings strangely like spectacles or have skin
welted by snaking cicatrices. Some of the more human creatures sit on the
ground, cross-legged or hunched. Warriors, priests, or victims, they serve
gods who stand four-square under their plumed head-dresses displaying the
emblems of divinity, eagles, serpents, the skulls which to this day are
omnipresent in Mexican folk-art.
A statue of a god of the Totonacs clasps a severed head by a handle as if it
were his handbag. He comes from the Gulf of Mexico and belongs to the
centuries equivalent to Europe's Gothic age. To form a picture of which
peoples were active when, Maya-Metropolis is the far and away the better
show, a survey of the Mayan city-states from the Yucatan to the Nicaraguan
frontier in the classical and post-classical period (200-1500AD).
The aim is to show how distinct these city-states were. Anyone not reading
French (or Dutch) is at a disadvantage although the show has a a clear
lay-out. Essentially it is one large space mapped chronologically into
city-states - Bonampak, Jaina, Chichen Itza, Palenque, and so on. Stylish
design puts stepped details and turquoise decoration everywhere to suggest
Mayan temples.
Astonishing and even beautiful things are in the show. Highly carved
figurines from Jaina, the island necropolis, have jointed limbs and
detachable shields for the warriors, like Action Man dolls, as well as
figures such as old women and hunchbacks who have much to tell
archaeologists about Mayan society. Here is the show to discover the Mayans'
incredible skill at using primitive means to carve obsidian and jade.
The catalogue, clear and readable, will give you the latest from the bloody
Mayan battlefield, whether the hieroglyphs really can be read (yes is the
answer). My world is the richer for learning that jade comes from Spanish
for 'stone of the kidneys', ijada, because the conquerors followed Mexican
practice in taking powdered jade as a medicine. No doubt that was the fate
of many fabulously carved necklaces such as stout Cortes gave his marquesa
on their betrothal. See also the very fine pre-Columbian rooms at the
Cinquantenaire museum which reopened last week after four years.
A smaller exhibition I liked is Crucible of Hope at the BBL headquarters,
place Royal 6. A survey of Mexican history from 1810 to 1910, it surveys a
century of revolution. The Belgian link is poignantly presented, less in the
person of Empress Charlotte who, I learnt, was an insanely ambitious woman
who forced poor Maximilian to accept the throne, than in the story of the
Belgian volunteers who left from Oudenaarde to defend their princess.
Ghent has a superb exhibition of silver, mostly religious, from New Spain in
the fine new galleries of the Museum vor Sierkunst; and shows elsewhere
explore popular art through masks, Day of the Dead paraphernalia, and the
muralists. For a Europalia catalogue, ring 071 629 0230.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: So serious about comedy - Alastair Macaulay reviews
'Huge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COMEDY IS hard enough, but Huge is a comedy about comedy
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
about Warren and Clark, two young men trying hard to become comedians. They
are so serious, and Huge exposes their seriousness so well, that it is
astonishing that one laughs too.
For what Huge shows is the ludicrous, ruthless, world-conquering ambition
that keeps Warren and Clark working on their unsuccessful little sketches in
their wretched Hendon bedsit. 'I want Roy Hudd stuffed on the floor of my
library . . . The day will come when, if they want 'funny', they'll have to
get down on their knees to us and beg for it.'
Warren and Clark are Ben Miller and Simon Godley, who co-wrote Huge with Jez
Butterworth. The show, which comes to the King's Head, Islington, from the
Edinburgh Fringe, is in two acts, showing the various stages of
collaboration and break-up between this great comedy duo that never was. The
big joke, the joke that never goes away, is their dreadful seriousness.
After their first row, Warren starts to lay plans for their overwhelming
assault on comedy: 'What are we gonna do? We're gonna to take 'funny', drug
it, put it on the table, and have a good look at it.' This image - laying
comedy out on the slab and anatomising it in its lifeless condition - says
it all.
I hardly like to say that Huge would be more huge - funnier and more telling
 -if it were performed by more experienced comic players. Despite a doting
audience on press night, Miller and Godley showed a few signs of tenseness.
I also think Huge would be yet funnier if it were in yet more deadly earnest
about Warren and Clark themselves and gave them more wretchedly human
dimension. We know their ambition all right, but we do not know them well.
But I talk of flaws only because the core of Huge is haunting. The plight of
those who want, terribly, to be funny; the horror of those who long to take
comedy prisoner and lock it up in solitary confinement; the misery of those
who want so to conquer the world with comedy that they will cry because
there will be no comedy left to conquer . . . Ye Gods. When Huge is good -
most of the time - it is as chilling as it is funny. It is a joke about the
huge ambitions that delude little minds - about a fantasy of comedy as
power.
At the King's Head, Islington, until October 31

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Miscast down the Mississippi - Karen Fricker reviews
Hal Prince's new production of 'Show Boat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS well into the second act of Hal Prince's lavish new production of
Hammerstein and Kern's Show Boat, which opened at the North York Performing
Arts Centre in Toronto last Sunday, before the musical lives up to its
potential. A montage conveys, in the span of a few minutes, the passage of
this century's first 20 years. Headline placards slapped one on top of the
other on a news stand wall telegraph the passage of years and events:
'Harding Elected,' 'War Declared,' 'Armistice'.
The fashion silhouettes change before our eyes as chorine after chorine,
decked in Florence Klotz' sumptuous, meticulously observed costumes, burst
forth from a revolving door on Eugene Lee's glorious set. Downstage, a
riotous scene unfolds, as chorus members shimmy their way through changing
dance styles in Susan Stroman's joyful choreography and from this point on
it is smooth sailing for Show Boat. But however rewarding these last 20
minutes, it takes a slow two hours to get there.
Behind this production of Show Boat lie hopes, of course, of a Broadway
transfer. It is not ready for that move yet, but Kiss of the Spider Woman
proved that Prince can turn a show around after a rough out-of-town start,
and producer Garth Drabinsky appears prepared to support him in the process.
Show Boat is considered the granddaddy of the contemporary musical for its
revolutionary integration of music and comedy with a serious and
historically significant story: the tale, spanning 40 years, of a steamer
that trolls down the Mississippi with a variety show on board. Prince and
his creative team constructed this Show Boat from the musical's several
previous stage and film versions, adding several formerly omitted songs and
excluding or changing material that is offensive to contemporary
sensibilities (the production has been the focus of protests in Toronto by
groups who call the musical racist).
Though primarily the story of the love between Magnolia Hawks, the innocent
daughter of the captain of the Cotton Blossom, and the raffish gambler
Gaylord Ravenal, Show Boat also tells several other stories, including that
of Magnolia's parents, Cap'n Andy and his shrewish wife Parthy; and of
Julie, the Cotton Blossom's star attraction, whose fate turns tragic when
she's revealed to be of mixed race.
So many relationships being played out on stage requires that the director
seize every opportunity to convey information about the characters, but
Prince's hand barely seems present in the first act. Characters drift on,
seemingly without motivation, play out a scene or sing a song, and drift
off.
The score, Hammerstein and Kern's best, sounds gorgeous as played by Jeffrey
Huard's orchestra. Rebecca Luker, with a bell-clear soprano, is perfectly
cast as Magnolia, and Mark Jacoby's dashing Ravenal is also in good voice.
Lonette McKee's Julie is an earthy star turn, and her rendition of 'Bill'
sparks the first real magic of the second act. But there is little chemistry
between Julie and her husband and acting partner Steve (Doug La Breque), nor
does there seem much warmth between Julie and Magnolia, and this is a major
oversight - it is their bond that results in some of the most significant
plot developments.
We know that we are in good hands for 'Ol' Man River' as soon as Joe (Michel
Bell) speaks his first words; his rumbling bass almost shakes the stage.
Although the huge cast - 71 performers - seems at times unnecessary, all is
forgiven when the company lends its full voice to the splendid 'Misery's
Comin' Roun' or one of the many 'Ol' Man River' reprises.
But what are Robert Morse and Elaine Stritch doing in this production as
Cap'n Andy and Parthy? Morse looks to be playing a mixture of Jack Benny,
Mickey Rooney, and his own signature solo turn as Truman Capote: floppy
hands, floppy hair, camp demeanour, and bizarrely elongated diction.
Stritch, of course, plays Stritch, which is fabulous in Sondheim's Follies
or Company but wholly out of place here: her undisguiseably contemporary
physical presence, gravely voice, and wisecracking delivery seem from a
different planet than the material.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Disaster at the top - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOOD in the arts world has never been so gloomy and insecure. It is now
accepted that the chancellor will cut the budget of the Department of
National Heritage in his November 30 statement, and the best that the Arts
Council can hope for is that the reduction in its grant will be confined to
just Pounds 5m, leaving it with Pounds 221m for next year. It will
presumably spread the agony by cutting the grants of all its clients by 3
per cent.
This will be the first ever cash cutback in government funding of the arts.
If it was seen as a once and for all emergency, a case of the arts doing its
bit to get the nation's finances into balance, it would be bearable, but a
further expenditure freeze is on line for 1995-96. Even more ominously it
intensifies the fear that official thinking is turning against the arts.
Margaret Thatcher was so uninterested in culture that during her premiership
the arts never became a national donkey, needing to be kicked into life. It
would be ironic and tragic if the ideologists suddenly sank their teeth into
the arts at this late stage.
The problem is political. While the Department of Arts and Libraries was a
backwater, its civil servants, with little hope of catching the eye of
Whitehall mandarins, spent their time fighting the arts corner. Its
ministers, too, often discovered to their surprise that, when given the
peripheral arts portfolio, really the arts in the UK, especially in the
regions, were much more fascinating than they imagined, and they fought
valiantly to preserve the arts budget.
The new Department of National Heritage, despite its minister with cabinet
rank, has turned out to be a disaster. At the top it is stacked with
ambitious civil servants who are using the arts and the heritage to impress
their superiors in the sexy government departments like the Treasury. The
minister, Peter Brooke, is treating the department like a politician rather
than a committed believer in the arts. He shows no desire to fall on his
sword to defend its budget.
Now there seems to be squabbling inside the department. Brooke's number two,
Iain Sproat, is a right wing ideologue. While confined to the department's
responsibility for areas like sport or tourism he was not seen as a danger,
but now he is taking an interest in the arts, and is pushing a
budget-cutting line which is believed to go too far, even for Brooke. As a
cricket buff Sproat has the ear of the Prime Minister. When arts groupie
David Mellor was on hand as Heritage Minister to influence his friend the PM
that was fine; with Sproat singing a different tune the arts' access to top
table is not an advantage.
The situation is desperate because the arts are already struggling. Next
month the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts will announce
that corporate sponsorship in the UK fell for the first time ever this year
 -business cannot and will not make good any shortfall in government
support. Also the recession has hit box office revenue: audiences for plays,
dance, classical music, and art exhibitions fell in 1992-93. Only opera
bucked the trend.
The fourth potential paymaster of the arts, local authorities, have
struggled manfully to maintain their support but now they are being forced
to reduce spending. The Liverpool Everyman is facing closure as is the
Passmore Edwards Museum in Newham.
This week the government backed a British Tourist Authority wheeze to make
1995 a Festival of Arts and Culture in the UK. Over half the UK's visitors
state that the arts and entertainment are a major reason for travelling
here, and they spend Pounds 2b a year to prove it. A flourishing arts scene
pays for itself, and much more, through overseas earnings, VAT receipts, and
tourist expenditure. It seems inconceivable that the government should so
wantonly put the boot in when the arts are operating in such a hostile
financial climate.
The Arts Council has created public relations problems for itself by
belatedly getting selective over which theatres to support during a
recession. It has now withdrawn the axe from the regional theatres but the
lack of judgment has hardly helped the search for a successor to Lord
Palumbo, who retires as chairman next spring. Now the prospect of a cut in
grant must make the unpaid job look distinctly unappetising.
You can forget outsiders like Lady Archer or Peter Gummer, the PR magnate
brother of Environment Minister Gummer. The totally acceptable front runner
as the next chairman is Sir Ernest Hall, who combines business success with
an impressive commitment to the arts, not least at his Dean Clough mill
complex in Halifax where commercial concerns rub shoulder with artists to
mutual benefit.
The other weighty candidate could still be Lord Gowrie, who is likely to go
non-executive as chairman of Sotheby's Europe next year. But could he have
his eyes on supervising the Lottery-funded Millennium celebrations? Or has
that task been reserved for Lord Palumbo, who first came up with the idea?
The Lottery is, of course, the joker in the arts pack. No one dares say so
but the arts are being given a hard time now because the government believes
it has secured their long term future through this new source of funding.
Yesterday Peter Brooke gave his cautious view that the arts, the heritage,
the Millennium Fund, sport and charities could each benefit by an additional
Pounds 75m a year from 1995. In practice, and time, the figure could grow.
The money will go mainly on capital projects but these, in turn, should
improve audiences and the efficiency of arts organisations.
One problem for bodies such as the Tate or the Royal Opera House is which
Lottery budget to go for: they could make a case for Millennium money, or
heritage aid, or even to the Arts Council, for the millions needed for the
new Tate and the new Covent Garden.
The real problem will be who will pay the running costs when the projects
come on steam? This will be a restraining factor for brand new buildings.
The Lottery funding bodies, like the Arts Council, will surely favour
existing clients, whose track record they know, over fresh ideas. Even so
seed money to get work started on the brand new Cardiff Bay, home of the
Welsh National Opera, a hot tip for Millennium aid, has now been raised.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Musical tilt at romantic fiction - Andrew St George
has a diverting evening in Scarborough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the two and a half hours Love Off The Shelf is on stage at
Scarborough, Yorkshire, the queen bee of romance fiction, Dame Barbara
Cartland, will have added two dozen pages to her oeuvre. This musical at
Stephen Joseph Theatre is directed by Alan Ayckbourn and is a thoroughly
enjoyable tilt at the romantic fiction industry.
The writers Roger Hall (book), AK Grant (lyrics) and Philip Norman (music)
base their idea on the cliches lurking in publishers' tips on how to write
romance novels. Everything becomes subject to parody, which is why Love Off
The Shelf will never be a great musical, since the action is unsure where to
take itself. But this makes a good diverting evening which amounts to an
extended revue rather than the full musical works.
The action meanders between City of Angels, The Singing Detective and
Possession. Two tweedy academics are researching the dull, short life of a
poet who wrote little and is known even less - the professional's dream
project. But both are secretly writing romance novels to strict rules. Hers
is a steamy Caribbean rhumba about the fortunes of one Clare Truelove and
the 'sardonically sneering' Hamilton Squire. And his is a raunchy (the
publishers call this 'Super Desire') Irish romp involving mega-novelist Sean
O'Hara and secretary Kathleen: 'Oh, Mister O'Hara, I've read all your books'
 -'Yes, but did you buy them?' The parallel interests evolve into happy
endings, but leave the romance species looking pretty weak.
The play peddles in types. The romance hero has been dark and mysterious
ever since Byron put the 'roam' into Romantic with his infidelities; and the
heroine supine since Jane Austen's action adventure Persuasion where eyes
meet across the Octagon Room in Bath Spa and a young lady's flirtation at
Lyme Regis ends in tears and concussion. But at Scarborough the action
flirts with sex stereotypes: behind the chiselled features and black-flecked
eyes of the hero is a sensitive man; and amidst the heroine's storm of
electrical feelings and racing pulses is a shrewd, savvy woman.
The songs are unmemorable, not because they are poor, but because they
underachieve. Parodies like these push their targets to one side, but never
out of sight; so the attention they get is always divided. But the acting
and singing are energetic and witty (particularly Simon Day and Sara
Markland), if overdone at times for such a small theatre. There is a strong
chorus to open and close the second half, and a deft number from the
researchers, 'What Can it Be Like?' . . . to be famous and feted.
Ayckbourn's sure and vivid staging work with Sheila Carter's sharp
choreography to bring the tunes to life and bring onto the small revolving
stage a ski-run, a ship, a helicopter, a lighthouse, a cliff and a sequence
of diminishing palm trees to represent the departing shore; as Sam Goldwyn
used to say from ship to pier, 'Bon voyage.'
The Stephen Joseph Theatre leaves its present site after its lease expires
next season, and will move into Scarborough's former Odeon Cinema. Half the
Pounds 4.35m needed has been raised; it should be supported.
In repertory, Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, Yorkshire (0723 370541)
until November 20

reviews the revival at Covent Garden of John Cox's production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN

<TEXT>
IT WAS Tchaikovsky's express wish that the first performance of Eugene
Onegin should be given by students. He feared that practised opera singers
would find it difficult to capture the ingenuousness of the young people in
Pushkin's tale, whose inability to control their emotions destroys the lives
of those they love and - ultimately - themselves.
After 20 years of a traditional staging the Royal Opera decided this summer
to try something new. John Cox's new production went as far as the borders
of the non-representational, which proved very sparing on visual beauty and,
presumably, cost. With a fine cast of big-voiced Russians and a noted
Tchaikovsky expert in the pit it won enthusiasm. But in revival, less
carefully rehearsed, less opulently played and sung?
The irony is that visiting singers need to work doubly hard on these
characters if they are to look natural, believable young people. When Onegin
is delivering his insufferably superior rebuff to poor Tatyana, it is
unhelpful to ask her to sink to her knees and finally crumple in a heap on
the ground - the standard reaction of a rejected prima donna. What is Onegin
to do: offer to help her up or leave her there?
Dmitry Hvorostovsky left her, but without sufficient disdain as to make her
grand opera gesture seem appropriate. As Onegin, he cuts a handsome figure,
at once proud and callow (the head is held at just the right angle to
suggest assumed superiority.) All told, Onegin must be Hvorostovsky's best
role. But he is short on specific insight and the voice runs out of power at
the top, however beautiful it can be on sustained notes lower down.
The Tatyana from whom he walks away is Catherine Malfitano. Not so long ago
she was a Royal Opera Tosca, but the voice is better suited to Tchaikovsky's
youthful heroine, easily able to take the climaxes in its stride. During the
Letter Scene, the shadings of vocal colour, the conscious mirroring of the
music in her movements, all spoke of an intelligent artist who had thought
long and hard in her preparation. Too hard, perhaps: the very awareness of
what she was doing robbed her Tatyana of naive sincerity.
Giuseppe Sabbatini's Lensky is easier to deal with - straightforward, not
much inner life suggested. His tenor is reedy, sometimes constricted, but he
is able to scale it down nicely to express affection and intimacy; the end
of his aria, at least, was the work of a poet.
Eirian James, a sparkling presence in primrose yellow, was a delightful
Olga. Gwynne Howell was a picture of wise old dignity as Prince Gremin,
leaving this Onegin with his wings visibly clipped.
A sharper cut, however, to the orchestral ensemble would be desirable. The
scrambled string playing that led into the second scene was only one example
of the general laziness that robbed Mark Ermler's conducting of its stock
Russian strength.
Faced with such a succession of unimaginative and ugly designs, perhaps even
a stock Russian production would be preferable. These sets are due to go to
Monte-Carlo and Madrid. Lucky them] - but may the boat please sink on the
way back.
Further performances at the Royal Opera House until November 11; there will
be a Radio 3 live broadcast on November 6

AS WE look at current events, it is worth remembering that nationalism in
Europe is not a new phenomenon. Every student of musical history learns that
the nationalist movement flourished about 100 years ago, when composers from
countries around the periphery of Europe (Russia, Czechoslovakia, England,
Spain, Scandinavia) started to assert themselves and write music in an
identifiably national style.
This year is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Edvard Grieg, one of that
movement's leading voices. It is difficult to explain why some events
capture the record companies' attention, but others not: 1993 is also an
anniversary year for Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov, both popular composers,
yet nothing much that is new or important of theirs has surfaced on record.
Perhaps it is because they were part of a wider Russian musical tradition,
whereas Grieg stands alone - Norway's lone champion, the embodiment in music
of a whole national identity.
Any number of interesting new discs of Grieg have been coming on to the
market. The single largest offering is DG's complete recording of all
Grieg's music with orchestra, which is available either as a boxed set of
six CDs (with the full version of Peer Gynt, originally issued a couple of
years earlier) or as four single CDs. Either way one has a chance to
discover some rare music.
Like so many young musicians of his time, Grieg studied in Germany.
Throughout the 19th century Austro-German composers were dominant in the
concert-hall and it was inevitable that visiting students will have come
away thinking it right and proper to write symphonies and concertos, even
though those forms might have been foreign to the indigenous musical
tradition in their homelands.
In that respect Grieg was no different. Among his early works are one of
each - a symphony written in 1864 and the famous Piano Concerto of four
years later. For a 20 year-old, the Symphony shows a remarkable mastery of
harmony and thematic invention, but in a derivative style. It is an
exercise, very competently carried out, and Schumann seems to be the
teacher. Grieg's own verdict - that the symphony 'must never be performed' -
is probably too harsh. Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,
the performers throughout this series, make a rumbustious case for it.
The Piano Concerto was immediately more successful. So successful indeed
that its popularity has obscured the fact that it makes little out of the
concerto form, except to hang upon the basic structure a series of typically
singable Grieg tunes. A recent Prom performance showed how fresh the music
can still sound, if its embellished piano writing takes on the magic of a
Chopin Nocturne. Jarvi and his soloist, Lilya Zilberstein, are heavier. They
want the Concerto to be grand in the Rakhmaninov manner, which does not work
to its advantage.
From then on Grieg was to turn his back on the Germanic style. His
preference was for smaller forms, where he could exploit a native gift for
melody without the need to engage in dense musical arguments. Among the
purely orchestral pieces, the Symphonic Dances and the Norwegian Dances are
based on traditional Norwegian tunes. Others, such as the Lyric Suite and
the Elegiac Melodies, are arrangements of small piano pieces or songs. Jarvi
is apt to be strenuous with them, rather than easy-going, but it is useful
to have these musical picture postcards collected together.
Even Peer Gynt is really a collection of miniature mood paintings rather
than a large single canvas. (Of one movement the composer wrote 'It stinks
of cow-dung and Norwegian insularity . . . but I think people will sense the
irony behind it]') Anybody who is fond of Grieg's music will have acquired
this 1988 set already, but it is worth giving a reminder that this was the
first recording to use the complete score, as the composer originally
intended it.
The most interesting new discovery is Olav Trygvason - described as a 'torso
of an opera', but really more of a pagan oratorio. Grieg attended the first
performance of Wagner's Ring as a reporter for his local newspaper and Olav
Trygvason, begun just three years earlier, would clearly have turned out a
Norwegian epic of a similar, if more modest, kind. The opening three scenes,
which are all that he composed, are unlike other mature Grieg, raw, dark
inspiring music, all heathen chanting and sacrifical dances. Ironic that
Anne Gjevang (the reigning Erda in Wagner's Ring) is the singer here of the
portentous invocation to the Norwegian gods.
The other vocal and choral disc couples Bergliot, a melodrama with a pair of
short solo vocal works and the songs which Grieg orchestrated himself. This
last group, although containing only five songs and those not always the
most famous, is wholly delightful. Barbara Bonney and Hakan Hagegard are the
singers, who show how moving the simplest of music can be, the key to
performing Grieg.
Nevertheless, if pressed to make one choice, I would take the single disc of
songs by Anne Sofie von Otter, imaginatively accompanied at the piano by
Bengt Forsberg (it was also the choice of Gramophone magazine, which has
just made it its Record of the Year). Although she stretches the scale of
the songs to a disturbing degree, adding a minute to the timings of a couple
of them in comparison with Bonney, von Otter does use the extra time
profitably. Her performance of Haugtussa, Grieg's late song-cycle, is quite
visionary, a marvellous example of how the cold Northern personality could
melt in music and singing of such seductive warmth. I have played this disc
again and again. It is the Grieg anniversary's clear winner.

Mortimer's memoirs

ABOUT TIME TOO by Penelope Mortimer Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 16.99, 219
pages
THE PUMPKIN Eater, Penelope Mortimer's best-known novel (do you remember the
film? Anne Bancroft having a nervous breakdown in Harrods?) ends with the
following haunting and elegant lines: 'Some of these things happened, and
some were dreams. They were all true, as I understood truth. They were all
real, as I understood reality'. That might stand as introduction to About
Time Too, the second volume of her autobiography.
Penelope Mortimer is today in her mid-70s. This memoir takes us from 1940 to
1978, that is to say from her 21st birthday (when she closed her
award-winning first volume, About Time, which has just been re-issued by
Weidenfeld and Nicolson in paperback) to the purchase of a house and a
garden in the Cotswolds which will, we hope and assume, be the subject of a
third instalment.
The Pumpkin Eater was 'about' a woman who had a horde of children and was in
love with a gifted, difficult, promiscuous husband. Mrs Mortimer has six
children by various fathers and was married, for part of this new book, to
the well-known lawyer and writer John Mortimer. Mr Mortimer does not come
well out of this account and if he is realistic he will hardly have expected
to. His ex-wife favours candour and she loved him not wisely but too well.
The revelation of the infidelities, miseries and delights of a trendy
liberal marriage of the 1950s and 1960s will be eagerly consumed in many a
literary dinner party and by the up-market gossip columnists.
But this book is something better. It is, or appears to be, appallingly
honest. It is beautifully written. It is vague or erratic on detail, the
narrative fast, full of gaps, the opposite of plodding. The author does not
pretend to remember everything and only occasionally quotes from diaries -
'I scrabble and search but don't know what I'm looking for. We were in love,
ambitious and in charge of five children: those are the things that
motivated our lives' - or again, and typically, 'Only fragments of that time
survive . . .' Even so, some of the detail seems approximate.
The children are always in the forefront and always the most important thing
in her life, but this is also the story of the life of a serious writer,
blocks and all. After the success of The Pumpkin Eater she was involved in
cinema and taken up in America, a relationship which lasted surprisingly
long, eventually including a couple of spells in East Coast academia.
Although it is clear that she always belonged on this side of the Atlantic,
her description of her time in America is very good (she is so much more
interesting when she gets away from John).
Some of her vignettes are hilarious, none more so than her stories of her
friendship with Bette Davis ('She was old and hating it. 'Ten years]' she
snarled, pouring a treble whisky. 'Ten years since I had a fuck] What d'you
think of that?''). Mortimer has a writer's gift for the telling phrase: of
her mother, for instance - 'She was aggressively humble, blatantly
self-effacing, passionately frigid'; or, 'Antonia Fraser, exquisite as
usual, sitting the entire evening on a small sofa, her expression placid, as
though about to moo'. These days it is easy to forget that Penelope Mortimer
had a reputation as the author of witty, not-overly-fictitious short stories
in the New Yorker, before she produced the novels she is most proud of - My
Friend Says It's Bulletproof, The Home, Long Distance.
Perhaps the detail is thin because she spent so much of the time on pills -
not just the 'uppers' that fuelled that generation but the drugs her
successive psychiatrists prescribed with such lunatic nonchalance. She tells
of a lifelong struggle with Depression, of breakdowns, a suicide bid,
electric shock treatment, nursing homes.
There have been plenty of men in her life, and she is happy to name names,
but this book, like her adult life, is dominated by John. 'Whatever the pain
and fury connected with John as a husband, as an individual he was my only
familiar'. She is not unaware of his own dilemmas: of a final bid at a
reconciliation, she writes, 'There is no point, either for writer or reader,
in telling it all as it was, except to say that it was perhaps the nearest
John has ever been to hell, a place on which, as a day-tripper, I thought
myself an authority. John was a novice at unhappiness . . .'
John eventually married a second, much younger Penelope and Penelope the
First worked at her escape. America came in useful. In the end she returned
home and bought a cottage in Chastleton. I know she is about to become a
gardener.

IN EUROPE'S NAME: GERMANY AND THE DIVIDED CONTINENT by Timothy Garton Ash
Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 680 pages
IN FEBRUARY 1989, during an interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, I asked
why he no longer used the word 'Wiedervereinigung' (reunification) to
describe West Germany's constitutional goal of unity with East Germany. Kohl
said he preferred the phrase 'Einheit der Nation' (unity of the nation).
'Under Wiedervereinigung one understood something else, the attachment of
the GDR (East Germany) to the Federal Republic,' he explained. 'Isn't that
the idea?' I persisted. 'The idea - the vision - is that we want the
political unity of Europe,' the chancellor replied, somewhat lamely. When I
rammed home the question again, Kohl burst out: 'The difference is that you
are a prophet, and I am only the chancellor.'
That dialogue - just nine months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 20
months before Kohl became chancellor of united Germany - certainly shows how
unification came as a surprise. It also neatly illustrates a theme at the
centre of Timothy Garton Ash's immaculate account of German post-war
Ostpolitik.
Successive West German chancellors believed that 'reunification' could only
take place as part of a gradual move towards ending the overall division of
Europe that formed the (apparently) enduring legacy of Hitler's war.
In view of their belief that a speedy 'attachment' of the GDR was
impossible, West German governments during the 1970s and 1980s concentrated
on stabilising East Germany politically and economically. By improving the
lot of East Germans, they believed the policy would facilitate democratic
reforms - judged the best long-term route to reforging the nation.
In fact, West Germany's unjustified confidence in East Germany's solidity
prevented rather than furthered reforms east of the Elbe. But, at a time
when Michail Gorbachev was trying to remodel Soviet communism, East
Germany's out-of-touch leaders' refusal to follow suit dramatically
increased their own unpopularity and their state's economic problems.
West and East German illusions about East Germany's ability to survive thus
reinforced each other. Collapse into the arms of its prosperous, alarmed
neighbour-brother became inevitable, precisely because it was unexpected.
Garton Ash's teasingly dialectical writing style is well suited to
describing a plot of Smileyesque convolutedness. Unique sensitivities
surrounded (and surround still) German reunification. The path to it was
thus a game of mirrors. From Konrad Adenauer's time onward, no policy, no
action, no statement, no objective, no outcome - and certainly no
politician's after-the-event account of any of these things - could ever be
taken at face value.
This was a cautious journey, not only two-track, but also in two directions
at once. Efforts first to form and then to develop relationships with the
Soviet Union and the GDR would succeed only if Bonn at the same time made
maximum efforts to extend its anchor within the European Community and Nato.
Two points stand out. The first is that the Soviet Union, with a taste for
and understanding of Realpolitik surpassing that of the word's original
inventors, had a good idea all along of what was going on. Referring to the
reasons behind Chancellor Willy Brandt's overtures to East Berlin, Leonid
Brezhnev warned East German leader-to-be Erich Honecker in 1970: 'He expects
to penetrate you.' Brezhnev added (half-correctly), 'But with time he will
find that ever harder.'
The Soviet Union had far more insight than West Germany into East Germany's
true weakness, and also probably during the 1980s sensed it would not send
in the Red Army should Honecker's power totter. Gorbachev was charmed by
Kohl's daringly sentimental talk - during a walk by the Rhine in June 1989 -
of how reunification would be in both nations' long term interests.
An agonising choice for Gorbachev, to be sure. German unification might well
profit Russia. First, however, as part of the dismantling of the Stalinist
order, the Soviet empire would have to disappear.
The second point relates to West Germany's relations with its eastern and
western European neighbours. The Federal Republic's transmutation into a
modern, efficient, non-revanchist EC state - both model and magnet -
increased its economic power and its reputation as a reliable partner.
Because everyone in Europe (Bonn included) believed Wiedervereinigung was no
longer feasible, the Federal Republic, almost imperceptibly, gained the
leverage and muscle to put it speedily into effect when the chance came.
After the Wall fell, Margaret Thatcher's unrealistic (and small-mindeded)
assessment that Kohl should try to delay reunification matched the
chancellor's equally inaccurate avowal (in 1988) that he would not live to
see it.
As he applies his spatula to this canvas of paradox and dilemma, Garton Ash
paints in the emotions as well as the politics guiding the practitioners of
Ostpolitik. The Social Democrats' veteran strategist, Egon Bahr, is rebuked
 -despite the brilliance and eventual success of his 1963 concept of Wandel
durch Annaherung (change through rapprochement) - for increasing the SPD's
disarray in 1980s dealings with East Berlin.
For all the book's copiousness, there are some lacunae. More detailed
treatment of Bonn's late-1980s dispute with the allies over short-range
nuclear missiles - crucial to inspiring solidarity among East and West
Germans, since they would be the only people killed if the weapons were ever
fired - would have been welcome. Garton Ash glosses over the remarkable lack
of curiosity towards East Germany by the West German media - cause and
effect of declining belief in Wiedervereinigung.
While he offers the exceedingly general precepts that united Germany should
redefine its national interests and avoid 'emotional over-reaction', Garton
Ash ducks analysis of the effects of unification on the rest of Europe. Kohl
sees his new twin-track task as combining German unity with European unity.
Successfully steering both processes may, however, prove as daunting as
anything faced by the architects of Ostpolitik.

THE MAGUS OF THE NORTH Isaiah Berlin John Murray Pounds 14.99, 144 pages
IN THE words of the Marquis de Condorcet, the Age of Enlightenment dawned
'when the human spirit moved in its chains, loosening all and breaking some;
when old opinions were examined and errors attacked; when customs were
questioned, and all minds took unexpected flight towards liberty.' The key
belief of the Enlightenment was that reason can deliver humanity from the
tyrannies of superstition, ignorance, and outworn convention, replacing them
with science and philosophy as guides.
The Enlightenment began in England and reached its maturity in France. Isaac
Newton showed that nature can be understood in terms of simple universal
laws; John Locke taught that 'the faculty of reasoning never deceives those
who trust in it'. The implication is that human intelligence can understand
the world and improve man's lot within it. Soon a group of French
philosophes was translating an English encyclopaedia, expanding and
transforming it into a revolutionary bible of rationalism, making the 18th
century outstanding as a time of hope for human progress.
The century might belong to reason's champions, but not all shared their
view; de Bachaumont complained that the philosophes 'seem deliberately to
aim at carrying a fatal clarity into men's minds.' But the most bitter of
the Enlightenment's contemporary opponents was the Prussian-born writer
Johann Georg Hamann, the 'Magus of the North' who is the subject of Isaiah
Berlin's new book.
Berlin's aim is to reclaim Hamann from obscurity. Hamann is 'the first
out-and-out opponent' of the Enlightenment, whose sharply uncompromising
hostility to it makes him 'the true founder of a polemical anti-rationalist
tradition which in the course of time has done much, for good and (mostly)
ill, to shape the thought and art and feeling of the West.' Berlin does not
share or approve Hamann's views; he writes about him as a 'witness of a
great deal that is truly revealing in the scattered, unsystematic,
passionate' writings of a man who figures high among 'the important if often
maddening irregulars of civilisation'.
Hamann was intensely religious. He came from the German pietist tradition,
which emphasises personal faith and direct communion with God, and
correspondingly despises 'book learning' and intellectualism. For Hamann
this meant commitment to blind faith and an angry rejection of the claims of
reason. He did not write systematic treatises, because that would conform to
the methods of those he attacked, with their goals of scientific clarity and
logical order. He wrote instead in outbursts and harangues, allowing his
views to emerge from essays that are often incoherent and deliberately
obscure.
The chief of Hamann's doctrines is that knowledge is wholly a matter of
animal faith. It is not the result of ratiocination; it is communicated by
God, spirit to spirit, in direct experience. Hamann hated science, which he
accused of describing the universe as a lifeless abstraction, thus
falsifying its divine, creative, spontaneous nature as the place where God,
who is 'a poet not a mathematician', might make anything happen.
Hamann hated all who were party to the scientific and rationalising ethos of
the time. This included not just philosophers, but everybody from Europe's
Jews to Prussia's Frederick the Great.
His zeal did not make him conventionally moralistic. Like William Blake he
considered sexuality good rather than evil. Flesh and the passions do not
sin, he argued, by existing; they can be misled by cold reason, but if they
are employed according to the instincts in which life itself consists, they
cannot be wrong. 'My coarse imagination,' Hamann wrote to Herder, 'has never
been able to picture a creative spirit without genitalia'. He identified
repression with rationality; children, he points out, have no false sense of
prudery.
Berlin wrote this account of Hamann 30 years ago. It is published only now
because Berlin's editor, Henry Hardy, onlyrecently discovered the manuscript
among Berlin's papers. It was a lucky find, for this is an appropriate
juncture for Hamann's thought to be discussed, if for nothing else as a
powerful example of the anti-rationalism which is again invading the world.
At the time Berlin wrote, it seemed natural to liken Hamann to the
Existentialists in some respects (the emphasis on instinct and feeling) and
to Wittgenstein in others (the obscurantist hostility to science and
theory). These comparisons wear well. If one wishes to see what blind
religious faith and hatred of rationality look like at their most eloquent,
Hamann is exemplary. Even if one is repulsed by unreason and its forces, one
must understand them; again Hamann is exemplary. So Berlin does a profound
service in restoring this philosophical whirlwind to our notice and helping
us, in his characteristically lucid way, to appreciate its content and
power.

THE MODERN BRITISH NOVEL by Malcolm Bradbury Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 20, 512
pages
AS I read this survey of the British novel over the past 100 years, I have a
picture before me from the silent movie screen. Our hero, played by Buster
Keaton, running for all he is worth in the middle of the railroad track, is
in hot pursuit of a moving train; just as he seems to be reaching it, the
train accelerates and pulls away from him. Clamping his hat firmly on his
head, he makes a superhuman effort and struggles on top just before the
train reaches the tunnel. He emerges clinging to the outside of the last
carriage covered in grime and soot.
No ingratitude is intended for a book from which I have benefited
enormously, and that has already acquired an honoured place on my reference
shelves, but there seems something similarly farcical and heroic in
Bradbury's attempt to discuss, or at least mention, every novel of some
significance by a British novelist published since the 1870s. Bradbury has
peppered his pages with an overwhelming plethora of names. At the conclusion
he appends a further List of Major Works from 1876 to the present that, he
says, 'reaches well beyond the authors it has been possible to cover in the
text but, though full, remains personal and selective.'
An idea of the extent of ground covered may be seen from two successive
entries in this list:
'DOYLE, ARTHUR CONAN (1859-1930). A Study in Scarlet (1887), The Sign of
Four (1890), The White Company (1891), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
(1892), The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes (1894), The Return of Sherlock
Holmes(1905) DOYLE, RODDY (1958- ) The Commitments (1988), The Snapper
(1990), Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (1993).'
Roddy Doyle is one of six favoured novelists on another list - the short
list of this year's Booker Prize for fiction to be awarded next Tuesday and
Doyle's novel on that list is the last one mentioned above by Bradbury. It
consists of an Irish schoolboy's random thoughts at a time when his parent's
marriage is breaking up. If it wins it will be very good going on Bradbury's
part to have got it in.
After Joyce and Beckett whom he deals with at length, Bradbury is
surprisingly weak on the Irish contribution. It is where the master-word
'British' in his title poses problems. He glances only summarily at major
writers like Brian Moore and William Trevor, and as for more recent ones he
is content with a quick round-up in his final chapter, '1979 to the
Present':
'Ireland (he writes) had of course long been a major centre of important
fiction in the English language, to the point where its tradition now seemed
distinct and independent. Still, a significant part of the best fiction read
in Britain came from there. To the work of well-established notables . . .
were now added the novels of John Banville . . . John McGahern . . . Claire
Boylan . . . Deirdre Madden . . . Neil Jordan . . . Patrick McCabe . . .'
It is not by such scrambles against the time-control that the book must be
judged but by the earlier chapters where the story is told of the novel's
fluctuating fortunes from the days of Hardy, George Moore, Kipling through
the two world wars and the decades that followed. These chapters are
exemplary, models of clarity and compression. Not only does Bradbury deal
with the various clusters of novelists who give a period its distinctive
tone, he sees well beyond them to the historical events, the main influences
from abroad and the critical theory to which they reacted.
Bradbury starts his survey in 1878 because it was around then that the
Modern (in the opposite sense to Victorian) novel began to emerge; it was
then that Henry James, recently settled in London, went to what he thought
was tea with George Eliot whom he revered. No tea was served and as James
was leaving her lover GH Lewes handed him a couple of books. They were the
two volumes of his The Europeans that had been sent on in advance of the
visit.
In that put-down of the emerging Modern by the declining Victorian, Bradbury
finds an emblem of the great fictional take-over. In The Portrait of a Lady
published two years later James canonised his debt to Eliot in the use he
made of the feminine consciousness in his novel. From then on Bradbury's
survey is sign-posted by words like modernism, realism, surrealism,
post-modernism, post-post-modernism, utopianism, and dystopianism (a word
that crops up more and more as the century progresses and describes a novel
like Orwell's 1984). The familiar names - Ford Madox Ford (whose complex
novels are excellently expounded), Forster, Lawrence, Woolf, Dorothy
Richardson, Evelyn Waugh (still underrated, Bradbury thinks), Huxley, Green,
Greene, Isherwood, Koestler, Angus Wilson, Iris Murdoch, Anthony Burgess,
remain in their predictable places in an intricate chronological tapestry.
As an example of the amount of critical punch Bradbury can pack into a
couple of sentences take this comment on the world of Ivy Compton-Burnett:
'The time is that less of late-Victorian life than the late-Victorian novel,
which Compton-Burnett does not reject but subverts, preserving it in an
eternal stasis, for repeated decoding. This is the eternal world of Samuel
Butler's The Way of All Flesh and Edmund Gosse's Father and Son, and
Butler's deep irony and Gosse's sense of patriarchal crisis are both
essential elements of her method.'
An old stager like CP Snow gets his due as a traditional realist and there
are comparisons between him and his 'saga novel' - the Strangers and
Brothers sequence - and others who have written novels on the instalment
plan, Henry Williamson, Anthony Powell, Doris Lessing in her Martha Quest
sequence. In further comments on Lessing Bradbury underlines the importance
of The Golden Notebook.
As the train moves closer to the present we become curious to see who is on
board and who is not. Muriel Spark and Margaret Drabble are both comfortably
esconced in a first-class compartment and so are AS Byatt and Angela Carter,
the latter with an amazing amount of luggage. John Fowles gets in at the
West Country, and we find the two Amises, pere et fils in the restaurant car
with Peter Ackroyd.
The fils whom Bradbury rates as highly as the pere and whose style derived
from Saul Bellow he discusses, is described as 'a pained post-modern
ironist'. Salman Rushdie has a carriage to himself; good to see his work
assessed on its true artistic merits for a change. John Le Carre, JG
Ballard, Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Graham Swift, Iain Banks, are
all aboard, and so are Beryl Bainbridge, Elaine Feinstein, Alice Thomas
Ellis (but not AE Ellis), Penelope Fitzgerald, A L Barker, Bernice Rubens,
Emma Tennant, Rose Tremain . . . but I could go on for ever. The reliable
old locomotive called the novel continues to pull this lot steadily along
and shows no sign even now of running out steam.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Gardening: A roving eye on beds and borders - Robin Lane Fox
follows the tracks of a TV camera in Kiftsgate Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BEFORE the frost cuts off the garden's bright spots, I find myself
standing in the right spot at the right time. Do not accuse me of being
smug: you have been there, too, if you have been watching the television
series on English countrywomen's gardens.
The last but one episode looked at Kiftsgate Court in Gloucestershire, where
the surviving two of three generations of gardening women were
characteristically modest. From the programme, you might not have guessed
how much we can all learn and enjoy from their accessible garden, maintained
in the same female line for more than 70 years. Some 20,000 visitors
probably agree with me, having propelled the takings at the gate to a record
this year.
In the mid-October sunshine, I followed the tracks of the TV camera in
midsummer. Out of season, it is legitimate to pick, choose and be selfish.
There is no longer the tension between being fair to the plan and the site
as a whole, and trying to note down all the plans which you want for
yourself, as if the garden was a lesson in shopping or an encounter with a
master chef.
In mid-October, the main shapes of the borders have died away; the forms of
old trees may be appealing, but the owners did not often plant them for the
particular effect of their last flourish while the garden around is dying.
You can justly make for whatever plant takes your eye, and size it up for
yourself, without such a context.
Kiftsgate in mid-October no longer emerges from a haze of Chinese deutzias
and striped old roses. Where the TV camera showed profusion, now there is a
mixture of leaves on the turn and particular subjects with a long season
which ask to be copied.
Few of us will ever garden where our grandmother gardened before us, and not
many of us enjoy the Kiftsgate range of soil and favourable micro-climate.
Marginal plants are hardy, even at the top of their very steep hill. Others
run wild in the soil.
Away from the south-west, few of us can grow the glorious madrona tree,
Arbutus menziesii, which is the queen of large-leaved evergreens and, so
far, is indecently happy in this corner of Gloucestershire. Rather more of
us have planted the famous white Kiftsgate rose; but those who visit it at
home will fear for their safety.
It has now run sky-high up two beech trees and the single plant has spread
for several hundred yards, proving that it is totally unsuitable for most of
the gardens where it has been planted. In your grandchildren's day, whole
areas of previous cultivation will have disappeared in a monstrous thicket.
At a simpler level, there are plants which stand out at this late season and
encourage us all to want them. Sometimes, it is a matter of proving the
right way to treat something. On the side of the house, I noticed out of
season how the tall, yellow-flowered Moroccan brooms, Cytisus battandieri,
have been pruned ruthlessly to a main framework after high summer. I have
always been nervous about cutting too far into this silky/grey-leaved shrub
for walls; but they have cut it for years at Kiftsgate and it flowers far
better for a hard trim.
Round the corner, I have learnt how to use a wonderful foliage plant. After
the recent frosts, the sea-green Melianthus major may not be looking so
noble, but they give it every chance at Kiftsgate by isolating it in a clay
pot all to itself. The leaves are a superb, serrated sea-green with pale,
apple-green flower stems which make me want to browse on them.
In sheltered corners or against the walls of a botanic garden, this
excellent plant often will live on through the years, being cut to the
ground in cold winters. With me, it usually dies if left outdoors after
mid-November. It has to go into a pot, but I now realise that it is five
times as good if it is not battling for attention in mixed company. At
Kiftsgate, one plant goes in one pot alone and has the impact of a good
piece of sculpture.
Nearer ground level, I picked and chose among ideas which most of us neglect
or do not know. One of my successes this year has been a hardy white sorrel
called Oxalis Bowles White, which derived from the great Bowles' garden at
Enfield. It flowers for most of the summer, but I now see that Oxalis
articulata would be almost as good and much easier for you to find. It is a
favourite at Kiftsgate, where it flowers continuously at a height of 6in
above leaves, like shamrock.
Just round the corner, you encounter a good companion, the yellow-flowered
flax, Linum arboreum, with its good, evergreen leaves, another long-lasting
plant which the rest of us overlook nowadays.
On the main terrace, the salvias are an important presence' but would any of
them survive a winter? Yearly, the list grows, tempting us all towards the
greenhouse side of the family. At Kiftsgate, however, the owners consider
that the tall, hooded flowers of Salvia candelabrum are certainly hardy,
encouraging me to try it wherever stems could come up through a bed to a
height of 3-4ft.
To one side spread the trailing groups of Geranium Buxton's Blue, reminding
all visitors that this form is still the finest late-flowering variety to
spread through a low undergrowth or run across the front of a border. The
small-leaved Fuschia thymiflora is less familiar, but it has been hardy here
for several years, like other small-flowered forms, and is a charming
contrast to the last penstemons and the white flowers as second crop on the
evergreen prostanthera.
In the late sunshine, did anything turn up for those everyday problems, a
semi-shaded corner or the difficult dry ground under trees? The latter runs
all down Kiftsgate's steep slope between the upper and lower gardens of its
hillside site: hardy cyclamen are one spectacular answer, but the other is
the lesser-known Campanula latiloba.
The violet-flowered Highcliffe form has run for years on this steep slope in
dry soil: I first copied it nearly 30 years ago and have now added the good
white form and the mauve one called Hidcote Amethyst. Young plants need to
be dead-headed quickly in order to encourage the side growth, but they do
make tough mats of fresh leaves which send up flower stems about 2ft high,
even in the bone-dry ground below a hedge. You need to see them in a garden
as old as this one to feel confident that they are so tough.
In semi-shade, I go first for Japanese anemones, pink and especially white:
after Kiftsgate, I now think of them with one of the tough, lace-cap
hydrangeas called Preziosa and fresh, evergreen skimmias and clumps of the
curious tricyrtis, or toad lilies.
The Plantfinder lists 26 varieties of this late-blooming beauty, the flowers
of which usually are spotted so as to resemble a toad's skin with purple
markings. They need slight moisture throughout the year and a lightly-shaded
aspect, but they are not all difficult so long as you do not ram them with a
fork before they wake up early in summer.
After the main season, great gardens with continuity through generations
outclass the rest of us because they can show such plants at settled
maturity and include such a range that you can pick and choose happily on a
slow walk during an afternoon.
When we film them, we always seem to do so in the full flush of summer, or
their best season. We are either restricted to close-ups or such personal
detail or eccentricity as the owner can be coaxed into releasing for the
occasion. Very few people who love and understand gardens will ever make
feature films: they prefer to garden and be left alone.
As a result, it is always worth following the camera's footsteps and seeing
for yourself what has been elided for the sake of an idea of what the public
is prepared to enjoy.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Fishing: Long to rain over us . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE RAIN. As I write, it is still belting down. Water is cascading off the
roof and gurgling in the gutters. The rivers are threatening to burst their
banks.
Amid such plenty, it is odd to recall the scourge of drought. Two years ago,
the land cracked and baked, the rivers shrank until they were rivers no more
and it seemed the dry spell might never end. The merchants of doom wrung
their hands, predicting irreversible ruin.
Even then, though, I did not give up hope entirely. I knew the wonderful
capacity of rivers to renew themselves. If only, we prayed, if only it would
rain again as it should in England, salvation was still possible.
I remember, three Septembers ago, visiting a stretch of the upper Kennet on
which I had received my rudimentary self-education in dry fly fishing a
decade or so before. Then, early in the 1980s, it was a lovely piece of
water to behold, crystal clear, bright with weed and golden gravel, alive
with the right sort of insects and fine, canny trout.
On my return, it was as if a plague had struck. The bed of the stream was
dark and lifeless, the weed and gravel smothered in silt. The water itself
was thick with gobbets of algae, the surface still and scummy. The trout
which remained darted through the murk, as if searching in vain for the
river's innocent past.
The curse was lack of water. The aquifers had been sucked dry and the
springs were defunct. What water there was hardly moved. Without current,
the river had ceased to be a river and had become something else - a ditch.
John Hounslow, the keeper of that fishery - a bright, purposeful, energetic
man - did not try to disguise the scale of tragedy. But even then, in his
despair, he never lost hope. Given two or three decent winters of rain, he
said imploringly, the river he loved would be reborn.
So, this autumn, to obtain a condition check, I went to see him again. It
was a grim day, the sky the colour of coffin lead. As we made our way down
to the river, the heavens opened and remained open.
Once, he explained, river-keeping had been a simple game. You kept the banks
clear, cut the weed, stocked the fish, cleared the hatch gates and listened
politely to the anglers. Now, though, he had of necessity become a
self-taught hydrodynamic engineer.
The problem he faced was this. A chalk stream must have the right sort of
weed if the insects and the trout are to flourish. The right sort of weed is
ranunculus, and it will grow only on a gravel bottom kept clean of silt by
an adequate current.
He showed me where, with back-breaking labour, he had narrowed the water
course to increase the flow; and where he placed tons of rock on the river
bed to create little groynes, or underwater breaks; anything to accelerate
the passing of the water. Along one stretch, the whole had been shifted
sideways to restrict its spread and squeeze the flow.
It was working. Everywhere were signs of returning life: in some places, a
mere trail of ranunculus; in others, true beds of weed, thick green masses
nourishing shrimp and nymphs, creating larders for trout. And the water,
clear and pure as ever, was moving again.
The sickness. however, had by no means departed. Despite several weeks of
almost constant rain, the level of water was still pitifully low compared
with what I remembered of this fishery in its prime.
The top stretch, for instance, remained virtually barren of weed, even
though the bed has been kept clean. The springs which feed the Kennet at its
source are still too depleted to provide the volume of water needed to
restore complete well-being.
So, the patient is convalescent. There is life where, a year or two ago, all
one could see was a creeping death. Strength is returning, but slowly,
slowly.
For a full recovery, time is needed, and the constant care and attention of
a dedicated keeper. Ultimately, though, the fate of the river is beyond the
power of mere men to determine. Nature must do its stuff. Let the gentle
rain drop from heaven - and keep dropping.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Property: Better - but not good - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WAS THE bad weather in September too much for the property market? Or were
sober assessments of family finances for the coming year to blame,
especially as nobody knows what nasty medicines the chancellor will
administer in November?
Whatever the reason, business was less than agents had expected. Such words
as 'flat' and 'patchy' - even 'stagnant' - could be heard. Buyers remain
willing to wait or withdraw unless house and price match perfectly. And
while the Corporate Estate Agents property index reported September sales
7.5 per cent up on August, they were below the February-July monthly totals.
One property that is likely to sell quickly, however, is Erwarton Hall, on
the Shotley peninsula in Suffolk. New on the market, it is a brick, grade
II-listed Elizabethan house with plenty of bedrooms plus a great hall with
minstrels' gallery, heated indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna.
Its glory is a 1549 gatehouse, looking like an upturned multi-legged table
in brick, directing visitors to the front door. Strutt &amp; Parker
(0473-214841) is seeking offers over Pounds 450,000.
Why so little? As a repossessed property, it is empty, which does not help
selling. Also, there are farm buildings against one of the boundaries, it is
far down the peninsula, and the view across the river Stour includes Harwich
docks. But it looks good value, especially with its gatehouse.
*****
IN CAMBRIDGE, St John's College has created the city's first true crescent
(rather than a sweeping road). The Crescent, designed by John Blair of local
architect Saunders Boston, and built with care by Amey, is aligned on the
axis of Churchill College across the road, enhancing both buildings. It has
16 town houses and five detached houses behind. At the side is housing that
college staff, graduate students and visiting fellows can afford in a city
where demand far exceeds supply and prices and rents are high as a result.
Town house prices start at Pounds 69,950 and the detached houses at Pounds
187,500. The agents are Carter Jonas (0223-68 771) and Redmayne Arnold &amp;
Harris (0223-323 130).
*****
IN OXFORD, New College is selling 16 lordships of the manor in places where
it no longer owns property. A minimum price of Pounds 5,000 allows the buyer
to be styled lord of the manor of, say, Newton Longville (or elsewhere) and
pass that on to an heir - but brings little else. Buyers pay a 10 per cent
premium, or 2.5 per cent if they are former New College men and women.
Inquiries to Cluttons (071-408-1010).
*****
IF YOU hanker after water views, but do not want to move to distant parts,
try Bishops Bowl Lakes. They lie in an old limestone quarry at Bishop's
Itchington, Warwickshire (between Banbury and Warwick), where two fossilised
plesiosaurs and an ichthyosaur were found in 1928. The lakes are for sale
from John D. Wood (0865-311522), which is seeking offers well in excess of
Pounds 1m.
When I visited them on a cold and frosty morning, steam was rising from the
water between the layered limestone cliffs as it began to warm in the
morning sun. Duck and a snipe were in the reeds. Yet, this romantic
wilderness is only 30 miles from Birmingham and Leicester and a mere 17 from
Coventry.
The lakes have planning permission for a private house, club houses and
fishing lodges, and could easily be a leisure centre for the Midlands since
they are only three miles from junction 12 on the M40.
At present, there is fishing, and water sports in the summer. If I had the
money, I should forget the leisure centre and build a large, low house for
watching the birds and enjoying Warwickshire at its wildest.

WHO BUYS a tax haven in the Channel Islands, where you can be free of UK
income tax? Answer: very rich people who might have to pay the tax. Last
year, Monaco-based reclusive twin brothers David and Frederick Barclay -
placed 62nd in Business Age's most recent list of Britain's wealthiest
people - bought The European newspaper from the ruins of the Maxwell empire.
Now, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley has sold them Brecqhou, a small island off Sark
in the Channel Islands. WHO The asking price was Pounds 3.5m. David Barclay
also gets a seat on Sark's governing body, the Chief Pleas.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Property: A dormitory for the world - Look behind Surrey's
suburban facade and you will find that plenty of attractive countryside
remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THINK OF Surrey and you might bring to mind the Oval, home of the county
cricket club with its base in south London next to a gas tank. Or the annual
university boat race, with either Oxford or Cambridge taking the Surrey
station. Or the chalky North Downs that form Surrey's natural frontier with
the sticky clay of the Sussex Weald to the south. Or commuters . . .
In the last century, the railways turned Surrey from a place of farms and
market towns into a dormitory for London. Cars continued the work, bringing
arterial roads and ribbon development. Now, set between Heathrow and Gatwick
airports, it is a dormitory for the whole world. But look again. It is
extraordinary how much countryside survives.
Between the old and new Surreys is the county of architect Edwin Lutyens and
garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. Many of his houses are expanded cottages,
built in the traditional materials of south-east England. He loved the
mixture of half-timbering and brick, with lots of wood indoors, leaded
lights in windows and hanging tiles as a wall cladding (there originally to
stop rain destroying the fill between the timbers).
Indeed, the pull and the sense of comfort these materials exude have been so
strong that thousands of 19th and 20th century houses in the county use
them. For mansion or shed, the cottage style predominates. And it is hard to
tell the age of a house. Are the bricks 1930 or 1630? A common answer in
Surrey is that you can get both.
Demand for houses has picked up this year - a problem, since there have not
been enough suitable properties available. This has meant slightly firmer
prices - 'an increase of 3-5 per cent,' according to Michael Parry-Jones, of
agent Browns - and some very quick sales.
James Wilson, of search consultant Wilson &amp; Wilson, attributes the renewed
interest in Surrey to prices being at pre-1987 levels. Despite this,
September was not so busy as agents had hoped.
One Lutyens' house for sale is The Old Barn outside the village of Holmbury
St Mary. He was not yet 30 when he converted the barn - which had been
brought from Slinfold in Sussex - and gave it an almost vice-regal drawing
room (although at hill station level, not his later New Delhi grandeur). He
even conjured a small room between the backs of the two chimney hearths. The
stone slab roof is vastly solid, and it has a good garden. Browns in
Cranleigh is asking Pounds 495,000.
A superb garden, but one for serious gardeners only - it has part of the
National Collection of magnolias - is Tilgates, near Reigate. Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley is asking Pounds 600,000 for the house and seven acres of garden. The
same agent is seeking Pounds 1m for Reel Hall, near Guildford, with beams
and inglenooks galore; and offers over Pounds 820,000 for Crocknorth House
(knapped flint and brick) near East Horsley, with a stable cottage and 12.5
acres in an official area of outstanding natural beauty.
Barnfield, at Dunsfold, is a small estate (74 acres) for Pounds 1.25m (from
Hamptons). In Shamley Green, Hill Clements is selling Timbers (the house has
them) near the cricket field and duck pond for Pounds 400,000.
For over Pounds 500,000 there is Tangley Way, a 1920s' traditional house at
Blackheath, near Guildford; while the Cherry Tree Cottage in Holmbury St
Mary, thatched and dating from the 1930s, costs Pounds 245,000 from the same
agent.
Worplesdon is famous for its golf club. Houses for sale in the district from
Hamptons include:
Bridley Manor, a fine example of Tudoresque (offers over Pounds 1.5m).
Nortons Farm, which goes back to the 17th century but now has electronic
gates, a stable yard, loose boxes and 13.5 acres (for Pounds 725,000,).
The Old Mill House, a Georgian brick box defiantly not in the traditional
style. In an era of mock-Victorian conservatories, it is a joy that it has
an original Victorian greenhouse. Price: Pounds 500,000.
The Manor House in Bletchingley is also Georgian, but the property has been
divided. Price: Pounds 300,000 (from Savills). Near Haslemere, the same
agent has Stedlands Farm, listed Grade II and basically 17th century, for
around Pounds 650,000.
At nearby Linchmere, the 1937 Queen Anne-style Gillhams House is going for
Pounds 725,000 (Hamptons), and the adjacent Gillhams Farm for Pounds 800,000
(Savills); this includes a cottage made out of a tithe barn.
In Ockley, between Dorking and Horsham and close to Sussex, Lane Fox is
selling Elderslie House, which has a cedar tree on the front lawn and is
almost opposite the village cricket pitch, for Pounds 400,000.
At Ripley, close to the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley,
Savills offers Dunsborough Park, basically Georgian, with 62 acres for
Pounds 1.45m; and Hamptons has the traditional Home Wood Farm in a price
range of Pounds 625,000-675,000 for the main lot which includes plenty of
farm buildings. The other lots are fields, some already under offer for
grazing.
Two intriguing houses to finish. The Moat House in Guildford is a
castellated Victorian coach house, gloriously Gothic with a garden probably
laid out in the 1840s as part of the Weycliffe Pleasure Gardens. The price
for this hidden gem is around Pounds 350,000 (from Browns).
In Merstham, two miles from Redhill, the vendor himself is selling the 1925
Knockando Manor, designed by the Scottish architect Louis Beaton McDonald.
Much of it McDonald built himself, using fireplaces from older houses and
front doors from a City bank.
Its deep pink colour reminds one of Scandinavia, where he is said to have
built the first 'spaghetti junction' in Oslo. Inquiries: 0737-643171.

Davenport samples local cuisine

<TEXT>
TERENA IS a small village, not far from Redondo, which is famed for its
pottery. It has a Templar church, a beautiful slate pillory, and the remains
of a 13th century castle. But another good reason for going there is Miga's
restaurant - a fine example of Portuguese cuisine.
Two cottages knocked into one, it has a choice of eating areas. In summer,
you can sit outside under an olive tree on a geranium terrace serenaded by
an orchestra of cicadas. In winter, there are dining rooms with log fires.
The food, like the decor, is simple and well executed: flavoursome and
without unnecessary elaboration, but presented with care.
First, we were given a selection of appetisers: briny black olives, tangy
sheep cheese from Nisa, and tiny sardine-like fish in saor (fried, soused in
vinegar, dribbled with olive oil and served with strips of pickled carrot).
The bread was good and the soups were even better. Hot tomato soup was
flecked with oregano and green coriander, swirled with olive oil and served
with a choice of boiled egg or salt cod if wanted.
Gazpacho was the pale pink of vin rose and almost as thin as wine, as
elegant and refreshing as any I have ever tasted.
Then came a richly flavoured version of migos, a mixture of bread with
garlic, bits of chorizo-type sausage, and fresh pork pan-fried in its own
juices.
This is not a summer dish (somehow, it is reminiscent of bubble and squeak)
but I could not resist it. Next time, I shall also try the partridge
escabeche and pig's muzzle with beans.
Owners Susana Bianchi and Aboim Arnaldo opened the restaurant just four
years ago so that guests at Casa de Terena (the B &amp; B she runs at the other
end of the street) would not have to go to Redondo for meals. But Casa de
Terena is a useful place to lay your head if you have dined too well at
Miga's to want to drive on.
The six rooms come with no frills but all the basics. Each has its own
shower or bathroom, an electric ceiling fan to keep the temperature down in
summer and a radiator or wood stove to keep you cosy in winter.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Food and Drink: Technique saves the day - Edmund
Penning-Rowsell considers the 1993 clarets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first 10 days of August there was the prospect of a very fine claret
vintage in Bordeaux but severe gales, followed by weeks of rain, changed the
prospects radically. September was the wettest month since the disastrous
1965 vintage.
Yet, if 1993 will not turn out another vintage-of-the-century candidate, it
will not be a catastrophe either as some favourable conditions were
maintained, ensuring at least a large proportion of healthy, fairly mature
grapes.
The skins were very thick and there was little or no rot for those chateaux
equipped to deal with earlier mildew and botrytis, and which had
summer-pruned their vines (vendange verte) in July. Mouton-Rothschild
sprayed its vineyard 14 times rather than the normal nine.
Merlot grapes always ripen before the Cabernets. Those who picked them early
brought healthy grapes of good alcoholic strength into the fermentation vats
 -as I saw in a number of chateaux. Large troupes of pickers were employed,
and Petrus was entirely picked on September 24 and 25.
Selection was all-important in the vineyard as well as before being tipped
into the hoppers. There were none of the clouds of rot dust that, in bad
years, rise as damaged grapes pour down.
So technique saved this year's vintage. But from the sodden ground the water
entered the grapes and they were diluted. This can be corrected to some
extent by chaptalisation (sugaring the must in the vats).
Also widely practised was saignee - where the unfermented juice is drawn off
from the skins and the proportion of skins to juice increased. As a result
of the thick skins the colour is remarkably deep. However, all this does not
make a great wine, and many of the generic Bordeaux Rouge growers and those
petits chateaux which did not have the adequate technical resources to deal
with such a difficult year will have made variable wine.
The dry whites, picked before the rain, are excellent. However, for the
second year running most of the sweet wines are a disaster.
Outside France, there is unlikely to be any en primeur sale for the '93
clarets. In price it is improbable that they will be more expensive than the
low-price '92s, although it is generally agreed to be a better vintage.
The old game of matching the year with others has already begun. No less an
expert than Jean Delmas, regisseur of Haut-Brion, has suggested that it may
turn out like the good, but tannic '88. Others say better than '87.
The '92s will be available in bottle next year and, together with the '93s,
should in four or five years time, provide agreeable and relatively
inexpensive early drinking, even at classed-growth level.
Opinions are divided in Bordeaux as to whether the '92s are superior to the
'91s. In the Pessac-Leognan Graves there is a slight preference for the
'92s, in the Medoc it is the other way round. In St Emilion and Pomerol,
where the frost struck rather worse, little '91 was made and none at all
under the chateaux label at Cheval-Blanc, Figeac, Petrus and other leading
Pomerol estates.
Not the least pleasure in claret drinking, are the opportunities afforded
for amiable disagreement about the relative superiority of one or other of
adjoining vintages. Today there are '89 and '90 to be argued about, and '85
and '86. Out there senior Bordelais are still disagreeing about the '28s and
the '29s.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Food and Drink: A sparkling challenge - Jancis Robinson's
Competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN Weekend FT readers succeed where Eurocrats have failed the wine world?
Certainly, I would think.
What do you call a wine that is fizzy, was made using exactly the same
methods used in Champagne - yet is produced somewhere else?
You certainly cannot call it champagne, except in those parts of the world -
such as the US - yet to be conquered by the litigious Champenois. In the US,
you can refer to any old carbonated plonk as champagne, but what I am after
is a term for top-quality wine made using top-quality methods.
These involve deriving bubbles from a second fermentation in the bottle in
which the wine will eventually be sold, and extra flavour from leaving it on
the lees of that second fermentation for at least nine months.
It used to be easy to distinguish these wines because they were made mainly
in France and were labelled methode champenoise, but the European Community
has now outlawed this term. Setting aside the issue of just who 'invented'
the method - and there are various claimants outside Champagne - at least
the term made clear that none of the more industrial gasifying methods were
used.
The EC is proposing that another term, methode traditionnelle, should be
made mandatory from next September. To me, it sounds as utterly meaningless
and unconvincing as, say, 'traditional fayre'. Guff, in other words.
In any case, a significant and increasing proportion of today's top quality
whatever-we-are-to-call-it is made not just outside Champagne but outside
France.
Why should those producers stick a French term on their labels? The
Spaniards make their version in enormous quantity and call it Cava. Some
Californians call theirs CMCV (Champagne Methods, Champagne (Grape)
Varieties). Italians - well, their labelling is as anarchic as you might
expect.
What I am seeking is a term we all can use colloquially. 'Bottle-fermented
sparkling wine' is just too much of a mouthful. 'Bubbly' and 'fizz' surely
are a bit too Wodehouse for the late 20th century, not to mention too
general.
For the moment, I shall use the term 'guff.' It sounds like a just-opened
bottle of the stuff and could be said to stand for Good Usage-Friendly Fizz.
Moet &amp; Chandon, the biggest producer of champagne - and a considerable
quantity of guff, too - will provide the FT reader who can propose the best
alternative name with six bottles of its Australian Green Point 1990 - the
best guff I have yet to taste.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Eating Out: Now go and stuff a mushroom - The life and
professional times of the Walnut Tree's nonpareil chef
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN IF you have not had the unique pleasure of eating in the Walnut Tree
Inn at Llandewi Skirrid, near Abergavenny in south Wales, there is a strong
probability that you will have eaten one of Franco Taruschio's dishes. Most
likely, it will have been another chef's variation on Taruschio's bresoala -
thin slices of marinated beef served with olive oil - the recipe which
Taruschio has been passing on to other professional chefs for years.
Now, with his wife, Ann, he has published a delightful book, Leaves from The
Walnut Tree, Recipes of a Lifetime, (Pavilion, Pounds 15.99, 256 pages). It
is full of the more usual culinary details but, as befits a man who is
surely the most modest and unassuming chef in Britain, many of the recipes
are put in their particular context. For the bresoala, we have to thank the
owner of the Piperno restaurant in the Jewish quarter of Rome; for the
Ukrainian ravioli, three Ukrainian students who came to work as plongeurs in
the restaurant kitchens; and, for Thai mussels, a Thai chef who visited the
Walnut Tree for a weekend.
My only disappointment is that the book does not put Taruschio in context.
All we are told is that he came from the Marche region of Italy - a poor
area where the people are known as magna pulentoni, big polenta eaters - to
Rugby, in Warwickshire, via a hotel school in Como, north Italy. He fell in
love with Ann and, 30 years ago, they fell in love with a pub: the Walnut
Tree.
But this lack of detail, although disappointing, only underlines the
Taruschios' varied achievements. The first comes via their respect for raw
ingredients. What is unique is the manner in which they have so patiently
raised standards and encouraged new suppliers across Wales, starting from a
very low level 30 years ago.
With the exception of oils and truffles, which come via Franco's extended
family in Italy, The Walnut Tree offers the exciting opportunity to all its
customers of eating the finest Welsh produce transformed into wonderful
Italian cuisine.
Two specific elements in this transformation reflect Franco's particular
approach to cooking. The first is the importance he attaches to strong
flavours. This does not mean overpowering or contradictory flavours on one
plate but an emphasis on what appear to be simple dishes cooked so that they
taste exactly as they should. His recipes for aubergines in carrozza,
pheasant with olives, the much-maligned - but when it is cooked properly -
grilled scampi and zucchini chips exemplify this philosophy. The book's
precise layout with ingredients listed on the side of the page makes this
approach easy to follow.
What is less obvious, but becomes apparent with several other recipes, is
the gentleness, care and patience with which everything has to be handled to
produce these flavours. The same avuncular concern Franco has shown to so
many chefs in this country he also retains for the humble zucchini flower.
Stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan, dipped in batter and deep
fried in light olive oil these are magnificent - but require great care when
twisting the flower petals. So, too, does Taruschio's recipe for olive
ascolane, large green olives stuffed with a mixture of chicken, veal, Parma
ham, nutmeg and cinammon, a recipe which destroys the aphorism that life is
too short to stuff a mushroom.
Leaves from The Walnut Tree will inspire you in the kitchen. It will also
take you along the winding road which leads out of Abergavenny and,
magically, thanks to the Taruschios, to spend a few hours in Italy.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Cookery: No place for the faint-hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is no place for faint-hearted appetites. Even in a heat wave, the
locals persevere bravely with very substantial lunches. And then, in
mid-afternoon, they are lured willingly into coffee and cake shops, so
keeping the calorie count ticking over nicely.
I discovered all this - and managed to adapt to the local customs - when I
went there this summer. My base was Estremoz, half-way between Evora and
Elvas in the Alto Alentejo, close to the border with Spain. The region is
full of fortified hill towns and is the home of the Elvas plum as well as
fine fruits and vegetables of many kinds as well as wines, cork and cereal
crops.
Estremoz itself is a delight: a sleepy, unpretentious, walled town topped by
a royal castle - named after the beatified Queen Isabel, who died there in
1336 - where I stayed and a maze of medieval streets. The castle is now a
pousada*. Updated for the comfort of 20th century guests, it is cool, calm
and imposing.
Sous-chef Alice Pola, my guide through the pousada kitchens - most of the
chefs in Portugal are women, she told me - described in detail what she was
going to cook for dinner. This included salt cod and fresh spinach for the
recipe given below; pork and clams for Porc a Alentejana, one of the best
known dishes to come out of Portugal; and a pudding with enough egg yolks
and sugar to horrify health food devotees.
Salt cod is one of Portugal's favourite ingredients. There is said to be a
different way of cooking it for every day of the year and it can be found in
grocery shops everywhere, stacked in piles like over-sized, over-starched
grey napkins and smelling as pungent as a footballer's socks.
Set into the grocer's counter is a guillotine used for cutting up the cod.
Indeed, these guillotines are as important to Portuguese grocers today as
the bacon slicer was to their British counterparts years ago.
The Portuguese are not squeamish. In butcher shops, tripes hang from hooks
like chamoix leathers and there are pigs' tails, cheeks and testicles on
offer. In the markets, shoppers run their eyes and hands over live,
fully-grown geese, ducks, hens, turkeys, guinea fowl and rabbits before
buying. The majority of birds, though, are sold as chicks, to be fattened by
the cook at home in readiness for the pot.
Fruit and vegetables have an irrestible appeal. What Briton could resist
tomatoes that really taste of tomato, or the squashily-ripe brown and purple
figs. Turnip tops are sold for the sake of their leaves, before the root
balls are formed. Bunches of herbs are the size of Interflora bouquets, and
there are masses of flat-leaf parsley, green coriander and intensely scented
wild oregano with flower heads as big as hops.
Meanwhile, back to the salt cod . . .
BACALHAU A MODA DE ESTREMOZ
(Serves 6-8 as a substantial first course, or 3-4 as a main dish. Either way
I like to accompany it with halved and baked tomatoes; their mild acidity
and juiciness complement salt cod well.)
Ingredients: 8 oz salt cod; 1 bay leaf; 1-2 garlic cloves; 12 oz spinach
(weighed after stripping away tough stalks); 3 fl oz olive oil; scant 3 oz
flour; 12 fl oz milk; 2 oz coarsely grated bread crumbs tossed in scant 1
tablespoon warm olive oil and stir-fried gently until crisp and golden.
Soak the salt cod for 24-36 hours, changing the water several times. Cut the
soaked fish into chunks. Put it into a pan with the milk, pushing it down
into the liquid. Add the bay leaf. Place over a low flame and bring slowly
to simmering point. Simmer for 1-2 minutes. Cover and set aside for 20
minutes before straining. Skin, bone and flake the fish. Reserve the milk
separately.
Wash the spinach, steam it lightly (bear in mind that it will continue to
cook in the oven later) and chop it roughly.
Crush the garlic and soften it gently in the olive oil. Add the flour and
cook briefly. Blend in the milk and bring to simmering point, stirring
continuously, to make a very stiff sauce or panade. Whizz about half of it
in a food processor together with the salt cod to make fishy paste. Beat in
the rest of the sauce by hand, then the spinach, and add pepper to taste.
Spoon the mixture into a shallow earthenware dish that has been brushed with
olive oil, mounding the mixture slightly in the centre. Cover with a dome of
oiled foil. Everything up to this stage can be prepared up to 24 hours
ahead.
Close to serving time, bake the creamed salt cod with spinach in its covered
dish at 375`F-400`F/190`C-200`C (gas mark 5-6) for about 30 minutes until
piping hot and and beginning to bubble at the edges. Scatter with hot
crisply fried crumbs and serve with tomatoes.

FT  23 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: From costume to fancy dress - Chanel has
come full circle with its new collection of real gemstone jewellery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW HERE'S a thing. The founder of the house of Chanel, Coco Chanel, was
almost single-handedly responsible for investing costume jewellery with the
kind of chic that once pertained to real gems. But next week Chanel launches
a sumptuous collection of jewellery that is flamboyantly, indubitably,
gloriously real.
While today's working girls may be twisting ropes of fake pearls round their
necks and wealthy socialites are trading in their diamonds for paste, Chanel
is launching rings of peridot and amethysts and pearls, necklaces of
diamonds and platinum, of coral and hand-carved agate, of sapphires, rubies
and emeralds, rings and bracelets of diamonds, quilted gold and pearls.
There is something outrageously grandiloquent about the move, a kind of
perverse contra-cyclical decision which cocks a snook at the recession and
treats such dreary things with the contempt which Lady Bracknell reserved
for people in found in handbags.
For those of us who remember Coco Chanel as the woman who changed forever
our notions of elegance it is all quite a turn-up. She was the first truly
modern dresser, the woman who cropped her hair, who first saw the sense and
comfort in soft jersey trousers and silky cardigans, who persuaded the world
that wealth was not the prerequisite of style and that there was as much
chic in a string of false pearls worn with panache as in any number of
diamonds,
However, remember that she was not short of the real thing herself. Her
lovers were many, legendary and either very rich or very grand, or both.
Bendor, Duke of Westminster, lavished jewels of every kind on her and the
Grand Duke Dmitri (alas, not very rich and, even worse, 'looked marvellous
but there was nothing behind it all - just vodka and void') gave her the
Romanov pearls which he had saved when he fled the Russian Revolution.
Some she wore, others (notably the Romanov pearls) she copied. 'A woman,'
she said, 'should mix fake and real' and so she did, wearing Bendor's rubies
and emeralds, (as in the photograph here) with a string of fake pearls and
Verdura's enamel and paste cuffs.
Above all she was against the banal, the timid, the meagre. She hated the
jewellery-as-investment, the jewellery-as-status cast of mind, the vulgarity
of huge solitaires set in rings ('One might as well tie a cheque around
one's neck'). What she valued, above all, was panache.
In her own person - in the photograph here - her whole philosophy can be
seen. Be bold, be adventurous, was her motto. Price is beside the point and
so is the matter of whether it is real or fake - what really counts is the
overall decorative, aesthetic effect.
And here, of course, is the point of the new designs. They may be real, they
may cost a small ransom, but it is the brilliance of the designs, the skill
with which they are made and the way they chime with the tradition of the
House of Chanel which is their raison d'etre - not the status they might
confer upon their owner.
House of Chanel tradition has it that in the days of boom and opulence you
sell glass gewgaws 'because they are devoid of arrogance in an epoch of too
easy luxe,' as Mlle. Chanel put it to The New Yorker magazine. When times
get hard you do as Mlle. Chanel did when the pre-war depression reached its
nadir - you decide that real jewels are fashionable again and have them
glinting in your windows while everybody else is still brooding over bottom
lines.
The House is already richly endowed with costume jewellery - its pearl and
gilt earrings, its chains of gilt and pearls, its gilt crosses and watches
have long been the staple of jet-set dressing. Now faithful fans with the
bank-notes to match can do as Coco Chanel herself did and mix the real with
the fake.
The way to wear these new jewels then, for the lucky few who can afford
them, is to wear them with the utmost panache. Mix them with strings of fake
pearls, with great over-sized brooches of paste and gilt, with punchy
crosses and glittering pins. When you choose the costume jewellery remember
Coco Chanel's adage: 'When you make imitation jewellery, you always make it
bigger.' As Miss Piggy, glamour-girl of the Muppets, said in another
context: ''Less is more,' is the silliest thing I have ever heard. Less is
always less.' And if you cannot afford them, console yourself with the
thought that these days even Barbara Cartland has to wear fake because real
diamonds do not look good on television.
Some of the pieces in this new collection are precise renditions of pieces
that Mlle. Chanel designed herself in the 1930s - these are mainly the
diamond pieces which have been faithfully reproduced. Then there are precise
copies of her own personal jewellery such as the ring shown here. Yet
others, such as the coral and pearl necklace photographed here, echo
original designs but, for reasons of cost, are made up out of different
materials.
There is also an entirely new collection which takes its inspiration from
the history and spirit of the House. The bracelets and rings, for instance,
use the quilting theme so closely associated with Chanel's handbags, using
platinum, diamonds and pearls to created the quilted effect.
Prices start at the equivalent of about Pounds 1,000 and go on up to Pounds
300,000 for the most expensive. For the moment the collection is available
only at Chanel, 7 Place Vendome, Paris 1 and 40 Avenue Montaigne, Paris 8.
Anybody who can afford the jewellery, reasons Chanel, can afford the flight
to Paris . . .

FT  23 OCT 93 / Fashion: The Brits are back - but they're broke - Avril
Groom finds a shortage of finance but no lack of wild and witty talent at
the spring shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON FASHION is a tale of the unexpected. The best of its shows for spring
1994 last weekend was not about clothes but about hats, the first catwalk
presentation of young Philip Treacy's impossibly balanced, light-as-air, net
and feather explosions.
Even Valentino, favourite couturier of Hollywood stars, shoehorned himself
in among the students and hangers-on for the hour-late show in a small,
crowded venue. The Roman designer uses Treacy's creations in his shows.
Also doing London for the first time in years was Ellin Saltzman, top buyer
for New York's chic Bergdorf Goodman store. And erstwhile super-shopper
Ivana Trump turned up for Tomasz Starzewski, darling of the ladies who lunch
and the nearest British equivalent to Valentino.
The international interest proved that the buzz is back - that, in spite of
the gloom six months ago when the Department of Industry withdrew its
backing for the London shows, Britain's cottage industry designers are again
hot news. This is due primarily to a rash of bright new names sending out
original, cleverly-made and wearable collections.
The makings of the revival were there last season when the British Fashion
Council backed a group of first-time exhibitors who attracted buyers like
bees round a honey-pot while better-known names had a quiet time.
Not that huge financial rewards resulted. None could afford a show this time
but to the rescue came Harvey Nichols department store, in association with
American Express, and new the Covent Garden fashion venue, Space NK, which
put work from the best new designers, plus a selection of this year's top
fashion graduates from across Europe, on the catwalk. The flow of talent
showed that London is again the place for buyers to seek out new ideas, and
silenced any argument that, as Paris is so near and communications
continually improving, another Northern European fashion capital is not
needed.
The young 'green shoots' argue that it is. Some were nominated for the New
Generation section of this year's Lloyds Bank British Fashion Awards - and
one, Abe Hamilton, won it - but they are all small-scale and not ready for
the expensive shows in Paris. Even the new Designer of the Year - John Rocha
 -is hardly a household name, even though he has had his company on and off
for 10 years.
All last time's debutantes are still in business, although it has been
tough. They do not talk of turnover because they do not yet have one.
Several live in their studios and started by signing on to unemployment
benefit to become eligible for a Pounds 50 per week enterprise allowance.
They are learning the tricks, like negotiating the best minnow's deal with
big-fish international retailers, and the disappointments - an enthusiastic
call from a swanky American store does not necessarily equal an order. They
would like, but cannot afford, someone else to take on the business
headaches and they all worry about the balance between commercial expedience
and creative satisfaction.
No one doubts their talent but commercially some are learning the hard way.
Abe Hamilton, who financed his first collection in 1990 with gardening and
cleaning jobs, found drawing up a strong contract for customers, with
discounts to quick payers, was the only way to keep his cash flow going.
Ex-Royal Marine Paul Frith and double-act Sonnentag Mulligan, showing their
second collections, still find getting paid and keeping their bankers happy
a juggling act.
Some fly by the seat of their pants. Vivienne Westwood's ex-assistant
Nicholas Knightly took orders on his much-praised second collection but then
withdrew from a possible manufacturing deal, 'to concentrate creatively on
one-off specials and a small resort collection', too late to get most of it
made elsewhere. Whether he can afford the luxury of that decision remains to
be seen.
Whatever the problems, no green shoot has any intention of compromising
either the quirky individuality which so appeals to foreign buyers or the
quality of their work, though, as Selina Blow - whose jackets, made by
traditional men's tailors, can take three days to complete - puts it: 'In
order to survive, one day we may have to forget the romance and get real.'
A few manage to keep the romance and hit the big-time. Every designer wants
to show in Paris and those two fashion iconoclasts, John Galliano and
Vivienne Westwood, are ready for the world stage and an all-action
supermodel show. Their spring shows last week were the talk of Paris for
their blend of wild theatricality, historical references and translatable
ideas shot through with a defiantly British streak. For Galliano this meant
an affectionate evocation of aristocratic novelettish heroines and for
Westwood a glimpse of London cafe life in the Naughty Nineties.
In spite of such talent, neither has found wealth. Self-financed Westwood
has three London shops and her designs appear in big stores across Europe
and the US, but after 20 years her business is only now reaching a stable
footing. Galliano is still dependent on backers' whims and from the
prodigious beauty of his collection probably only the fragile,
lingerie-style bias-cut dresses and Biba-esque tailoring are commercially
viable.
None of this deters the next generation. New graduates, hungry for
experience in production and marketing, want to work for established
companies and then start a business.
Of the four British graduates in the Harvey Nichols show, Miranda Tsui has a
job abroad with MaxMara, Sonja Nuttall has joined a business already started
by her partner. Talented menswear designer Tim Voegele is still sifting
offers and Lucy Templeman - named Graduate of the Year - has discovered the
hard facts of British fashion by taking a job with Zygo, a label now up for
sale. The benefit which graduates gain from British companies is more often
in experience or exposure rather than financial reward. Student placements,
sponsorship for shows or promotions in stores are useful but investment in
real jobs is lacking.
'Investors in the UK take a very short term view of the fashion industry,'
says John Wilson, chief executive of the British Fashion Council. 'There is
clearly great talent, but it needs professional management to raise finance
and organise production. Until investors develop confidence in our
designers, resources will remain limited.'
Meanwhile, in Dusseldorf, DM2.5m (Pounds 1.01m) including state funds, has
been found for the Creativ Haus, a centre where, at very low rates,
designers can rent a workshop with high-tech equipment, get advice on
business and sell their designs. It is intended as an international
enterprise and the Royal College of Art plans to recommend it to former
students. British designers would love to see a similar initiative, but any
such thing seems very far away.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Chess: Honour and defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, it was an honourable defeat in a match of two halves. Gary
Kasparov retained his PCA world title at London's Savoy Theatre by a 12 1/2
 -7 1/2 margin, six wins and 13 draws against a solitary win for Nigel
Short.
The champion collects Pounds 1.06m of the Times' Pounds 1.7m prize money,
but Short recovered well from a dreadful start. Short held his own over the
final eleven games, the only player apart from former champion Anatoly
Karpov to do so well against Kasparov, the all-time Number 1.
There are two ways of looking at the result. The match was effectively
decided when Kasparov won three of the first four games, and some believe he
simply coasted to victory. But Kasparov himself admitted dissatisfaction at
not being able to crush his opponent, and he seemed fatigued during the last
few games.
'Nigel's strategy was to tire Kasparov out,' says Short's sacked guru,
Lubomir Kavalek. 'It was really working near the end of the match, but by
then Kasparov was too far ahead. Nigel was well prepared, but he missed
opportunities through nervousness.'
If Short had taken all his clear winning and drawing chances, he would have
been leading by one or two points after 20 games rather than contemplating
his Pounds 640,000 loser's cheque. Kasparov's future opponents will note how
Short successfully defied classical strategies by gaining active pieces in
return for weakened pawns, and that the Russian was uneasy in such
positions. Kasparov's legend of invincibility is dented, if not damaged,
while Short can reasonably contemplate another challenge in 1995.
Off board, the championship has been hyped on Channel 4 and in The Times,
and denigrated by that newspaper's rivals. Seat prices at the Savoy were
heavily discounted from their original Pounds 45 minimum, but then daily
audiences stabilised at about 600 daily even when Short's situation was
hopeless.
Television audiences settled at a healthy 600,000, viewing both Channel 4,
whose one-hour live commentaries broke new ground, and BBC 2. Dealers in
chess equipment report large sales increases. But the London Chess Festival,
scheduled to run alongside the championship, was a disappointment. The Times
was forced to abandon all but a handful of events.
It may be a long time yet before the controversies surrounding the match are
finally settled. In a few weeks' time, the breakaway Professional Chess
Association, founded by Short and Kasparov, holds its first qualifier to
decide Kasparov's next challenger in 1995. Then the official Fide world
body, whose champion is likely to be Kasparov's old rival Karpov, stages its
own elimination matches.
The escalating costs of this expensive war are certain to strain the
resources of both organisations. Although Kasparov and Short are proclaiming
that their match has begin a brave new world where chess is free from the
Fide bureaucracy, the reality is more likely to be, at best, an eventual
truce and merger between Fide and the PCA. At worst it may be a return to
the days when champions personally chose their challenger and often dodged
their strongest rivals.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Minister for a Day: Guns blazing on the 6pm news - The start
of a new series in which we ask prominent people to imagine themselves as a
government minister for a day. General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley imagines
what he would do if called on to become defence secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By General Sir ANTHONY FARRAR-HOCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE scarcely sat at my desk before one of the assistant secretaries
enters with a huge pile of briefs; reading material that would occupy the
whole day. I select only the summary of departmental cuts and consequences
asked for in advance. The conclusions are chilling.
When the chiefs of staff and permanent secretary come in, I suggest that we
lack resources to meet the commitments published in the 1993 Defence
Estimates. Setting aside the case of general war, the ability to respond to
lesser contingencies seems to assume that these will arise conveniently, one
at a time.
What would be the effect, I ask, of the following arising simultaneously:
the requirement for a British division in Bosnia-Hercegovina, with
neighbouring sea and air elements, as part of an international policing
operation; increased violence in Northern Ireland, for example, random
battles between armed Protestant and IRA groups; and the provision of, say,
a fire service as in the firemen's strike in the late 1970s? My tentative
conclusion is that this triple demand would exhaust the complement of field
engineers and logistic units.
While accepting that enough ships, battalions, and air elements might be
scraped together to meet the initial bill, it would be difficult to find
replacements for them after a tour of duty, say six months.
Looking further into present circumstances, I note that units of the field
Army are mostly moving from one active commitment to another, leaving little
time to train for the roles they are expected to fill, from gendarmerie
operations to general war. Is this equally true for the Royal Navy and Royal
Air Force?
I ask the chiefs to send me observations on these points this afternoon, not
later than 3 pm. They leave rather wearily, spending hours with their staff
in such pursuits, often fruitlessly. I hope to offer them some return on
this occasion.
The permanent secretary remains behind. As chief accounting officer, he
duels with the Treasury. I make it clear that I am looking either for a
reduction in commitments or an increase in resources. We agree that the
government is strapped for cash and that party pressure is not going to ease
that position.
I put this point to him: facts and figures persuade me that the
helter-skelter reduction of the armed forces began with an irresponsible -
almost a mischievous - ministerial minute concluding that the collapse of
the Warsaw Pact removed the necessity of maintaining rounded defence forces.
This inevitably opened a breach for Treasury exploitation. Why do we
continue to deny that the defence cuts are Treasury driven? All departments
are properly subject to funding constraints. He reminds me that he cannot
answer for former ministers.
Meantime, details concerning defence equipment have been brought in. I ask
my private secretary to hold off callers while I study them. I agree to hold
a press conference at 5pm.
The Options for Change policy promised improvements in equipment programmes
to mitigate cuts in defence manning. This is abandoned in the current plan.
Contracts bind the ministry to continuing procurement, but these will simply
replace outworn or obsolete items. I reflect that, if money is short, this
is probably as it should be. It will pay the services to sweat out lean
years with a sufficiency of seasoned men and pay for their retention by
trimming equipment demands. Unfortunately, the equipment savings have been
made without benefit to manpower.
Eschewing a haggis sandwich left by a predecessor, I eat hard cheese. This
reminds me of a fuse I intend to light.
Personal allowances continue to be sacrificed to savings, transferring
public expenses to private pockets. Moreover, those extant are often subject
to extraordinary accountability, not because there is growing evidence of
fiddling, but in order to satisfy penny-pinching qualifications. My guess is
that we have disposed a host of scrutineers whose collective wages exceed
any savings accrued. I order a review of this entire subject.
At 3pm the chiefs answer to the queries I made this morning. They confirm my
apprehensions. Even if we send a brigade rather than a division to
Bosnia-Hercegovina, we shall be in immediate difficulties should concurrent
claims arise. I write an advisory note to my colleague, the Foreign
Secretary.
At 5 pm, I tell the press that the armed forces cannot meet the commitments
declared to parliament. I have therefore cancelled the remaining Options for
Change and have opened a defence review. Disengaging myself from questions,
I drive home. My wife is just answering the telephone. It is the prime
minister. He has been listening to the early evening news . . .

FT  23 OCT 93 / Despatches: The Somali warlord who backed the wrong horse -
Leslie Crawford braves Mogadishu's Bermuda Triangle to meet Aideed's rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO WEAPONS, I told the three Somalis who had volunteered to drive me across
the no man's land that separates the warring fiefdoms of north and south
Mogadishu.
They were incredulous. How were they to protect me? Hadn't I heard of an
area called the Bermuda Triangle, where people disappeared, never to be seen
again? I repeated my request, this time trying to suppress the nervous edge
that had crept into my voice. Reluctantly, the teenager who had been toying
with an AK-47 rifle gave it to a friend for safekeeping.
We set off. I was curious to discover what Somalis thought and felt on the
other side of the Bermuda Triangle. Since May, the western media had focused
its attention on south Mogadishu, where a rebel militia leader, Gen Mohamed
Farah Aideed, was waging an urban guerrilla war against 14,000 US and UN
troops. In the north, however, Aideed's arch-rival had chosen to co-operate
with the UN forces by handing over an acceptable number of his heavy
weapons. Ali Mahdi had, therefore, been spared the nightly air raids that
had terrorised south Mogadishu as the UN attempted to flush out Aideed and
his militias.
But the tide had turned in Aideed's favour. During a pitched battle in
mid-October, his militias had shot down two US helicopters, killed 18 crack
US troops and captured one of the downed pilots. Pictures of Somalis
dismembering the corpses of US soldiers had shocked television viewers
across America. President Bill Clinton, under pressure to stop the carnage
in Somalia and to secure the release of the US hostage, had sent a special
envoy to negotiate with Aideed.
The situation, therefore, was not looking good for Ali Mahdi. I sought him
out at his headquarters, a solid red-brick building which, a young guard
told me in hushed tones, had once housed the dreaded secret police of the
Siad Barre dictatorship. Aideed been a prisoner there for six years.
Two larger-than-life posters, depicting a handsome, light-skinned man with a
Clarke Gable moustache, proclaimed Ali Mahdi as Somalia's 'interim
president'. On the top floor a cluster of people hovered outside the interim
president's office, and inside, a chubby man sat at the head of a conference
table. I recognised the moustache.
He came straight to the point: 'I hope the international community will not
commit the crime of rewarding Aideed. How can you negotiate with a man who
has killed 70 UN peacekeepers and thousands of Somalis? Aideed has always
broken his agreements. A truce will only buy him time to regroup his
militias.'
He looked like a man whose luck had ran out after gambling on the wrong
horse. He had welcomed the UN military intervention in Somalia, and now
President Clinton was planning to withdraw his troops in six months' time.
He did not hide his alarm: 'If the US pulls out without disarming Aideed,
the war and starvation will start all over again.'
At the Indian Ocean Bar and Beach Club, the new owners did not want to see a
return of the anarchy which had destroyed their city. Yes, they admitted,
they had been bandits in the bad old days. Looting, after all, had been the
only way to survive. But all they wanted now were regular customers and a
quiet life. We ordered soft drinks and surveyed the beach front. Every
mansion with an ocean vista had been blasted by mortar shells or pock-marked
with bullet holes.
Yahia Amir, a lecturer in economics before the civil war, tried to explain.
'The UN has good intentions, but their interference in Somali politics is
disastrous. It is not enough to understand the tradition of different clans;
you also have to know the relationships between different families. Aideed
and Ali Mahdi belong to the same clan, but to rival sub-clans. Alliances can
change overnight. It is even difficult for Somalis to follow.'
It was also difficult for them, the proudest race in the Horn of Africa, to
acknowledge a debt of gratitude to a foreign occupation force. 'We don't
understand UN policy,' said one of my guides. 'They bomb us by night and
feed us by day.'
More than 1,600 orphans were being fed at a nearby orphanage, named 'Restore
Hope' by the US Marines who had captured the bombed-out premises from Somali
militias. They stood in line, dressed in western cast-offs. They attended
school seven days a week.
'We are trying to restore some sense of order to their lives,' Salim
Mohamed, the headmaster, explained. In the crowded classrooms, hundreds of
tiny voices chanted the alphabet in English, numbers in Arabic, or songs in
Somali. The school lacked a roof, and like the rest of Mogadishu, it had no
electricity or running water. But a generator had been installed to pump
water from a well.
Despite its appearance, the school felt like an island of sanity amidst so
much devastation. It reminded me of a different island across the city - the
80 acres of the UN compound cut off from its hostile environs by barbed
wire, sand bags and high walls. Inside, hundreds of UN officials, special
policy advisors and military personnel search for a rationale to their
presence in Somalia. They rarely venture outside the compound; Aideed's
snipers have made it too dangerous.
The compound resembles a vast building site, where 2,000 Somalis labour to
erect offices and dormitories, kitchens and toilets for the foreigners
trapped inside. Unable to rebuild Somalia, the UN is building its
headquarters to create an illusion of purpose and permanence in this strange
land.
Back in north Mogadishu, it was getting late and my guides were growing
restless. We still had to run the gauntlet of the Bermuda Triangle, and it
was best to do so before dusk. The driver also needed his daily fix of chat
 -a bitter, leafy stimulant responsible for the recklessness of gun-toting
militias.
The roads were deserted except for heaps of tyres and rusted masonry that
slowed our dash across no man's land. We all breathed a sigh of relief when
the Pakistani checkpoint came in sight. The soldiers motioned us to stop and
searched the car.
'No weapons,' I said.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Victims who want to soldier on: Melanie McDonogh meets a
formidable brigade of men in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MELANIE MCDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAR in Bosnia has become so complicated that most of us have given up
trying to understand it. But the majority of people have one abiding
impression: that the Moslems are the main victims, the people who have
suffered more than anyone else.
That is why the Seventeenth Brigade is remarkable. It is the brigade of
victims turned soldiers. Nearly all the men in it are Moslems who were
expelled by the Serbs from Northern Bosnia. Most have spent time in brutal
Serbian detention camps such as Omarska where, they say, they were treated
inhumanely. They came to Travnik 18 months ago, and there they formed a
brigade to fight their oppressors.
That is where they first entered the public eye. When the fighting started a
few months ago between the Bosnian army and their former allies, the Croats,
the Seventeenth Brigade and the Bosnian army won. One result of their
victory was the exodus of most of the Croatians from Travnik, where they had
made up more than 40 per cent of the population. The other was the
establishment of the brigade's reputation as a formidable fighting force.
I met the general who commands this brigade in a field of crocuses
overlooking the plain where his soldiers were fighting the Croats around
Zenica. It is an idyllic place - or would be if it was not for the sound of
shells exploding behind us.
Getting to him was an arduous, roundabout business. First, I had been with
the Croatian army in Gornji Vakuf, then I had gone to Vitez. From there I
had walked across the front, from the Croatian side to the Bosnian army,
where the soldiers took me to Travnik. From Travnik there had been a bumpy
trip at breakneck speed - 'we have to drive fast to avoid snipers' - in the
military police commander's precious VW Golf, through steep little villages,
behind flocks of sheep, across fields where you would normally hesitate to
take a Land Rover, to the general, sitting in a tranquil meadow.
The general's name is Mehmet Agic - Aga to his men - and he is a former
dancing master in a military academy. 'It was such a good way to meet
girls,' he said. We sat on a wooden bench, he gave me a cigarette and a
soldier brought us cups of warm milk. Aga is a commanding presence and a
tremendous flirt.
He does not talk the language of compromise. I asked why it was that the
brigade, made up of men who had been dispossessed by the Serbs, were now
fighting the Croats. 'We are the army of Bosnia-Hercegovina,' he said
simply. 'The legal army. We fight wherever the fascists - the Chetniks
(Serbs) and Utasha (Croats) - try to kill Moslems. Every weapon of theirs is
a weapon to kill Moslem people.'
The brigade has remarkable morale - it is so short of petrol that the
soldiers have to walk to the front, but one of them bragged that because of
this they had 'the best legs in the Bosnian army'.
If the Geneva peace-dealers are hoping that hunger and desperation will
cause the Bosnian army to compromise, an encounter with the brigade would
fill them with gloom. 'We have nothing,' said Aga cheerfully. 'Just morale
and a hard bite. But we can live without French chocolates. We don't want to
live in another country. We want to live here. And if necessary, we will eat
the flowers in the field before we give in.'
He took me to see the terrain stretched out below. One of the soldiers gave
me an apple; another, a handful of walnuts. I had expected before I came
that the soldiers in this unit might have been brutalised by what they had
been through. But to a stranger, they could not have been kinder.
The dehumanising experience of the camps and dispossession has left its
mark, however, even though the commander insists that he does not want
revenge. One officer in another unit in Travnik said bluntly of the men in
the brigade who had been in Omarska: 'They are full of hate.'
I met some of them. A soldier who had been in the detention camp for 70 days
recalled that they were beaten every day. 'Every day we would get the
Serbian massage,' he said, tapping his shoulders behind the neck. 'And every
day the lorries would come and take away the dead. But I'm getting my own
back now.
'But,' I said, 'you are not fighting the Serbs here.'
'We will,' he said. 'The Serbs are afraid of the Seventeenth Brigade.'
For all that this brigade has little hope of attacking the Serbs, who are
for the most part solidly entrenched and well-armed in what is now the
Serbian Republic, many are homesick for the towns from which they have been
expelled.
I told them I had been in the region a little while ago. They crowded round
me asking questions. What was it like in Banja Luka? Was the town much
damaged? Were there any mosques left? The answer to that last question was
'no'.
I cannot say that most of the men I met were fundamentalist Moslems;
especially on the subject of drink, veiled women and mosque attendance.
Most, if asked, estimate the number of fundamentalists in the army at around
10 or 20 per cent.
There are a few Croats and Serbs in the brigade, and the odd foreign
volunteer. One Moslem, aged 17, introduced me enthusiastically to his
colleague, a Serb. 'The best,' he said, clapping him on the shoulder. 'Are
you an Orthodox?' I asked him. 'No, a Moslem,' he said ironically. 'He's
lying]' they chorused.
The losers around Travnik, obviously, have been the Croats. I passed through
several villages on the way to the commander where the houses had been
gutted. 'Croatian houses?,' I asked the young soldier with me. He shook his
head. 'HVO houses,' he said, referring to the Croatian army, which
presumably had tried to defend them. For the Croatian community, however,
the distinction cannot have been that obvious. But, to the credit of the
Bosnia army, the Roman Catholic churches in those villages are still intact.
The fighting in which the brigade has taken part has been ugly, fought with
ferocity that you only get between old allies. I told a couple of soldiers
about the stories I had heard on the Croatian side about finding the
mutilated bodies of their comrades. 'Listen,' one of them said. 'I've seen
the bodies of our men with their eyes gouged out and their arms hacked off.
I found one soldier on the other side with his pockets full of ears.'
None of the brigade gets paid. The men get just their uniforms, food and
four packets of cigarettes a month, bought from the Serbian troops on the
mountains nearby. 'All we have got is big hearts,' one said. 'If we had
weapons as well, nothing would stop us.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rugby: All Blacks boosted by generosity of hosts - Derek
Wyatt previews the New Zealand tour, which starts today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE All Blacks open their 13-match tour this afternoon at a sold-out
Twickenham against the London and South-East Division. They are,
justifiably, worth their No. 1 status in the world, having disposed of the
British Isles, Western Samoa and Australia earlier in the year.
They will find the London side playing an expansive game which will suit the
likes of Will Carling, Damian Hopley, Chris Oti and Tony Underwood, but it
could stretch Huw Davies' abilities at full-back.
The All Blacks will play it tight, as they have done for the past 100 years.
Theirs is a game predicated on crossing the gain line as close to as many
forwards as possible. It can, therefore, be mind-numbingly boring to watch,
but it is ruthlessly effective.
Only Australia, over the past five years, has managed to beat them, and beat
them well - something they find quite alien. True, South Africa has the best
record against them at international level (23-17), but not in the recent
past and not since neutral referees were introduced.
Australia's success has come from matching the fire and fury of the All
Black forwards, and actually being superior technically in the front and
second rows. This, understandably, has sent shock waves through the New
Zealand community.
But, as well as settling for equality up front, the Wallabies have had a
dominance at half-back, centre and, when Campese is on song, out in the
darkest recesses of the three-quarters.
Will London show us the tactical nous to beat the All Blacks? I doubt it.
While much bar-room talk has been centred on Jeff Probyn's reinstatement in
the front-row, the game will not be won there (besides which, as far as
England is concerned, Vicar Ubogu is now a more complete player). It will be
won by the middle five: that is, the back rows and the half-backs. In these
positions, the All Blacks have the edge.
Of New Zealand's new boys, former All Black fly-half Wayne Smith says: 'Marc
Ellis is outstanding. Perhaps his versatility is a problem but he has
immense potential.' We shall have to wait until mid-week to see him,
however, as Steve Bachop is preferred today at first five-eighth (the New
Zealand term for fly-half; the inside centre is the second five-eighth).
Without Grant Fox, the All Blacks have the potential to play a wider game;
but if they lose their confidence, and if a kicker of goals does not emerge,
they will move inside centre Lee Stensness to fly-half in the Tests. Laurie
Mains, the coach, is a dour man who fears failure.
The tour itinerary leaves some questions unanswered. Why was the Lions tour
to New Zealand 'so murderous' (to quote former All Black captain David
Kirk)? How come the Rugby Football Union has ageed to play five matches in
England without the sixth being the Test match?
Instead, the All Blacks will head north to play three matches against
various Scottish sides before meeting Scotland. That means eight games
before a Test; for England, it will be 10 games before their international.
The authorities are being extraordinarily generous to their visitors.
The answer must be the workings of the four home unions and their tour
committee. With players grumbling already about the demands on them this
season, it does make some kind of sense to move the international season to
April and play it over four successive weekends on both Saturday and Sunday.
(In New Zealand, the provincial championship does just this).
This must be on the minds of sport executives at the BBC, ITV and Sky, the
three companies pitching for the television rights to rugby for 1994 and
beyond. Indeed, Geoff Cooke, the England manager, earlier this month called
the Five Nations championship too incestuous and suggested including Romania
and Canada).
If rugby is to become global, then some of its tradition must be re-shaped;
after all, the Derby is to move to a Saturday. The Five Nations should
become the Ten Nations and embrace America, Italy, Romania, Canada and Spain
in two leagues, with promotion and relegation. This would truly benefit
northern hemisphere rugby.
In essence, the problem for England is that it has become too successful. It
does not need the protection of the four home unions. It could have its own
more lucrative television contract. It could certainly demand that, in
future, it plays three Tests on tours against South Africa, Australia or New
Zealand - something the present understanding prevents it from doing.
By default, the existing set-up favours the incoming tourists. How typically
British.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Tennis: Hong Kong produces another winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PERHAPS it was an omen of better times ahead for Chris Patten in his
delicate negotiations with China. When the governor of Hong Kong lunged for
his winning backhand volley on the centre court at Victoria Park, the packed
stands rose to acclaim him.
For a man who has only recently resumed his acquaintance with tennis after a
long absence, it had been a brave decision in the first place to agree to
appear alongside India's Vijay Amritraj in the One Million Dollar Challenge.
This charity match against US ace Roscoe Tanner and the chief secretary of
Hong Kong, Sir David Ford (no mean player himself, by the way), was part of
the festivities at the annual Marlboro championships to mark the 21st year
of professional tennis in the colony.
I have to report that the governor has a respectable forehand and a cunning
lob on the backhand, plus the ball sense and movement of a natural athlete.
He also possesses the sort of determination and shrewd tactical awareness
that one would expect from a man who faced constantly faced with having to
make difficult decisions.
The occasion was suitably worthy: the presentation of a HKDollars 1m cheque
to the Tennis Foundation of Hong Kong, a non-profit organization within the
Hong Kong LTA which exists to further junior tennis development.
Together with the surplus from this year's tournament - which, like the
Wimbledon surplus, is ploughed back into the grass roots of the local game -
the foundation will have collected some HKDollars 10m since it was formed in
1988.
Times were not always so prosperous, nor organised so smoothly. 'We took the
plunge in 1972, the fifth year of open tennis,' remembers Ken Catton, a
one-time Hong Kong government servant and former president of the HKLTA who
has been responsible for bringing the professionals to Hong Kong every year
since.
'The total prize money that first year was Dollars 10,000. Our star player,
Pancho Gonzales, was flown out from Los Angeles by Cathay Pacific, our joint
sponsor, but when I went to meet his flight I discovered that Pancho was not
on it. Total panic]
'Frantic phone calls revealed that a family tragedy had delayed him but,
true professional that he was, he arrived the next day and duly reached the
final where he lost a marvellous match against the Australian Davis Cup
stalwart, Mal Anderson.'
The ambitious decision in 1973 to join the newly formed Grand Prix, with a
Dollars 25,000 tournament as part of the embryo Asian circuit, posed further
problems for Catton. The only suitable site, in Victoria Park, had five
tarmac courts and no seating accommodation.
'We improvised with centre court stands built of bamboo scaffolding and
planks. It was not very comfortable for the spectators, but at least we
found a sponsor in BAT and I managed to persuade Rod Laver, the double Grand
Slam winner, to play and he became our first champion. Despite the problems,
everyone seemed to enjoy it. What's more, we broke even - a triumph for us
at that stage.'
The following year, a star cast included Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe and
Tanner. But there was no final. Torrential rain washed out play altogether
and Jack Kramer, the father of post-war professional tennis who had been
flown in to commentate on the final for television, found himself under an
umbrella.
Back in Hong Kong as a guest of this year's anniversary tournament along
with Fred Perry, Neale Fraser and ITF President Brian Tobin, Kramer was in
reflective mood. 'It was such a shame,' he said. 'They had worked so hard to
produce a fine tournament and had sold all the tickets.'
More difficult was the decision about distributing the prize money. 'There
was nothing in the rules,' said Catton. 'Eventually, we agreed to divide it
equally among those still left in.'
After a Dollars 50,000 loss in 1975, carried jointly by Catton and a local
benefactor, the late MW Lo, a decision was made the following year to form
the Hong Kong Tennis Patrons' Association which, it was hoped, would involve
the local business community in supporting the annual tournament.
That aim was achieved quickly but, even with the support of two blue chip
sponsors, Colgate Palmolive and Seiko, the next 12 years were spent
frustratingly in the wilderness of the second-tier Grand Prix events. Seven
successive appeals to the Men's Professional Tennis Council, to be included
in the Super Series category, were denied.
In 1988 the HKTPA, supported now by Philip Morris, decided reluctantly to
become a special event outside the official circuit under the Marlboro
banner. The decision proved an instant success. With the best players now
available, the crowds flocked to Victoria Park to see some memorable matches
involving former world No. 1 Stefan Edberg, the ever-popular
Chinese-American Michael Chang, the Czech stylist Miloslav Mecir (who won in
1988 and '89) and the three-time defending champion, Ivan Lendl.
This year's Marlboro, which finishes tomorrow, has included the world's top
doubles teams to add a new dimension to an already successful formula. In
the true innovative spirit of Hong Kong, the HKTPA have produced another
winner as professional tennis in the colony comes of age.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Sailing: Maxis feel the heat in Whitbread tussle - A look at
the lessons of the first leg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAILING'S great debate is over. Since the first of the new W60 class was
launched two years ago, yachtsmen have argued about whether these light,
water-ballasted sloops could beat the 85ft maxi-ketches in the Whitbread
round the world race. With the Southampton-Uruguay leg just finished it is
clear they can - and will.
'On the next leg, I think the W60s will be far away over the horizon,' said
Pierre Fehlmann, a skipper in five Whitbreads whose maxi, Merit Cup,
finished third into Punta del Este, 8hr 22min behind the leg winner, New
Zealand Endeavour. Tokio, skippered by young New Zealander Chris Dickson,
was the first W60 into harbour, three hours behind NZ Endeavour. With maxis
taking first and third places, why does this make the W60s look so hot?
According to theory, only on the first and fifth legs, with a good deal of
close reaching and upwind sailing in light airs, could the bigger yachts
exploit their greater displacement and massive sail area. Weather conditions
matched predictions almost exactly on the 5,900-mile route down through the
Atlantic. Maxis like Merit Cup and NZ Endeavour should have arrived in Punta
days in front of the smaller boats.
Tokio, Galicia Pescanova, Yamaha, Winston and Intrum Justitia were the first
five W60s to arrive, in that order and separated by 12 hours from first to
last. All are from the board of Maryland-based designer, Bruce Farr. Their
skippers agree there is nothing between them in performance, with crewing
and tactics being the difference.
Physically, the leg was easy, said helmsman Gordon Maguire from Winston, but
mentally it was gruelling. 'We've just sailed 24 incredibly competitive day
races back-to-back,' he added. 'Most of the time, we were within sight of
Yamaha. At night, we'd plot them on the radar.' The two yachts seemed tied
by an invisible string.
A constant stream of satellite data put the other items in the matrix
together. This race through the wildest corners of the world's oceans is
being fought below decks around the computer and the weather fax.
'It is like a chess game,' said Dickson, who led the fleet out of the the
Solent on September 25. 'We would receive the reports. Then, Andrew Cape,
the navigator, and I would go over all the available weather patterns and
try to find the best tactical course in relation to what the opposition were
doing.
'Each session took two to three hours of analysis and discussion. So, with
new reports coming in every six hours, you could never relax and snatch more
than a couple of hours of sleep. It was like match racing 24 hours a day,
but you couldn't go home at night.'
Grant Dalton, skipper of NZ Endeavour, found the reports addictive. If the
scheduled transmission was even a few minutes late, he and navigator Mike
Quilter would find themselves staring impatiently at the computer waiting
for the data print-out.
'Whoever sends those things out, tell them not to be late,' joked Dalton
when he stepped ashore. 'It's fantastic to know straight away whether you're
heading into a gain or a loss.' One of his crew, Glenn Sowry, likened the
arrival of the transmission to waiting for school exam results.
According to one or two crew aboard Endeavour, though, there was almost more
interest in how the finely-balanced W60s were faring than in their own
boat's stately leadership of the fleet. 'I feel sorry for those guys in the
maxis,' said a watch leader from one of the W60s.
'Only two of them are really in the race and it obvious now that Merit is
slow and Endeavour's going to win.' This, a remarkable comment for so
competitive a sportsman, came from Fehlmann as soon as he stepped ashore
when he admitted that Merit Cup had a speed problem.
'Down-wind when it's blowing hard, NZ Endeavour is a bit faster than us,
maybe 0.2 or 0.3 of a knot. It's nothing,' he added. With due respect to the
hugely-experienced Fehlman, 0.3 of a knot disadvantage over the next
7,500-mile leg to Australia (all down-wind and nothing much below force 6)
will put him into port nearly a day behind the opposition.
Almost all the W60s are looking to add an extra crew member for the Southern
Ocean legs, taking them up to 11. Gorillas and winch-grinders need not
apply. It says everything about this Whitbread that the skippers are looking
for more brain-power rather than extra muscle.

FT  23 OCT 93 / London Motor Show: Indulgence first, reality later
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PICKING the star of the London Motor Show depends on your attitude to cars.
Are they a business tool, a mobile extension to the home - or sheer
indulgence?
If an indulgence, there are several on which to feast your eyes at Earl's
Court. One is the AC Ace, a Ford V8-engined convertible which is hand-built
in Surrey a stone's throw from the old Brooklands race track. The Ace is put
forward as a realistic alternative to the class leader among mature
motorists' sports cars, the Mercedes SL.
While the Ace is making its world debut, the DB7 that promises to be the
best Aston Martin for two decades has been seen already at Geneva and
Frankfurt. Powered by a supercharged Jaguar 3.2-litre, in-line, six-cylinder
engine producing 335 horsepower, it is a two-by-two of head-turning
elegance.
An Ace will be around Pounds 50,000; a DB7 - - on sale from next April -
nearer Pounds 80,000. But these are modest prices compared with the Pounds
150,000 Ferrari will ask for its latest offering, the 456GT, when UK
deliveries start early in 1994.
Is Toyota's new, twin-turbocharged, Pounds 37,500, three-litre V6 Supra an
indulgence, too? I suppose so, although this ultra-civilised very high
performer might appeal to a young entrepreneur seeking dashing business
transport.
Worth looking at, if only enviously, are the latest manifestations of the
seemingly everlasting Porsche 911 and the BMW 840Ci coupe. The Porsche, as
always, has an air-cooled, horizontally-opposed six. The BMW is powered by a
four-litre V8 instead of the 850Ci's five-litre V12 and, especially with
automatic transmission, is sheer joy to drive.
All these high-profile, glamorous cars are the icing on the motor show cake.
Of greater personal interest to most visitors are cars that might
realistically grace their garages, or decorate their drives, given an
indulgent employer or understanding bank manager. There are a lot of them at
Earls Court, although not all will be on sale immediately.
Ford's Probe, seen for the first time with right-hand steering and due to
reach Britain early in 1994, is the overdue successor to the Capri. Alhough
Ford-badged, it is built at Mazda's US factory and will be offered with
either a Mazda two-litre, four-cylinder engine or Ford's own 2.5-litre V6. A
pretty car, it competes with the 2.5-litre, V6-engined Vauxhall Calibra.
The Honda Civic coupe, shown first at Frankfurt, is another international
car designed for Europe, made in the US and not even sold in Japan. The
South Korean Kia Mentor 1.6-litre, a neat, power-steered, four-door saloon,
looks most attractive and will be in British showrooms soon, priced keenly
to undersell most of its European and Japanese counterparts.
The new Seat Ibiza, made by Volkswagen's Spanish arm, will soon be in
Britain with three or five doors. Think of it as a cut-price VW Golf
equivalent. Toyota's new three-litre Lexus GS300 (on sale in the UK now at
Pounds 31,950) is a challenger to the Mercedes E-Class and BMW 5-Series.
Mazda's Xedos 9, available in Germany but not due in Britain until early in
the New Year, is related closely to the Xedos 6 but has V6 engines of two or
2.5 litres.
A Volvo saloon or estate with turbo-charging and a top speed of close to 150
mph (240 kph) sounds like a contradiction in terms. But the company thinks
the 850 T-5 will snap at the heels of Pounds 24,000-25,000 cars in the BMW
and Saab Turbo class.
There is a bullish air on the Mercedes-Benz stand where the new C-Class has
pride of place. Last week, Mercedes-Benz UK took orders for nearly 800
vehicles, of which 500 were C-Class. This roomier, curvier replacement for
the best-selling 190 seems bound to become the benchmark for compact
executive saloons. All the engines, including diesels with four and five
cylinders, are multi-valve designs. Prices, starting at Pounds 17,600 for a
1.8-litre C180, are only slightly higher than those of the 190 equivalents.
Also worth a look in this size class is the latest Volkswagen Passat,
face-lifted for 1944 and bristling with safety features, twin air-bags among
them. It is expected to be priced from Pounds 13,000-22,000 when it arrives
in the UK in January.
The first Golf estate, with 25 per cent more luggage space than the
hatchback, and the new Golf Cabriolet are both on show at Earl's Court and
will reach Britain early in 1994.
Can the on/off-road, recreational, four-wheel drive market absorb any more
new models? Toyota clearly thinks so because its 4Runner, with three-litre
petrol or diesel engines, joins the long established Land Cruisers. It looks
as hefty as the Vauxhall Frontera and also shares a pick-up truck's
underpinnings.
Land Rover, meanwhile, is showing the best all-round version of the
Discovery yet: a diesel automatic with a hush pack. This is quiet, has
excelllent fuel economy and is car-like to drive in town.
On Fiat's stand, the Punto - due in Britain next spring - makes its UK
debut.
The London Motor Show at Earl's Court is open daily from 9.30am-7.30pm (9pm
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) and closes on Sunday October 31 at 6pm.
Admission is Pounds 6.50 (Pounds 5 after 5pm) with reductions for children
and pensioners.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Travel: Kenya - just beating around the bush - Afraid of
being eaten, Michael Thompson-Noel still got close to elephants and seven
cheetah
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAY 1, 2pm: Happiness is seeping into me, like a welcome dose of painkiller.
I am at Rekero Farm, under the crest of Kipeleo hill, in the north-western
part of Kenya's Masai Mara conservation area, watching elephants drinking at
a water-hole which is fed by a year-round spring. The elephants snort and
push, and spray themselves with dust.
I arrived from London yesterday and was transferred at once to Nairobi's
smaller airport where I caught a charter flight to an airstrip in the Mara.
Total travelling time from Heathrow: 12 1/2 hours. Impact on the psyche:
immediate and considerable. My regret at transiting Nairobi: absolutely
zero.
Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, admits that the back
streets of Nairobi, where lynchings are commonplace, some by necklacing, are
now no safer than the back streets of Miami, and that the city's vice and
violence have played a role in the decline in Kenyan tourism.
Ron Beaton, who runs Rekero Farm with Pauline, his wife, says: 'Staying
overnight in Nairobi is a complete waste of time. It used to be a fun city;
now it's a den of iniquity.'
So to hell with Nairobi.
By now the wind has shifted slightly. The elephants have smelt me. Irritably
they wave their trunks. They glare across the water-hole. Crossly, they move
away.
The peace at Rekero - a private home with accommodation for six guests  - is
as fine as its old-time hospitality. Guests sleep in twin thatched cottages
which overlook the water-hole, 30 yards away. There is wildlife all around,
including, says Ron Beaton, three prides of lion.
Beaton is a third-generation Kenyan with a farming and wildlife background.
'If clients are hyper on seeing the Big Five (lion, leopard, Cape buffalo,
black rhino and elephant),' he cautions, 'then they'd be better off in the
game lodges. Here, we put more emphasis on an authentic African experience
than on cut-glass luxury.' Yet Rekero is perfectly civilised.
This morning Ron led our little group on a game-drive and walk. I much
preferred the drive. Game-walks make my heart race. You can trudge along for
hours, scarcely seeing a thing. You could easily be eaten. I imagine it
happens often: a roar and a thud and - arrghhh]
What surprised me this morning was that we saw seven cheetah from a range of
a few feet. They virtually ignored the vehicle. First we saw two males,
walking slowly across the plain, their cheeks bloodied from breakfast. Then
a female with a cub (the only survivor of three). And then a female with two
cubs, barely four weeks old, vulnerable and mewling. When they skittered
away, the female called to them anxiously.
Day 2, 6pm: I am sitting alone on Rekero's veranda. The others have gone for
a walk, heedless of gathering lion and of other unspeakable dangers. I am
flipping through the pages of African Hunter, a dinosaur of a tome even when
it was published in 1975. It is a reverential guide to the business of
slaughtering wildlife by a man, James Mellon, who had shot approximately 450
African game animals.
In Chapter II, in a section about Tanzania, Mellon discusses methodology:
'Leopard occur virtually everywhere in Tanzania and can be attracted to dead
bait without much difficulty. Many huge old toms have been taken in the
north along the korongos (dry watercourses) of Masailand, but with luck a
trophy cat can be shot almost anywhere. Where circumstances permit, leopard
can sometimes be drawn out of thick cover by beaters and shot on the run
with 00 buckshot. But baiting in trees with putrid carcases is usually more
successful.'
Today, Richard Leakey says that Kenya's conservation efforts are producing
good results. Nearly 28,000 square miles are protected areas. In the past
two years Kenya has attracted more than Dollars 150m (Pounds 99.3m) in
outside aid to spend on wildlife conservation and the necessary
infrastructure.
'It is often claimed,' he says, 'that in Kenya more and more tourists are
clustering round fewer and fewer animals. Yet of 52 national parks and
reserves, only seven are accessible to mass tourism.
'Our security is excellent. We have 900 armed men, plus good surveillance
and intelligence. In general, the standard of safety for tourists in our
parks is good, and commercial poaching has been reduced virtually to zero.
'One of the biggest problems now is destruction of crops by elephants. We
are losing 50-60 elephants a year - no more than 10 in the national parks -
as a result of attacks by villagers, compared with the thousands being lost
previously.
'Kenya is firmly opposed to any renewal of trade in ivory and rhino horn for
at least five years. If trade in ivory were to restart in any part of
Africa, the black market would start again and we would face renewed serious
security problems in our national parks.
'Numbers? Kenya's black rhino population is certainly now 400-450, compared
with 300-350 four years ago. There are 80 white rhino, which are not
indigenous, mostly on private land, and about 26,000 elephants, compared
with a low of possibly 18,000.'
Day 3, 4pm: Now I am at Ol Donyo Wuas - it means spotted hills in Masai -
more than 200 miles south-east of the Mara, in the foothills of the Chyulu
hills which run between Amboseli and Tsavo national parks. This is supremely
beautiful country: semi-arid, with a short-grass plain stretching to the
horizon on which, 45 miles away, Mt Kilimanjaro is propped. Annual rainfall
hereabouts: 20 inches annually. The nearest source of water: a village 23
miles away.
Ol Donyo Wuas is owned and run by Richard Bonham, a buccaneering bachelor -
he is a qualified commercial pilot - who specialises in unusual safaris,
including walking-and-boating adventures from his camp on the Rufiji river
in Selous game reserve, southern Tanzania.
Accommodation at Ol Donyo Wuas is in four comfortable cottages, limiting
guests to a maximum of eight. Activities available include game drives and
walks, horse riding, horse safaris (you stay in camps each night) and bird
shooting (July to October). Because of the dryness there is less game here
than in the Mara, but there is still quite enough. Unsurprisingly, Bonham
rates the location of his home one of the most startling in Kenya. He
discovered it from the air.
Like Ron Beaton in the Mara, Bonham works closely with the local Masai, who
view him as a friend and from whom he rents his land. I asked Bonham what he
did to help the Masai, beyond his role as an employer.
He said: 'I represent them on a wildlife committee; run a cropping
programme; have set up a women's workshop, which I use as a forum for
wildlife education; have established a trust which pays for wildlife
scholarships and for schoolbooks. And if someone gets mauled by animals, I
try to cover the cost.'
A year ago he was asked to rescue a 17-year-old Masai who had been badly
mauled on a lion hunt. The lion had killed a cow, so a dozen warriors hunted
it. Three speared it; then the 17-year-old was mauled. Bonham rescued him
and flew him to the best hospital in Nairobi which patched him up. Medical
bills alone ran to Dollars 1,500. The warrior recovered; now he is a herder.
A Masai lion-hunt must be a sight-and-a-half. The warriors run the beast
down - stamina is not its forte - and are armed only with spears. The most
courageous warrior is the one who grabs the lion's tail and holds on to it.
Usually the warriors are juiced-up on a decoction of the bark of acacia
nilotica, which acts as a powerful stimulant.
It is a fine plant, the acacia. Other members of the subfamily are used by
medicine men for treating diarrhoea, intestinal worms, itchy rash, female
sterility, snake bite, malaria, bubonic plague, bleeding, skin eruptions,
brain infections, swellings, and head or body sores.
Day 4, 5pm: For a final dose of painkiller I have travelled, via Nairobi, to
the comfortable tented camp on Funzi Island, 40 miles south of Mombasa,
where the pleasant mindless life of small tropical islands anywhere is
abundantly in evidence: fishing, goggling, swimming, or idling through the
mangroves. In an hour's time I start my return trek to London. It gets
harder every time.
Michael Thompson-Noel's trip was organised by Worldwide Journeys and
Expeditions. The company's new brochure is published next week: 8 Comeragh
Road, London W14 9HP, tel: 071-381 8638, fax: 071-381 0836. There is a
15-day 'Homes of Kenya' holiday in the new brochure which takes in Ol Donyo
Wuas, Rekero Farm and Funzi Island, plus Sangare Ranch in the foothills of
the Aberdares. Based on four people travelling together, the price is Pounds
2,795 per person (Jan-Nov) or Pounds 2,930 (Dec). However, Worldwide
Journeys and Expeditions will put together almost any itinerary you want,
for Kenya or elsewhere.
Details of other visits to Kenyan homesteads can be had from Ron Beaton: Off
the Beaton Track, PO Box 14398, Nairobi, tel: 506139/502491. Richard Bonham
can be contacted via PO Box 24133, Nairobi, tel: 882521. For Funzi Island:

FT  23 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The road to fame - Clive Fewins
meets two would-be British film makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A Cotswold village another revival of the British film industry is ready
to take shape. Early next year, producer Genevieve Jolliffe and director
Chris Jones, both less than four years out of film school, launch their
first full-length feature film.
White Angel, a psychological thriller, will be one of a handful of
all-British features on general release in the past 12 months. Classed as
low budget, it cost less than Pounds 1m to produce. The pair had to raise
all the capital themselves, and they have had to wait four years before
seeing any return.
'All the money has come through our own contacts - friends, friends of
friends, and simply people who have faith in us and our ability to produce a
good film that will make a lot of money,' said Jolliffe.
'Several hundred people have lent us sums ranging from Pounds 100 to Pounds
30,000. None if it came from a bank.'
Although only 23, Jolliffe had 'lived films' since being captivated by Star
Wars at the age of seven. Two years ago she gained an entry in the Guinness
Book of Records for being the youngest British film producer, and the
world's youngest female producer. After film school in Bournemouth she and
partner Chris Jones made another psychological thriller, The Runner, with a
group of friends. It was backed by a large film distribution company and
made a lot of money. Jolliffe and Jones made nothing, but they had an
excellent product to show the backers of White Angel.
Nevertheless, it has been a hand-to-mouth existence for the past three years
since forming Living Spirit Pictures and making White Angel. They have
existed on grants from the government Enterprise Allowance Scheme and a gift
of Pounds 5,000, plus much material support from The Prince's Youth Business
Trust. In addition they have made a number of small but profitable
promotional videos.
In the last six months, however, the pair's day-to-day income has all but
dried up. White Angel will not hit British screens until November 15, when
it will get two screenings at the West End Odeon as part of the London Film
festival. By then, hopefully, the couple's fortunes will have improved. By
the end of this month the first payments from pre-sales of the film, arising
from August's Montreal film festival, will arrive in the Living Spirit bank
account.
'We know that by the end of the year we will have taken at least half a
million pounds,' Jones said. 'We shall immediately pay out about half of
that to our creditors but we shall still be poor for another 12 to 18 months
because most of the remaining money will go straight in to our next project.
'This is under wraps at present but it is much bigger than White Angel. We
have had serious offers of pre-sales valued at more than Pounds 2m from some
very large distributors who are prepared to buy the rights before the film
is made.'
Jolliffe said: 'We told our investors they would get their money back and
double it, and we are well on course. The plan is that they will get an
additional one per cent of the total profits for each Pounds 10,000 they
have invested.
'What we said all along is proving true. White Angel got rave reviews at the
Montreal Film Festival at the end of August. It is so low budget it cannot
fail to make money.
'But our movies are our existence. It is a long cycle to financial success
in this business. It will be a long time before we are millionaires.'
In the meantime the couple lives with difficulty. 'Our biggest outgoing has
been the rent of the cottage - Pounds 450 a month,' said Jones, an ebullient
25-year-old.
'It is quite easy to drive to west London, to dubbing theatres, sound
transfer bays, equipment hire companies, publicists, and all the other
specialist services we need,' he added. 'Also, we have all the editing
equipment we need here in the cottage. It cames as part of an Pounds 8,000
seedcorn grant from Cheshire County Council.
'Besides, more than half of White Angel was shot here, so we are very
attached to the building, although we shall probably move and buy something
for ourselves with some of the proceeds of the film.'
The film is set entirely in suburban London, Jolliffe and Jones having
deliberately written the screenplay to suit a location in the outer suburbs.
They started shooting some of the scenes in a rented Ruislip house before
their move to the Cotswolds. However, after they moved out, they were unable
to return to shoot other scenes in the same interior. So they had to
recreate that in the garage at their current cottage.
'When we filmed The Runner in and around the cottage we occupied near
Nantwich we hired Terence Ford, the brother of Harrison Ford, to play the
all-American action-man hero,' said Jones. 'When he arrived, direct from
Hollywood, he found, to his enormous surprise, that all the crew as well as
the actors, were staying in the same house. It was quite a shock as he was
used to having an enormous camper van to himself. However, he stayed the
course.
'It was much the same here.' White Angel will get a limited theatrical
release in the new year, but in the meantime, through their agents, the
couple have already made sales totalling Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 in
the US alone. Rights have been sold in Korea and Venezuela and negotiations
are going on with distributors in the UK, Germany and Spain.
Jolliffe and Jones believe that, in spite of a mass of talent, the British
film industry will not return to anything like the health of the 1950s and
1960s.
'The problem seems to be that the British see film-making as an art, not an
industry. So in this country the professionals don't make great movies any
more - they make terribly important films. We represent a new generation of
film makers. Our aim is to revive the British film industry. No less.'
White Angel, starring Peter Firth, Harriet Robinson and Don Henderson,
producer Genevieve Jolliffe, director Chris Jones.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Looking to the future - The
Speculator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE US, futures funds look after some Dollars 21bn of assets, but the
sector has yet to take off in the UK. Only a few managers have entered the
market since the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) licenced such funds
in 1991.
In part, this is because of a public image that links futures with wild
speculation. But futures can be used to reduce risk, as well as to increase
it. It is thus important that potential investors understand the different
types of futures funds.
One simple use of futures funds is to match a particular index. This is
relatively easy to do, since most major stock market indices are traded on
one of the world's futures exchanges. Furthermore, since for every futures
buyer there is a seller, one also can create funds that perform in a
completely opposite way from a given index.
This gives additional scope to those who believe, say, that the FT-SE 100
index is riding for a fall. Instead of just selling shares and investing in
cash, the bear can aim to make a profit from the falling market. John Govett
has a range of bull and bear funds based on US, UK, European and Japanese
indices, as well as other financial commodities such as the US dollar.
The same principle can be applied to provide a geared return on the index -
a so-called GFOF (or geared futures and options fund). Govett has a GFOF
which aims to double the capital growth of the FT-SE 100 index; the
corollary is that, if the index falls, the investor's losses are doubled.
So, this type of fund is only for the strong of stomach (and wallet).
A different variation is to use futures to try to reduce the effect of the
stock market's volatility. Last year, Fidelity launched the Stabiliser
Growth range, a set of four funds covering the UK, America, Europe and
Japan. They were designed to provide a return which does not rise as quickly
as the index in a bull market, but does not fall as fast as the index in a
bear market.
The aim was to create a 'half-way house' for investors who were thinking
about moving funds from the building society into shares but were alarmed by
the risks involved.
In the US, futures funds tend to give the manager greater freedom. Some
funds are allowed to take bull and bear positions in a range of financial
instruments, and even in agricultural commodities, where there is a
perceived opportunity for profit. The investor obviously has to buy on the
basis of the reputation of the fund manager, although there are funds which
use a range of futures specialists. Such speculative vehicles have yet to be
launched in the UK, thanks mainly to the tight rules of the SIB.
For European investors, ED&amp; F. Man offers a range of futures funds which
take the diversified approach. The key to overcoming traditional European
caution has been to offer a guarantee. So, a substantial proportion of the
funds is invested in zero coupon bonds, which grow to repay the investor's
initial capital; the rest is used to play the futures markets.
The Man funds, which are registered in offshore centres such as Bermuda, are
not SIB-recognised and cannot be sold directly to UK investors.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: One for worldly stock-pickers - Unit
Trusts / A look at the merits of Framlington's international Recovery fund -
Unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEAKNESS of UK recovery funds is that they are hit badly when recession
affects the British economy. Because such funds are designed to invest in
high risk stocks, returns are volatile.
An international recovery fund should be able to avoid some of these
problems. Although the fortunes of the world's major economies obviously are
linked, it is often the case that they are out of synchronisation. Some
economies (at present, the US and the UK) are recovering while others remain
in recession. That should give investors a smoother ride.
Framlington runs one of the few international recovery funds. In fact, for
much of its life (it was set up in April 1982), the fund concentrated on
just two countries - the US and the UK - where Framlington believed its
expertise was concentrated. That changed when Rebecca Thomas took over as
manager in 1991. She gave the fund a much wider spread and the geographical
split of the assets is nowUK (38 per cent), US (32 per cent), Japan (14 per
cent), Europe (12 per cent), Far East (2 per cent) and cash (2 per cent).
Thomas emphasises, however, that Framlington Recovery is 'very much a
stock-picking fund. We are picking the stock because of each company's
potential to recover, not the economy's'
With a world of stocks to choose from, the fund cannot be a one-woman show.
In fact, five people make the stock selections with Thomas focusing on the
UK, Antony Milford on the US, Stephen Watson on Europe, Peter Jordan on
Japan and Christel de Vauman on the far East. And although the fund is worth
only Pounds 50m, it has a very wide spread of holdings. 'We used to own over
200 stocks,' says Thomas. 'Now, it's down to 130.'
The fund picks some stocks early in the recovery cycle: for example, buying
shares in advance of the rights issue that will strengthen a company's
balance sheet. Generally, it looks to hold stocks for two-three years so
that it can benefit from the final phase of recovery when the shares gets
the 'double whammy' of earnings growth and the re-rating of the company's
price-earnings multiple.
The fund's aim is to produce capital growth, and this lack of a dividend
constraint allows Thomas to look at companies where the dividend has been
cut. She is prepared to 'average down' her purchases if she believes in the
story. 'We first bought Asda at 75p, then 44p, then 22p. The average price
we paid was around 40p and the shares are now 60p.'
The recovery approach means, inevitably, that there are few well-known names
in the Framlington portfolio. The trust's largest 10 holdings are Renold,
Hewden-Stuart, Southdown, Avon Rubber, Anchor Bancorp, BMC West Corporation,
Hicking Pentecost, Matthew Clark, Shimano and American Travellers
Corporation. The list contains a mix of companies where the underlying
business is recovering (such as Hewden-Stuart, the UK plant hire company),
or where new management has caused a revival (such as Hicking Pentecost, a
textile group).
The fund's long-term record is excellent. Since launch, the compound annual
return to investors has been 18.8 per cent. The trust is ranked fourth of 44
in the international equity growth sector over the 10 years to October 1,
with growth of 374.5 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested: source
Micropal).
Over the one and three year periods, the trust is in the first quartile (top
25 per cent) of international equity funds, achieving growth of 48.5 and
103.1 per cent respectively. Over five years, however, the fund is just out
of the top quartile, ranking 29th of 112.
Thomas says the slight dip in the five year record was caused by a bad patch
in 1989-90 when both the UK and US economies showed signs of slipping into
recession. She adds that she under-estimated the strength of Japanese stock
market and the yen over the past year, although the Japanese shares the team
selected did perform well. The group has reduced its US weighting
substantially over the past year, believing that the market had got ahead of
itself.
Thomas emphasises that the Recovery fund is not designed for those who want
to track the world stock market index. And Anne McMeehan, managing director
of Framlington Unit Management, says the fund is designed to add 'a bit of
spice to the international investor's portfolio.'
Charges. The initial is 5 per cent and the annual 1.5 per cent (increased
recently from 1.25). Minimum investment is Pounds 500, or Pounds 50 a month
via the savings scheme. The trust is not fully Pepable because it does not
guarantee to keep more than 50 per cent of its assets in the EC. But Pounds
1,500 a year can be invested in the fund as a 'non-qualifying' Pep.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Beware of the sting in the tail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MY portfolio, I have two very successful single-premium investment bonds
with different insurance firms. I rang one company asking about the
procedure for cashing the bond. It replied that any gain would be free from
basic-rate tax, although (a) this might affect entitlement to age allowance
and (b) any charge for higher-rate tax would depend on the individual's
circumstances.
I then rang the Inland Revenue. It assured me there would be no tax, as
capital gains tax was already taken care of in a single-premium bond. But
the Revenue added that it would look on the money I received as income and
reduce age allowance accordingly.
I understand from previous articles that the Revenue admitted in the 1970s
that it was unlawful to restrict age allowance by taking capital gains into
account in matters like this.
When we use the phrase 'capital gains' in our articles and Briefcase
replies, we mean 'capital gains as calculated for the purposes of charging
capital gains tax'; the phrase does not include (as you unfortunately
thought) capital gains chargeable to income tax.
It is not practicable for us to keep defining the words and phrases which we
use commonly - that would make our replies too long and repetitive. You must
bear in mind that every reply is tailor-made for the reader who asked the
question; thus, what we say must not be taken as a statement of universal
application.
What you were told is correct except that the exemption from CGT has nothing
to do with CGT being 'already taken care of in a single-premium bond.'
Exemption from CGT (which is not actually an advantage, because it merely
denies you the benefit of indexation losses) is given by section 210 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
Over the years we have, in fact, given a number of warnings in our columns
about the sting in the tail of single-premium life policies for people over
64 on modest incomes. (Here again, when we use the phrase 'people over 64'
we mean people whose 64th birthday fell before the beginning of the tax year
in question; but we cannot spell that out explicitly on every occasion.) The
surrender or maturity of a single-premium life policy (a so-called
investment bond) can trigger a 12 1/2 per cent age allowance clawback
because section 547 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 says:
'(1) Where under section 541 . . . a gain is to be treated as arising in
connection with any policy . . . if, immediately before the happening of the
chargeable event in question, the rights conferred by the policy . . . were
vested in an individual as beneficial owner . . . the amount of the gain
shall be deemed to form part of that individual's total income for the year
in which the event happened . . .'
(5)' . . . where by virtue of subsection 1 above, a sum is included in an
individual's total income . . . he shall be treated as having paid income
tax at the basic rate on that sum . . .'
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WHO bought permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) when they were
first issued have had some healthy profits. As the table shows, all Pibs are
trading above their issue prices; in the case of Leeds Permanent, the rise
has been 50 per cent.
Pibs are fixed interest securities, issued by building societies, which pay
income twice a year. They offer a higher yield than gilts because of the
greater risks; and Simon Mozley of Hoare Govett, which supplies the table,
notes that the spread over gilts has widened during the past month.
A major risk is that, if a society collapses, those holding Pibs will be
last to be paid back. Furthermore, in normal circumstances, Pibs will never
be repaid and there is no guarantee that investors will get back what they
paid for an issue. On balance, the higher the Pibs' yield, the riskier the
society is deemed to be by the market.
Investors also should note that issues from some of the best known
societies, such as the Halifax, come in Pounds 50,000 denominations.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year, Thomas Buffet, chairman and chief executive of Automated
Security, sold 200,000 shares at 157p; five months later, director CD Buck
also sold stock. Last week, the company gave a profits warning; however,
Buffet bought 250,000 shares at 101p and now holds more than 2m shares. The
last time he bought was in March 1992, when the shares were trading around
85p, so there is a lot to be said for his sense of timing.
Hewden Stuart is a Scottish-based company involved in the hire and
merchandising of construction equipment. Despite an optimistic statement at
the announcement of interim results, the chairman, Sir Matthew Goodwin, sold
300,000 shares at 160p. His residual holding is in excess of 1m and the
transaction was said to have been made for personal financial reasons.
Leonard van Geest, the chairman, sold 446,993 shares in Geest, almost a
third of his existing holding. The company is involved in the distribution
and marketing of fresh food, including bananas.
Three members of the board of Alumasc, including the chairman, sold shares
following a period of relative outperformance. All three retain fairly
sizable stakes.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Easing the pain of extractions -
Bethan Hutton explains the advantages of dental plans that provide
affordable private treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT TIME you need a filling, your dentist might start to extol the merits
of joining a dental plan. The idea is that all routine treatment is covered
for a small monthly premium.
Adults - apart from those on low incomes or state benefits, who are exempt
from charges - are obliged to pay 80 per cent of the NHS charge for all
dental treatment, up to a maximum of Pounds 250. The state pays the rest,
but standard NHS charges are far lower than the normal fees charged by
dentists in private practice.
Last July, payment to dentists for NHS work was cut by 7 per cent. A growing
number have responded by opting out of providing NHS cover for adult
patients.
A survey by the British Dental Association in April found that only 57 per
cent of dentists were taking on new adult NHS patients. In June 1992, the
figure was 88 per cent.
There is considerable regional variation, with dentists in London and the
south being least likely to take on new NHS patients although the majority
will still accept children and charge-exempt adults. A smaller number, about
20 per cent, are not continuing to offer NHS treatment to patients
registered with them.
Accordingly, there is a rapidly expanding market for dental plans which
allow patients to pay a regular, affordable amount for private treatment,
rather than being faced with a big bill when the dentist does the work.
They also give dentists a regular, reliable income and make it
cost-effective for them to concentrate on preventive treatment rather than
relying on expensive repair and cosmetic work to make a living - or even
being tempted to carry out unnecessary work.
Although such schemes sometimes are referred to as 'dental insurance,' the
core element of most is not insurance but capitation - a charge per patient
for providing services which, effectively, spreads costs across time and a
group of patients.
Most, but not all, schemes also include an element of insurance, which
covers emergency treatment abroad and at home.
Unlike private medical insurance, these plans do not tend to be sold through
advertising campaigns. Instead, patients are usually recruited by their own
dentist when they go for a check-up or treatment.
Most schemes require that you should be in 'good dental health' when you
join, which means that you have to finish and pay for any treatment in
progress.
Some plans vary their charges according to your dentist's view of your
dental history and the state of your teeth, while others have standard fees.
The cost might also vary depending on where you live - dentists in London
and other big cities generally charge more.
The broad range of costs is from Pounds 5 to Pounds 20 a month, with the
majority of people paying less than Pounds 12. Some companies have a one-off
registration fee when you join the scheme.
As with any insurance, you should make sure you know exactly what is covered
before you sign up or you could end up having to find more money for
unexpected treatment or extras.
For example, some schemes ask you to pay all or part of the laboratory costs
involved in making crowns and so on, or exclude wisdom tooth extraction or
other more complicated procedures.
Some providers offer a range of plans from basic (covering just check-ups
and general maintenance) to comprehensive (covering crowns, root canal work,
wisdom teeth etc).
For those seeking such a scheme, here is a selection. Denplan, the oldest
and largest, has been going since 1986 and now has several hundred thousand
subscribers. The standard plan covers normal treatment, with insurance for
emergencies.
Bupa, the UK's largest private medical insurer, has just launched
DentalCover in Bristol, Cardiff and Nottingham. It hopes to have enough
registered dentists to cover the whole country by the end of 1994.
The plan covers crowns, bridges, dentures and root treatment in addition to
routine work, including the extraction of wisdom teeth under local
anaesthetic. Patients can opt out of cover for major restorative work if
they want to reduce premiums.
Complete Direct Care (CDC) has about 700 dentists around the UK and 40,000
patients signed up. It has three schemes: NHS Care, which reimburses NHS
charges; Emergency Care, covering only accidents and emergencies; and Cost
Care, the main scheme, which covers private treatment and accident and
emergency insurance and is underwritten at Lloyd's.
Densure started with one dentist in 1986 but has been expanding rapidly for
the past 18 months and now has 50 dentists signed up. It offers a choice of
levels of cover, but no insurance element.
MIDA, an American company, has been operating in the UK since June last
year. It offers three levels of cover, all including world-wide emergency
cover.
There are many other schemes along similar lines involving small groups of
dentists. Companies can also arrange cover for their employees. Corporate
schemes are available from Cigna, CDC, Denplan and National Dental Plan,
among others. A handful of private medical insurance schemes also cover
dental treatment.
If you are happy with your dentist, you might just have to settle for
whatever scheme he is offering, but practices can usually register with more
than one scheme if they think it is worth-while. If your dentist is not
offering a scheme, but you are interested in the idea, mention it at your
next appointment.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Debut for ethical trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRIENDS Provident is set to launch the first ethical investment trust, which
will have a split capital structure and will be available in personal equity
plan form.
Investments will go through two screening processes, one by the Ethical
Investment Research Service (EIRIS) and the other by a committee of
reference which includes such celebrities as Joanna Lumley. Companies will
be chosen on such positive criteria as benefiting the local community, and
rejected on negative grounds such as making arms or gambling.
Friends Provident already runs Pounds 300m of money on an ethical basis,
including three unit trusts and a managed pension fund. Do ethics prevent
investors from making profits?
Not necessarily. The Friends Provident Stewardship fund is 25th out of 77 in
the UK equity growth sector over the seven years to October 1, recording
growth of 106 per cent (offer-to-bid with income re-invested: source
Hardwick Stafford Wright). The other two funds are not quite as successful:
Stewardship Income is 80th out of 92 in the UK equity sector over the five
years to October 1, with growth of 36 per cent; Stewardship North American
is 64th out of 98 in its sector over the same period (with growth of 82 per
cent).
The new trust will offer a mixture of ordinary and zero dividend preference
shares, and will have a limited life. Full details of the issue will not be
available until November. Broker Greig Middleton is looking to raise over
Pounds 30m.
Edinburgh Investment Trust, the second largest in the industry, this week
reported a 7.2 per cent rise in its net asset value per share over the six
months to September 30 and a 3.5 per cent rise in its interim dividend.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Warnings on housing scheme - A look
at the latest batch of BES offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESS expansion scheme called Housing the Homeless, which says it aims
to offer accommodation in the East Anglian area, has sparked warnings from
other parts of the BES industry.
The Peabody Trust, which has launched a string of successful
house-the-homeless BES companies in association with Downing Corporate
Finance, has said in a statement that neither body has any relationship with
the new BES.
The Allenbridge Group, publishers of Best BES Advice, adds in its latest
bulletin: 'We have a number of very serious concerns about this issue, and
would advise extreme caution.
'We are principally concerned that the option agreement prejudices the tax
qualifying status. Moreover, we have seen no financial information on the
guarantor whatsoever. Be careful.'
The Investment Analysis bulletin, published by the Briish Taxpayers
Association, says of the new scheme: 'The prospectus makes a number of
claims . . . We are not convinced . . . these claims will be met.
Furthermore, numerous inconsistencies appear in the documentation. Avoid.'
The 'helpline' telephone number for the BES was regularly engaged yesterday.
Accountant Moores Rowland is warning investors not to make hasty decisions
on any investment as the demise of the BES in December approaches.
Partner Robin Stevens says: 'With the scheme coming to an end, there is
bound to be considerable interest in the final period. But it would be a big
mistake to jump at anything offered - careful consideration is needed.'
The present round of BES companies, which have arranged exits and cash
backing, are very different from the early ones which were highly risky,
small start-up companies. Johnson Fry, sponsor of a large number of issues
in the late 1980s, has been criticised for the number of its companies which
went bust. Problems have emerged recently at Quality Coaching Inns and on
the Fantom and Fast BES issues.
Chairman Charles Fry says that of 100 old-style BES issues up to January
1992, 28 per cent failed, accounting for 25.5 per cent of the money raised.
He says, however, that this is a lower proportion than might be expected for
similar venture capital schemes, and the risks were made clear at the time.
Johnson Fry is still active in the BES market and this week sees the launch
of another housing-the-homeless scheme, the Twelfth Johnson Super Growth. It
is a Pounds 5m, contracted-exit, assured tenancy scheme from Acton Housing
Association, in association with the London Borough of Harrow, and offers an
exit price of 121p after five years - equivalent to 13.93 per cent net for
higher rate taxpayers. But the scheme is not cash-backed.
The Countrywide Rentals Second Growth Scheme is another Johnson Fry BES,
backed by the Leeds &amp; Holbeck building society, which aims to raise Pounds
7m to buy mostly repossessed residential properties from the L&amp;H.
It offers higher-rate tax-paying investors a return of 13.51 per cent net
via a non-status, non-recourse loan at 117p per share (assuming subscription
at 99p before November 12) after the end of the five-year period. It also
offers investors 50 per cent of any extra gains if property prices rise
substantially.
BESSA North of England is a contracted-exit scheme with an FT-SE option from
Close Brothers and the North of England building society. It aims to raise
Pounds 10m to buy residential properties, to be let on assured tenancies.
Investors can choose between a fixed return of 120p a share or a Footsie
investment with a lock-in once the index has grown by 24 per cent - or a
combination of the two.
Warwickshire Select is an assured tenancy scheme, involving two companies,
from Berkeley Fund Managers. There is no arranged exit, but the managers say
their aim is to ensure investors receive at least Pounds 1.50 a share after
six years.

BET, the business services group in the latter stages of a three-year
restructuring, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds
48m on Monday. The figures could include some profits on disposal, although
the group has been selling businesses on modest valuations. Now the group is
better managed, cash is being generated and its balance sheet is under
control, investors will focus on whether it has formulated a plan to inject
some more excitement into its portfolio of businesses - a necessary step if
it is to approach the rating enjoyed by the likes of rival Hays.
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, reports full-year results on Thursday.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits to come in at between Pounds 640m and Pounds
690m, compared with Pounds 504m last year. The company will benefit
substantially from favourable exchange rates, so attention will be focused
on underlying sales growth. Of particular interest will be the progress of
Zovirax, the best-selling shingles and herpes treatment. The impact of an
unfavourable clinical trial on sales of AZT, the HIV treatment, will also be
followed closely.
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports
third-quarter results on Thursday and pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m
and Pounds 70m are expected despite a difficult three months. Demand on the
Continent was slow during August, and recovery in the UK and US has been
hesitant. The scale of the post-holiday pick-up in September will be
important.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Govett offers a 7% yield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW international investment trust, with a yield of 7 per cent paid
quarterly, is being launched by fund management group John Govett. It will
invest in an unusual mix of UK equities, high-yielding international bonds
and emerging markets.
The aim of the Govett High Income investment trust will to give investors a
high and steadily rising income with the potential for long term capital
growth. The bulk of the income will come from the bond portfolio. which will
buy government bonds in developed countries such as Italy and Spain but also
in such emerging markets as South Africa, Mexico and Turkey.
Yields on Turkish government bonds are around 81 per cent, so obviously this
is a high risk area. But Govett argues that emerging market debt should
benefit from the same factors that have caused so many to buy emerging
market equities.
Economic liberalisation and increased capital inflows will improve the
credit rating of emerging countries and encourage them to adopt
anti-inflation policies. Therefore, says Govett, the risk premium on the
debt of these countries will contract, giving investors above-average
returns.
As evidence, Govett cites figures for the year to September 30. The return
on Turkish bonds, in local currency terms, was 77.2 per cent. Although the
Turkish lira fell by 43.2 per cent against the pound, the net return to
sterling-based investors was still a healthy 23.9 per cent.
Only 34 per cent of the portfolio will be in international bonds (and just 4
per cent in Turkey). Around 14 per cent will be in emerging market equities,
which will be expected to provide capital growth. The remaining 52 per cent
of the portfolio will be in higher-yielding UK equities, with a particular
emphasis on smaller and medium-sized companies.
This particular combination of investments reflects the areas which Govett
believes are attractive at present. The managers will have the flexibility
to change the investment strategy; however, a minimum of 50 per cent of the
portfolio will be kept in UK equities to ensure the trust qualifies for Pep
status.
Full details will be available in November but the trust will have a 10-year
life. Its 7 per cent yield will attract income-seeking investors, but they
should be aware of the risk profile.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Now, it's the motor card - A look at
a new initiative from Vauxhall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH by Vauxhall Motors this week of a British version of the GM
credit card available in the United States, means that the motor card has
arrived in the UK. The GM card aims to compete with the established credit
cards both on basic price and through added benefits from frequent use.
Using the general purpose card - available at the customer's choice as
either as Visa or MasterCard - earns points towards a discount on buying a
new Vauxhall vehicle. Five per cent of the value of any transaction on the
card counts as a rebate on a car, up to a maximum of Pounds 500 worth of
discount points in a year.
Points can be accumulated for up to five years but can be 'spent' at any
time after the first monthly statement. The greatest available reduction on
a car or van would be Pounds 2,500, but this could be achieved only by
having spent at least Pounds 10,000 through the GM card each year for five
years. This is considerably higher than the average spent on a credit card
in a year. But points will be transferable within an immediate family - for
example, to a spouse, daughter or son - so increasing the prospects of
accumulating a more substantial amount.
Vauxhall says the rebate points will not affect any saving from other
promotions or incentives; nor need they inhibit any individual car buyer's
ability to haggle with the dealer. Anyone wanting to use the GM card points
towards a Vauxhall need not reveal that until after a price has been agreed.
Meanwhile, a special scheme is to be set up in April next year to cater for
company car drivers. too.
While Vauxhall obviously would prefer company car drivers to use discount
points to buy a Vauxhall as a second car, those who do not want to do so
will be able to use the points they acquire as vouchers for high street
goods and services. The co-operating hotels, shops and restaurants have yet
to be named.
A balance transferred from another credit card will also qualify for the
discount points, at the same 5 per cent rate that a purchase would do. With
the GM card itself not available until January, this offers a way of
acquiring points in money spent through any credit card in the run-up to
Christmas.
The Vauxhall GM card will not carry an annual fee and has an annualised
percentage rate of interest of 19.9 per cent. This compares with 22.9 per
cent at Barclaycard and 23.9 per cent at National Westminster bank. Most
card issuers now charge an annual fee of Pounds 10-12.
HFC bank, which will be handling adminstration of the card, says its
credit-scoring will be in line with general market practice. It does not
guarantee, however, that it will match the credit limits offered by the
established cards. At some point, the card could also entitle the holder to
a discount on other goods and services: Vauxhall is looking hard at taking
on corporate partners, but does not necessarily expect to have arrangements
in place for the first day of the venture.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: SIB changes rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODEST changes to the unit trust industry were proposed by the Securities
and Investments Board, the UK's main regulator, this week, writes Philip
Coggan. The main one is that funds will be allowed to charge exit fees when
investors sell their holdings. Since such fees usually trail off over the
years, this should benefit long term investors.
SIB did not, however, come down in favour of single pricing, the system used
commonly outside the UK, and which is simpler for investors to understand.
Many in the industry feel single pricing would penalise existing investors,
since new ones would not always pay the full cost of creating units. The
existing dual pricing system will be maintained, but open-ended investment
companies, set to be introduced in 1995, will have just one price.
Another change is abolishing the restricted list of overseas markets, which
made it difficult for emerging markets trust managers. In future, managers
would have only to select liquid and well regulated markets.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Investment trust option for Lloyd's
 -A look at a limited liability choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors are being offered the chance to put money into an entirely
new kind of investment vehicle - the Lloyd's investment trust. In the wake
of this week's vote by Lloyd's Names in favour of plans to admit 'corporate
members', merchant banks and securities houses are pressing ahead with plans
to lraise Pounds 1.25bn for 16 investment trusts.
Although the structure of each of the trusts differs, the idea behind them
is relatively simple. They will direct the money they raise into a portfolio
of shares and bonds, in much the same way as with any other investment
trust. At the same time, however, their capital will be used to support
Lloyd's syndicates.
If things go well, investors - like Lloyd's Names - can expect to earn a
return both from investments and from underwriting. Syndicates can
underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income for every Pounds 1 of capital, so the
underwriting return alone could be very attractive. A 10 per cent return on
underwriting would become a 20 per cent profit for the investor.
By 1997, when the Lloyd's trusts report their first underwriting results -
in line with Lloyd's three year accounting system - their dividends will
include both investment and underwriting returns.
Unlike Lloyd's Names, the new trusts will have limited liability for losses;
investors are only liable to lose the amount of capital they have committed.
However, just as the potential returns are highly 'geared', so are the
risks. If underwriting syndicates lose money, investors will also suffer
from a sharp fall in their income from investments as their capital is used
to pay insurance losses.
The recent record reveals that this risk is very real. Lloyd's has lost more
than Pounds 6bn since 1988 and specialises in insuring higher risks such as
aircraft, energy installations and natural catastrophes, which can produce
large claims and volatile results for underwriters.
Advocates for the new schemes argue, however, that profitability is
returning as syndicates cut their costs and increase their rates.
They argue that some syndicates have made attractive profits even over the
last five years, and that over the longer-term, Lloyd's has proved to be
more profitable than insurance companies specialising in lower risks like
cars and houses.
Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS Global Research, calculates that between
1950 and 1989, Lloyd's syndicates were nearly twice as profitable as
insurance companies. So how should investors decide between the trusts on
offer? The trusts differ in size (ranging from Pounds 280m to just Pounds
8m); their approach to investments (with some managers favouring a higher
exposure to equities and others a higher exposure to gilts); and their
approach to syndicates (some favour a broader spread of syndicates, while
others are more narrowly focused on certain syndicates or sectors).
In addition they have different relationships with the Lloyd's agents that
have traditionally controlled access to syndicates.
CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, aims to raise up to
Pounds 200m. It has no direct links with either members' agents (which have
traditionally handled the affairs of Names), managing agents (which
administer syndicates) or combined agencies (which own both managing and
members' agencies).
Michael Wade, chief executive of CLM, says that agency links can lead to
conflicts of interest. If a managing agent had links to an investment trust,
he might persuade it to continue supporting his syndicate, even if it were
performing poorly, for example. Wade says fund managers should have freedom
to transfer their support to syndicates capable of earning the best returns
for shareholders.
Funds which are linked to members' agents may also have potential conflicts
of interest. If a syndicate has a shortage of space, a members' agent would
be likely to make the interests of its own Names a priority.
Michael Carpenter, of the London Insurance Market Investment Trust (LIMIT),
says: 'In the present market environment, schemes relying on members' agents
have a conflict between their individual Names and corporate members.'
LIMIT, which aims to raise Pounds 280m to support 98 syndicates, is jointly
sponsored by Samuel Montagu and James Capel.
Another scheme which has no agency links is New London Capital, sponsored by
SG Warburg, and advised by Chartwell Re, the third largest fund formed to
date, while the Johnson Fry Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust avoids the
issue by buying the shares of a range of Lloyd's trusts.
On the other hand, many smaller trusts have close links with agents. The
schemes differ but their supporters argue that agency connections should
give investors improved access to better performing syndicates. Examples
include Angerstein Underwriting Trust and Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust,
which have links with independent members' agents, and Hiscox Select
Insurance Fund, which is connected to a combined agency. Bronek Masojada, of
Hiscox, says: 'It would be foolish to deny the conflict, but our scheme
brings investors increased access and better market intelligence'.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Europe's bright future - Analysts
optimistic about market trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKETS in Europe have been powering ahead recently: Germany and
Switzerland set records this week while others responded well to news on
Thursday of the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts. But is it too late for
small investors to join the European bandwagon, or is there still plenty of
growth to come?
Fund managers surveyed are unanimous in their optimism for Europe's stock
markets generally. The consensus is that while there is little prospect of
real growth in economies or corporate earnings until late 1994 or 1995, the
markets will be driven by investors switching into equities as a result of
interest rate cuts.
Patricia Maxwell-Arnot, manager of the Lazard European Growth Fund, says: 'I
basically believe that European equity markets are supported by two things:
bond yields have fallen substantially and may still go down further, and
interest rates, whichever way you look at it, are inevitably going to fall.
'Local investors are starting to look more favourably at equities. As yields
decline, it is the natural instinct to look first for shares with a high
yield, and then at the market generally. Really, what we are talking about
in Europe is a weight of money story, and I don't think that is going to
change. People argue that valuations are very high, but you can go quite a
long way on the weight of money before fundamentals, in terms of p/e ratios,
begin to create much difficulty. It is difficult not to be optimistic.'
Anthony Bolton, manager of Fidelity's flagship European trust, also has
longer-term reasons for his positive view of Europe. He feels there is still
significant under-ownership of shares by domestic individuals and
institutions in many nations.
'Quite a lot of countries in Europe have got big budget deficits and are
desperately looking for ways to cut expenditure,' he says. 'They have ageing
populations and are trying to shift the pension fund expenditure from the
state to private hands, whether by encouraging funded schemes or private
pension schemes. That creates new equity investors.'
Bolton also sees the large privatisation programmes under way in Italy and
France as stimulating investor demand, rather than depressing the markets.
Although there is general consensus among fund managers on the big picture,
views differ when it comes to which markets are likely to provide the best
performance.
Germany has experienced spectacular stock market performance over the past
few weeks but UK fund managers are not rushing in. 'I do not like Germany, I
think it is overpriced,' says Talal Shakerchi, who manages Providence
Capitol's European trust. 'I would prefer to be in other European markets.'
Lorna Harnby, one of the team managing the Fleming Continental European
investment trust, agrees: 'In Germany, we are still underweight because the
effect of low interest rates on the German market is much less marked than
elsewhere. We are finding re-structuring stories in Germany  - the classic
example is Volkswagen. In the absence of growth, we are making sure we are
investing in companies which are re-structuring; they will emerge at the
other end leaner and fitter.'
France has been popular for some time. Harnby says: 'We are very positive
there. We are very overweight in the French market, basically because we
think they have got the furthest to fall.'
Some investors' enthusiasm is wearing thin, though. 'I think the problem in
France is really that although companies have depressed earnings, their
stock prices have generally not fallen as much as in some other countries,'
says Shakerchi.
Switzerland offers a slightly different investment climate. 'It is perhaps a
market all on its own,' says Shakerchi. 'Companies tend to have very
international earnings - the Swiss have been very good at developing
exposure to emerging markets, with operations in South America and the
smaller Asian countries. Those areas are growing like mad. It is really
quite a different story to the rest of Europe, but it is still an attractive
story.'
Maxwell-Arnot is also a fan. 'We have been big bulls of Switzerland. Swiss
financial shares are relatively under-priced - we have had quite a good run
in insurance and in banks.'
Scandinavia is popular with most of the managers. Shakerchi sees markets
there as offering the best value, along with Switzerland. 'Certainly, many
stocks in those markets are well below historic highs. At the end of last
year, I was finding a lot of cheap stocks in Scandinavia, he says. If you
are looking at the core ERM countries, I think Denmark is perhaps the most
attractive.'
Maxwell-Arnott: 'Unfortunately, we have been consistently wrong on
Scandinavia. I just find the whole market very expensive and, personally, I
always try to limit the downside risk by buying things which are cheaply
valued. In my view, Sweden is not cheaply valued and the other markets are
pretty small.'
Italy attracts mixed feelings. Shakerchi: 'The stocks are often very
volatile there. They can move up and down by very large percentages, and it
is not always apparent why they have done that. What we have tended to do in
Italy is just buy a few stocks where we think the long term prospects are
very good.'
Harnby is also cautious. 'We are neutrally weighted in Italy; there is a
very high political risk; and because that is not something you can apply
any logic to, we don't want to be anything more than neutral.'
Maxwell-Arnot is more positive. 'I do believe they have got their act
together in terms of reducing their public sector deficit. If you look over
a year, I think the market could be one with the most favourable environment
and the best chance of revaluations.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: Reality of new issues fashion - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Virtuality Group, which makes computer software simulating virtual
reality, leapt to an 82 per cent premium when they started trading on
Tuesday - making the launch one of the most successful as well as intriguing
of the recent wave of new issues.
Supported by a rising market, most of this year's new issues are now trading
at a healthy premium to their flotation price. However, private investors
would be unwise to conclude that all new issues are therefore a safe bet.
There were several unusual features about the Virtuality issue, which sought
to raise Pounds 9.45m for product development. Institutions worldwide
expressed interest in the company, which uses headsets and software to
generate a three-dimensional world - or virtual reality - with which people
can interact.
John Gregory, of the stockbroker Beeson Gregory, said the issue was also
unusual in the degree of genuine press interest in company and its founder,
Jonathan Waldern, 33, who started the company in the garage of his Leicester
home in 1987.
Because the flotation aimed to raise only a modest amount, most of the
shares went to fund managers. About 80 institutions received a total of 5.9m
shares, but this number fell sharply amid heavy turnover as they booked a
quick profit and sold to the hundreds of private investors keen for a piece
of the action.
Offering what might prove to be the technology of the future has obvious
attractions. Dorling Kindersley, which publishes highly illustrated
reference books, has seen the price of its shares more than double since it
was floated last October. This is partly because the company has a stake in
another futuristic area , multi-media, which combines CD and computer
technology.
Picking the right technology is not the whole story, however. Video cassette
recorders have transformed how we use television, but Philips and even the
mighty Sony both lost out in the battle over which format would dominate the
global market. Virtuality has impressive shareholders in the shape of IBM
and Motorola, yet even after this week it still only has a market
capitalisation of Pounds 79m, making it in a very small player indeed.
The fact that Virtuality is still making losses also made it an unusual sort
of flotation candidate. One attraction of new issues to institutions in the
current market is that most of the companies coming to market have a track
record and plausible story to tell, which have been checked by their
advisers. So long as the shares are not greedily priced, they therefore
present a fairly safe bet for the fund managers.
Prices are normally set at a level which give the company's backers a modest
initial premium, often because the companies want to attract and maintain
the long-term support of the institutions. Two engineering groups which
floated this year, David Brown Group and Quadramatic, have already come back
to the market to raise money for acquisitions.
Gregory says most flotations will be oversubscribed, if they are priced
correctly. But even a good company can be shunned if the advisers are too
ambitious: 'It's almost always feast or famine.'
Stock market fashion can also be crucial. Shares in JD Wetherspoon, the
London pub chain, have more than doubled since flotation last October. They
might have been thought to attract strong interest from the public then, but
the intermediaries' portion was only 79.4 per cent subscribed, leaving the
rest of the shares with the institutions. The flotation just missed last
year's pre-Christmas rise in the market.
Beeson Gregory placed about 25 per cent of the available Virtuality shares
with private-client stockbrokers. It is keen to increase the involvement of
private investors in new issues, perhaps by some sort of tendering
arrangement.
New issues can thus offer investment opportunities, but institutions are on
the inside track. Private investors who are interested in a particular
flotation should check market opinion of the pricing.
Above all, they should not be extrapolate too much from the performance of
unusual companies such as Virtuality in a bull market.

Credit card holders are largely unaware of the interest rates they pay,
according to a survey from Save &amp; Prosper, which recently launched a
low-rate card. Nearly 70 per cent did not know the rate charged on their

The survey found that around 37 per cent of card holders do not pay off
their balance in full each month. New GM card, page IV.

Halifax building society is launching a new scheme to help existing
customers with negative equity to move house. The scheme will allow
borrowers who meet certain conditions to carry forward any shortfall on
selling their property, and at the same time take out a 100 per cent
mortgage on a new property.
A maximum of Pounds 25,000 negative equity can be carried forward, as long
as the total new mortgage does not exceed 125 per cent of the value of the
new property. Interest on the element will be charged at prevailing rates
but will not be eligible for tax relief.

of funds - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies recorded a net inflow of funds in September, for the
first time since May. The societies cited an absence of negative factors,
rather than any positive news, for the turnround. Summer outflows had been
caused by the holiday season, August spending on L-registration cars and the
BT3 share issue.
As the graph shows, the Pounds 124m inflow in September was still well below
the figures being recorded in the first five months of the year. The
societies said that competition from other savings media, such as unit
trusts, was still tough.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: Pause for breath before surging on - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street paus-ed for breath this week, after a feverish up-ward run, but
by yesterday it seemed to have recovered sufficient confidence to keep the
bull market intact.
The week has been dominated by the third quarter results season, which
produced its usual share of nasty surprises and market jitters.
Yet the main message of the results season so far appears to have been
positive: the gradual recovery of the US economy is intact, with GDP
expanding at around 3 per cent a year, and this has been reflected in the
financial reports from some of the most cyclically sensitive sectors.
Wall Street was particularly pleased on Thursday when Caterpillar, the heavy
equipment company, and Cummins Engine, maker of diesel engines, reported
better than expected results and brisk demand for their machines.
Better results have also been reported by several of the leading US
airlines, with both American Airlines, the largest US carrier, and Northwest
Airlines announcing rare profits for the third quarter.
The market has also took heart from the battle for Paramount Communications,
the film and book company, where QVC Network, the television home shopping
company, has made an an unsolicited Dollars 9.5bn takeover proposal, while
cable company Viacom has made an agreed Dollars 7.6bn offer. Paramount,
while proceeding with the Viacom deal, has been refusing to talk to QVC.
On Thursday, QVC tried to force Paramount to the negotiating table by
turning its bid from a mere proposal, for discussion with the Paramount
board, into a firm offer to its shareholders - a tender offer for 51 per
cent of the company's stock. This offer has the same value as its opening
proposal - Dollars 80 for each Paramount share - but will be all in cash,
rather than a mixture of cash and stock.
Few investors seem likely to accept, since Wall Street is anticipating a
long bidding war for Paramount. But the action could rapidly tease out a
higher offer from Viacom and push Paramount's board to the negotiating
table.
The bid action and encouraging results helped the Dow Jones industrial
average recover yesterday from its week-long weakness and at lunchtime it
stood some 10 points above its all-time closing record of 3,652.1, reached
on August 25.
However, nervousness about long-term US interest rates could prevent it
making much more ground in the near term.
In spite of fears at the start of the week bank lending rates were not about
to tumble, it seemed. However, with demand for loans remaining low and banks
increasingly awash with capital, an erosion of lending margins still looks
likely.
JP Morgan sparked a minor rout by announcing that it was cutting its prime
lending rate - the rate used by banks to determine loans mainly to smaller
businesses and on consumer credit - from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The
news came out of the blue. And its surprise nature added to its shock value
and prompted a 4 per cent drop in bank shares.
Other big commercial banks spent the rest of the week playing down the
significance of the Morgan move, while nervously looking to see who might be
tempted next into a pre-emptive interest rate cut. In one sense they were
right: Morgan, after all, has little business tied to the prime rate, and
the move may be more in undermining competitors than in increasing its own
lending business.
Also, a lower prime may do little immediate damage to bank earnings.
Citibank said a half point cut in its prime rate would cost it Dollars 100m
a year in net interest revenue, although it would probably be offset by
other factors (such as an increase in demand for loans.) Chemical, which
reported third quarter earnings per share of Dollars 1.84 (up from 98 cents
a share) said a prime cut would cost it only around 8 cents a share but it
was not planning to cut, it added.
Market willingness to mark down bank share prices so quickly, though,
reflected the fact that lending margins will have to fall eventually. The
big commercial banks last week reported further advances in their key tier
one capital ratios (even Citibank passed the 6 per cent milestone, a level
almost unthinkable just two years ago) prompting several to question at what
level they would begin to look over-capitalised.
Faced with the choice of dropping their credit standards to attract business
or charging less for loans, most banks would prefer the latter. Bank share
prices may have recouped some of their of their losses by the end of the
week, but the day when all big banks are forced to drop their prime rates
seemed a step closer.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: City dances to euphoria's siren song - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST intriguing story in the FT this week appeared on the capital
markets page on Wednesday. It started: 'Bangkok Land, Thailand's biggest
property group, is planning to launch a Dollars 600m Euro-convertible
debenture.'
We live, of course, in jaded times. And doubtless Bangkok Land is Thailand's
biggest property group. But, still, that sentence makes you blink. After
all, even these days, Dollars 600m is a lot of money. The average British
property group might think twice about an issue of that size. Even blue-chip
British Land, launching a debenture in the spring, managed to keep its
appetite for cash to Pounds 200m.
Thai new issues may seem of limited relevance to the average British
investor. But, even in these days of global money transmission, sentiment is
more fungible across borders than cash. And the sentiment that allows
Bangkok Land to tap the Euromarkets on such a scale is one that has proved
particularly contagious in the past: euphoria.
This comes in two varieties: specific and general. The specific sort is  -
in this instance - a belief in the apparently magical growth properties of
the south-east Asian economies. Although such enthusiasms start off grounded
in fact, calculation soon gives way to blind faith.
Still, the rational investor can easily avoid a specific enthusiasm. Such
localised bursts of hysteria are usually easy to monitor. Someone sceptical
about the 1980s' enthusiasm for small company shares, shown in the chart,
could have opted out of the ride when the ascent became stratospheric early
in 1987. And, despite the recent recovery of interest in small companies,
the market seems to have this enthusiasm under control.
General euphoria is much harder to avoid: it seeps into your bones little by
little. You start off buying a new tie and end up with an over-weight
position in Bolivian warrants.
It might seem absurd to talk about euphoria when much of the country is
still mired in gloom. But, for many of the people in the City, the good
times are back. The markets are rising almost everywhere, new people are
being hired.
It becomes psychologically harder each day to see the glass as half-empty
rather than half-full. That helps explain why the stock market has continued
to set new highs. The FT-SE 100 closed yesterday at 3199 up 10.7, a rise of
61.4 on the week.
A classic example of the half-full glass came on Tuesday when the Bank of
England announced there would be no gilt auction in November. The market
interpreted this as a sign that the funding pressures on the government had
eased and that there might not need to be an auction in December, either.
The yield on 10-year gilts fell; by Wednesday it was below 6 3/4 per cent.
Yet, figures published only the day before had re-emphasised the
government's financial straits. The public sector borrowing requirement for
September was Pounds 5.88bn; quarterly borrowing is 40 per cent higher than
a year ago.
The scale of the public sector deficit was a central theme of the 'Green
Budget' published by Goldman Sachs and the Institute of Fiscal Studies on
Tuesday. The PSBR today is no higher, as a percentage of gdp, than it was in
the mid-1970s but there are two reasons to find it more worrying.
First, much of the 1970s' PSBR was made up of the losses of nationalised
industries. Those losses have gone, leaving a much bigger deficit for the
government itself.
Second, because so much of the national debt was paid off in the 1980s, the
burden of interest payments is much lower than it was in the mid-1970s; so
the 'primary deficit,' the heart of the government's borrowing, is over 4
per cent of gdp, a spectacularly high level.
Still, if the economy performs as the Green Budget authors expect,
government borrowing will be down to manageable levels by 1997-98. That
means that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, could probably squeak by without
increasing taxes.
They recommend, however, some modest tax-raising, partly to allow tighter
fiscal policy to be offset by easier money. This is a course the markets
clearly expect, especially after this week's half-point cut in German
interest rates which takes the Bundesbank's discount rate (the floor of the
'tunnel' within which actual market rates are set) below UK base rates.
In pricing all this into stock and bond prices, the market is acting
perfectly sensibly. These are, after all, the most likely outcomes. But what
if the glass is actually half empty and recession abroad continues to hold
down economic growth, pushing up government borrowing?
After all, the lowest of the Green Budget's three forecasts for gdp growth
over the next five years, a not-entirely-gloomy 1.7 per cent, yields a PSBR
that actually goes up, rather than down. That is almost certainly not
reflected in current prices.
The Green Budget also points out that stopping tax-exempt investors, such as
pension funds, reclaiming the advance corporation tax paid by companies on
their dividends would raise the tempting sum of Pounds 3bn without any
individual taxpayer noticing.
After all, the amount of tax reclaimable was cut, in effect, in the spring
Budget, yet there were no rallies of actuaries at Central Hall.
The stock market most certainly would notice, though: such a change would
cut sharply the after-tax return on equities for tax-exempt investors. That
would encourage them to shift the balance of their portfolios away from
equities, leading, on some estimates, to a 10-15 per cent fall in share
prices.
On balance, it is not very likely. But, it is a possibility - one that, in
its present mood, the market is happy to ignore. Which is where we came in.
As with emerging markets, the mood is what counts.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Markets: The bulls among the fund groups - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER MIND the new funds which investment managers keep advertising in
newspaper and mailshots. Would it be better for investors to buy shares in
the fund management groups themselves?
The question is given particular topicality by the forthcoming offer of a 25
per cent stake in Gartmore, the fund management group owned by Banque
Indosuez. But it is also prompted by investment conditions, which are
bringing fund management groups a double benefit.
First of all, world stock markets are reaching all-time highs. Secondly, low
interest rates are persuading private investors to switch out of the
building society and into equity-based products such as unit and investment
trusts.
Both factors serve to increase the level of funds under management, on which
the managers' fees are based. Better still, the two elements are mutually
reinforcing. The surge of private investor money is helping to push the
stock market to new heights, and the sight of higher share prices is
encouraging more investors to enter the market.
It is an old maxim that it costs no more to manage Pounds 150m of funds than
it does to manage Pounds 100m. Once a fund management group has covered its
fixed costs (office space, computers, salaries and so on), any increase in
revenue goes straight through to the bottom line. Conversely, a fall in
funds can have a disproportionate effect on profits.
Accordingly, as Graeme Caton, of James Capel, puts it 'fund management group
shares are highly geared to world stock markets.' So if you believe that
stock markets will continue to enjoy their bullish run, and that the
low-inflation, low-interest-rate scenario will continue, fund management
group shares might, on the surface, seem a highly attractive investment.
Looking at the US, one can see the phenomenal amounts of money which can be
shifted into collective funds, once investors decide to make the move. In
1980, only 6 per cent of US investors owned mutual funds; today it is 27 per
cent. Leading US group Fidelity had Dollars 20bn under management 10 years
ago; it now has Dollars 220bn. Rival Vanguard has grown from Dollars 7bn to
Dollars 114bn over the same period. US investors have been placing around
Dollars 1bn a day into mutual funds (the American equivalent of unit trusts)
this year, in response to low interest rates.
While UK investment flows will never match the absolute levels of those in
the US, an equivalent shift in British investors' portfolios would have an
enormous impact on the profits of UK fund management groups. Traditionally,
the average Briton has been happy to keep savings in building societies,
which have a much better reputation than the US savings and loans
institutions. Just 4 per cent of UK investors own unit trusts.
As ever, there are no free lunches. The markets have already taken into
account the bull factors for fund management group shares and have reacted
accordingly. M &amp; G shares, for example, passed the Pounds 10 a share mark
yesterday, around 50 per cent up from their low for the year. Perpetual
shares have now climbed to 807p, compared with 142p a year ago.
The ratings accorded to some of these companies are discounting a lot of
future growth. Perpetual's shares are now trading on a historic p/e of 64;
Aberdeen Trust shares are on a p/e of 39. On the other hand, the last time
that Perpetual announced results (in May), interim pre-tax profits had more
than doubled from Pounds 2.18m to Pounds 5.09m, on the back of a climb in
funds under management from Pounds 846m to Pounds 1.34bn
Funds have since risen to Pounds 2bn thanks to the host of performance
awards Perpetual received at the end of 1992, which have made it a prime
choice for IFAs and retail investors in 1993.
Perpetual represents one of the purest plays on the growth in retail funds
in the UK fund management sector. Other companies, such as Mercury Asset
Management, depend to a much greater extent on managing pension fund money.
While this rises in line with markets, it is a mature industry, with
improving market share the best way of increasing funds under management.
Pension fund management is also a much lower margin business than managing
unit or investment trusts - which is one reason why a group such as MAM
trades on a much lower multiple (around 17) than Perpetual. (Another factor,
of course, is Mercury's much greater size; it cannot grow as fast as
Perpetual.)
Around 77 per cent of Gartmore's assets under management are pension funds.
However, its strong recent performance record means it is gaining new
pension clients and since it already manages around Pounds 2bn of unit and
investment trusts, it should benefit from the private investor effect.
Graeme Caton, of James Capel, thinks Gartmore shares will 'probably be
floated on a small p/e premium to MAM, and there will be no difficulty in
selling them.'
The bull arguments could be easily undermined, by one thing: a bear market.
Although there is good reason to expect that low interest rates may be here
for a while, the high ratings mean that fund management shares must be
vulnerable to a correction. So if you are already nervous about the market's
dizzy heights, fund management shares are definitely not for you.

FT  23 OCT 93 / The Long View: On borrowed time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEXT WEEK's auction of UK government bonds by the Bank of England will be
the biggest yet at Pounds 3.5bn, which is Pounds 60 for every man, woman and
child in the country. The issue will not even go very far towards covering
the extra debt accumulated by the public sector in September alone of Pounds
5.9bn.
Yet the bank is well ahead of the game in its borrowing programme this year.
Including next Wednesday's tranche of gilts it will have financed nearly
Pounds 40bn of the projected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement
for the financial year. It will not hold an auction in November and maybe
not in December either. The promised holiday put the gilts market in
cheerful mood this week, and yields were touching new lows even ahead of the
Bundesbank's unexpected interest rate cuts. At the long end, which has seen
few of the new gilt issues, the yield has now tumbled to 7.1 per cent
compared with just over 9 per cent in mid-January.
Bearing in mind that some City forecasters were warning at the beginning of
the year that yields might have to go to 10 per cent to get rid of all the
paper it has turned out remarkably easy. But it would be dangerous to become
complacent. The experience of most debtors is that the transition from
having money thrust upon them and then finding it impossible to obtain at
any price is an unpredictable and sudden one.
Right now, money is flooding the world's capital markets. Buyers are
snapping up Italian bonds, Mexican bonds and, this week, Bangkok Land
Eurobonds. In this context the impeccable creditworthiness of Her Britannic
Majesty's government is scarcely questioned.
Should it be? This week the Institute for Fiscal Studies produced its Green
Budget study of the UK's finances, with much of the macroeconomic input
provided by Goldman Sachs. The picture is one of violent contrasts. Although
the government's debt is lower, in relation to national income, than for 200
years, it has begun rising faster than it has ever done before in peacetime.
The size of this year's PSBR, at 8 per cent of GDP, is large but no bigger
than was seen in the mid-1970s. On further examination, however, the picture
is more disturbing. Rapid rates of inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s
meant that the apparently high level of borrowing was something of an
illusion, because there was a powerful inflation 'tax' on the real value of
the debt in the hands of investors.
Moreover a significant part of the debt was incurred in financing investment
in physical assets by local authorities and nationalised industries: some of
this has in fact been realised over the past ten years through Pounds 50bn
of privatisations. It is very different now. With inflation low the debt
sticks obstinately around: a government that wants to achieve low inflation
must also be ready to run low budget deficits.
The problem is that today's new borrowing is almost entirely to finance
current spending, so the implications for the shape of the public sector's
balance sheet and future revenues are dire. We have a year or two to get it
right, but at the moment we are on the road to ruin, comforted only by the
sight of Belgium, Italy and Sweden ahead of us.
A look at the structural distortions in the British economy makes it very
clear why this should be so. In the past few days the statistics have
pointed to the familiar trends of buoyant retail spending and a worsening
balance of payments.
We are drifting in the direction of an unsustainable consumer-led recovery.
Personal disposable income has risen sharply as a proportion of GDP during
the recession and although the savings rate has risen (at least until very
recently) consumers' expenditure has reached 65 per cent of GDP compared
with 60 per cent during the recession of the early 1980s.
The policy responses ought to be as follows: increases in personal taxes on
incomes and expenditure in order to cut consumption; and reductions in
company taxes in order to raise investment, which should be made more
profitable through a fall in the exchange rate encouraged by lower
short-term interest rates. At least the government is no longer trying to
destroy industry by fixing the pound at DM2.95, but the low inflation target
might have something of the same effect.
The budget deficit problem also looms large. Unless the economy continues to
expand at a steady rate the PSBR could balloon. But the Green Budget sets
out something of a Hobson's Choice here. If economic growth runs at only 1.5
per cent a year the PSBR could rise to 9 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. But if
growth is a healthy 3.5 per cent a year the balance of payments deficit will
rise to 6 per cent of gdp by the same date. The trouble with running big
twin deficits is that if you keep one of them under control the other one
comes and hits you from behind.
From Kenneth Clarke's point of view at the Treasury the economic judgment is
probably that the consequences of slow growth will be worse than those of
overheating. Therefore he should stimulate now and be ready to correct
later.
Unfortunately this does not easily mesh with the political priorities, which
dictate that he should be tough now but cut taxes and interest rates in 1995
ahead of a tentative election date in the summer or autumn of 1996.
The way of squaring the circle is probably through another series of phased
tax increases so that he could seem to be cutting taxes in the election
run-up even though the actual pre-programmed burden might still be building
up.
But as we have seen with VAT on domestic fuel, deferred increases have the
political disadvantage in that they give disgruntled groups of protesters
all the time in the world to organise their opposition.
Dear loyal newspaper readers be warned, it may soon be time to get ready.

FT  23 OCT 93 / The triumph and tragedy of the Thatcher years: Geoffrey

are scarred by an obsessive desire

but without treachery. Margaret Thatcher's 11 years as prime minister will
stand out as a period of remarkable achievement, marred by decisive and
fatal errors of judgment in her third, final term in office.
It is a sad reflection of the scale of those errors, and her absolute
incapacity to recognise them, that her memoirs are scarred by an almost
obsessive desire to justify her last three years in power, to the exclusion
of so much else.
Virtually all public comment on The Downing Street Years has focused on the
years 1987-90, and so perhaps inevitably will this review. That is a pity.
The first two-thirds of Margaret Thatcher's book are a relatively balanced
and well-researched account of her government. They lack the arresting
immediacy of Hugo Young's biography or the intellectual brilliance of Nigel
Lawson's record of the same years. But they capture something of her heroic
battle against the accumulated causes of British decline.
It is all too easy for the conflicts and failures of later years to eclipse
the scale of earlier triumphs. Most difficult and most lasting was the
dismantling of the malign, if unspoken, compact between state ownership and
monopoly trade-unionism in Britain's bloated public sector - culminating in
divisive but essential success against Arthur Scargill.
Almost as fundamental were three key economic changes: the central switch we
made in our tax structure away from demotivating burdens on enterprise and
investment, the recovery of control we secured over public finances, and the
remarkable success we achieved against inflation. Margaret Thatcher rightly
takes credit for the renewed economic vitality with which we entered the
1987 election - just as she does for the broader revival of national
self-confidence that sprang from the Falklands victory.
I acknowledge the generosity of Margaret Thatcher's tribute to my work as
chancellor and return the compliment. It was an exciting privilege to serve
in a government that first arrested and then began to reverse Britain's
prolonged economic decline. As chancellor, my policies could not have been
sustained without the Prime Minister's sometimes near-solitary support. In
retrospect, I may have been too ready to rest upon this backing, and so to
condone her instinct to dispose of cabinet members who were not 'true
believers'. Her base might have been stronger in the years ahead, especially
after the Westland affair, if she had tried harder to secure the
understanding of 'difficult' colleagues, rather than their departure.
Such shortcomings, however, seemed of little consequence in the early years.
It was my happy fortune to serve as foreign secretary during a period when a
prospering economy and a respected leader together generated growing British
influence in the world. The sparkling dynamic of Britain's increasingly
successful woman prime minister opened many doors, not least across the
Atlantic. The special chemistry of her relationship with Ronald Reagan
enabled her, on two occasions at Camp David, to secure concessions that were
as crucial for our continental allies as for ourselves.
The first Camp David was in December 1984, when President Reagan accepted
crucial changes for his SDI (strategic defence initiative) programme - so
that it would enhance not undercut, the doctrine of deterrence, and so that
deployment, as distinct from research, would be a matter for negotiation. At
the second meeting, two years later, Margaret Thatcher repaired the
near-fatal damage inflicted at the Reagan- Gorbachev Reykjavik Summit: the
president was persuaded to re-affirm that NATO's strategy of flexible
response would continue to require effective nuclear deterrence.
Margaret Thatcher is entitled to remind us, as she does, that 'much hung on
my relationship with the president'. The Thatcher relationship with Mikhail
Gorbachev became curiously similar in many respects to her transatlantic
partnership. I watched it developing between the first meeting at Chequers
in December 1984 and its 'consummation' on her first visit to Moscow in
March 1987. Probably the closeness of their dialogue had more impact on the
US view of Gorbachev than on the Soviet leader himself. But it was none the
less important for that.
The conversation that bubbled between Thatcher and Gorbachev was talk
between fellow radicals. It was almost as lively between Thatcher and Reagan
 -between fellow conservatives. In both cases, the prime minister's attitude
was always one of respect, almost of deference. It was very different, of
course, with her European opposite numbers. She was dealing here with folk
and nations of her own size - or smaller. Initially her European shock
tactics had a cathartic effect. With the growing experience of Helmut Kohl
and Francois Mitterrand - as well as the strategic skill of Jacques Delors -
this approach began to backfire badly. She never enjoyed European politics,
and never understood the importance of diplomacy and persuasion.
In many ways, the turning point of her tenure was the Westland affair. It
was then that she identified Europe as a key fault line in her government,
and indicated to senior colleagues that saving her own position would take
precedence over loyalty to others. Her explanation of those events is
ultimately unconvincing and verges on comic.
At one point she notes: 'Alas, Leon's days were numbered.' She even declares
that Michael Heseltine's advocacy of his position meant that 'cabinet
collective responsibility was being ignored. . . This had to stop.' Coming
from the past mistress at marginalising cabinet committees and deciding
issues in bilaterals, this is quite a statement. Margaret Thatcher developed
over time a clear determination to limit dialogue within government. As
chancellor and, to a lesser extent, as foreign secretary, I was lucky enough
to be one of those who very often had to be present. But one has little
doubt - and at the time had few illusions - that she came to see collective
discussion as an irritating inconvenience. Her book is full of examples of
this, disclosed with astonishing candour. Taking SDI again, she notes
casually: 'I kept tight personal control on discussions . . . Laid back
generalists from the Foreign Office let alone the ministerial meddlers in
charge of them - could not be relied upon. By contrast, I was in my
element'. She goes on to note the inconvenience of having included Michael
Heseltine and myself, as defence and foreign secretaries, in a subsequent
SDI discussion at the White House. 'I did not bring them again'.
Throughout the book, Margaret Thatcher's deep distrust of the Foreign Office
shines through. My own increasing 'unsoundness' on Europe is attributed to
'the Foreign Office's deformation professionelle . . . the more the
Community moved in a centralised direction, the more influential the Foreign
Office became in Whitehall'. My own belief in ERM entry is seen as
conversion to an FCO 'departmental enthusiasm'. The fact that she herself
agreed a European Election manifesto in June 1979 which actually endorsed
ERM entry is, of course, never mentioned. The fact that the ERM really
started to work successfully after 1983 - when France, gave priority to a
strong franc over Socialist economics - was a powerful fresh argument.
The ERM issue was, as Nigel Lawson has eloquently chronicled, the epitome of
Margaret Thatcher's 'I must prevail' syndrome. It matters little to her that
she found herself alone - apart from John Biffen - at the crucial
ministerial meeting on the ERM in November 1985, when Willie Whitelaw, Leon
Brittan, Norman Tebbit and John Wakeham joined Nigel Lawson, myself and the
Governor of the Bank of England in recommending early entry.
Instead of moving ground, she decided that there should be no more
collective discussions. As is well known, my own belief is that had the UK
joined the ERM in 1985, we would have been spared the excesses of the
boom-bust cycle.
Equally we could have avoided the clashes over ERM entry in 1989 which
ruptured irretrievably the once solid troika which Nigel Lawson and I had
formed with Margaret Thatcher. One cannot help feeling that her own
reputation might be the greater today - indeed she might even still be in
power - if she had not tested that relationship to destruction in pursuit of
an ideological obsession.
It is in the last third of her book that the sparks really begin to fly. I
am cast as perhaps the guiltiest of her guilty men. So be it. I am in good
company, and I will explain in full my motives and behaviour when I publish
my own memoirs - although on a rather less spectacular scale - next year. My
feeling now is one of sorrow, rather than anger. Sadness that she should
feel so deeply and so bitterly about the rights which others asserted to
have their say. Sorrow that she could not understand, and - as her recent
interviews suggest - is coming even less to understand, the danger in her
mood of invincibility and intolerance towards any who dared to disagree.
For Margaret Thatcher in her final years, there was no distinction to be
drawn between person, government, party and nation. They merged in her mind
as one seamless whole. Her interests were axiomatically those of Britain.
Any criticism of her was an unpatriotic act. To see that tragedy for what it
was and react accordingly, was not to engage in treachery, but to do what I
at least believed to be right for my party and my country. I have no regrets
whatsoever about that.
It is impossible in one review fully to rectify her account of those final
years, especially the memorable episodes of the pre-Madrid 'ambush' (in June
1989), my departure from the Foreign Office (a month later), and ultimately
my resignation from her government (in November 1990), three weeks before
her own. But I will try to give a flavour of how her description falls short
of objectivity, at least in respect of the first, and comment briefly on the
second and third.
First, Madrid. Before the Madrid European Council, where the Delors Report
on monetary union was to be discussed, the prime minister was not planning
any discussion with her chancellor or foreign secretary about the key issues
to be tackled - how we were going to prevent maximalist conclusions being
reached, including a possible timetable for stage two of EMU. Nigel Lawson
and I produced a joint memorandum on Madrid strategy and insisted on a
meeting. This was conceded with bad grace and elicited little response.
After a second joint note, we secured with great difficulty a further
meeting. At this, we threatened to resign if she could not make a specific
commitment at Madrid to join the ERM at some point in the reasonably near
future.
We suggested that, subject to specific conditions, the UK should enter not
later than the end of 1992. Without concessions in this direction - and ERM
entry was, after all, official policy and desirable in itself  - we believed
that it would be very difficult to detach stage one of EMU from Stages two
and three. An early intergovernmental conference to draft an EMU Treaty
would become inevitable. Britain would be isolated and there would be little
chance of holding back the Delors route to a single currency.
The prime minister was deeply annoyed by this 'nasty little meeting', as she
describes it - it was certainly not an easy occasion - and left the matter
unresolved. She did not reveal to either of us what she planned to do. When
she and I flew to Madrid, later that same day, we exchanged no further words
on the matter. She locked herself into her hotel room on arrival. It is
therefore instructive to record more fully than she does in her memoirs what
happened the next day.
There was widespread expectation that Margaret Thatcher would object to EMU
lock, stock and barrel. However, when the prime minister spoke, she said
that the Hanover European Council had agreed that there should be concrete
stages leading to the progressive realisation of EMU, and we should be
pragmatic. The Delors Report, she said, was right to go for a staged
approach to EMU and its analysis was valuable. We were ready, she said, here
and now to make an early start on stage one with effect from July 1 1990,
and in some respects we wanted stage one to go further than proposed, for
example in the use of the ECU. She had always made clear that we would join
the ERM when the time was right, but this would have to be carefully judged.
She could reaffirm the UK's intention to join in conditions which would
strengthen the ERM. The timing, she said, would depend on progress in the UK
against inflation and progress in the community on the single market
(scheduled for completion in 1992), and particularly on the abolition of
exchange controls (agreed for 1990). The timing, of course, was for HMG
alone. As for the later stages - two and three - we had serious
difficulties: the adoption of a single currency would not be acceptable to
the House of Commons.
The effect was electrifying. At the end of the morning a number of
colleagues came over to commend the new, strangely calm, presentation of a
much more positive position - and Jacques Delors with 'Congratulations,
Geoffrey, on having won the intellectual argument within the British
Government.' I explained that it was probably not quite as straightforward
as that - and so it proved. But although the prime minister had avoided any
commitment to a date, we had made the essential breakthrough. The Madrid
conditions, which led - duly modified - to entry 15 months later had been
set. President Mitterrand had incidentally been isolated. And the occasion
was seen as a victory for the UK - and a significant shift by Number 10.
This brings me to my removal from the Foreign Office. With the benefit of
hindsight I should have seen dismissal coming. However, the media had been
led to report that there would be no change in the top team, and I myself
had received implicit assurance from the chief whip that no such moves were
planned. I was therefore somewhat surprised, as was everyone else, when the
knife fell. Her account of our first meeting on July 24 1989 - which I
managed to keep secret by entering through the Cabinet Office - is
misleading. She offered me both the home secretaryship and the leadership of
the House at this meeting. I rejected the first and said I would consider
the second.
There was no negotiation, as she implies, over Dorneywood. I did not request
it; she said Nigel Lawson would have to leave it and she would settle that
matter with him privately. At the second (publicly known) meeting, in the
afternoon, I accepted the leadership of the House on the basis - which I
requested - that I would become deputy prime minister, with certain cabinet
committee chairmanships. This had been largely agreed in telephone contacts
before the meeting. There was no particular resistance from Number 10.
Astonishingly, she was not prepared to reveal the name of my successor.
It was perhaps a mistake to have believed that this arrangement could have
worked. It was not helped by the fact that, because Number 10 unnecessarily
revealed that there had been two meetings, the press quickly worked out that
there had been a negotiation over the job. Once that happened, we were on a
slippery slope. Bernard Ingham's rubbishing of the post of deputy prime
minister fatally compounded the problem. Certain Number 10 sources talked
freely about Geoffrey Howe having no reason to feel 'hard done by', since he
had been offered other jobs.
Margaret Thatcher was unforthcoming about why she wanted me to leave the
Foreign Office. She said simply that it was lack of agreement over Europe.
It is therefore all the more surprising that she still claims not to
understand why I resigned. This brings me to the third point. I resigned for
the same reasons she sacked me from the Foreign Office: deep and growing
differences over her handling of European affairs. In late October 1990, she
allowed what we had avoided at Madrid to occur in Rome - total isolation on
EMU.
She did it by saying 'never' and refusing to negotiate. I was deeply
concerned by the 11-1 outcome. I was shocked by her cavalier announcement to
the media afterwards that we would simply veto any EMU Treaty the others
negotiated. I could not accept her casual undermining  - in throw-away lines
in her Commons statement on the Rome outcome - of the Chancellor's hard ECU
plan, a possible route which everyone in the party could live with and which
kept us in the same negotiation as the rest of Europe.
Certainly I could have been more explicit in my resignation letter. Her and
Kenneth Baker's deliberate attempt to trivialise my concerns - as style
rather than substance - made my resignation speech, 13 days later,
inevitable. Her decision expressly to rule out a single currency, rather
than negotiate to postpone or dilute it, was not the 'removal of camouflage'
she talks of, but a decisive break with the 30-year-old Macmillan concept of
Britain's role in Europe. She was breaking with Europe - the logic of Bruges
taken to extreme - and I had to break with her. I could not know the exact
consequences: I wanted to change the policies, not the leader. But if that
meant that the leader had to go, then so it had to be.
Margaret Thatcher was beyond argument a great prime minister. Her tragedy is
that she may be remembered less for the brilliance of her many achievements
than for the tenacity, the recklessness, with which she later defended her
own, increasingly uncompromising views. The insistence on the undivided
sovereignty of her own opinion - dressed up as the nation's sovereignty -
was her undoing.
The withdrawal of support for her leadership, not just by her
reluctantly-retained deputy, but first by almost half the parliamentary
party and then by the bulk of her own Cabinet, was a consequence not of
malice or weakness but of an increasingly clear perception that her
single-mindedness, which had once achieved so much, now threatened to take
her party and the nation into the wilderness.
Ironically, this characteristically candid book makes clear to almost
everyone except its author the reasons that lie behind the tragedy, as well
as the triumph, of Margaret Thatcher.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rebellion crushed by Gadaffi, diplomats say: Evidence points
to uprising by Libyan military
</HEADLINE>

COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, last week violently put down
what appears to have been a concerted rebellion by parts of his armed
forces, according to Arab and western diplomats. They described the unrest
as the most serious in Libya for at least seven years.
Details of the uprising remain patchy, but diplomats quoting 'reliable
sources' in Libya say military units in as many as five centres staged a
violent rebellion early last week, which seems to have been crushed with the
help of the Libyan air force.
Libyan officials, who habitually suppress sensitive information, denied any
such unrest.
But diplomats say there is evidence of sizeable uprisings on October 11-14
at military installations at Misratah, Tarhua, Ghariyiah, Beni Walid and
Brak - towns to the south and west of the capital, Tripoli.
They reported explosions at military depots, airforce bombing of roads, and
witnesses seeing numerous casualties in several hospitals.
Several diplomats said the violence appeared the worst since clashes between
the army and dissident factions in 1986, after the US bombing of Tripoli.
The diplomats spoke of a subsequent purge of senior officers within the
Libyan military. 'We understand people in the government were quite rattled
 -several old military hands appear to have taken part,' said one diplomat.
Others said members of Col Gadaffi's security escort had been among the
casualties.
The reports converge with earlier claims by the National Front for the
Salvation of Libya, the exiled opposition group, claiming a simultaneous
uprising took place last week involving up to 2,000 mutinous troops at
Misratah alone in what they claimed was an attempted coup d'etat.
The reports are also circumstantially supported by a speech given by Col
Gaddafi in Misratah on October 17, in which he condemned 'treachery' against
the regime at some length, and said in reference to those who 'betrayed'
Libya to the Italian colonisers, that: 'The traitors of October 1911 are
like the traitors of October 1993' and should be 'eliminated'. He made no
direct allusion to any uprising.
The cause of the unrest is also unclear, although most diplomats and other
analysts suggested it may have arisen indirectly out of the international
pressure on Libya over its alleged role in the 1988 bombing of a PanAm
aircraft over Lockerbie in Scotland.
They said deep internal divisions over whether to extradite two Libyan
secret service agents accused by the US and Britain over the Lockerbie
bombing have aggravated intra-tribal rivalry in the country.

SHARE prices in the UK, Germany and France reached record levels yesterday
as a spate of interest rate cuts in continental Europe boosted prospects for
economic growth. France, Denmark, Spain and Ireland cut rates after
Germany's surprise easing of monetary policy on Thursday.
The moves prompted investors, especially from the US, to sell the D-Mark
heavily in favour of the dollar and other European currencies. The dollar
rose in London to DM1.6750 from DM1.6635, edging up to DM1.6775 in New York.
Sterling slipped about half a pfenning against the D-Mark to DM2.4675 with
little change in New York.
The continental rate cuts also sparked speculation that the UK government
may soon cut base rates, now at 6 per cent, although better than expected UK
output figures yesterday may have persuaded the chancellor that further cuts
are unnecessary.
London share prices finished at a record level for the third successive day,
with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing 10.7 higher at 3,199. The
three-month interbank rate, which indicates market perceptions on base
rates, fell about a quarter of a percentage point to about 5 17/32 per cent.
The bourses in Paris and Frankfurt closed at all-time highs, both rising
about 1.5 per cent on the day. The CAC-40 index of leading French companies
finished at 2,231.86, up 32.14; the German DAX index closed 31.48 higher at
2,066.17.
The Bank of France lowered its intervention rate, which sets the floor for
French lending, to 6.45 per cent from 6.75 per cent. After the move
investors switched funds into the French currency, which gained almost two
centimes in London, closing at FFr3.4930 against the D-Mark with little
change in New York.
The Bank of France said yesterday's action 'takes into account the general
downward movement in rates in Europe and the objective of internal and
external franc stability'.
The Danish krone rose against the D-Mark to DKr4.0120 from DKr4.0255 after
Denmark cut its two-week CD rate by half a percentage point to 8 per cent.
Spain followed the trend, cutting its main money rate by a quarter
percentage point to 9.25 per cent. The move helped its currency rise to
Pta79.98 against the D-Mark, from Pta80.02. The Bank of Ireland cut its
short-term facility rate to 7 per cent from 7.5 per cent.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Hurd backs government decision on Malaysian aid project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD said yesterday that Britain had pressed ahead with aid
funding for an uneconomical hydroelectric plant in Malaysia because of
commitments made by Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, and fears that to
renege on the contract 'would have been very damaging to trade'.
In a vigorous defence of a government decision to provide Pounds 234m in aid
funding for a hydro-power project on the Pergau river in Malaysia, the
foreign secretary admitted he had overridden advice from civil servants that
the project would be 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian consumers.
He said in an interview with the BBC World Service during the Commonwealth
heads of government meeting in Cyprus that he had disagreed with advice from
the Overseas Development Administration, which manages Britain's aid budget.
'I had to take account of something they did not have to take account of,'
he said. 'An undertaking had been given at the highest level that we would
proceed with this project. The damage of backtracking on that understanding
reached at the highest level would have been very great.'
He was referring to a high-profile visit to Malaysia in 1988 by Lady
Thatcher which brought to an end a decade-long 'Buy British Last' policy in
Malaysia.
A Pounds 1bn defence supply agreement was negotiated personally by Lady
Thatcher with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysia's
defence shopping list at the time amounted to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn), an
official involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
Controversy over the contract erupted on Thursday when a National Audit
Office report strongly criticised the government's support of the project,
saying it 'would result in Malaysian consumers paying over Pounds 100m more
for electricity over its 35-year life than if the money were invested in an
alternative'.

<TEXT>
The CAC-40 raced to a new high yesterday as the Paris bourse sensed the
latest interest rate cuts might mark a turning point in monetary policy.
Earlier in the week, the franc had weakened against the D-Mark as investors
fretted about the economic damage of delaying rate reductions. But it
strengthened after the cuts themselves. The favourable exchange market
reaction may not create scope for more cuts, however, given the government's
determination to wait on the still cautious Bundesbank's lead. Besides, the
Bank of France may remain worried about the foreign exchange risks of going
it alone, given its need to rebuild reserves.
The additional concern is that the underlying economy remains so fragile.
The weakness of the German economy and the delays in cutting interest rates
suggest any recovery will be muted in 1994. Earlier this month, the OFCE
economic institute cut its forecasts of French GDP growth to 0.3 per cent in
1994, compared with the government's 1.4 per cent estimate.
On underlying fundamentals, the bourse is already looking strained. A market
multiple of 25 times forecast earnings for 1993 and a yield of 3.05 per cent
appear ambitious. But there have been more earnings upgrades than downgrades
following the corporate reporting season. Dividends also remain well
supported and may grow quickly in recovery. The main reason for optimism is
the sheer weight of money and the search for yield that is fuelling world
markets. US mutual funds have been busy buyers of French equities. But, as
yet, no substantial sums have moved from French money market funds into
shares.

FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even after the introduction of corporate investors next year, Lloyd's will
have neither a price mechanism nor a secondary market. Capital will continue
to be allocated to underwriting syndicates through a system of queueing
rather than on price. Shares in the proposed Lloyd's investment trusts will
be traded on the stock exchange, but Names will still not be able to buy or
sell their syndicate participations. That prevents them paying for losses on
bad syndicates by selling their rights to profitable participations.
The advent of quoted Lloyd's investment trusts is a step towards accurate
pricing. Corporate investors are demanding more information on the
performance of syndicates, which can only be good for transparency. The
price of a trust's shares should reflect the value of its assets and likely
profits from syndicate participations. The shares should trade at a premium
to net assets when the outlook for underwriting profits is good and at a
discount when it is poor. Once a basis for pricing has been established,
trusts might also trade syndicate participations between themselves by
buying and selling subsidiaries.
But it will take another giant leap before Names are free to trade in a
similar way. The legal hurdles are immense. If individual Names are wholly
replaced by corporate investors, the issue will not have to be addressed.
But that cannot be taken for granted. If corporate investors are free to
take profits in the form of capital gain while Names cannot, the playing
field will have to be levelled.

FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: National lottery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of the national lottery is likely to lead to some significant
shifts in consumer spending patterns. If Mr Peter Brooke's predictions prove
correct, the British public may splash out Pounds 1.5bn on tickets a year.
Some estimates suggest this could climb as high as Pounds 3bn. The stock
market is already speculating about the winners and losers in this furious
flutter.
Football pools are bound to be hit. For stock market investors, the main
worry concerns Ladbroke. But Vernons represents a relatively small
proportion of Ladbroke's total profits. Pub and club operators, such as Rank
and Bass, may lose money from slot machines. Other forms of gambling may not
suffer so badly. The regulars who bet on the 2.30 at Kempton doubtless
believe this is more a matter of skill than chance. Newspapers, magazines
and confectionery may lose sales. The government could lose much of its
premium bond revenue.
The consortia scrambling to operate the lottery will surely see their
returns limited by political considerations. But retailers who sell lottery
tickets may do nicely by keeping perhaps 5 per cent of the price with
minimal outlay on their part. Television companies, too, can expect to win
advertising revenue. But the real prize will go to the advertising agency
which wins the contract for what is likely to become the UK's biggest
consumer product.

FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tempted by liquid gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those of a nervous disposition or with vertigo should perhaps avert their
gaze from world equity markets. There is no doubt that the liquidity flowing
from deposits into bonds and equities is having a powerful effect on
financial asset prices. What is more debatable is the degree to which the
rise is sustainable. Unlike 1987, this is not a rally fuelled by borrowed
money and high gearing. The search for yield is in part a genuine switch
between asset classes as a result of the low rates available on deposits.
Yet the liquidity in the financial system - most notably in the US - is a
result of a prolonged stimulus by central banks which risks inflating asset
prices unsustainably.
In that context, and with UK equity yields so low, even a modest uptick in
inflation is a cause for some concern. By most measures, UK equities are now
more expensive than they were at the peak in 1987. There is some comfort for
the optimists in the third-quarter UK growth figures which show the economy
growing at a reasonably robust 2 per cent annual rate. The picture which
emerges is of strengthening consumer spending while exports and investment
remain patchy. Yet despite this week's rate cuts on the continent, the risks
of a widening trade gap remain, further hedging the UK's room for manoeuvre.
The budget may bring modest or deferred tax increases and some loosening of
monetary policy, but the potential for further cuts remains limited. How
much further the market can rise depends upon imponderable international
flows. The faster the rise, the greater the risk of a nasty bump.

FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond prices undercut
morning rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER a morning rally, US share prices finished at mixed levels yesterday,
as falling bond prices undercut the positive impact of the week's corporate
earnings reports, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 13.14 higher at 3,649.30
after remaining well above the all-time closing high of 3,652.09 until early
afternoon. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.08 at
463.28, while the Amex composite was off 0.27 at 477.25. The Nasdaq
composite was ahead 1.41 to 772.69.
At the opening, equities moved decisively into positive territory, as the
bond market registered modest gains over levels reached in Thursday's
sell-off. In reviewing the third-quarter performances of many cyclical
companies, those most affected by business cycles, many investors appeared
to be encouraged by the economic outlook. The perception of improving
conditions was reinforced by Thursday's news that business activity in the
Philadelphia area had surged over the past month.
In the afternoon, however, bonds reversed direction in a nervous reaction to
comments made by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. In late
trading, the benchmark 30-year issue was  7/8 lower at 103 23/32 , to yield
5.976 per cent.
Stock prices quickly followed suit, falling back from their earlier highs
with an added drag from program trading. In the last two hours, the market
recovered some steam, but fell short of its initial promise. One of the most
actively traded issues was Caterpillar, up Dollars 4 1/8 to a 52-week high
of Dollars 90 after being upgraded by several analysts on the strength of
its earnings report.
Another advancing cyclical was Cummins Engine, up Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars
87, after it provided forecasters with reasons to expect further profit
gains in the fourth quarter.
Banking issues continued to recover from losses that followed JP Morgan's
cut in its prime lending rate earlier in the week. Bankers Trust climbed
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 , while Chase Manhattan added Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 34 1/2 in heavy volume. JP Morgan gained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 74.
QVC, which has announced an Dollars 80-a-share tender offer as part of a
two-tier deal to acquire Paramount, was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 55 on
the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, Paramount was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 77 1/2 .
On the Amex, class-A shares in Viacom, Paramount's friendly suitor, fell
Dollars 1 to Dollars 59 3/8 . Its non-voting class-B shares were off Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell
9.39, or 0.23 per cent, to close at 4,153.81. But advancing issues
outnumbered declines 372 to 358. Volume was 55.54m shares, down from
yesterday's 63.67m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 642.8m from
CDollars 723.1m.

FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: US equity investors search for value
overseas - The recent trend represents a significant change in investment
attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frustrated by sluggish economic growth, low yields and expensive stocks at
home, US investors are pouring their money into overseas equity markets in
unprecedented amounts.
In doing so, they have provided foreign markets with a new source of
liquidity, and driven share prices in Europe, Latin America and the Far East
to new highs.
The flood of US money abroad, however, is about more than a short-term
search for higher returns. It reflects the growing sophistication of the
once-parochial US investment community which, until recently, was reluctant
to risk its money abroad.
According to the latest data on overseas investments, net purchases of
foreign stocks by US investors in the second quarter of this year were a
record Dollars 13.2bn. It was the 20th straight quarter when US investors
bought more overseas stocks than they sold, and it took net purchases for
the first half of this year to Dollars 21.7bn, almost twice the amount
recorded in the first six months of 1992. US holdings of foreign stocks now
stand at Dollars 210bn, more than double the total of just two and a half
years ago.
Most individual investors have bought into foreign markets via mutual funds.
In August, for example, 45 per cent of the net Dollars 12.1bn invested in US
stock mutual funds went into funds that buy overseas equities.
Institutional investors have also been snapping up foreign stocks, including
the normally conservative public pension funds, which are being told by
investment advisers to drop their usual reluctance to invest abroad and
increase the size of their foreign holdings.
Fund managers across the US have been amazed at the demand for foreign
stocks. Mr Rick Mace, co-manager at Fidelity Global Balanced Fund, describes
the recent interest among US investors in foreign stocks as 'phenomenal',
and says that it dates back to about a year to 18 months ago. He says:
'Foreign markets are relatively so much more attractive. Comparable
companies in foreign markets are trading at lower multiples of earnings,
cash flow and book value, than US companies.'
US investors are looking for those kind of bargains everywhere. Although the
UK, Canada and continental Europe remain the most popular destinations for
US money (primarily because falling or low interest rates are expected to
stimulate local economies), investors are becoming more adventurous in their
search for diversification and value.
They have been especially keen on emerging markets in Europe, where the
opportunities for investing in newly privatised industries in former
Communist countries are growing, and in Latin America and the Far East.
Hong Kong, for example, has proved very attractive to US investors. In the
second quarter they bought Dollars 1.8bn of Hong Kong equities, almost as
much as they invested in the far bigger Japanese market. For many, buying
Hong Kong stocks is regarded as a relatively safe way of investing in the
future of China, the world's largest country with one of the fastest growing
economies.
It is no surprise that US investors are rushing overseas when their home
market has lagged behind the rest of the world. In Hong Kong, according to
the FT-Actuaries World indices, stocks have climbed 56 per cent in dollar
terms this year, in Japan 46 per cent, in Italy 28 per cent, in Spain 26 per
cent, and in the UK 11 per cent. In contrast, the value of US stocks has
risen by 7.5 per cent, the poorest performance of any country other than
Mexico.
US demand for foreign stocks has acted like a virtuous circle. By boosting
prices in many overseas markets, they have lured more US money abroad. 'The
better the foreign markets do, the more interest there is in them,' says Mr
Mace.
Although the recent growth in US investment overseas has been remarkable,
there is a concern that it may be short-lived. In particular, some analysts
believe a sudden upturn in US interest rates might stem the flow of money
overseas, simultaneously by making domestic fixed-income securities more
attractive, and by boosting the value of the dollar which would cut into the
value of US investors' foreign assets.
Among those who believe that US investors' love affair with foreign stocks
may prove temporary is Mr Scott Black, a fund manager with Delphi in Boston,
who says: 'It's the next gimmick. Everyone always buys into the next
gimmick.' He is especially wary of those who have bought into markets they
know little about. 'I'm not keen on Hong Kong. It's a crap-shoot. Who knows
what it's going to look like in 1997?'
Other fund managers, however, argue that growing interest in foreign stocks
represents a fundamental change in investors' attitudes to non-US assets. Mr
Mace of Fidelity says: 'The definition of overseas versus domestic stocks is
going to blur. People want a diversified portfolio, that is diversified not
just across one market but across countries.'
Mr William Holtzer, a fund manager responsible for global funds at the New
York investment group Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, sees the trend towards
overseas investment in an even broader context. 'It's not a euphoria we are
seeing, but a panic. People are panicking about their retirement income.'
Mr Holtzer believes that a new generation of investors, desperate to build a
portfolio that will provide enough income for their retirement, is moving
into foreign equities in search of higher returns.
He also thinks that investors' interest in foreign stocks will prove more
resilient than critics think, even if they suffer the occasional setback
overseas.
'The first round of international investing (in the early 1980s) was based
largely upon growth in the Japanese stock market. Well, that market fell to
bits, but it didn't knock the trend off the rails, just slowed it down a
bit.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cuts, dollar and
Wall Street lift bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES rose on interest rate cuts and a higher dollar, moving into an
exciting afternoon as Wall Street threatened its all-time highs, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT built on the American post-bourse buying which lifted it on
Thursday afternoon. The DAX index rose 31.48 to a new closing high of
2,066.17, up 2.5 per cent on the week, gained more lift from Wall Street and
closed the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,083.62.
Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM11bn. Volkswagen soared through a key chart
point, rose DM11 to DM389.80 on the session, and piled on another DM6.20 to
DM396 in the post bourse for a 4.5 per cent gain on the day.
Allianz, the insurer, classed as a beta stock on its ability to outperform
the market, rose DM63 to DM2,832, and by another DM28 after hours. Thyssen,
the steelmaker, consolidated Thursday afternoon's gains, rising DM8 to
DM226.
PARIS set a new closing high with investors encouraged by the 30 basis point
cut in the intervention rate at the start of business. The CAC-40 index
added 32.14 or 1.5 per cent to 2,231.86, more than 4 per cent up on the
week.
The banking sector was firmer overall. However, Hoare Govett recommended an
underweight position in this sector, on the basis that 'current ratings
appear already to be fully discounting a full earnings recovery in 1995
without giving due weight to the difficulties (such as property-related
loans) which will continue to beset the sector for at least the next 12
months.'
MADRID posted early gains on an intervention rate cut, and extended them to
close with the general index 5.10 higher at 310.28, up 3.9 per cent on the
week. Banks joined utilities as the buyers' choice, Popular gaining Pta700
to Pta17,500. Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel noted that Popular had
been touring the UK this week. ADR stocks were also strong with Repsol
gaining Pta100 at Pta4,065.
ZURICH concentrated on cyclicals and dollar-sensitive shares, such as Brown
Boveri, SFr14 higher at SFr1,004, and Ciba-Geigy, up SFr7 at SFr745, as the
SMI index rose another 11.7 to a new high of 2,701.6, up 3.4 per cent on the
week.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index finished up 1.4 at 137.1, a week's rise of
nearly 5 per cent. Nedlloyd was suspended for a short period before
announcing a further stage in its divestment programme to concentrate on
core interests. The shares fell back Fl 1.00 at Fl 52.60, but up 12 per cent
over the week.
MILAN lagged behind, the Comit index gaining 4.03 to 593.76 for a 2.8 per
cent rise on the week. Fiat put on L22 to L3,863 on news that it had been
asked by the French authorities to be a core shareholder of Rhone-Poulenc
when it is privatised.
COPENHAGEN was lifted to a further closing high after the cut in interest
rates with the KFX index adding 1.10 to 103.05, for a gain of 3.2 per cent
over the week.
HELSINKI put on 2.9 per cent, the Hex index closing 43.4 higher at 1,559.6.
Banks gained 5 per cent on news that the Savings Bank of Finland was up for
sale; Nokia climbed FM20 to FM320 on a better than expected interim report.
ISTANBUL fell back by more than 3 per cent after the constitutional court
halted the planned privatisation of the state telecommunications group. The
composite index shed 505.9 to 14,320.9.

FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Mixed pickings in region
as Nikkei revives

<TEXT>
THE decline of the yen against the dollar boosted the high-technology
sector, and share prices gained ground on buying by arbitrageurs and
financial institutions, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 85.41 to 20,264.83, an advance of 0.5 per cent
on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 20,223.82 before rising to
a high of 20,377.84 during the morning session.
Volume rose from 228m to 317.2m shares, clearing the 300m level for the
first time in five days. Gainers led losers by 605 to 400, with 180
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 17.53 higher
at 1,663.09 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.61 to close at
1,305.49.
Traders said that active buying deterred investors, who had expected share
prices to decline, from selling. In spite of the yen's fall against the
dollar, foreign investors also refrained from selling shares.
High-technology stocks were strong. Hitachi rose Y13 to Y863, Matsushita
Electric Industrial Y30 to Y1,490 and Sony Y100 to Y4,900.
Arbitrage buying supported banks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y60 to
Y3,340 and Sakura Bank gained Y30 to Y1,720. Brokers were also higher ahead
of interim results, announced after the close: Nomura Securities rose Y40 to
Y2,000 and Daiwa Securities gained Y50 to Y1,400.
Pharmaceuticals, which had been strong recently on new drug developments,
were among the few losers on the day. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y20 to
Y2,350 on profit-taking, while Dainippon Pharmaceutical lost Y30 to Y1,210.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 131.73 to 22,216.95 in volume of 29.8m
shares. Export oriented stocks, including the electronics sector, were
strong because of the weaker yen.
Roundup
EXCITEMENT, stagnation and retreat were all in evidence in the region
yesterday.
NEW ZEALAND hit another four-year high in thin and volatile trading
dominated by buying in Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE 40 index closed up 10.71
at 2,098.11, 1.2 per cent higher on the week. FCL rose 12 cents to NZDollars
3.89, and turnover fell to NZDollars 46m from some NZDollars 70m.
MANILA took profits on some blue chips and switched to second-liners, but
the composite index still rose 13.53 to a new high of 2,260.99, 3.9 per cent
higher on the week.
TAIWAN climbed by 2.2 per cent in heavy trade on buying of speculative
stocks by major participants, hopes for an interest rate cut and a good
profit announcement by Cathay Life Insurance.
The weighted index ended 85.28 higher at 4,052.38, 0.7 per cent up on the
week, in turnover up from TDollars 19bn to TDollars 33.2bn.
BOMBAY closed higher on short-covering by speculators after carry-forward
costs were fixed at 1.75 to 2.25 per cent a month - lower than anticipated.
The BSE index ended 37.0 higher at 2,720.0.
HONG KONG continued the correction that began after a 3.1 per cent gain on
Monday. The Hang Seng index closed 163.36, or 1.8 per cent, lower at
8,719.32, just 0.5 per cent down on the week, as turnover slowed further to
HKDollars 5.60bn against HKDollars 6.84bn.
Recently buoyant utilities were hard hit, with China Light losing HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 50, China Gas 70 cents to HKDollars 17.70 and Telecom 40
cents to HKDollars 15.50.
AUSTRALIA saw big business in major banks, particularly ANZ and Westpac, and
a lower gold sector, but the All Ordinaries index ended a mere 1.0 higher at
2061.4, 0.6 per cent down on the week, in turnover of ADollars 408.4m.
Among banks, ANZ was up 7 cents at ADollars 4.07, Westpac 10 cents higher at
ADollars 4.26 and CBA up 9 cents at ADollars 9.85. NAB slipped 8 cents to
ADollars 12.38.
JAKARTA closed mixed in active trading, the JKSE index receding just 0.09
from its year's high, to 466.22.

FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE fails to penetrate 3,200 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK stock market beginning to display signs of running out of steam after
the near-euphoric trading activity following Germany's interest rate cuts on
Thursday, was given a fresh boost from across the Atlantic where Wall Street
was threatening to push through its all-time trading high. The Dow Jones
Average was trading above its previous closing high as London closed
yesterday afternoon. Adding to the bull trend was a bigger than expected
rise in UK gross domestic product in the third quarter.
But the FT-SE 100 index, despite numerous attempts, just failed to penetrate
the 3,200 level, although closing at a new all-time record.
The FT-SE 100 settled 10.7 higher at a record 3,199.0, a rise of 78.2, or
2.5 per cent over the week, while the FT-SE Mid 250, 20.8 firmer at a peak
3,547.0, was 67.2, or 1.9 per cent higher over the five-day period.
However, dealers said that activity in the Footsie future after the market
had closed would have been sufficient to drive the underlying cash market
through the 3,200 mark with relative ease. On senior marketmaker said:
'Demand in this market is becoming frightening; the recent charge was
fuelled by the shorts panicking and closing their positions. This is new
buying and any marketmaker still holding on to increasingly perilous short
books is playing a very dangerous game.'
The market's record-breaking performance was reinforced by the high levels
of trading activity. Turnover yesterday was 658.5m shares. Gilts edged
stayed in positive territory throughout the session ahead of news of a
Pounds 500m tap stock of 7 3/4 per cent stock dated 2,006.
Long-standing worries that the market has run too far, too fast were
shrugged aside by senior marketmakers, now used to paying a high price to
close any short positions. A widespread view around the trading desks was
that traders had paid too much heed to stories about an overvalued Wall
Street.
Mr Richard Jeffreys of Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said he
expected the equity market to become 'more tentative ahead of the Budget.'
At Strauss Turnbull Mr Ian Harnett cautioned against what he described as 'a
search for value in second-line stocks.' He said these had outperformed the
leaders by around 6 per cent over the past year and recommended a move back
into the leaders ahead of the Budget.

FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More volatile moves in the telecoms sector provoked a variety of stories,
but dealers said that most of the action was down to a simple bout of
profit-taking. SG Warburg was one of a number of brokers advising a pause
for breath on the sector, although remaining fundamentally positive.
Telecoms stocks have zoomed forward in recent weeks as several bullish
factors have come into play, including the proposed Dollars 22bn takeover by
Bell Atlantic of Tele-Communications Inc, the rating applied to the
flotation of Singapore Telecom and the video on demand potential linked to
BT.
Cable and Wireless was among the worst hit, the shares tumbling 17 to 946p.
BT also slipped back, its shares ending 6 adrift at 467p. Vodafone bounced
from initial weakness to close 2 up at 563p.
The week's burst of activity in international markets turned the spotlight
on the merchant banks, sending the shares sharply ahead. Kleinwort Benson
moved 13 ahead to 514p, while SG Warburg gained 23 to 902p.
The rest of the investment sector was not to be left behind and M&amp;G Group
blasted through the Pounds 10 barrier. Mercury Asset Management improved 8
to 714p.
Elsewhere in financials, talk that several influential brokers were set to
come out with buy recommendations for National Westminster helped fuel the
day's advance in the shares. They closed 12 up at 585p, in trade of 3.3m.
A stock overhang depressed Abbey National and the shares bucked the market
trend to close 6 lighter at 415p.
A recommendation from Strauss Turnbull following a visit to Standard
Chartered boosted the banking group's shares sending them 21 ahead to 1036p.
Drugs stocks continued to enjoy investor interest, with Wellcome especially
ending the week with a flourish. The stock, which has been buoyed by an
upbeat US conference, moved ahead 22 1/2 to reach 845 1/2 p. After US
interest boosted the stock in the previous session, the buying was thought
to have spread out to be more general yesterday and was sustained through
most of the day.
SmithKline A pushed up 13 1/2 to 448p and Zeneca added 14 to 797 1/2 p.
Running against the trend was Glaxo which gave up 7 1/2 to close at 715 1/2
p. The stock, which has been at the forefront of the drugs' charge, fell
back as investors switched into its rivals.
On its last day of trading, Rothmans 'B' put on 5 to 626p, as turnover
reached 6.4m. The company is being restructured into two separate groups
with effect from Monday.
However, a Stock Exchange ruling means that the new shares issued by
Rothmans and Vendome, after the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury
goods group, will not be included in the UK stock market indices.
Rothmans is to be replaced by Southern Electricity in the list of FT-SE 100
companies, that fact boosting its shares 18 1/2 to 624 1/2 p ahead of its
debut, in trade of 1.1m.
Speculation about boardroom changes hung around Lasmo and the stock saw
active trade of 6.6m. Market rumours about the future of the finance chief
refuse to die down. The shares finished the session ahead 3 at 143 1/2 p.
Stores stocks enjoyed another good session as a mixture of interest rate
hopes and this week's retail figures sustained investor attention. Argos
continued to climb, the shares adding 5 to 353p, as did Body Shop, up 6 at
215p.
Upbeat remarks by Bass executives over Holiday Inns helped the shares add 4
to 495p. The division's chairman was reportedly telling a conference that
margins were hardening as the market recovered.
Fears of a cut in defence expenditure in next month's Budget continued to
overhang several defence related stocks. Shares in GEC eased 6 to 346p, with
Smith New Court reported to have been the day's main sellers. Volume at the
close was 6.7m.
A confident statement to accompany better than expected figures from Pratt
and Witney, a US competitor to Rolls-Royce, led to demand for stock in the
the UK aero-engine maker. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 155p, on turnover of
12m.
Shares in engineering group Meggitt eased a penny to 100p after a
substantial trade in the shares. Smith New Court was said to have bought a
block of around 4.3m shares (around 2.1 per cent of the group's shares) at
96 1/2 p, and sold around 2.8m of the holding in a flurry of activity at
98p.

FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG two-way pull in Dixons saw the shares dip sharply before recovering
in late trading as turnover hit a hefty 4.5m.
The store group came under early pressure as news broke from a trade press
magazine that Tandy Corporation, the leading US electrical retailer, was
about to launch a challenge in the UK to Dixons' PC World computer
superstore concept. According to the report, Tandy has earmarked a number of
sites - each of which is above 25,000 sq ft - to launch its UK operations.
Dixons shares weakened sharply, coming off almost 10 at one stage. With a
good sense of timing, Dixons was yesterday hosting an analysts visit to a PC
World site in Cardiff, and reports drifting back from South Wales in the
afternoon were said to be positive, with the company hinting at brighter
sales and firm margins. The shares staged a rally and closed just 3 1/2 off
at 276 1/2 p.

FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE lacking the fervour of the previous day's trading, equities
derivatives showed strength in the afternoon, still clinging to hopes of a
half point cut in UK interest rates, writes Christine Buckley.
Although it started the day a little tentatively, the December contract on
the FT-SE 100 was enlivened by good GDP figures. The French cutting of
interest rates further bolstered hopes for UK interest rates and more
buoyancy for the contract came from good performances in gilts and short
sterling. A strong Wall Street provided an afternoon push and the contract
traded at a healthy premium to the cash market for most of the day.
December began at 3,217, hitting its high of the day of 3,232 just before
its close of 3,228 - a lead of just over 15 points on its fair value premium
to cash of about 15 points. Volume was subdued at 6,167 contracts.
Index options were again a strong feature in traded options with the FT-SE
100 option accounting for 10,999 lots of the total options volume of 31,446
lots.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Big shortage taken out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE great mystery of whether the UK will cut base rates in the near future
intensified yesterday as money market dealers scrutinised the Bank of
England's operations for clues, writes Peter John.
Some suggested that although there was no obvious pointer the Bank was
certainly not being obstructive to the market's drive for lower rates.
Three-month lending rates - the best indicator of where base rates are
heading, fell to just over 5 1/2 per cent, down from 5 15/16 a month ago.
If the Bank is unhappy with the market's enthusiasm for rate cuts it can
hold back in its daily dealings. Such operations force overnight rates
higher, with these changes possibly also forcing up three month rates.
However, no signals of this kind were detected yesterday. As one dealer
said: 'If the Bank sent those sort of signals on a day when Europe is easing
it would behaving like King Canute telling the tide to go back.'
Short sterling futures, which currently reflect a mid-way view between
between half a percentage point and one point off rates, trod water
yesterday and closed only marginally firmer.
In the money markets, the Bank of England offered an early round of
assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 2.1bn,
later revised to Pounds 2.05bn. Among factors affecting the shortage,
Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 655m, higher note circulation withdrew
Pounds 820m and T-bills and maturing assistance sapped Pounds 698m.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 1.876bn of assistance at the established
rates of 5 7/8 per cent in an early round of bill offers, including Pounds
615m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on November 11 and
12 at 5 29/32 per cent.
It did not operate in the money market at midday but provided Pounds 20m in
the afternoon, via band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent, and late
assistance of Pounds 150m bringing total help for the day to Pounds 2.046bn.
The German short term interest rate contract for December almost hit 94.00
and closed closing nine basis points up at 93.97 on turnover of more than
70,000 contracts.
The French futures contract for December lifted nine basis points to 93.83
and was beginning to discount rates of almost 6 per cent following the
decision by the Bank of France to lower its intervention rate.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Rate cut trend hits D - Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German currency came under pressure again yesterday driven down by US
heavy selling following a rush of interest rate cuts throughout Europe,
writes Peter John.
Weakness in the D-Mark resulted in strength for the US dollar and a good
performance from the French franc, Danish krone, Italian lira, Spanish
peseta and the Scandinavian currencies. Meanwhile, the pound dropped as the
UK was seen as missing out on the opportunity to ease lending levels along
with the rest of Europe.
A general move away from the D-Mark gathered pace as the Bank of France
announced a long awaited cut in its key rates. The central bank cut the
intervention rate to 6.45 per cent from 6.75 per cent and its 5 to 10-day
lending rate by half a point to 7.25 per cent.
Heavy selling sent the D-Mark down to FFr3.4850, the first time it has been
back below FFr3.50 since the recent round of speculative attacks on the
French and Belgian currencies began a fortnight ago.
Dealers said US investment funds were shifting their holdings from Germany
to France but the D-Mark fall was stemmed fairly quickly and there were
reports that the Bank of France was taking advantage of the currency change
to buy D-Marks and replenish its reserves which were depleted by the ERM
crisis at the end of July.
Consequently the D-Mark recovered to close at FFr3.4930, but still down on
the previous day's close of FFr3.5120.
The D-Mark also fell sharply against the dollar. However yesterday's dollar
rally was reigned in later. Dealers suggested that the Bundesbank may have
been selling dollars and there were reports that Japanese officials had
expressed concern over the dollar's strength.
Heavy speculation that the Bank of England would announce a cut in the 6 per
cent base rate yesterday remained unfulfilled and the pound slipped.
Sterling fell half a pfennig against the D-Mark to DM2.4675. Against the
dollar it slid to Dollars 1.4730 from Dollars 1.4870 previously.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Bank of Spain cut its money rate to 9.25 per cent
from 9.5 per cent and the peseta rose to Pta79.98 to the D-Mark from
Pta80.02 previously. The Danish Central Bank lowered its two-week CD rate by
half a point to 8 per cent and its discount and key deposit rates to 7.25
per cent from 7.75 per cent. The Danish krone rose to DKr4.0120 to the
D-Mark, up from DKr4.0255 previously.
The Irish Central Bank cut its short-term facility rate to 7 per cent from
7.5 per cent, effective Tuesday, and its overnight deposit rate to 3.75 per
cent from 4.25 per cent.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Murdoch faces up to mortality: Likely successors at News
Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media tycoons are dangerously prone to imagine themselves immortal.
But when they cannot banish thoughts of mortality the next best thing is to
establish a dynasty and try to maintain control beyond the grave.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of The News Corporation, one
of the world's largest media organisation is 62. Although he is fit and
active, he is being pressed to spell out the succession - what happens when
the company can no longer be described as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
Where, some ask is, the executive of vision within the organisation, if not
Rupert Murdoch.
Mr Murdoch has been spelling out his hopes in interviews with his Australian
papers and at the company's recent annual meeting.
'I don't feel old. I feel very well. I certainly hope that I can keep going
at the present pace for another 10 years. I have at least two of my children
coming into the business - how well they'll do will have to be judged later.
It's no longer a private business,' Mr Murdoch said.
His daughter Elizabeth, 25, is a manager in charge of programme acquisition
at Fox Television, News Corp's US television network.
Lachlan Murdoch, 22 in September, is at Princetown University, but, much
more important, spent the summer as a sub-editor on The Sun newspapers in
the UK.
'He loved them and they loved him,' said one News International executive.
Rupert Murdoch has a soft spot for the The Sun, the UK paper that more than
any other was the foundation of his fortune.
James Murdoch, 21, is at Harvard University and has worked on the set of the
recent Twentieth Century Fox release The Rising Sun.
Rupert Murdoch is clear about the advantages his children will hold. They
will have the opportunity to show what they can do but their real proving
time is probably still a decade away.
What if the unthinkable happens and Rupert Murdoch were to fall under a bus?
In February 1990, much to the surprise of his senior executives Rupert
Murdoch anointed Mr Andrew Knight as his successor.
'People say there is no number two or successor in News Corporation. This is
he,' said Mr Murdoch gesturing to Mr Knight, chairman of News International.
'If I should turn out to be mortal,' grinned Mr Murdoch.
Asked the same question In August 1992, Mr Murdoch replied: 'I have nothing
to add to that or to alter it in any way, except that the children are
older.'
It seems Mr Murdoch has something to add. He has been suggesting his wife
Anna, who would probably have been involved in any succession to represent
the family interests, would probably become non-executive chairman.
Something else has changed over the past three years. Partly in response to
the growing size of the business and in response to the debt crisis which
nearly brought the company down three years ago a tier of accomplished
managers has been put in place.
Under any non-executive chairmanship of Anna Murdoch, a novelist, there
would be:
Mr Gus Fischer, managing director of News International and chief operating
officer of News Corp. He is a German-Swiss businessman who ran a printing
industry company in California before coming to Rupert Murdoch's attention
Mr Dave DeVoe, New York-based vice-president finance and chief financial
officer has established his financial credentials as News Corp pulled back
from the brink and is again expanding
Mr Arthur Siskind, executive vice-president and general counsel is seen as a
weighty lawyer involved in all the important deals.
The Australian part of the Murdoch empire operates semi-autonomously under
the charge of Mr Ken Cowley. But without Rupert Murdoch where would be the
chief executive of vision?
Mr Terry Povey, Murdoch-watcher for stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan has no doubt
of the answer.
'Mr Sam Chisholm (managing director of British Sky Broadcasting) or Mr Barry
Diller. And they can't have Mr Diller because he's gone off to be a Rupert
Murdoch in his own right,' said Mr Povey.
Mr Diller, former head of Twentieth Century Fox, is running the QVC shopping
channels bidding to take over Paramount Studios.
'I would place a small bet that Rupert Murdoch will outlive us all
professionally,' Mr Povey adds.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rally in bond market lifts Japan's leading brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RALLY in the bond market and a recovery in stock prices helped Japan's
leading brokers to report stronger performances for the first six months to
September.
However, the figures were lower than previously anticipated for most
brokers, due to weaker-than-expected commissions on the Tokyo stock market,
where the daily average turnover has been 10 per cent lower than initial
projections. While the big four houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi -
saw a return to profitability from a year ago, six of the 10 second-tier
brokers remained in the red.
The Nikkei index, which hit a six-year low in August last year, recovered to
the 20,000 level last April.
Daily trading value rose by 58 per cent to Y407.6bn (Dollars 3.8bn) from a
year ago, but activity has been dominated by large institutional investors,
and some smaller brokers, which are dependent on retail investors, failed to
benefit from the increase.
Of the 14 largest brokers, Daiwa saw the largest pre-tax profit, due to a
56.5 per cent rise in commissions to Y110.5bn. Daiwa posted a nine-fold rise
in stock underwriting commission income to Y2.6bn due to income from DDI, a
long-distance telecommunications company, and Taito, a game maker, both
popular among investors.
Nomura's commission income rose 48.2 per cent to Y140.4bn, while
underwriting commission income rose 71.5 per cent to Y17.3bn due to an
increase in convertible bond issues. However, its profit in the balance on
financial times shrank 26.8 per cent to Y34.5bn due to lower interest rates.
Nikko's commission income rose 58.7 per cent to Y105.3bn, while stock
underwriting commission income increased seven fold to Y3bn.
However, Nikko was the only broker among the big four to see an increase in
expenses, as sales and administrative expenses rose by 8.1 per cent to
Y116.3bn.
Yamaichi posted a 44.4 per cent rise in commission income to Y88.7bn, while
stock underwriting tripled to Y803m.
Many of the smaller brokers are still struggling under the burden of
over-expansion during the late 1980s. Of the 10 second-tier brokers, New
Japan, Wako, Tokyo, and Kokusai managed to post pre-tax profits, while
Sanyo, Kankaku, Yamatane, Okasan, Cosmo, and Dai-Ichi posted losses.
Industry analysts feel the worst is over for the larger brokers, but point
out they will need to undergo further cost cuts to improve profitability.
For the full year, Nomura expects a 30-fold jump in pre-tax profits to
Y70bn, while Nikko forecasts pre-tax profits to rise six fold to Y40bn.
Daiwa, which saw losses last fiscal year, expects a pre-tax profit of Y60bn
while Yamaichi predicts pre-tax profits of Y22bn.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Borland Int'l plunges 48% in second term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BORLAND International, the US personal computer software company, reported a
sharp drop in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, as revenues fell 16
per cent.
Net income was Dollars 2.8m, or 11 cents per share, down 48 per cent from
Dollars 5.4m or 20 cents last year. Revenues declined to Dollars 107.4m from
Dollars 127.8m.
Borland blamed the declines partly on a court order that forced it to
temporarily withdraw and make changes to its spreadsheet programme, Quattro
Pro. It is involved in a dispute with rival Lotus Development, which has
accused Borland of copying certain features of its 1-2-3 spreadsheets.
Borland quickly issued a new version of Quattro Pro omitting the offending
features.
In a bid to gain market share, it has priced its new version of Quattro Pro
at less than half that of competing spreadsheet programs.
Borland said it was also hit by weakness in Europe.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Fiat extends Rhone-Poulenc alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's largest private industrial group, is to form part of a core of
stable long-term shareholders in the forthcoming privatisation of
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals company.
The move, which was revealed yesterday by Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief
executive officer, will mark an important consolidation of a cross-border
alliance with Rhone-Poulenc.
Rhone-Poulenc and Snia BPD, Fiat's chemicals and fibres subsidiary, have one
joint venture and a second is due to begin in January.
Fiat's participation in Rhone-Poulenc's privatisation, which is due within
the next few weeks, reflects the interest of international industry in
France's ambitious plan to sell 21 publicly-owned groups. The privatisation
of Banque Nationale de Paris earlier this month attracted participation from
several overseas companies, including BAT Industries of the UK and General
Electric of the US.
In announcing Fiat's involvement in France's privatisation programme, which
has to be approved by the French privatisation committee, Mr Romiti said the
group would not be bidding for any of the assets about to be divested by the
Italian state. 'We have drawn too much fire for being too big in Italy and
we do not want to be accused of further increasing our size in respect of
others,' he told a parliamentary commission.
This comment appeared an attempt to head off suggestions that Fiat had
passed a vote of confidence in French privatisation and not that of Italy
which is proceeding at a much slower pace than that of the Balladur
government.
Core investors are expected to represent about 25 per cent of
Rhone-Poulenc's shares when the state sells its 43 per cent stake within the
next few weeks. They must purchase a minimum of 2.5m shares, about 1 per
cent of the total. Rhone-Poulenc shares are trading at about FFr156.
The move by Fiat comes shortly after the consolidation of relations with
another large French industrial group. On September 28, Fiat announced a
L6,250bn (Dollars 3.9bn) capital increase and the creation of a hard core of
friendly shareholders that included France's Alcatel Alsthom, due to raise
its stake from 1 per cent to about 2.2 per cent.
Fiat intends to rationalise its Fiatimpresit construction and civil
engineering interests by forming a joint venture with Lodigiani and Girola,
two private Italian operators.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Finland sells SBF to banks for FM5.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST restructuring of the Finnish banking sector was unveiled
yesterday when the government sold off the Savings Bank of Finland (SBF) to
four of the country's leading banks for FM5.6bn (Dollars 983m).
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Unitas, Okobank and Postipankki will each pay
FM1.4bn for a share of SBF's 650 branches and FM48bn of deposits.
SBF collapsed into the arms of the state last year. As the second biggest
casualty of the country's financial crisis, after Skopbank, it has received
FM14.6bn in state support.
Yesterday's deal will leave the state shouldering FM32.6bn of SBF's
non-performing assets, including real estate with a book value of FM6.2bn.
This will be administered by an asset management company, backed by FM5bn of
equity.
The state will be paid through a combination of cash, bank shares, other
stocks and preferred capital.
Both KOP and Unitas, the country's biggest commercial banks, are planning to
issue new shares to the government guarantee fund in part-payment.
This will leave the state with a stake of about 10 per cent in KOP, which is
taking over 135 SBF branches, and a 6 per cent stake in Unitas, which is
acquiring 122 branches.
The government guarantee fund said the agreed dismemberment of SBF was the
best way to promote competition and rationalisation in the Finnish bank
sector.
The deal will lead to a significant number of branch closures.
The government was under pressure to find a quick solution to SBF's problems
as its customer base disintegrated under the marketing onslaught of
competitors.
It leaves Skopbank, a commercial bank which has come under state control, in
limbo. Its role as the central bank of the SBF will disappear, although it
will still derive business from 40 independent savings banks outside the SBF
network.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Strong sales help Nokia turnround to FM466m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled a FM466m
(Dollars 81.7m) pre-tax profit for the first eight months. Growing
telecommunications and mobile phone sales helped the recovery from the
FM277m loss in the same 1992 period.
The group said it had reached an advanced stage in talks with other industry
groups over a partnership covering the tubes and home electronics activities
within its loss-making consumer electronics division.
Stemming losses through rationalisation had proved insufficient due to
depressed European markets, said Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive.
He declined to reveal the partners involved but hoped an agreement could be
reached within months.
Telecommunications sales climbed 87 per cent to FM2.74bn and mobile phone
sales jumped 83 per cent to FM3.68bn in the first eight months to push group
sales up 42 per cent to FM14.16bn.
Operating profits amounted to FM787m, compared with a FM152m loss last time.
Margins improved within telecommunications and mobile phones compared with
last year and profits in both divisions rose strongly.
On the negative side, losses within consumer electronics were as large as in
1992 and financial expenses jumped to FM323m from FM130m, after exchange
rate losses of FM172m.
It forecast an operating profit of at least FM425m in the final four months
with an improvement on last year's FM158m full-year pre-tax loss.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Week in the Markets: Copper struggles to halt downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market was yesterday making yet another
attempt to consolidate after a resumption of the bear trend that followed
the ending of a protracted technical supply 'squeeze' five weeks ago.
At the close the three-months delivery contract, which had earlier slumped
to a six-year low of Dollars 1,630 a tonne, was quoted at Dollars 1,636.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day, Dollars 68 on the week and Dollars 244
from the level ruling before the squeeze suddenly evaporated on September
17.
Most of the fall - Dollars 47 for three-months metal - happened on Monday,
as the market abandoned last week's attempt to consolidate after a modest,
technically inspired rally. Tuesday's extended decline, reflecting bearish
fundamental and technical factors, had dealers talking in terms of an
imminent test of support around the Dollars 1,600-a-tonne area. But another
abortive consolidation interrupted the downtrend on Wednesday and early on
Thursday before running into stern resistance close to Dollars 1,660 a
tonne.
The aluminium market had also steadied at the end of last week, helped by
reports of production problems in the former Soviet Union. But those gains
were quickly wiped out on Monday and the three-months delivery price dipped
to Dollars 1,112 a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,115.25, down
Dollars 27.50 on balance.
The biggest loser, however was nickel. The three months position surrendered
Dollars 130 of last week's Dollars 207.50-a-tonne rise to close yesterday at
Dollars 4,645 a tonne. That fall reflected the further fading of hopes that
other companies would follow up the 16 per cent output cut announcement made
two weeks ago by Canada's Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer. That
move, together with buying in anticipation that it was coming, had been
instrumental in lifting the price from the 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars 4,030
a tonne reached a week earlier.
On the credit side at the LME this week were tin and lead.
Despite easing back by Dollars 48 yesterday the three months tin price
closed with a Dollars 192.50 gain on the week at Dollars 5,005 a tonne. But
that performance owed less to the market's fundamentals than to
manipulation, probably on behalf of producers as well as merchants,
according to Ms Lesley Campbell, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the London broker.
'Most of the recent rise is artificial,' said Ms Campbell, 'the result of a
well-timed, concerted effort to boost the price.'
She explained that the operation, centred on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market,
was well-timed because the market was oversold and nervous after the recent
fall to 20-year lows. In addition the fundamental position had changed as
mines had cut production of concentrates (an intermediate material) over the
past six weeks, although the resulting supply tightness 'could take another
year to filter through and give real support to prices'. In the meantime
availability of refined metal would continue to be assured by the plentiful
supplies in the US official stockpile and LME registered warehouses.
The lead market suffered a heavy fall in the first half of the week before
buyers returned in strength. The three-months position, which had risen by
Pounds 20.75 last week, fell back by Pounds 9.75 a tonne over the first two
days of this week. But it then surged by Pounds 19.25 to close yesterday at
Pounds 414.75 a tonne, the highest level since August 5.
Dealers attributed the rise to trade buying and short-covering encouraged by
the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, the high season for sales of
replacement car batteries.
The gold market ended a choppy week in the middle of its range. After
trading as low as Dollars 364.25 a troy ounce and as high as Dollars 375.20
it closed on the London bullion market yesterday at Dollars 368 an ounce, up
Dollars 3.25 on balance. Once again the market seemed to be dancing to the
tune of the US investment funds - falling when they were sellers and rising
when they bought. Dealers also noted that producers had been active sellers
early in the week.
The silver and platinum markets both fell back with gold yesterday - by 9
cents to Dollars 4.44 1/2 an ounce and by Dollars 4.10 to Dollars 371.75 -
but were still up on the week - by 11 cents and Dollars 5 respectively.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the market was 'disappointed' after
silver's failure on Thursday to breach technical resistance at Dollars 4.60
an ounce. 'It could drift lower over the next couple of weeks,' one said.
At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa market tried its footing on fresh
high ground before deciding reluctantly on a tactical retreat. The March
position reached a 5 1/4 -year high of Pounds 991 a tonne on Thursday,
before easing to Pounds 976 at the end of the day; and yesterday it
clambered back to Pounds 988 a tonne at one point. Vertigo set in once
again, however, and by the close the price stood at Pounds 965 a tonne, up
Pounds 21 on the week.
Dealers said the highs were reached on relatively light buying in what one
called 'a selling vacuum'.
The coffee market moved with the ebb and flow of confidence about Brazil
operating the export retention scheme effectively, especially in view of the
present political scandals. The January position traded up to Dollars 1,242
a tonne in mid-week but ended at Dollars 1,205, up Dollars 13 on balance.

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tarmac swaps tiles for bricks - Deal with
Marley gives opportunity to rationalise over-capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES TO reduce substantial over-capacity in the brick industry were
promised by Tarmac when it announced an asset swap with Marley, its rival
building materials group.
Tarmac, the UK construction group, is exchanging its Hawkins Tiles clay tile
manufacturing business for three regional brick factories and Pounds 3m in
cash.
While representing a significant boost to Tarmac's production of clay
bricks, the deal will enable the company to rationalise and take capacity
out of the industry even though its overall brick capacity will rise from
220m to more than 300m bricks a year. This represents about 10 per cent of
the UK brick market.
Mr Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive, said: 'The exchange is very much
in line with the group's signalled intent of working towards consolidating
and rationalising the UK brick industry.'
Tarmac has recently undertaken to dispose of non-core businesses to reduce
its large borrowings and pave the way for new investment in housebuilding
land.
It also recently raised Pounds 215m in a 1-for-4 rights issue.
UK brick stocks at present stand at about 1bn. About 45 per cent of the UK's
clay brick production is sold into new housebuilding, mostly to the top 50
builders. This market is expected to increase by at least 5 per cent a year.
The three Marley brick factories at Dorket Head in Nottinghamshire, Errol in
Perthshire and Maltby in South Yorkshire, are operating at less than 50 per
cent capacity. Tarmac plans to take advantage of this spare capacity to
match growth in the housing market.
Last year the three factories recorded sales of Pounds 6m and incurred
operating losses of Pounds 3.2m. Excluding clay reserves, which Marley did
not value, the businesses had net assets of Pounds 14.7m.
The deal gives Marley a way out of the brick business which it has been
trying to sell for several years. Its interests were acquired in 1987 and
1988 for Pounds 47.8m. However it will be forced by accounting rules to
record an exceptional charge of about Pounds 33m in the current year.
Hawkins Tiles, with net assets of Pounds 23.8m, is one of the three main
clay tile manufacturers in the UK. Last year it reported a Pounds 860,000
operating loss on sales of Pounds 2.52m.
Hawkins manufactures a range of clay roof tiles at its plant in Cannock,
Staffordshire, which has an annual production capacity of more than 30m
tiles and will complement Marley's leading position in concrete roof tiles.
Mr David Trapnell, Marley's chief executive, said: 'This deal is good for
both parties. We have each been able to move out of activities that no
longer formed part of our core business in the UK and at the same time we
have both strengthened our market positions in the areas where we wish to
concentrate in the future.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Usborne achieves Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USBORNE, a diversified group with core interests in grain merchanting and
pig production, yesterday announced a return to profit with Pounds 1.6m
pre-tax for the 18 months to June 30 - in line with the forecast which
accompanied August's Pounds 4.6m rights issue.
The shares rose 2p to 22 1/2 p.
The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 4.12m for the 1991 year,
was enhanced by a pension fund surplus of Pounds 721,000 and a sharp fall in
the company's share of associates' losses of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 4.38m).
Operating profit from continuing operations was Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 1.27m)
on turnover of Pounds 311m (Pounds 210m).
Mr David Frame, chief executive, said the two main events of the year - the
rights issue and the purchase from Unigate of a substantial portion of its
outdoor reared pigs - both made a substantial difference to the balance
sheet and provided 'important opportunities for the development of our two
principal businesses.'
He said that the grain merchanting side had performed well in a declining
market for cereals. Grain showed a profit of Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 1.5m) on
turnover of Pounds 269m (Pounds 186m).
On the pig side the Unigate arrangement would lead to more stable long-term
supplies and Mr Frame said the group had made strides towards creating a
business which would produce steady profits over the next five years.
The division showed a profit of Pounds 611,000 (Pounds 69,000) on turnover
of Pounds 37m (Pounds 20m).
The proposed final dividend is 0.4p, making a total of 0.8p (0.4p), payable
from earnings of 2.19p per share (losses of 5.79p).

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barclays expands in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS is spending Pounds 50m to virtually double the number of its
branches in France this year.
'We have to ride out the recession in France, just as we have done in the UK
and US', said Mr Andrew Buxton, the banking group's chairman.
Barclays, which reported a 1992 loss of FFr987m (Pounds 115m) - including
provisions of FFr900m against bad debts - would still lose money this year,
but would break even next year, he predict-ed.
'Our strategy is to deliver a particular skill to our customers rather than
try to take the major French banks head-on across the board', he said.
This 'particular skill', he said, consisted of linking current accounts to
an interest bearing deposit account.
In response to French authorities' objections last year Barclays had had to
make transfers between the two accounts less automatic. But Mr Buxton
forecast that 'sooner or later, consumers' wishes will have an effect on the
French market'.
'We have gained a considerable number of customers with this', he said, and
as a result Barclays was expanding the number of its retail branches from 50
to 90 during 1993.

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Institutions concerned about trust expenses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONS are worried about escalating costs in the investment trust
industry, driven by managers' eagerness to attract private investors.
NatWest Securities, which surveyed 23 institutional investors for its
1993-94 investment trust annual, discovered a massive increase in expenses
over the past eight years.
Of the 31 trusts in the FT Mid-Cap index, all have doubled their expenses
over that period and 12 have quadrupled their expenses. The RPI has risen by
only 60 per cent.
One investor surveyed said: 'I would like to see more quality control on new
issues, especially on expenses which have risen too fast. The industry must
demonstrate quality with low costs. Management fees of 1.5 per cent or more
will damage the industry.'
One reason for the increase in expenses has been the cost of running savings
schemes and personal equity plans.
Since these have helped to narrow the discount on which shares trade,
institutions may have seen the benefit.
However, NatWest has found no correlation between the extent of growth in
expenses and the narrowing of the discount. NatWest said that institutions
were also concerned about 'cosy' boards, too many new issues and a lack of
consultation about important corporate charges.
Nevertheless, 12 out of the 23 institutions surveyed remain net buyers of
investment trust shares. They usually hold generalist trusts, as a means of
buying assets at a discount, and specialist trusts, as a means of
subcontracting management in areas where they lack expertise.

ROYAL INSURANCE has acquired the Canadian subsidiary of Sun Alliance, its
rival composite insurer, in its first overseas purchase for five years.
In a parallel move, Sun Alliance will acquire Royal's New Zealand business.
Both deals take effect in January.
No terms were disclosed. Net assets of the Canadian business amounted to
CDollars 71m (Pounds 35.5m) at the end of last year, while the New Zeland
operation had net assets of NZDollars 8m (Pounds 3m).
'This is a sign that we are moving onto the front foot,' said Mr Roy
Randall, head of corporate relations at Royal, which is moving back into
profit after three years of heavy losses. Royal is the fourth biggest
insurer in Canada and the deal reinforced its commitment to Canada.
Mr Roger Neville, group chief executive of Sun Alliance, said the New
Zealand deal confirmed its position as third largest insurer in that
country.

<TEXT>
DELIAN LLOYD'S Investment Trust yesterday became the seventh new Lloyd's
investment company to publish a pathfinder prospectus. Delian is seeking a
full listing through a placing by Hill Samuel, writes Richard Lapper.
Delian aims to raise Pounds 50m, allowing it to provide up to Pounds 100m in
capacity to between 40 and 50 syndicates. RF Kershaw, the independent
members' agent, will act as a licensed Lloyd's adviser, while the investment
portfolio will be managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial Management.
'We have deliberately chosen a Lloyd's adviser which is independent of the
agents who manage syndicates, in order to avoid conflicts of interest that
are otherwise inevitable,' said Lord Stewartby, chairman.
Earlier this week SG Warburg and Samuel Montagu also published pathfinder
prospectuses for new trusts. The London Insurance Market Investment Trust,
the biggest trust announced to date, is seeking to raise Pounds 280m.
Applications for shares in Limit will be for a minimum of 1,000 shares at an
offer price of 100p per share.

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Abacus raising Pounds 15m via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABACUS is coming to market through a share placing which is expected to
value the franchised distributor of electronics components at between Pounds
35m and Pounds 40m.
The placing, sponsored by NatWest Markets, will raise about Pounds 15m,
including Pounds 3.6m net of new money. Mr Brian Murdoch, managing director,
said the new funds will be used to pay back Pounds 3m of debt and position
the group for future growth, both organic and, if appropriate, through
acquisitions.
Abacus was the subject of a Pounds 3.4m management buy-out led by Mr Murdoch
and three colleagues in February 1989 and backed with funds from Ensign
Trust, a company controlled by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund.
Since then it has grown quickly through two small acquisitions and organic
expansion. Turnover in the year to September 30 increased to Pounds 30.9m
(Pounds 23.4m) and pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 1.76m),
equivalent to earnings of 7.4p (4.3p) per share.
Following the flotation roughly 35 per cent of the equity will be in the
hands of institutional shareholders, a similar proportion will remain in the
hands of the management team and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund
will retain the remaining 30 per cent stake.

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Toytown tales of teapots and Mighty Max - A
look at the success of and City support for Torquil Norman's Bluebird
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTHUSIASM, creativity and charisma are not qualities necessarily associated
with captains of industry. However, they are three words which constantly
crop up in conversations about the chief executive of Bluebird Toys.
The City fairly gushes with goodwill for the man. One broker with 25 years
experience said: 'I think it is tremendously refreshing that despite the
problems and the ups and downs he has maintained that enthusiasm for his
product. I think that's lovely.'
And if Mr Torquil Norman is riding high so is his company's share price
which reached a new peak of 543p last month having hit a low of 26p in
December 1990.
The price rose sharply in late September when the company reported interim
pre-tax profits of almost Pounds 2m for the six months to June 30, compared
with Pounds 234,000.
Mr Norman started Bluebird in 1980 to make the Big Yellow Teapot, a
teapot-cum-house he designed for children aged three to five during a year
or so of unemployment. That spell followed a boardroom row at Berwick Timpo,
the toy company he stumbled into after almost 10 years in banking.
He found he 'couldn't bear' to licence anyone else to make the Teapot. About
120,000 were sold in 1985, the same year the company floated on the USM,
valued at about Pounds 5.3m.
There was also an element of principle behind the project. 'I started the
business in the middle of a recession and I really did it with a sort of
idealistic feeling that we could create jobs in the UK, but that sounds a
bit pretentious.'
And create jobs he did, about 38 initially. Declaring that a weak sterling
meant toys assembled by Bluebird from other companies' components could
compete with imports from the Far East, Mr Norman watched the profits roll
in.
'It was incredible. We thought it would never come to an end.'
In quick succession Bluebird acquired Peter Pan Playthings for Pounds 3.5m
in June 1987 and Merit Toys in April 1988 for Pounds 1.7m. By this time Mr
Norman had stepped down as chief executive to concentrate on designing toys.
Profits began to decline in 1989 as more difficult trading conditions
coincided with the cost of buying 300,000 sq ft of assembly and warehouse
space in Merthyr Tydfil. The situation was further aggravated by retailers
reducing orders which caused working capital problems.
By 1990 profits had fallen to Pounds 856,000 and the shares, which took
their first sharp knock in the 1987 crash, continued their fall to 26p.
Bluebird announced a Pounds 5.9m rights issue and Mr Norman was voted back
as chief executive.
He was quick to realise his ideals could not withstand recession in the UK.
He cut the 1,000-strong workforce. It now stands at about 420. He closed two
factories, consolidating operations on one site at Merthyr Tydfil. In 1991
the company booked exceptional costs of Pounds 3.46m to pay for the shake up
and pre-tax losses deepened to Pounds 3.55m.
About 50 per cent of turnover is sold in the UK, with about half sourced in
the Far East, mainly China which means that about three quarters of total
volume is based on overseas manufacture.
'The point is that the cost of developing, tooling and packaging can't be
recovered if you are only selling in the UK,' said Mr Norman.
Bluebird returned to the black in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.55m
and paid its first dividend since 1989 with future hopes pinned on the so
far successful new pocket-money sized ranges, Polly Pocket and Mighty Max.
He blamed himself for some of the difficulties. 'I could be accused of being
a bit slow.' However, he refused to claim credit for the turnround. 'I may
have been a fairly natural marketer, but in those days it was fairly easy.
Now we are much larger and it is very different. There really is a team
effort.'
The Eton-educated son of Air Commodore Sir Nigel Norman was not obviously
destined for such a career.
'I was a great disappointment to everybody going into toys,' he said, with
barely concealed satisfaction.
Things might well have been different but for peace in east Asia.
'I was due to go to Korea and the war stopped about three weeks before I was
to have gone out. So my mother sent me a cable saying 'Bad luck, you'll have
to go to Cambridge instead,'' he said, laughing. 'It didn't seem to matter
about exams in those days.'
Leaving Cambridge with a degree in law, he read of JP Morgan and wrote to
the bank asking for work.
He spent more than four years in America, meeting his fiancee at a parachute
club and acquiring a distaste for Britain's political culture.
He now describes himself as 'virtually a republican' and an enemy of the
class system.
'In industry you have to take decisions quickly and sort things out.
Politicians are increasingly professionals, lawyers and so on. The result is
they are constantly tinkering and never analysing what needs to be done.'
In spite of early doubts about British society, Mr Norman left JP Morgan in
the unpleasant aftermath of a merger and returned to the UK.
'I couldn't stand all the merger politics. All the redefining of jobs
instead of getting on with them. Anyway I wanted to get married.'
He took a job with Philip Hill Higginson Erlanger (now Hill Samuel) only to
be confronted with another equally unsettling merger after another four
years.
As his disaffection with banking grew Mr Norman became more and more
involved with a small venture capital company he and a colleague had formed.
Called Batehill, it traded under the deathless slogan, 'putting skates on
business'.
When, during a refinancing the banks made it a condition that Batehill put
skates on just one business, Mr Norman chose the toy company, Berwick Timpo,
because it was the biggest.
Now aged 60, Mr Norman continues with his lifelong hobby of flying classic
aeroplanes and has no plans to retire. 'I'll be around for a while.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Blick pays Pounds 57.6m for Time &amp; Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLICK, the communications systems and time products company, will almost
double in size by buying the business of rival Time &amp; Security for Pounds
57.6m.
Blick, which said last week it was close to a substantial acquisition,
estimated the deal would more than double income from rental contracts from
Pounds 87m to Pounds 167m. 'We are doubling our customer base for 22 per
cent of the equity.' said Mr Ian Scott-Gall, Blick's managing director.
The acquisition is funded by a Pounds 20m rights issue, a Pounds 40m new
credit facility and cash reserves of Pounds 6.6m. The rights is underpinned
by the company's estimate that pre-tax profits for the year to September
1993 will rise to Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 8.7m).
The company said it had been stalking T&amp;S for a number of years. It had
signalled its intention to grow through acquisition by mopping up smaller
companies in its sector in recent years. T&amp;S, with about 18,500 contracts,
is by far its largest addition.
Cable and Wireless acquired what was to become T&amp;S as part of Telephone
Rentals, the equipment supplier it bought for Pounds 320m in 1988.
The division, which employs 200 people at its Bletchley base, focuses mainly
on time recording equipment, on-site paging and broadcast, fire alarm and
detection systems, and emergency management systems.
At current prices it is expected the business will make annual profits of
Pounds 5.5m before tax and financing costs. In the year to March 31 turnover
was Pounds 18.8m, of which 90 per cent was from the customer base and the
balance from the sales of new equipment.
Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's UK telecoms arm, has a significant paging
business, but most of T&amp;S's activities were incidental to its
telecommunications concerns.
C&amp;W saw Telephone Rentals as crucial to developing Mercury's business
customer base. Mercury said a large part of T&amp;S' customers were now buying a
broad portfolio of its services, and would continue doing so.
Blick is buying stocks, work-in-progress and some staff as well as the order
book. The business is currently integrated within Mercury, relying on its
infrastructure for support services. Blick proposes to replicate this
structure.
Blick will pay Pounds 40.7m on completion, with a further Pounds 10m due by
July 1 next year and Pounds 6.9m payable on April 1 1995 depending on T&amp;S
hitting income levels which Mercury has guaranteed at Pounds 80m.
The 2-for-9 issue of new ordinary shares at 370p apiece will raise Pounds
20m net of expenses. Analysts said the price reflected the current worth of
guaranteed income.
Blick's shares closed down 5p at 440p.
The issue of 5.54m shares is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.
Kleinwort Benson Securities are brokers.
About Pounds 17m of the Pounds 40m new credit facility, arranged by
Kleinwort Benson, will guarantee the deferred payments.
The deal means Blick will be geared for the first time since flotation in
1986, with the company estimating the level at between 150 per cent and 175
per cent. This is projected to fall to nil by the first quarter of 1996.

Gresham House, the investment trust, reported net revenue for the first half
of 1993 of Pounds 1.17m, against losses of Pounds 1.5m.
The result was helped by the issue of Pounds 7.42m secured loan stock by its
Gresham House Finance subsidiary. That allowed the release of provisions for
interest and guarantees which, with the release of other provisions,
resulted in an exceptional credit of Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 982,000 charge).
Earnings per share came out at 27.6p, against losses of 35.3p.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Take it from the top: Is success something you can learn?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take one Brazilian archbishop, one French chef at a three-star restaurant,
an Australian marathon runner, a Russian conductor, the manager of the Los
Angeles Dodgers baseball team, the chief of an American Indian tribe, and 34
other super-achievers. Find out how they got where they are, and what makes
each tick. Distill the result, and you should have the secret of success.
Today, at a conference at Leeds Castle, Kent, that secret could be revealed.
A team of researchers from the Performance Group, a Norwegian management
consultancy, has spent two years travelling the world with a tape recorder
talking to 40 'world-class performers', including politicians, sports stars,
film makers, business people and clerics. A group of senior business
executives has been invited to hear the study's conclusions. All will
probably be hoping to glean a few tips for themselves.
At first sight, the reasons Luciano Benetton became a sweater-selling
superstar may appear to differ radically from those that made Fumihiko Maki
one of Japan's leading architects, or helped yachtsman Dennis Conner win the
America's Cup. But the Performance Group contends that all top performers
have common characteristics - and that success is not a birthright but a
trait that can be developed.
The most obvious similarity among those interviewed for the study is a sense
of compelling purpose. Successful people, it seems, are greedy for knowledge
and never stop acquiring it. They learn from their mistakes, they learn from
others. They have strong powers of concentration. They are disciplined,
intense and most have integrity.
Wilma Mankiller is presented in the study as a typical world-class
performer. She is the first woman to be elected principal-in-chief of the
Cherokee Nation, an Indian tribe in North America with 137,000 members. Her
ambition to lead the tribe came after a serious car accident. She says she
is dedicated to her work and respects her colleagues: 'What I like best, and
think is the most fun, is to talk with people in the Cherokee Nation at
large and focus on what it is we need to do, and then put all of the pieces
for a project together and move forward.'
Arne Naess, mountaineer and Norwegian shipowner, agrees that dedication is
fundamental: 'You cannot be successful at anything doing it 90 per cent of
the time.'
Far from being egocentric, however, successful people are aware of the need
to motivate those who work with them as well - at least so they said in
their interviews. Esa-Pekka Salonen, 35, conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, says he aims to 'make others feel free, to create an illusion
that they are actually doing what they are doing out of their own desires
and not being led by somebody'.
All top performers are able to work intensely, according to the study, but
can also be flexible. For chef Michel Guerard, pioneer of nouvelle cuisine,
this means one minute dreaming up a strategy for restaurants combined with
health spas, the next making a perfect chocolate mousse.
Hard work, however, needs to be matched by relaxation. According to Jan
Carlzon, former president of Scandinavian Airlines System, 'to withdraw is
one of the keys to going forward again'.
All withdraw in different ways. Masanari Iketani, chief executive of Tokyo
Steel, gets up at first light to tend his orchids. Susan Bambrick, a leading
Australian academic, takes an early morning dip in the sea. Once a week
Paulo Evaristo Arns, archbishop of Sao Paulo, leaves his office and goes
incommunicado for a day.
World-class performers do not waste time. They know how to delegate and keep
their desks tidy. Ricardo Semler, who runs Semco, the unusual Brazilian
manufacturer of industrial equipment that allows employees to set their own
hours and in some cases their pay, is particularly jealous of his time. 'If
I can't imagine anybody else doing the task and I still think that it has to
be done, I do it,' he says.
He schedules no appointments unless there is a definite reason for them, and
he does not answer telephone calls.
Most high-flyers agree that it is important to make mistakes and experience
failure. Hector Babenco, the Argentine film director who made The Kiss of
the Spiderwoman, describes having a film panned by the critics: 'I was
crying at ridiculous moments of the day, watching the ceiling all night . .
. Then one day when I woke up, I said that life is bigger than everything
else. Today I am a new person.'
Many of these leading performers share a competitive streak. Cheong Choong
Kong, chief executive of Singapore Airlines, emphasises 'a person's drive,
an aggressive need always to be one step ahead of the others'. Conner
attributes his prowess as a yachtsman to persistence and an inner drive to
win - instincts he thinks result from growing up poor in San Diego,
surrounded by rich folk and their sailing boats.
However, some comments in the study fail to back up the thesis that anyone's
performance can be improved by taking a lead from the successful. Several
believe that greatness is congenital. Maestro of the Russian Opera, Valery
Gergiev says: 'Number one: you are born. You are born with certain abilities
already. It is in the computer, and you can't change it easily.'
Others have had greatness thrust upon them. Masanari Iketani inherited his
steel business from his father. About half of the interviewees rate their
fathers - mothers are hardly mentioned - as the most important influence in
their lives.
The Performance Group argues that high-flyers have lessons for all of us.
But it is one thing to establish that world-class performers have much in
common. Whether the executives attending the Leeds Castle conference will
leave with a more purposeful stride is another matter.

FT  23 OCT 93 / New boy upsets flexible friends: A look at the increase in
competition among UK credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than ever before, UK credit card issuers are having to prove just how
flexible and friendly they can be towards their 20m or so customers.
Existing credit card operators, dominated by the high street banks, had long
expected new players in the market. This week's launch of a credit card from
Vauxhall Motors is the clearest sign yet that competition is not only
increasing but that new players are bringing substantial financial and
marketing clout.
Before Vauxhall followed in the tyretracks of General Motors, its US parent
group, by offering a credit card that can earn customers a discount on a new
vehicle, the leading card issuers were unconcerned about new competitors who
had declared themselves.
Save &amp; Prosper, the investment group, last month launched a Visa card with
an annualised percentage rate of interest (APR) 7 percentage points below
the market norm. But it had said it was not interested in building a mass
market and has deliberately restricted eligibility, seeking to attract
mainly those looking to borrow on a credit card. The aim is to double its
existing base of 100,000 customers. In contrast, Barclaycard has almost 9m
customers; NatWest has 4m.
Similarly, the announcement by BMNA America Bank, one of the largest US
credit card lenders, that it is to set up a European headquarters in Chester
and plans to issue UK credit cards, did not cause alarm. In the US it has
focused on groups such as teachers.
But Vauxhall's entry is different. Some competitors even admit the package
being offered is 'good'. The APR of 19.9 per cent is 3 percentage points
below most others and there is no annual fee. 'Rebate points' acquired each
time the card is used could save up to Pounds 2,500 on the cost of a new
car, but only if purchases total Pounds 50,000 over five years.
Also likely to worry the established UK players is the impressive success in
the US of credit cards launched by manufacturers.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Universal credit card, unveiled in March
1990, is now the second largest in the US bank credit card industry by
numbers of cards. The GM card, launched in September last year, has 8m
customers in the US. General Electric and Ford motors have started their own
schemes.
Vauxhall is not expected by others in the credit card business to be the
last non-bank to enter the UK market. British Telecom is considering
creating a combined credit and telephone card in co-operation with one of
the existing issuers.
It would be rash, however, to assume that a repeat of the US successes can
be guaranteed.
The high street banks say that their relations with customers are stronger
than in the US so account holders are less likely to go elsewhere for a
credit card. 'There's much less loyalty in the States,' says Mr Bob Potts,
managing director of Barclaycard.
But even if the take-up of non-bank credit cards, such as Vauxhall's, does
not match that in the US, the result could still be to shake up the market.
'In a year, I expect the new entrants on a combined basis to have achieved a
significant but still small share of the market - large enough for people to
say 'They're serious and they're here,'' Mr Potts says.
His prediction, shared by others among the main players, is that the
casualties in any credit card war would be smaller existing issuers, such as
some building societies, which cannot exploit economies of scale and do not
offer a sophisticated package of discounts.
But the smaller operators see the contest differently. Mr Mark Christopher,
marketing director for banking services at S &amp; P, says small issuers that
focus on a niche market will not be in direct competition with the Vauxhall
card. Instead the brunt of the competition will fall on the market leaders.
'It gives the major cards a problem,' he says.
Although it is unclear who would win from a credit card war, the grounds on
which any battle would be fought are more obvious: fees and interest
charges, customer service, and the extras on offer.
Of these, the focus looks set to be on the additional benefits. Vauxhall's
discount scheme is the latest. Alongside insurance on purchases, many
issuers now offer 'loyalty schemes' that encourage frequent use of the card.
Barclaycard Profiles, for instance, offers points towards a selection of
gifts, while NatWest offers 'air miles' that give discounts on travel.
Such schemes have proved successful in making customers use their cards more
often. But, from the customers' point of view, they require high or
persistent spending. To qualify for a toaster from Barclaycard requires
spending Pounds 4,900. A return trip to Paris from a NatWest card needs
Pounds 9,000 of expenditure. The Consumers' Association warned this week
that nobody should apply for a card because of a 'gimmick' but should look
instead at the annual charges imposed on most cards and the interest rates.
It is on these more central features of a credit card that the prospects for
new and existing entrants will almost certainly depend.
Vauxhall seems to have recognised this by combining its discount scheme with
a competitive interest rate and no charge. Some rivals are sceptical about
whether the initial offer can, or will, be maintained, in spite of an
assurance from Mr Charles Golden, chairman and managing director of
Vauxhall, that 'it wouldn't be in our interest to play games with the fee or
the APR'.
There are also those who argue that the annual fee and APR are not
necessarily decisive factors in choosing a card. Ms Elizabeth Phillips,
director of the Credit Card Research Group, which carries out research for
the industry, says the original imposition of annual fees was an emotive
issue but now that they extend to more than three-quarters of cards, such
charges are no longer as contentious.
She is also unconvinced that the APR is critically important because about
three-quarters of credit cards are paid off in full most months.
But given that CCRG estimates that the average spending on a credit card is
only about Pounds 1,500 a year - not even enough for a toaster from
Barclaycard - undercutting on annual fees and interest rates is probably the
quickest way for new entrants to grab a market presence. The evidence is
that most card holders do not take advantage of the advertised benefits.
Mr Bruce Reid, marketing director for AT&amp;T's Universal card, pins the growth
of his product on basic pricing: 'The word 'free' was instrumental in our
popularity . . . You won't find our card packed with a lot of bells and
whistles.'
If Vauxhall's tactics are sustained then the market leaders will have to
respond. A first step may be to improve the additional benefits they offer.
But given that the main use of a credit card is not to win a free electric
kettle but to facilitate spending, the long-term response may be a
competitive struggle to offer lower charges.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Ding-dong battle to be boss: Quality of life dominates the
contest to be New York's mayor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a misty autumnal morning on Manhattan's Upper West Side and jut-jawed
Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, is
out chasing the important Hispanic vote - and trying to make himself look a
little less unlovable.
Mr Giuliani, who is battling a reputation as a cold, impatient,
short-tempered man, looks out stiffly across a hall of elderly, mainly
female Latinos - a sea of permed grey hair, glinting spectacles and brightly
coloured clothes - and tries to create a rapport.
His speaking style is flat, his manner uncharismatic, and he fails to amuse
the audience with a heavy-handed joke about his 84-year-old mother, who
lives in the same apartment building as him. 'If I let you down, she's going
to drive me crazy,' he says.
But the pensioners suddenly break into enthusiastic applause when he
promises to rid the city's projects (council estates) of their warring
armies of gun-toting drug dealers. 'We owe you a safer city,' he declares.
The audience warms like a bowl of chilli salsa.
The incident highlights the choice facing New Yorkers in the November 2
election. On the one side there is Mr David Dinkins, the 66-year-old black
Democratic incumbent, whose four years in office have left him with an
extremely mixed record and a reputation for enjoyment of the formal
trappings of office.
In spite of this, Mr Dinkins comes across as a humane man and a
bridge-builder, who has often managed to defuse racial tensions - no small
matter in the world's most ethnically diverse city, where any utterance is
prone to be construed as an insult to someone's colour or character.
On the other is the Italian-American Mr Giuliani, 49, who became one of the
best known lawmen in the US when, as US attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s,
he staged a series of high-profile prosecutions of corrupt politicians,
Mafia bosses and crooked financiers. It was he who caused a sensation on
Wall Street by carting three securities traders away from their desks in
handcuffs.
He is certainly a man of immense zeal and self-belief, who might energise
City Hall, but many New Yorkers question whether he has the temperament to
build the complex coalitions needed to govern the metropolis, where
registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly five to one.
It therefore says a lot about the restless, demoralised mood of the New York
electorate that Mr Giuliani, who lost by just 2 per cent of the vote when he
first fought Mr Dinkins in 1989, is once again running neck and neck with
the mayor in opinion polls that may significantly understate the
challenger's strength.
If he wins, he will be New York's first Republican mayor since the
good-looking, aristocratic Mr John Lindsay, who ran City Hall from 1966 to
1973. He will also strike a serious blow to the national Democratic party,
which is still smarting from the election in Los Angeles last spring of the
riot-torn city's first Republican mayor in 36 years.
The loss of New York would reinforce the theory that the Democrats' hold on
big city politics may be weakening.
The electorate, goes the argument, is disillusioned with policies that have
failed to solve the severe problems of the inner cities, particularly the
growth of an alienated, ill-educated black underclass - predominantly from
single-parent, welfare-dependent homes - armed to the teeth with guns and
willing to kill at the slightest provocation.
Mr Bret Schundler, a 34-year-old Republican who catapulted from nowhere to
be mayor of normally Democratic Jersey City, New Jersey, argues: 'You're
seeing the unravelling of Democratic party dominance in the major cities.
Big city machines are breaking down because the problems are so serious.'
New York shares many of these problems. It has a high crime rate, is one of
the leading drug-dealing centres of North America, and its constant struggle
to balance its budget has left it with a rotting infrastructure. The crisis
is epitomised by its schools, where metal detectors routinely check children
for guns. They opened weeks late for the autumn term because of asbestos
risks from crumbling walls and ceilings.
Yet New York is also distinctly different from other American cities, a fact
that both exacerbates its current financial problems but also offers
long-term strengths.
Its uniquely cosmopolitan nature, coupled with its almost European health
and social welfare programmes, means it has more than a normal quotient of
Aids victims, the indigent and the deranged. Their ubiquitous presence on
the streets of Manhattan contributes mightily, along with crime, to the
voters' sense that the quality of their life is deteriorating. So too does a
four-year recession, just ending, which has wiped out nearly 400,000 city
jobs.
Yet this same cosmopolitan nature maintains the city as the world's premier
financial centre and is constantly replenishing it with new, energetic waves
of immigrants - the latest coming from China and eastern Europe.
Both these forces - a sense that life is getting worse and the new
immigrants - play to Mr Giuliani's strengths. Mr Mitchell Moss, who heads
the Urban Research Centre at New York University, points out that many of
the new, entrepreneurial Asian and Latino arrivals have no ties to the
Democratic party machine and feel that Mr Giuliani's platform - which
emphasises self-help and reform of New York's taxes and bureaucracy - is in
line with their own values.
However, the main focus of Mr Giuliani's campaign is his promise - wearing
the prosecutor's mantle - to crack down harder than Mr Dinkins on crime,
drugs and vagrants. The mayor replies - and the figures support him - that
crime has actually fallen in New York on his watch, thanks to his large and
costly expansion of the police force.
But what matters in elections is not statistics, but perceived crises - and
politicians' ability to present themselves as the solution to them. Here, Mr
Dinkins has something of a credibility problem, not least because of his
handling of two serious racial incidents during his term.
First, he refused to take sides when blacks boycotted two Korean-run grocery
stores. More seriously, an official report published last summer blamed him
for failing to act decisively enough to prevent disturbances in the Crown
Heights area of Brooklyn which escalated into four days of violent
confrontation between blacks and Jews in 1991 - the city's worst racial
unrest in over 20 years.
At the very least this smacks of indecision, though critics also accuse Mr
Dinkins of pandering to black interests at the expense of other racial
groups. And this matters greatly in a city where the key to electoral
success is patching together a coalition of diverse ethnic and interest
groups.
Mr Giuliani, who refers to Crown Heights as a 'pogrom', has gained ground
among two important sets of voters: Jews and the Hispanic community, many of
whose Catholic members have been offended by the mayor's bold support of
homosexuals and the distribution of condoms in schools.
In a city as volatile as New York, much could happen in the next 10 days to
change the electoral climate. But, provided he keeps his personality in
check, Mr Giuliani could become the latest in a line of outsider
politicians, stretching back 100 years, who have temporarily wrested power
from the Democratic machine by exploiting the feeling that the city is going
to the dogs.
On that score, the worried Hispanic grandmothers of the Upper West Side seem
to have absolutely no doubts.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr DOMINIC DE LA BARRE D'ERQUELINNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The contention by Mr Luc Guyau, leader of FNSEA, the French farmers'
union, that the third world needs French food is absurd (World Trade News,
October 19). The main effect of subsidised food exports by OECD countries is
to depress world prices on free markets, since OECD food consumption is too
low to absorb extra production generated by subsidies. This deprives farmers
in poor countries of a share of revenues they would otherwise get if there
were no subsidies, in turn producingurban exodus, food riots, lower growth
and demand for OECD industrial products.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Privatising at BR's convenience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM HODGSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to urge the government to include an element of unbundling in
the forthcoming privatisation of British Rail.
During a recent trip to Turkey, I noticed that the public conveniences in
the main bus station in Ankara serve, I estimate, well in excess of 8,000
clients a day, at a price (effectively index-linked) of almost 8 pence a
visit. This business enjoys a local monopoly, a strong client base, 24-hour
custom all the year round, minimal fixed assets, no working capital
requirements and hence produces an astonishing cashflow.
Could not this element of BR's business be sold separately, under the price
control of, say, Ofbog, thus providing a new utility sector to the FT-SE
index? It is vital that the government obtains the best price for the
potentially profitable parts of what 'silver' is left in the cupboard.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your headline, 'Arrogant Welsh agency is humbled' (October 21) and
subsequent comments contained in the article appear to miss the fact that
the Welsh Development Agency was successful on a world scale.
Dr Gwyn Jones, the former chairman, and Philip Head, former chief executive,
have committed the heinous crime of running a quasi-government body in a
professional and successful manner. The relatively small amounts of money
spent outside Treasury guidelines (I understand it to be less than Pounds
3m) pales into insignificance when compared to more than Pounds 1bn of
inward investment they attracted to Wales last year alone and the
operational savings they made within the WDA. We continue to benefit from
both.
While, like all human beings, neither Gwyn Jones nor Philip Head is perfect,
both have proved themselves excellent custodians of public money, creating
wealth and opportunity within the Welsh agency.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fuss-pot of instant coffee and a
dose of hot air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN C BROADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It can be shown that of 100 units of energy in a North Sea Reservoir
destined to make a cup of instant coffee on mainland Europe some 90 units
are lost along the way.
The energy is drained off in energy production processes, in transportation,
in heat rejected by power stations and in transmission losses, and finally
(next to the coffee jar) as the energy remaining in the hot over-filled
kettle.
On the gardening page of the Weekend FT (October 16/17) the article by Robin
Lane Fox reminded me of waste on this scale (but unnecessarily so), as he
commended to us the processes of dosing our summer garden into the autumn
with liquid fertiliser and so achieving October flowering. This drenching in
chemicals is to be achieved by a garden hose fitted with a dosing
attachment.
But most of the liquid fertiliser so applied will end up as a management
problem for river and water authorities. We should, rather, be encouraging
gardeners to build up a good humus content (in part from re-cycled garden
waste) and letting our tens of thousands of garden worms and trillions of
bacteria produce the appropriate plant food in solution.
Happily, the article on the same page by Bridget Bloom should have furnished
a swift-acting antidote, when she drew our attention to the environmental
problems arising from lawn care. The potential damage arises through the
excesses of the dosing and cropping rituals of fuss-pot gard-eners.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA ROCHE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The news of Bridget O'Brien's important victory in the House of Lords
on Thursday is heartening.
More than seven years ago Mrs O'Brien was asked to sign a charge over her
home so her husband could obtain a business loan from Barclays Bank. Her
husband told her that he was applying for Pounds 60,000 when in fact he
borrowed Pounds 154,000, and she was never seen by any bank employee nor
were the legal implications explained to her. When the bank called in the
overdraft which would have led to the loss of her home, Mrs O'Brien took her
case to court and lost. When she won on appeal, Barclays took the case to
the Lords. The Law Lords decided today that creditors should not be able to
call in loans where they have not taken reasonable steps to ensure that
spouses have had independent legal advice.
There are many other women in similar situations. This scenario is a clear
example of the need for a new Banking Act stating clearly customers' and
borrowers' rights, and instituting an independent regulatory body for the
banks. Whether the government brings forward such a bill in next month's
Queen's Speech will be a test of their true commitment to citizens' rights.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMAN LAMONT bears the scars of fruitless efforts to persuade the
Bundesbank to do what it did voluntarily on Thursday. With the German
discount rate at 5.75 per cent, which puts it below UK base rate for the
first time for more than a year, his successor has reason to smile. A cut in
interest rates has become easier to contemplate. Such a cut could sugar a
bitter fiscal pill.
By bringing forward a recovery in the continent, these lower interest rates
should also help the British recovery. Their importance should not be
exaggerated, however. Real short-term interest rates remain high in most
continental countries, which suggests that recovery is likely to be long in
coming and weak when it does come. The importance of continental recovery to
the UK can also be exaggerated, even though continental markets take nearly
two-thirds of the UK's exports.
It is possible for the UK economy to grow when the continent is in
recession. It has done so, for example, over the year to the third quarter
of 1993, which saw a real increase of 2 per cent in UK gross domestic
product. But high continental interest rates and recession mean that such
growth must come at the price of lower interest rates and a lower exchange
rate than would otherwise be required. This is not just unpopular abroad. It
is also inflationary at home.
In any case, the economy needs all the help it can get. Yesterday's
preliminary statistics on third-quarter GDP show that the economy has been
in recovery for at least five quarters. But output in the third quarter of
1993 was still 1.3 per cent below the level in the second quarter of 1990,
while the economy has regained only two-thirds of the output it lost in the
first two years of recession.
How fast might it continue to recover? This week's report from the
Treasury's panel of independent forecasters is guardedly optimistic. These
worthies forecast growth of real GDP at between 1.6 and 3.3 per cent in
1994, between 2.4 and 3.4 per cent in 1995, and between 2.2 and 3.3 per cent
in 1996. But note the range of disagreement. Note also that even under the
most optimistic forecasts UK economic growth would average only around 1 1/2
per cent between 1990 and 1996.
Mixed evidence
As is to be expected at what remains a relatively early stage of the
recovery, evidence on performance is mixed. But the retail sales data for
September were encouraging, with a year-on-year increase of 3.5 per cent and
a monthly rise of 0.5 per cent. The latest numbers for the money supply
suggest that domestic demand may continue to pick up. Over the 12 months to
September narrow money (M0) rose by 5.3 per cent and broad money (M4) by
only 3.9 per cent. But over the latest three months the annualised rates of
growth have risen to 6.9 and 4.7 per cent, respectively.
These figures suggest recovery is in progress. The most disturbing
counter-evidence is that for exports outside the European Community. The
jump in the trade deficit to Pounds 1.1bn in September, from Pounds 0.7bn in
August, may not mean that much. But it is depressing that the volume of
exports outside the EC (excluding oil and erratics) was up only 1 per cent
in the latest quarter over the three months ending June 1993, while import
volume was up 1 1/2 per cent.
Hoped-for bounce
The devaluation has failed to give British exports the hoped-for bounce.
This is not that surprising when British exporters have increased the unit
value of their exports (excluding oil) by 5 1/2 per cent between the last
two quarters, while the unit value of UK imports has risen not at all.
The chancellor presides over an economy that is enjoying a modest recovery
led by domestic demand. What is not obvious is that he presides over an
economy which needs a further vigorous push, though some easing may be
justified. The main question he faces is how to combine such easing with the
need to rein in the fiscal deficit. The Green Budget from the Institute for
Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs argues, for example, that even under
modestly optimistic growth assumptions, the public sector borrowing
requirement would still be 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1997-98.
Politics demand that the chancellor announce most of the painful medicine
now. Economics suggest that a sustainable fiscal position must be offered if
inflationary expectations are to remain as subdued as they seem. The
solution would be to announce tax increases that the chancellor would want
to make in any case, but implement some of them in future years. The
required adjustment would be at least 1 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 6bn. If
the economy were to do better than now feared, reductions in taxes could be
introduced to offset these pre-announced increases.
In addition, there is always the possibility of lower base rates. The
Bundesbank should cut again in coming months, which will give Mr Clarke
still more room for manoeuvre. The rebalancing of fiscal and monetary policy
has begun. The budget is likely to see the process continue.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Smoke signals in the east: A look at western tobacco groups'
bids to broaden their markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Marlboro cowboy may have looked bedraggled and saddle-sore in the US
this year but he is still riding high elsewhere in the world.
The cigarette brand's manufacturer, Philip Morris, has fought fiercely in
the past six months to protect its advertising icon. It is anxious to
restore Marlboro's standing in the US. But protecting home sales is not the
only motive. It also fears that any further slippage in its standing in the
US would hit its growing international business.
The emphasis on strengthing an image in new markets is not unique to Philip
Morris. As the US, along with other western markets, have turned away from
cigarette consumption in the face of health lobbies and government
regulation, the multinational producers have had to look elsewhere - such as
the Far East - for sales growth.
This week came evidence that Philip Morris' strategy is paying off. Its
daring decision in April to cut prices in the US by 20 per cent reversed
some of the fall in sales over recent years. Marlboro's market share in the
US has risen from 24 per cent to 25.7 per cent. More spectacularly, results
for the quarter to September showed operating profits outside the US up 15
per cent on the same period a year before.
Although the US, where 500bn cigarettes are consumed a year, and western
Europe, where 750bn are smoked annually, will continue to be important
markets for Philip Morris and other tobacco groups, such as BAT Industries,
R J Reynolds and Rothmans International, it is the international market that
will provide the long-term opportunities.
What has transformed the prospects for the multinationals has been the
opening of new markets in Asia and the Pacific Rim and in eastern Europe.
A decade ago, 4,500bn cigarettes were smoked a year worldwide. But 60 per
cent of the market was closed to the multinationals by trade barriers.
Removal of restrictions in the fast-growing economies of the Far East and
the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, have now given western
multinationals access to all but 5 per cent of a global market that has
grown to 5,330bn cigarettes, in spite of recent worldwide recession.
Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, for instance, have lifted trade barriers
since the mid-1980s - usually under pressure from a US government that was
discouraging smoking in its own backyard. China, the biggest market in the
world with an annual consumption of 1,705bn cigarettes, still restricts
imports to hard currency outlets, but has said it will open the door wider
in 1995. Philip Morris this year signed a co-operation agreement with the
state tobacco company to produce Marlboro cigarettes.
In Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, tobacco multinationals
headed the race by western companies to establish operations in the former
communist states, a market of 643bn cigarettes.
Such emerging markets present almost a mirror image of conditions in the US
and western Europe. In the Far East and east Europe, the smoking habit is
spreading and is socially acceptable. Anti-smoking campaigners are less
vociferous. Restrictions on advertising are relatively weak or weakly
enforced.
The contrast between the mature and developing markets can be stark. While a
Los Angeles court recently removed a child from the custody of a mother who
smoked, children sell cigarettes on almost every street corner in Manila.
Whereas in the west, the health hazard is top of people's minds, in Russia's
parlous economy the jobs created by the investments of tobacco companies
weigh more heavily. Moreover cigarettes have the status of a currency which,
unlike the rouble, does not depreciate.
Tobacco multinationals are flourishing in these conditions. World sales of
international brands, such as Marlboro, grew by 7 per cent a year between
1989 and 1992. BAT, which exported 45bn cigarettes in 1989, almost trebled
the number to 129bn last year. US companies shipped 18bn cigarettes to the
Pacific Rim in 1985; last year, the number rose to 87bn.
To cope with the demand from these markets, Philip Morris is completing a
Dollars 400m expansion of its plant in North Carolina, increasing production
capacity by 50 per cent. BAT is investing Pounds 175m in its Southampton
factory in southern England to double annual production to 55bn cigarettes.
The inroads made into Far East markets - where many consumers aspire to what
they perceive to be a western lifestyle - is almost certainly producing the
biggest contributions to profit, although no group gives a regional
breakdown.
Philip Morris has secured 12 per cent of the Japanese market, the world's
fourth largest. BAT's Kent and Lucky Strike brands both rank in the top five
of Japan's best-selling imported cigarettes. The two groups dominate the now
growing imported sector in Taiwan.
Rothmans International this year merged its tobacco interests in Malaysia,
Singapore and Hong Kong to strengthen its operations in the region. Mr Nyren
Scott-Malden, analyst at BZW, says: 'The move enables it to use the cash
built up in the mature markets of Malaysia and Singapore to exploit the
biggest growth markets in the world.'
Outside the Far East, slower economic growth mean returns from investments
will take longer to secure. Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's chairman, says
significant profits on the group's east European ventures are not expected
for at least 10 years, 'possibly 25'.
Establishing operations in the former Soviet bloc also requires a deal of
management agility to surmount obstacles presented either by the absence of
any framework of commercial law or a maze of regulations. 'Businessmen,'
says Sir Patrick, 'are marooned in a command economy.'
In Russia, BAT is setting up a joint venture with Yava, Moscow's largest
cigarette factory; Rothmans is investing Pounds 55m in a joint venture in St
Petersburg; and Philip Morris this year bought into its third cigarette
company.
Other ventures are being set up in the the CIS and other east European
countries; in the Czech republic, Philip Morris paid Dollars 400m for a
majority of the Tabak company which controls 80 per cent of the country's
tobacco market. BAT has gained a 50 per cent share of the Hungarian market
through a Pounds 20m joint venture with a local factory.
Equipped with modern machinery, these factories are now improving low-priced
local cigarette brands. The expectation is that over the next few years,
such investments will begin to reap rewards comparable with those in the Far
East.
All this is not to suggest that the multinationals have given up in western
markets.
For instance, the breaking of state cigarette manufacturing monopolies, as
rules for new market entrants have been relaxed, in Italy, France, Spain and
Portugal, have provided further opportunities for international brands.
Marlboro now controls 43 per cent of the Italian market and 35 per cent in
Germany. Sales of BAT's Lucky Strike brand in France have risen by 27 per
cent a year since 1989 to 1.2bn cigarettes.
But demand in the mature markets US and western Europe markets is falling
under constant and growing pressure of health lobbies and increasing
government controls on advertising. The need to keep the Marlboro cowboy
looking proud in China and elsewhere will remain the first priority.

FT  23 OCT 93 / China's puff for the west: Marlboro man's new horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Chang hardly fits the image of Marlboro man, whose rough-hewn visage
has been employed to sell cigarettes worldwide; but this week, wittingly or
unwittingly, the tennis player who is ranked seventh in the world might be
said to be helping to promote cigarette sales throughout Asia, and in China
in particular.
As the top seed at the Salem 1993 Open Tennis Championships in Beijing,
Chang, a Chinese-American, is the tournament's main draw card and a
favourite with the crowd, that cheers him on in his contests with the
Europeans and Australians. For the manufacturers of Salem, Chang's presence
in the first open tennis tournament in the Chinese capital is the fulfilment
of a marketing dream in the world's biggest market for cigarettes - one in
which foreign tobacco companies are taking an increasing interest as sales
slide in the west.
A small survey this week on Beijing's streets, and in several of the larger
emporiums, showed that Western-style worries about the health hazards of
cigarette-smoking are making little impact in China, where growing affluence
and the impact of advertising are bringing with them a boom in the sale of
foreign brands.
Typical of smokers' reactions was that of a woman driver for a Beijing
company. 'The media like to tell you that smoking is harmful to your health,
but that's mostly just propaganda,' she declared.
At the Yaohan department store, a smart Japanese-owned emporium on the
city's main boulevard, a salesgirl at the cigarette counter said foreign
brands, at about USDollars 2 per pack, were outselling local products among
status-conscious smokers by a factor of two to one. 'By offering a Marlboro
to a friend or business associate you're flattering the other party,' she
said.
Interest among foreign companies in the potential of the China market is
entirely understandable given the numbers involved. According to a survey
conducted earlier this year by the State Statistical Bureau, 298m people
over the age of 15, or nearly 35 per cent of the total population, are
smokers. Put another way, the number of people who smoke in China, exceeds
the population of continental Europe, or that of the US.
For foreign tobacco companies intent on penetrating the China market,
however, life has not been easy. The Chinese have been reluctant to expose
their lucrative state tobacco monopoly to foreign competition. Besides
Philip Morris' agreement with China's state cigarette manufacturer, only two
other well-known foreign manufacturers - R J Reynolds and Rothmans - have
been permitted to establish a manufacturing foothold in the China market
through joint ventures. Philip Morris has not started production yet.
By and large the western cigarette conglomerates have seen their products
gain access to China by less conventional means. It has been estimated
informally that less than 1 per cent of foreign cigarettes on the market in
China have passed through customs. Legal imports are restrained by high
tariffs. In 1990, the the Worker's Daily estimated that smugglers had
brought 175m cartons into China. That figure is almost certainly much higher
now, as trade across China's porous borders has grown rapidly.
Marlboro and other brands, such as Kent, Dunhill, Winston, 555 and Camel,
are leaving little to chance in their efforts to gain market share in China.
From the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing motor rally later this month to Marlboro's
advertising blitz across the country, the tobacco giants are fighting hard
for the loyalty of China's legions of smokers. They have been enticed not
only by the size of the existing market but by expectations that pressures
for trade liberalisation will create further opportunities.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Man in the News: The reluctant diplomat - John Cahill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the staff of the Hilton Hotel in Taipei, the tall, slightly stooping
figure of Mr John Cahill is becoming a familiar spectacle. His present stay
there is his eighth this year. The company he chairs, British Aerospace, is
involved in a highly public struggle to tie down a deal with Taiwan on
making regional jets. The jobs of 3,000 workers at BAe's regional jet plant
at Woodford in the UK may hang on his success.
His qualifications for the task are a little uncertain. The talks in Taiwan
are deeply political, and Mr Cahill is not a political man. Until he took
over at BAe 18 months ago, at the age of 62, he had spent his working life
as a manufacturer with the conglomerate BTR. At the time, he freely
confessed his political inexperience. That side of things, he said, would be
handled by his chief executive, Mr Dick Evans. He now knows better.
His first trip to Taiwan six years ago involved nothing more controversial
than buying a plastics factory. But where he used to deal with small
businessmen, he now talks to national leaders. His ninth-floor executive
meeting room is guarded by black-suited Chinese women, who zealously shoo
away the local press corps and camera crews. He is accompanied by an
ever-changing cast of merchant bankers in chalk-striped, double-breasted
suits, discreet civil servants from the UK Department of Trade and Industry
and elusive corporate lawyers with their fax machines.
The experience has been salutary. A few months ago, Mr Cahill employed the
blunt impatience learnt in his BTR days. Now he is a model of restraint,
almost ambassadorial as he peers over rimless reading glasses perched on the
end of his nose.
The change has not been accomplished without pain. One very senior figure in
the Taiwanese establishment said of Mr Cahill's style this week that, 'given
that the deal is still under negotiation, if I were too frank it could have
a negative effect'.
One example of the more aggressive approach came over the summer. The deal,
jointly to manufacture a short-haul passenger jet, had suffered one of its
periodic setbacks, with both the bankers to the project and the Taiwanese
partners apparently getting cold feet. Mr Cahill fired off letters to
minister Mr Chiang Pin-kung, whose economic affairs department is
responsible for aerospace policy, with copies to Taiwan's president,
premier, central bank governor and other local luminaries.
One letter accused the Taiwanese partner, Taiwan Aerospace Corporation
(TAC), and the state-run bank heading the lending consortium of 'not
proceeding in good faith'. Another came close to threatening BAe's
withdrawal.
'That's not the way you do business here,' says one western consultant well
versed in negotiations with Taiwan's aerospace industry. 'This is not Japan.
You do not write to the top man. You deal with the small companies.'
The letters were leaked to the local press and seized upon by Taiwan's
opposition politicians, who suspect that the deal is uncommercial and
over-ambitious. The row has kept government ministers on the defensive since
then and still threatens to damage the ruling party, the Kuomintang, in next
month's regional elections.
As a result of yet another trip to Taipei at the end of August, Mr Cahill
managed to win the banks round. Pinning down TAC was another matter. Mr
Cahill had the jarring experience of seeing Mr Denny Ko, president of TAC
and the man with whom he had signed the original deal, excluded from the
most important meetings. By September, Mr Ko was no longer president, and
TAC's other top man, chairman Mr Earle Hou, also said he would step down.
Exasperated by the turmoil, BAe broke off talks in London last month.
To be fair to Mr Cahill, there are some in Taiwan who believe that he has
taken more than his share of the blame for the deal's tortuous progress.
'The problem is our problem, not Mr Cahill's problem,' said one official
yesterday. 'Civil aviation is new to us here. It needs co-ordination from
different departments.'
Another official, asked what he would do differently if the relationship
with BAe could be started afresh, said with a wry smile: 'We would be more
organised.'
Whatever his political shortcomings, Mr Cahill is a shrewd enough
businessman not to have all his eggs in one basket. BAe disclosed this week
it had started talks with Indonesia over possible collaboration in regional
aircraft. The company has also told London financial analysts that it could
keep its regional jet operation going in the UK for at least a year while it
looked for an alternative joint-venture partner.
Meanwhile, politicians on both sides have been anxious to distance
themselves from the affair. This month Mr Yang Shih-chien, the deputy
economics minister and effective sponsor of the venture, said he would quit
the TAC board. The Taiwan government said it would take no further direct
part in the talks. The UK government repeated that all the decisions would
be taken by BAe and TAC.
And yet this week Taiwanese ministers including Mr Yang met both Mr Cahill
and the visiting UK trade minister, Mr Richard Needham. The joint venture
was high on the agenda.
The explanation, said one Taiwanese government insider yesterday, is, once
more, the political nature of the deal. Between now and polling day on
November 29, ruling party politicians want to steer clear of any potentially
embarrassing developments.
'The government is still active but wants no publicity,' the insider said.
'Its motto is 'just do it, don't talk about it in public.' '
The politicians may have declared their intention to leave the business
decisions to BAe and TAC. But the reality is that aircraft manufacture is a
far more political business than running a plastics factory. For Mr Cahill,
the days of being a simple manufacturer are over for good.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Independents come up in fast lane: A look at the British
carmakers that shone at the Motor Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S small independent carmakers, which have been the focus of this
week's London Motor Show, were too busy seeking or taking orders on their
stands to really enjoy the limelight.
Mr Xavier Karcher, head of the Peugeot group's Citroen division, whose
background is in engineering, summed it up: 'It is the creativity . . .
amazing.'
People such as Mr Peter Wheeler, the chain-smoking accountant who owns
Blackpool-based TVR, were well aware of the media attention.
These independents' combined production is insignificant in motor industry
terms - perhaps 2,000 in a good year. But between them at the show they have
unveiled almost as many genuinely new cars as the volume manufacturers. They
include:
The AC Ace, a Pounds 50,000, Ford V8-engined two-seater just going into
production on an industrial estate forming part of the pre-war Brooklands
racing circuit in Surrey.
The TVR Cerbera, a 340-horsepower coupe for which Mr Wheeler reported 10
orders on the opening day alone.
A 200mph four-seater, the Storm, from Lister Cars, which has long historic
associations with Jaguar.
The R42, a mid-engined 'supercar' from GTD Developments, a small company
from Poole in Dorset, which first established a market niche through the
production of replica Ford GT 40 sports/racing cars.
The Marcos Le Mans GT, unveiled by Marcos Cars of Westbury in Wiltshire,
which has been in erratic, small-scale production of sports cars for more
than 30 years. A pair of the 430-horsepower Rover V8-engined cars will run
in the Le Mans 24-hour race next year, with road-going ver-sions made
available for sale.
The producers say their survival - and even development of new cars - in the
recession shows there is scope for the smallest players to find profitable
niches.
In some cases they have brought cars into production for a few hundred
thousand pounds or less, allowing profitability on output levels of a few
hundred, or even a few dozen, cars a year.
TVR, with an output of 880 two-seater sports cars last year, is the largest
such producer in the UK. AC, whose chairman Mr Brian Angliss last year
bought back a stake acquired by Ford in the company in 1986, expects to
produce 200 of the new Ace next year, and is otherwise best-known for the
Cobra model sold by Ford throughout north America in the 1960s.
Mr Wheeler says TVR will produce 950 cars this year - continuing several
years of sales growth - and that there is now firm evidence of consumer
confidence returning in the luxury sports car market.
'What's most interesting about the pattern of demand for our cars is that
more and more deliveries are taking place into the south-east,' he said.
'And that's the region which, we all know, was hardest hit when the
recession came in.'
This weekend Mr Wheeler was preparing to forsake the show for a day at the
Midlands Donington Park motor-racing circuit - and a publicity coup for TVR
to match that of the new car's launch. World champion Nigel Mansell will
race a TVR Tuscan, one of 20 similar cars in a championship organised by
TVR.
Rumours that Mansell will be paid several thousand pounds per lap completed
in the TVR are hopelessly wide of the mark, said Mr Wheeler. 'Nigel's
getting a couple of cups of coffee and a bun like the rest of us.'
TVR could be seen as the ultimate enthusiasts' sports car concern. Mr
Wheeler, who races himself, admits to styling cars 'on the back of fag
packets' - and with the help of his dog, Ned, who helped design the new
Cerbera by biting a chunk out of the prototype model. The hole now houses
the sidelights.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Clywd attacks shadow cabinet vote stitch-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS ANN CLWYD, who lost her job as Labour's national heritage spokeswoman
when she was voted out of the shadow cabinet, yesterday described the
election as a 'stitch-up'.
Her outburst over the vote, which resulted in the election of fewer female
members to Labour's frontbench team, came as the government sought to
exploit Labour's divisions.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, accused the Labour leader of
'bungling' the changes to his team.
Mrs Clwyd narrowly missed being re-elected to the shadow cabinet but unlike
Ms Harriet Harman, who scored fewer votes, failed to keep her job.
She warned she would 'take the lid off the manoeuvres and macho-machinations
within the parliamentary Labour party, the press and the lobby which robs
women of their proper representation in parliament'.
Sir Norman said: 'This week's game of musical chairs in the shadow cabinet
has left Labour looking more unelectable than ever. John Smith has shown
very clearly why he would be wholly unsuited to the office of prime
minister.' Mr Smith's cautious reshuffle has been greeted with dismay by
some shadow cabinet members, who had expected a more wide-ranging shake-up.
Sir Norman described the rule changes for electing the shadow cabinet, which
obliged MPs to choose at least four women with their 18 votes, as 'a
monument to political correctness'.
Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, said Mr Smith had botched the
reshuffle by keeping Ms Harriet Harman as shadow chief Treasury secretary in
spite of her failure in the election.
'His shadow chief secretary has kept her job - despite losing the confidence
of her colleagues,' said Mr Waldegrave.
The Labour front bench yesterday ignored the continuing row over the
election, preferring to renew its attack on government plans to impose value
added tax on fuel.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, pledged a national crusade against the
tax move.
He also attacked the possibility of VAT being imposed on newspapers and
books in next month's Budget - 'the first attacks on the Bible' - and said
Mr Kenneth Clarke would be the first chancellor to tax his own words.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Jaguar pulls out of GKN deal: Telford pressings plant faces
closure as production moves to Ford's Halewood factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, Ford's lossmaking luxury cars subsidiary, said yesterday it was
abandoning the joint venture it set up with GKN, the automotive components
group, to supply body pressings.
The move, involving the transfer of production to the Ford Halewood stamping
plant in Liverpool, is expected to lead to the closure of Venture Pressings,
the Telford-based company set up by the two groups at a cost of Pounds 40m
in 1988 and which employs about 200 people. Mr Keith Chambers, director of
Venture Pressings, said: 'The decision is a serious blow. As Jaguar is VPL's
sole customer it will ultimately lead to the closure of the plant.'
There is a possibility that some employees could be offered jobs at other
GKN group plants in the immediate area and which together employ about 2,000
people. However, all parties involved ruled out any prospect of finding
alternative work for the plant itself.
Jaguar said the economic benefits of going to Halewood, where Ford has
excess capacity in its pressings plant, were 'overwhelming'.
Its parent, Ford, is urgently concerned to find every means possible of
reducing costs at Jaguar, which has made losses totalling more than Pounds
500m over the past 4 1/2 years.
However, Ford made clear last night that the decision did not imply any
shortcomings in the efficiency or productivity of the Telford venture, which
has established an industry reputation as a model plant, with good
industrial relations, a flexible workforce and state-of-the-art equipment.
GKN Sankey, Jaguar's joint-venture partner at Venture Pressings, said it was
dismayed by the decision.
However, under the provisions of the shareholders' agreement in the 50-50
joint venture, GKN itself is protected from any financial losses arising
from closure.
The venture was set up following Jaguar's privatisation but before its
purchase by Ford. It has the capacity to produce pressings for 50,000
Jaguars a year but has been operating at only a little over half this level
as a result of the worldwide recession in luxury car markets. Ford's
Halewood pressings facility, now used for Escort body pressings, is also
running below capacity. Halewood is believed capable of meeting the demands
of both makes in the future.
The potential for expansion is understood to be such that Halewood would
also be capable of providing pressings for the XJ200, the smaller car Jaguar
intends to produce from 1998 and which is expected to lift its total output
to more than 100,000 units a year. A final decision on whether to produce
the XJ200 in the UK or North America is expected in about a year's time.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Proposed Scottish councils 'too small'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was warned yesterday that some of the new local authorities
it plans for Scotland are too small to be viable.
The claim will embarrass Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who is
now committed to a similar system of unitary authorities in England,
replacing the old two-tier structure of counties and districts,
Unitary authorities would lead to further centralisation, which would 'do a
disservice to democracy', according to Professor Arthur Midwinter, an expert
on local government at Strathclyde University, Glasgow.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England,
has said that he believes that many local people would prefer to retain the
status quo.
Prof Midwinter criticised the Scottish Office white paper which proposes
creating 28 unitary authorities to replace the two-tier system of nine
regions, three island councils and 53 districts. A bill is to be presented
in the new session of parliament.
He told a conference of local government officials that small authorities
would have difficulty providing all the services required, and bigger
neighbouring councils might be unwilling, for political reasons, to help
them out.
Prof Midwinter highlighted three proposed councils whose small size compared
with those of neighbouring areas has led to accusations that the
Conservative party is gerrymandering.
The three examples are Stirling, which would have 81,000 people compared
with the 195,000 people in adjoining Clackmannan and Falkirk; East
Renfrewshire, with 88,000 people compared with 265,000 in West Renfrewshire;
and Berwickshire and East Lothian, an area of 76,000 people to be carved out
of Lothian and Borders regions.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Recession-hit textile areas to get Pounds 2m aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AREAS hit by recession in the textile industry are to receive more than
Pounds 2m in aid from the European Commission, the government said
yesterday, writes Tim Burt.
The funds, of which the largest share will go to Yorkshire and Humberside,
form part of the Retex initiative, which encourages small businesses and
training schemes in regions where traditional textile production has
declined.
Under the scheme, the government has to commit Ecu5.6m (Pounds 4.4m) by the
end of the year to projects selected by officials from Whitehall, Brussels
and local authorities.
Yorkshire and Humberside receives Pounds 865,560; followed by the north-west
with Pounds 615,639; the east Midlands on Pounds 272,573; the north-east
with Pounds 202,515; and the west Midlands with Pounds 102,990.
Northern Ireland will receive Ecu13m from a different programme under the
Retex initiative between now and 1997.

writes.
Ms Abramsky has been editor of news and current affairs for BBC radio since
1987.
Mr Mike Lewis, head of sports and outside broadcasts for BBC radio, is to be
deputy controller.
The appointments coincide with the introduction of a new management
structure in BBC news and current affairs combining radio and television
resources.
Mr Peter Bell, now editor of television news programmes, will become
responsible for all news output. BBC Enterprises said yesterday that deals
worth Pounds 10m were negotiated during the media market at Cannes,
including the sale of Thatcher: The Downing Street Years.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Maximum Imro fine rises to Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMRO, the self-regulating body for the fund-management industry, has
substantially increased the fines that can be levied under its disciplinary
procedures.
The maximum fine which can be awarded against a member for any single charge
by its own disciplinary committee is to rise from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds
1m.
This contrasts with an alternative, more formal membership tribunal operated
by Imro which has no ceiling on fines.
The increase in fines under the informal disciplinary committee is part of a
wider process of reforming Imro's regulatory procedures.
The organisation is also considering giving greater publicity to findings
reached by the informal 'first-tier' disciplinary committees.
The decision to raise the fines was approved at a board meeting earlier this
week, and follows a wider restructuring of Imro after criticisms made
against it in the last two years.
The disciplinary committees comprise members of Imro's board, and have been
widely used in cases including that against Invesco-MIM, which was fined a
record total of Pounds 750,000 in June for a range of regulatory breaches in
connection with the Maxwell affair.
The more formal disciplinary procedure involves a hearing before an
independent membership tribunal. Only two of the organisation's members have
chosen this route since 1988, against about 30 using the informal route.
'All these moves are designed to make the disciplinary processes more speedy
and simple,' said Mr David Brewster, Imro's legal director.
Other changes over the next few months may include efforts to reduce
response times in inquiries.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Return of Heseltine the heavy hitter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'HE'S DEFINITELY taking things easier. Instead of a 9 1/2 -day week, he's
cut it down to six,' confided a colleague of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, who yesterday completed his first week back at work
since his heart attack in July.
After nearly four months of enforced leisure, during which he admits to
having contemplated retirement from politics, Mr Heseltine is back at his
desk.
In fact he put in about 3 1/2 days this week.
Looking slightly thinner and a bit older, he has been telling well-wishers
of all political persuasions that his doctor has given him a clean bill of
health.
Even so, he emphasises that his return to the stressful and unpredictable
world of Westminster will be carefully paced.
'I am not going to rush back in,' he insists.
Another colleague said: 'He really is fine. But no-one with any sense goes
back after a heart attack with all guns blazing.'
Mr Heseltine, who managed entirely to avoid the daily diet of red boxes
during convalescence on his Oxfordshire estate, appears happy that reforms
of the Department of Trade and Industry aimed at helping improve Britain's
industrial competitiveness were pursued in his absence.
Much of the responsibility for filling the gap fell to Mr Tim Sainsbury, a
member of his ministerial team.
But in the words of one DTI official: 'There are some things which need a
heavy hitter and it is good to have him back.'
The sentiment is shared by many MPs, who believe his heavyweight
contribution has been badly missed by a government in trouble.
With his planned return to the DTI temporarily postponed following a bad
bout of flu - inevitably giving rise to speculation that he was far from
fully recovered - Mr Heseltine briefly popped into his Victoria Street
offices on Monday.
On Tuesday he attended cabinet and in the afternoon held a meeting with DTI
officials to see how his department's competitiveness programme was
proceeding.
Wednesday saw an early morning radio interview, more meetings with officials
and lunch with a national newspaper before taking a frontbench seat to hear
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, make a statement on coal.
By Thursday he had attended a meeting of the EDX special cabinet committee,
which is charged with the task of maintaining public spending targets and
later in the day left London to address the Tyne and Wear chamber of
commerce.
Yesterday he was at home in his constituency.
Next week Mr Heseltine's diary includes a Commons debate on coal - Mr Eggar
is likely to lead - a Conservative party constituency dinner and a reception
in Birmingham.
He also intends to honour his commitment to address the Confederation of
British Industry conference in Harrogate next month.
Ahead of him are decisions on coal privatisation and the future of the Post
Office, a deregulation bill and plans for opening a national chain of
'business link' advice centres.
As for suggestions that Mr Heseltine's return to the DTI will be shortlived,
he says he is pledged to seeing through the changes in the DTI which will
help it bat for Britain.
After four months under temporary management, it looks like business as
usual at the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Injunction on 'Clockwork' clips lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL FOUR Television is to screen an arts documentary including clips
from the banned film A Clockwork Orange after a Court of Appeal decision to
lift an injunction preventing the programme being shown, John Mason writes.
The injunction had been won earlier this month by Time Warner, the film
producer and distributor, which claimed the use of the clips broke copyright
law.
However, three appeal court judges ruled yesterday that Warner had failed to
show Channel Four had infringed the 'fair dealing' provisions of the
Copyright Act 1988 which allows excerpts of films to be used for review
purposes without permission from the copyright owners.
The documentary is scheduled for next Tuesday's Without Walls arts
programme.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Newspaper staff victory overturned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX former employees at The European newspaper, who won a court fight over
wrongful dismissal two years ago, saw their victory overturned by the Court
of Appeal yesterday.
The six, who had been granted 'summary judgment' by the High Court in their
compensation claim against the paper's former owner, Mirror Group
Newspapers, were told they now faced a legal battle to establish their case.
The case turned on the question of who their employer was. If it was MGN,
they stood to recover full damages. However, if it was The European Ltd, a
privately owned Maxwell company, the money recoverable from its insolvency
assets would be less.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Businessman jailed for 4 years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN, whose obsession with antique toys led him to pull off a
Pounds 12m fraud, was jailed for four years yesterday at Southwark Crown
Court.
Mr Jeffrey Levitt pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraudulent trading and
evading VAT and import duty between August 1988 and May 1991.
His operation, which stretched from Japan to the US, was built on fraud and
'hoodwinking' the banks to give him credit, said Mr David Penry-Davey QC,
prosecuting.
Mr Stephen Solley QC, defending, told the court: 'Levitt's primary motive
was not financial gain. It was to be at the very centre of the toy antique
market.'

THE Church Society yesterday won permission to seek a High Court declaration
aimed at blocking moves to allow the ordination of women as Church of
England priests.
Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, indicated that
the court intends to give the society - the Church's most influential
evangelical body - leave to seek a judicial review.
The society plans to seek a declaration that members of the Ecclesiastical
Committee of both houses of parliament acted outside their powers in
deciding to back proposed legislation paving the way for women's ordination.

BRITISH Sky Broadcasting yesterday won an undertaking from the Irish-based
Satellite Decoder Systems to stop selling its pirate decoder cards in the
UK, John Mason writes.
The undertaking covers all sales and advertising of the cards in the UK and
also requires Mr David Lyons, who controls the company, to disclose the
identity of his supplier to the court within 10 days. Satellite Decoder
Systems made the agreement prior to a High Court hearing at which BSkyB was
seeking an injunction to prevent the marketing of the cards in the UK. BSkyB
said afterwards that it was 'delighted with the outcome'. Pearson, owner of
the FT, has a significant stake in BSkyB.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Branson plans no-profit bid for national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON, chairman of the Virgin Group, said yesterday he was
seriously considering applying for the licence to run the UK's national
lottery on a non-profitmaking basis, distributing all the proceeds to good
causes.
Mr Branson confirmed that he has a team working full-time on a possible
application and said he had the support of influential businessmen, although
he declined to name them.
'We are seriously looking at it and we think it should be run this way
(non-profitmaking)', Mr Branson said.
Mr Branson's comments came on the day that Mr Peter Brooke, national
heritage secretary, formally launched the lottery race following royal
assent for the National Lottery Bill.
'I believe that we are on the threshold of great things. A flutter for the
punter and a bonanza for good causes,' said Mr Brooke, who is taking a
conservative view of turnover by predicting revenues of Pounds 1.5bn a year.
Most specialists looking at international experience believe that a properly
run lottery in a country the size of the UK ought to be able to raise more
than Pounds 3bn a year.
Even at Pounds 1.5bn, prizes could total Pounds 14m a week with some
potential operators talking about a top prize of as much as Pounds 5m a
week, drawn on national television.
Mr Brooke yesterday appointed Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman of Abbey
National, the bank, as director-general of the Office of the National
Lottery. Mr Davis, who will invite tenders for running the lottery, license
each game and monitor the operation, will publish a draft licence soon.
Mr Davis said yesterday that the licences would probably run for between
five years and 10 years. The likeliest period will be about seven years.
He confirmed that non-profitmaking organisations would be able to apply for
the licence and would be treated the same as other applicants. The aim would
be to maximise the money raised for the five 'good causes' - the arts,
charities, sports, national heritage and a millennium fund.
Mr Branson, who first approached the Home Office with the idea of a national
lottery for good causes four years ago, envisages setting up a foundation.
He said he would decide within the next month whether to apply.
Mr Brooke said he hoped the first tickets would go on sale late next year or
early 1995 and Mr Davis said he hoped to award the licence to operate the
lottery by next spring.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Banks fear Pounds 500m home surety exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, STEWART DALBY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG FOUR clearing banks could face exposure of between Pounds 400m and
Pounds 500m each following a law lords ruling on Thursday that gives
partners who act as surety for borrowings greater protection against losing
their homes.
According to the Bank Action Group, a consumer pressure group, thousands of
cases that were awaiting the outcome of Mrs Bridget O'Brien's case against
Barclays Bank can now go ahead. The group, which is already handling 30
similar actions, said it had been 'flooded' with inquiries yesterday from
people in similar situations.
Five law lords ruled that Mrs O'Brien could set aside a charge over her home
in Slough, Berkshire, because her husband had lied about the extent of the
guarantee liability, and the bank had failed to explain the transaction to
her and to suggest she seek independent legal advice.
Ms Patricia Griffiths, the national co-ordinator of the group, said: 'I
personally feel this decision does not go far enough. But it is clear the
floodgates are now open.'
She said the group had been advised that the clearing banks could face
exposure of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m each.
Mr Eddy Weatherill, chief executive of the Independent Banking Advisory
Service, said it was already dealing with more than 50 cases that raised
issues similar to the O'Brien case. That number would increase as the lords'
decision became more widely known, he said.
But he added that the service was very worried about the growing number of
cases where there were allegations of undue influence or misrepresentation
by the bank.
The issue of bank honesty was now the fastest-growing area of customer
complaint, he said, and the service would be raising the issue at a meeting
with the Bank of England next Friday.
The banks yesterday rejected Mr Weatherill's assertion and emphasised that
they had procedures to protect the position of the guarantor who was not a
partner in the business being guaranteed.
They acknowledged, however, that there was a limit to the information that
could be disclosed to guarantors without the agreement of the borrowers,
since the bank had a duty of confidentiality to their customers.
The banks are reluctant to put a figure on their potential exposure to
O'Brien-type cases but insist that each case will be treated on its own
merits.
Both Barclays and National Westminster Bank, the biggest lenders to the
small-business sector, claim there is only a small number of cases in
dispute.

FT  23 OCT 93 / TV stations resist police moves to claim riot film
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE integrity and impartiality of the media will be undermined if
untransmitted television film of last month's Whitechapel riot in London is
handed over to police, a court heard yesterday.
Four television companies are opposing an application by the Crown
Prosecution Service for surrender of the footage.
The BBC, Independent Television News, London News Network and BSkyB - the
satellite television venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
has a substantial stake - argued through counsel at Southwark Crown Court
that the public interest would not be served by surrender of the material.
Ms Susanna Fisher, for the television companies, told the court: 'Although
we accept that it is in the public interest that material be produced so
that the guilty are convicted . . . we say there is a competing public
interest.'
The disturbances erupted during a vigil on September 10 by more than 300
demonstrators outside the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London,
where a Bengali teenager, who was attacked two days earlier by a gang of
white youths, was on life-support.
During the riot police were pelted with stones and other missiles. Ten
people were arrested and 25 police officers were injured.
Mr Jeremy Benson, for the Crown, told Judge Gerald Butler QC the police were
seeking an order for the material to be handed over to them under the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1989. Officers wanted to view footage which had
not been screened to see if it contained evidence to help in the prosecution
of those responsible.
The judge will give his ruling on Monday.

A restored Victorian horse tram running down Broad Street in Portsmouth
yesterday (left) was discovered in a Kent apple orchard in 1975, where it
was being used as a shed (above). It was then bought by London Transport,
which spent two years restoring it. The tram was originally supplied by the
John Stephenson Company of New York to the London Tramways Company in 1882
and operated in south London until 1905. Suitable tram tracks were found in
Portsmouth, where it ran some celebratory journeys yesterday before
returning to London and its final home at the London Transport Museum in

solicitors' property centre which handles 90 per cent of house sales in
Aberdeen to the restrictive practices court, seeking a declaration that it
operates a rule that works against the public interest.
Sir Bryan is also considering taking action against the solicitors' property
centre in Edinburgh, which handles 80 per cent of house sales in the city.
He is concerned about a rule which forbids solicitors who are members of the
Aberdeen centre from submitting particulars of homes if an estate agent is
advertising them elsewhere. He says this restricts competition and consumer
choice.
In many Scottish towns people sell their houses through a solicitor rather
than an estate agent. In Edinburgh, Aberdeen and elsewhere, solicitors have
set up solicitors' property centres in a main street where all properties
for sale are advertised.
The complaint against the Aberdeen and Edinburgh centres was made by made by
the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
If the restrictive practices court makes a declaration that the restriction
is against the public interest it will then decide whether to make an order
prohibiting it.
Mr George Clark, chairman of the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre, said
the centres were very much in the public interest and that without them
Scot-land would be dominated by half-a-dozen estate agents.
The 200 firms of soli-citors which own the Edinburgh centre are in active
competition with each other.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rail telecoms move is threat to union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE reorganisation of British Rail Telecommunications before its planned
privatisation threatens the only single-union deal established within BR.
Meanwhile RMT, the main rail union, has warned that splitting off the
telecommunications function from signalling could threaten safety.
RMT, which has no members inside BRT, said yesterday that it would be
pressing for recognition or for a new ballot on union recognition when more
than 1,500 RMT telecommunication workers join BRT before April next year.
When BRT was set up in 1990 to take advantage of the liberalisation of the
telecommunications industry it was given the freedom to establish its own
industrial relations machinery. It decided to reject BR's multi-union
culture and ran a ballot between three unions which was won by the TSSA.
BRT at present employs about 650 people but over the next few months this
will rise to 2,700 as it absorbs a large number of operational telecoms
staff from BR, most of whom are RMT members.
BRT managers accept that they will have to review the situation after the
occupational structure of the company changes but they may want to retain
the single union recognition which could be attractive to potential buyers.
RMT said yesterday the changes could pose a safety hazard. Signalling and
telecommunications functions were often carried in the same cables and could
affect each other. 'If the telecom staff are going to come from a
non-railway background with no knowledge of signalling it is potentially
very dangerous,' said an RMT official. Telecoms staff had recently prevented
a disaster when a signalling system broke down. 'If telecoms staff are
recruited from outside that will no longer happen.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / Computer confidence 'growing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE is growing among suppliers of computers and software for UK
manufacturing industry after three years of reduced spending.
Exhibitors at this week's Computers in Manufacturing Show at Birmingham's
National Exhibition Centre said yesterday they were looking forward to
increased orders, and believe the constraints imposed on spending by finance
directors are being relaxed.
'It was definitely the best show for four years,' said Mr Patrick Cockell,
director of Fourth Shift, the Crawley-based supplier of software and
services.
Mr Cockell said he had felt the three-day show would be a good test of
whether the downturn in spending had ended. 'Three years of pent-up demand
are coming to the surface,' he added.
Ms Sara McKinnon, marketing manager for Bracknell-based Parametric
Technology (UK), said: 'People were not rushing up wanting to spend money
straightaway, but at least they were building spending into next year's
plans. That was not happening last year.'
Parametric, which along with Fourth Shift and most of the industry is
US-owned, is a supplier of Cadcam (computer-aided design and manufacturing)
software.
The increased optimism was underlined by attendance figures for the show -
up 56 per cent from last year at 10,882, said Mr Andy Center, the show's
marketing director.
A survey released at the show by Benchmark Research, a market-research
company, predicts that spending by UK manufacturers will rise to Pounds
1.41bn in the 12 months from this summer, up Pounds 33m from Pounds 1.37bn
in 1992-93.
The latest figure is still a long way short of the Pounds 1.75bn spent in
1989-90. But Mr Ian Parkes, Benchmark's managing director, said that prices
for information technology had dropped sharply, and the number of UK
manufacturing sites had fallen by 9 per cent since 1989.
The figures show that manufacturers' spending on computers has weathered the
recession better than other areas of capital equipment such as machine
tools.
The survey discloses clear opportunities for suppliers to expand the
industrial IT market, but suggests vendors could speed up the process by
improving their understanding of customers' businesses.
The Benchmark figures are for computers, software and services used in
manufac-turing applications, and exclude purely office-based spending such
as word processors.

FT  23 OCT 93 / UN chief visits Mogadishu and Baidoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali, the UN secretary general, sought to retrieve the
diplomatic initiative on Somalia yesterday with unannounced visits to the
towns of Baidoa and Mogadishu.
The secretary-general insisted on going against the advice of senior UN and
US officials, who feared his presence might fuel unrest.
It did. In Mogadishu, supporters of Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the rebel
warlord, greeted the secretary general's arrival with burning barricades and
well-organised anti-UN demonstrations.
Mr Boutrous-Ghali did not leave the airport, where he remained for just two
hours. During his last visit to Mogadishu in January, he was pelted with
stones and abused by hostile crowds.
'With the ceasefire in Mogadishu barely two weeks old, we thought the
secretary general was taking unnecessary risks,' a western diplomat in the
Somali capital said.
But Mr Boutrous-Ghali clearly felt he had to re-establish his authority over
the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) following the success of Mr Robert
Oakley, US special envoy, in securing release of an American pilot and a
Nigerian peacekeeper last week.
The UN military and civilian chiefs in Somalia, Gen Cevik Bir and Admiral
Jonathan Howe, met Mr Boutrous-Ghali in Baidoa, where the UN is well-liked.
Baidoa, known as the 'city of death,' has recovered from starvation and
civil war thanks to western charities and UN agencies.
Back in Nairobi, the secretary general said he had met UN generals in
Somalia to discuss the future of the peacekeeping operation after the
departure of US, French and Belgian troops due in the next six months. Mr
Boutrous-Ghali said he hoped Arab and African states would volunteer extra
troops and funds.
Some UN officials, however, fear UNOSOM will fall apart without logistical
support of the 5,000-strong US contingent.
Mr Boutrous-Ghali insisted that the UN Security Council had not lifted the
arrest warrant against Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the slaying of 24
Pakistani peacekeepers in June. However, he said the UN was willing to find
a commission of inquiry that was acceptable to the fugitive general.
He did not rule out further military sorties with the aim of capturing Gen
Aideed. The UN, he said, was keeping all its options open.
Mr Boutrous-Ghali said peace prevailed over 90 per cent of Somalia, hailing
this as a success for the UN.
As for Gen Aideed's defiance, he said the UN could not impose peace 'if
there is no political will among the protagonists of the conflict.'
Mr Boutrous-Ghali is trying to organise a Somali reconciliation conference
with the help of Eritrea and Ethiopia.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Egypt braced for big drop in tourism
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S travel trade is braced for another disastrous winter season, with
the latest tourism ministry figures showing a 31 per cent fall in tourist
nights for the first eight months of 1993 and hoteliers reporting occupancy
rates limping along at 20 per cent in the country's traditional Nile
resorts.
Ministry figures show the number of European visitors fell 25 per cent
between January and August 1993 against the same period last year, with
total arrivals down 20 per cent at 1.7m over the period.
Worse, hotel managers and booking agencies report no pick-up as the peak
winter season for European visitors begins. 'The winter's already over for
us,' said the manager of one five-star Cairo hotel, which has forward
bookings only for 20 per cent of the rooms over the next fortnight.
The continued slump in one of Egypt's main foreign exchange earning
industries - it culled an officially estimated Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in
1991/92 - is blamed on the effect of Islamic extremist attacks on tourist
targets.
These have abated significantly in the past four months, mainly because of
intensified security operations. But officials in the industry say the real
effect of these attacks will be felt this year, since many international
travel agencies dropped Egyptian packages from this season's brochures.
Packages to Cairo and the main Nile resorts in Upper Egypt, Aswan and Luxor
have borne the brunt. The Hilton group reports that occupancy in Upper Egypt
hotels is just 20 per cent, while it is operating just one of its three Nile
cruisers. Individual rates on Nile cruises have been halved as a result to
around Dollars 400 for a week's cruise.
'We haven't even created group rates for the winter season, because we don't
get groups any more,' said leading cruise operator bleakly.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Israel to ease conditions for Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday announced it was easing a seven-month closure order in the
occupied territories in an effort to bolster support among Palestinians for
its autonomy accord with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
However, the move did little to dispel the widespread Palestinian grief and
shock over Thursday's assassination in Gaza of a leading member of the PLO,
Mr Assad Saftawi.
Israel's police minister, Moshe Shahal, announced yesterday that from next
week all Palestinian women, men over 40 and children under 16 will be
allowed to cross from the occupied territories into sovereign Israel.
Doctors and Jerusalem city council employees will also be allowed in, he
said.
But despite requests from PLO peace negotiator Faisal Husseini for a
complete lifting of the closure order, most Palestinian men will still be
barred from entering Israel.
The ban was issued after a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers and
civilians last March, and Mr Shahal explained that it could not be
completely rescinded because of continuing 'security concerns.'
The easing of restrictions, combined with Thursday's agreement on a phased
release of thousands of Palestinian security prisoners, were described by
Israeli officials as 'goodwill gestures' in advance of next spring's
scheduled start of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho
areas.
But the gestures have been overshadowed by the death of Mr Saftawi, whose
funeral in Gaza yesterday attracted a crowd of mourners estimated at 15,000.
A lifelong friend of PLO leader Yassir Arafat, Mr Saftawi was arguably the
most prominent loyalist in the Gaza Strip of Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction which dominates the PLO.
But while Mr Sami Assaya, the official in charge of Fatah's Gaza offices,
blamed Israelis or Palestinian collaborators for the killing, Palestinian
sources and Israeli press reports yesterday insisted that Mr Saftawi was the
victim of internal Fatah rivalries.
In Paris yesterday Mr Arafat warmly thanked France for its political and
financial support for Palestinian self-rule, saying Paris would have
privileged relations with 'our new state.'
On the second day of an official visit, Mr Arafat met parliamentary leaders
in what he called their 'temple of democracy' and pledged that the
Palestinians would follow French revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality
and fraternity.

FT  23 OCT 93 / BAe and Taiwan end talks without agreement

TALKS between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) over
a long-delayed joint venture to build regional jet aircraft broke up
yesterday little nearer resolution.
Both sides said the talks had been constructive and that they would discuss
them at board meetings. They would not commit themselves to holding any
further face-to-face discussions.
Failure to secure the venture, called Avro, would be a blow to BAe's plans
to improve its performance. The regional jet business loses money and it has
not made a full-year pre-tax profit since 1990.
Taiwan's government also wants the deal to go ahead as part of a policy to
bring the island's engineering industries into the civil aviation sector.
But the proposals to build BAe's range of RJ regional jets in Taiwan in
return for a cash injection have hit opposition from politicians, bankers
and industrialists, who argue that they are uncommercial and too ambitious.
The centrepiece of yesterday's meeting was the TAC demand that BAe give a
legally-binding commitment to the development of a new generation of
aircraft, called the RJX. Without it, Avro would not have a product to take
it into the next decade, argues TAC. The government, which is TAC's biggest
shareholder with a 19 per cent stake, supports this view.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, can point to one partial success during this
week's visit. Yesterday they were able for the first time to present their
case directly to several of the most influential members of TAC's board of
directors.
Last week, BAe said that one of its aims was to clarify who was in TAC's
negotiating team; the man who in January 1993 signed the original deal to
create Avro, Mr Denny Ko, stepped down from his post of company president
last month and Mr Earle Hou, the chairman, has also said he wants to leave.
Mr Hou said yesterday the two companies had 'a mutual understanding' on the
key issues of technology transfer and the specifications for a proposed
advanced two-engine passenger jet. But he said he 'had no comment' on
whether BAe had agreed to make a legal commitment to co-develop the advanced
RJX with TAC.
Reuter adds from Jakarta: Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister Jusuf
Habibie said yesterday that the country's state-run aerospace company IPTN
was in the final stages of talks with BAe on plans to co-operate in aircraft
marketing.

A MEASURE of economic peace returned to South Africa yesterday when
breakthroughs were achieved on two lingering disputes over cellular
telephone licences and a petrol price rise.
Threats by the African National Congress to nationalise the cellular
telephone industry and by the trade unions to implement a mass action
programme to resist a petrol price rise had done much to sour the optimism
following the lifting of economic sanctions.
Yesterday, however, a joint statement from the ANC and government said
Vodacom and Mobile Telephone Networks, the two companies issued with
licences to operate cellular networks, could proceed 'as soon as possible'
with the establishment of their networks. The basis for the rapprochement
was that the ANC backed away from its threats to nationalise the operators
in exchange for the two companies agreeing to increase black participation.
At the same time the government yesterday announced that the petrol price
would be dropped by two cents a litre from October 30. This decrease follows
widespread protest against the 7 cents a litre hike announced on September
15.
When, two weeks ago, the government refused to accept advice from the
National Economic Forum (NEF), where business, labour and government are
represented, to put the price rise on hold, trade unions and taxi-drivers
threatened mass action.
Cosatu, South Africa's largest union grouping, welcomed the announcement,
but said it still wanted the full 7 cents rolled back. It still has to
decide on whether to pursue any action.
The NEF has urged that the whole structure of the liquid fuel industry,
including pricing, needs urgently to be reviewed.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Coup leaders in Burundi set up new committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARMY coup leaders who ended Burundi's fledgling democracy have set up a
National Salvation Committee headed by a former interior minister and
declared a state of emergency, Reuter reports.
State-run radio Burundi, monitored by Reuters in neighbouring Rwanda on
Friday, said the committee had elected civilian Francois Ngeze as head of
state. The committee would draw its membership from the armed forces,
political parties, human rights groups and clerics.
Mr Ngeze, from the majority Hutu tribe, was interior minister in the
government of military ruler Pierre Buyoya, defeated by President Melchior
Ndadaye in Burundi's first multi-party elections in June.
Paratroopers ousted Mr Ndadaye on Thursday, raising fears of a new ethnic
bloodbath in the central African state of 5.6m people where the Tutsi
minority have ruled the majority Hutu for centuries.
'There is a big danger of the Hutu rising up against the army and against
civilian Tutsis. This could lead to unprecedented levels of violence,
turmoil in the country,' a western diplomat in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi,
said.
State radio in Rwanda, where an internationally-brokered peace deal offers
hope of easing hostility between the two tribes, said Mr Ndadaye may have
been killed.
Radio Burundi returned to the air at 8pm on Thursday and said said all
borders, the airport and port were closed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, said yesterday the prospect of
interest rate rises in Australia had been eliminated, now that the federal
budget had passed through the Senate, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
An amended budget was formally approved on Thursday after two months of
wrangling between the Opposition, the two minority parties who hold the
balance of power in the Senate, and the government.
The uncertainty surrounding the budget's progress had previously unnerved
the Australian dollar, and led the Reserve Bank governor to warn that
interest rates might have to rise in support.
Mr Dawkins' remarks came as the treasury, in its latest quarterly bulletin,
said the Australian economy was continuing to expand at a 'moderate pace.'
However, the authorities acknowledged that business investment has yet to
show any signs of picking up.
The June quarter saw 'continued growth in private consumption, as well as
strong contribution from the public sector,' the treasury said. More
recently, continued strength in housing indicators has suggested the housing
cycle may not have run its course, although the industry anticipates a
downturn to start in 1993/94, it added.
The treasury also noted the current account on the balance of payments had
improved marginally in the last three months, and that price and wage
pressures remained low. But it conceded that business investment remained
lacklustre, despite the strong upturn in corporate profitability and low
level of interest rates.

A COMMONWEALTH ministerial mission will visit Paris, Washington, London and

positively and flexibly to reach final agreement', said a statement issued
by heads of government at the end of day two of their five-day summit.
The Uruguay round has emerged as the main issue, with Mr Paul Keating, the
Australian prime minister and Mr John Major, his British counterpart,
playing leading roles.
Both men have argued that the fact that the Commonwealth should have a
special voice in trade negotiations since it includes members of the Cairns
group and countries with francophone affiliations such as Mauritius and
Canada, as well as straddling the developed and developing world.
'After seven years of effort, now is the time to secure the benefits of a
successful Round package,' said the statement. December 15, 1993 must be
seen as the final deadline.
It went on to call on the US, Canada, the EC and Japan - the so-called Quad
countries, which agreed on a tariff reduction package in Tokyo last July -
to 'build urgently on the commitments they made, to secure a substantial
market access package in which all can participate'.
It continued: 'Given the importance of agriculture to both developing and
developed countries, we emphasise the need for an outcome which liberalises
market access and reduces domestic support and export subsidies in
accordance with the Draft Final Act, as modified by the Blair House Accord.'
Earlier in the day Mr Keating had resumed his campaign for action by the
Commonwealth. With a disregard for convention, Mr Keating has made the
running during the first 48 hours of the five-day conference of Commonwealth
heads of government.
In doing so he has taken up the role of champion of developing country
interests, and upstaged the British prime minister, Mr John Major.
Although Mr Major has himself made a strong plea for an early agreement, and
spoken forcefully on the need for rapid implementation of Trinidad terms for
debt relief, he has not had the same impact on the 50-member association, or
enjoyed the same publicity. At a press conference last night, Mr Major said
'It is not just an economic and political question. I think there is a moral
imperative to get an agreement.'
Yesterday Mr Keating followed up his implicit attack on France, made in his
speech at Thursday's public opening.
Speaking during a closed door session yesterday, but taking care to ensure
wide and early distribution of his address, Mr Keating told delegates: 'It
is time for the Commonwealth to say clearly to the world that the Uruguay
round must be concluded this year. We have an opportunity to put the
Commonwealth's name to a separate statement calling on all the participants
in the negotiations to show good faith and stop using their self-interested
concerns as an excuse for a delay.'
Earlier in the day Mr Keating had what his officials described as a friendly
meeting with Queen Elizabeth. Mr Keating has been at pains to reassure
fellow leaders that Australia's intended move to republican status would not
weaken Commonwealth ties.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, newly re-elected prime minister of Pakistan, arrived in
Cyprus in time to take part in yesterday's dicussions.

At least 16 people were killed in separate incidents when Indian security
forces opened fire to break up demonstrations against an army siege of
Kashmir's holiest mosque on the Moslem sabbath yesterday, Reuter and Shiraz
Sidhva report from Srinagar.
A police statement said four died in a clash between security forces and
protesters in Fatha Kadal in the old quarter of Srinagar, capital of Jammu
and Kashmir state.
Another two died in a separate clash in Srinagar.
The statement said another 10 people died in violence involving
demonstrators and security forces in Bijbehara town of Anantnag district,
police added. Witnesses put the number of injured at between 150 and 200 in
Bijbehara.
Srinagar appeared to have calmed down towards evening, with armed soldiers
and paramilitary police digging to maintain the siege on Hazratbal shrine
where at least 50 militants and 150 civilians have been trapped since
midnight, last Friday.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Kashmiri conflict destroys a 'paradise': Why prospects for a
peaceful settlement appear more remote than ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE siege of the Hazratbal mosque, the holiest Moslem shrine in Kashmir in
northern India, is the result of four years of violence and four decades of
political dispute.
Neither the separatists hiding inside the white marble buildings nor the
Indian troops surrounding them are in any mood to compromise. The militants,
who seized the shrine a week ago, want to walk free with their heads held
high. The authorities want surrender. There seems little scope for a
negotiated settlement.
What is true for the siege, seems tragically true for Kashmir as a whole:
the uprising which started in late 1989 and which the security forces have
tried to suppress with brutal force has almost killed hopes for a peaceful
resolution of south Asia's most serious conflict.
The violence is prompting the international community to look at Kashmir
with renewed urgency, out of concern for the fighting and for the damage
done to relations between India and neighbouring Pakistan.
Much of Kashmir today is in the grip of a military-style occupation by at
least 150,000 Indian soldiers and paramilitary troops, who have replaced the
local Kashmiri police in front-line security duties.
A mainly-Moslem population of 8m is ruled by a Hindu-dominated
administration. Civilian officials go about their work under armed guard.
In Srinagar, the capital, and in other towns, there are sand-bagged bunkers
at strategic points. Barbed wire is as common on the roadside as Kashmir's
famous wild flowers.
Wooden houseboats which until the late 1980s took thousands of visitors
across Kashmir's limpid green lakes are now rotting at their moorings. Once
a Mogul poet wrote: 'If there is paradise on earth, it is here, it is here.'
If he came today, he might think himself in hell.
Destruction is everywhere: Sringar's Lal Chowk, the main market, is scarred
by the blackened ruins of buildings set alight during disturbances earlier
this year - by the security forces, according to the residents who fled
their homes in terror. Elsewhere are the remains of a 200-year-old mansion,
burnt down by militants. It was once meant to be converted into a museum;
now it stands as a memorial to violence.
The human tragedy is even worse. According to police figures, some 7,500
people have been killed since the start of 1990, including 635 members of
the security forces.
Militants put the Kashmiri death toll, including insurgents and civilians,
at 20,000. The police allege militants spread terror by murder, kidnapping,
robbery, extortion and rape. They also kill each other in bloody inter-group
conflicts.
The record of the security forces is also violent: international human
rights groups have documented scores of cases of brutality, including
killing suspects on arrest and in custody, rape and torture.
Just this week, Mr Mukhar Ahmed, a 25-year-old Kashmiri journalist, was
arrested and interrogated for 13 hours. Trembling with fear, he showed marks
on his ears where he said he was given electric shocks and bruises on the
soles of his feet where he said he was beaten. His face was pale with pain;
his eyes black and sunken.
The Kashmir dispute began with the bloody partition of India in 1947, when
Kashmiri hopes for independence were ignored as Pakistan and India divided
the territory.
In 1949, the two countries agreed with the United Nations that the status of
Kashmir should be determined by a plebiscite - but it has never been held.
In 1972, India and Pakistan signed an agreement in the resort town of Shimla
to the effect that Kashmir was a bilateral issue - so third parties,
including Kashmiris and UN officials, no longer had a say. Indian officials
argue the time for plebiscites is past and Indian-held Kashmir is 'an
integral part of India.' Pakistan describes Indian-held Kashmir as disputed
territory, which it claims for itself.
Just as government attitudes have hardened so have the views of Kashmiris.
As a vegetable trader in Srinagar says: 'We want the bloody Indians out.
Once we could have lived with them. But now it is too late.' Mr Mahmood
Rahman, a senior official of the local state government, admits that 'the
alienation of Kashmiris is getting worse'.
Indian officials blame Pakistan for fomenting militancy by sending money,
arms and trained terrorists. But the roots of insurgency lie much deeper -
principally in the fact that this isolated mountain land has been
independent for long periods of time and, in common with other peoples
united by history and culture, Kashmiris now want to assert their
independence.
Most want to form a new state, though a significant minority, including some
powerful Pakistan-backed militant groups, would prefer to acceed to
Pakistan.
Nationalist feelings has been heightened by religious differences: the
global rise of Islamic militancy has given courage to Kashmiri insurgents
and eroded Kashmir's tradition of Hindu-Moslem tolerance.
Over the years, Delhi has been caught between promoting democratic politics
in Kashmir and suppressing anti-Indian political activity. The result is
that about half urban Kashmiri youths are unemployed and so are fertile
ground for militancy.
Kashmiri political leaders take heart from recent global political changes.
'The old order is crumbling. Like the Soviet Union broke up, India may also
break up,' says Professor Abdul Gani, a representative of the All Party
Freedom Conference, a newly-formed umbrella organisation of Kashmiri
political groups.
Mr Gani suggests putting Kashmir (including Pakistani-held territory) under
UN administration for five years followed by a plebiscite.
For Mr Rahman, the state government official, such suggestions are anathema.
'These people want to go back to 1947. We cannot go back on history.'

<TEXT>
THE latest clear signal that Japan's system of labour relations is under
review came yesterday as Nissan, the country's second largest car maker,
said it would introduce a salary system for some of its managers that would
lay greater emphasis on achievement than on length of service.
Beginning in July next year, Nissan plans to abolish the basic pay portion
which is determined by length of employment and increase the proportion of
achievement-based pay in salaries paid to some managers. The move, which
reflects growing disenchantment among Japanese companies with the
traditional seniority-based pay system, is expected to introduce significant
differences in individual pay levels and will affect about 2,900 managers.
Nissan's salary system already comes in two parts - a basic pay portion,
which changes according to the number of years an employee has been with the
company, and an achievement-based pay portion. But in reality the salary of
employees is determined largely by seniority, which in turn is generally
based on length of employment. Under the new system, however, greater weight
will be laid on factors such as the results of work done and the attainment
of goals in determining individual pay levels.

FT  23 OCT 93 / US and Japan post no progress in trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan concluded two weeks of trade negotiations yesterday,
reporting little progress in bridging their principal differences.
While officials from both sides described the talks as useful and
constructive, Japanese officials noted that some of the proposals made by
the US to open Japan's market to foreign goods involved actions that were
not within the authority of the Japanese government.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice-minister for international affairs at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, emphasised that setting
numerical targets for imports to Japan would run counter to the Japanese
government's attempts to deregulate the country's markets.
The US appeared to be adopting a less combative approach in trying to open
Japan's markets.
Instead, Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, took the
moral high ground by pointing out that the US was only trying to persuade
Japan that it had a responsibility to move in step with other countries of
its stature, in terms of foreign direct investment, import penetration and
market transparency 'in order to promote global growth and to revitalise its
domestic economy.'
Ms Barshefsky underlined that the US was not demanding anything of Japan but
was trying to argue that 'as the world's second largest economy, and perhaps
the world's most pre-eminent economy, Japan should move in line much more'
in those respects, with other industrialised countries. To that end, the US
had presented publicly available data on the foreign penetration of the
public procurement markets for telecommunications and insurance in G7
countries.
According to that data, foreign direct investment in Japan was only 0.7 per
cent compared with 38.5 per cent for the EC and 28.6 per cent for the US. In
the public procurement market for telecommunications equipment and services,
foreign penetration was only 5 per cent in Japan, compared with a 25 per
cent average in the other G7 countries.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, repeated his call on Japan to
accept tariffication of its rice market and said that if the Uruguay Round
failed, Japan, the EC and the US would carry the primary responsibility.

The EC yesterday warned the US and Japan that the offer on market access for
industrial products it put forward this week within the Uruguay Round world
trade reform talks is conditional on similar offers from them.
'There has to be an equivalent response from our partners,' a senior EC Gatt
negotiator said, insisting that the US in particular has much further to
move on reducing 'peak tariffs' - or those above 15 per cent - by the 50 per
cent agreed at last July's summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Another Commission official said the EC offer was 'a genuine attempt to
unblock the market negotiations at this very late stage,' as the December 15
deadline for concluding the Round looms. It was not, he said, 'a
finger-pointing exercise.'
Nevertheless, the senior EC negotiator said the Community had 101 'peak
tariffs,' against 663 for the US, 457 for Japan, and 918 for Canada.
Although he acknowledged that 'the Americans have very high peaks in some
sectors and no tariffs at all in others,' he underlined that in the US, 312
of these tariffs were over 20 per cent (against 11 in the EC), covering
Ecu17bn (Pounds 13.19bn) of imports (against Ecu1.8bn in the EC.
A senior US official said the US had offered to cut 53 per cent of its peak
tariffs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no sign of an imminent Japanese economic recovery, but the grounds
for an upturn are being laid, the Japanese central bank said yesterday.
The Bank of Japan's assessment, in its latest quarterly review, coincides
with growing signs that the government will cut income tax to try to
stimulate sluggish consumption.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is planning to ask his coalition
partners to agree to a Y5,000bn (Pounds 31,250m) tax cut, to take effect
next April, according to widely leaked reports to the press. It would be
financed by stop-gap government bonds, until April 1995, when consumption
tax would be increased from 3 per cent to possibly 7 per cent.
Mr Hosokawa is awaiting proposals from a panel on tax reform, due on
November 16, before drawing up a bill to be tabled in parliament early next
year, according to the reports. Government officials would not comment, but
a tax cut is already reflected in equity prices, say stock market observers.
Yesterday's assessment provides further evidence that three government
spending packages and seven cuts in the official discount rate over the past
two years have failed to stimulate the economy.
Public sector investment and private house building is growing, but this is
not enough to make up for the weakness in corporate investment and consumer
consumption, according to the survey.
The main uncertainties the bank sees ahead are the impact of the yen's rise
on company profits and business sentiment; the influence of the weak job
market on consumer consumption; and balance sheet adjustments by banks and
other lending institutions as they dispose of bad loans.
Commercial bank lending continues to be slow, despite record low interest
rates. This is partly because of slack corporate demand for credit and
cautious lending by banks. More companies are turning to the capital markets
and finance corporations have increased lending, said the bank. Money
supply, M2 plus certificates of deposits, rose by 1.8 per cent in the second
and third quarters and is expected to rise by 2 per cent for the year.

DENMARK'S central bank cut its official discount rate to 7.25 from 7.75 per
cent yesterday and its other key short-term interest rates from 8.5 to 8.0
per cent following the Bundesbank's cut on Thursday.
This was Denmark's fourth cut in the discount rate since late July, when
interest rates were raised to protect the Krone from speculation prior to
the partial suspension of the exchange rate mechanism. The Danish currency
rose after the cut, lifting from the previous close of DKr4.0255 against the
D-Mark to DKr4.0120.
Mr Henning Christophersen, Denmark's EC budget commissioner, said interest
rates in Denmark, where inflation is running at just over 1 per cent, remain
high and continue to dampen investnment. There was a need for a further
reduction in rates, he said.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Spain, which had already lowered its benchmark
intervention rate by half a percentage point last week, yesterday surprised
the markets with a further 25 basis points cut that brought the rate down to
9.25 per cent.
The bank said the favourable domestic economic circumstances that had
prompted last week's cuts continued in place and allowed the authorities to
shadow lowered rates elsewhere in Europe.
Ireland yesterday also cut its key short term facility rate - the rate at
which it lends money to the commercial banks - by 0.5 per cent to a new
level of 7 per cent.
Dublin economists said the development was unlikely to lead to early cuts in
Irish retail bank or mortgage interest rates.

PRODUCER prices in west Germany fell sharply last month, reinforcing signs

Down 0.2 per cent on August, the September producer price index was 0.5 per

yesterday.
The office pointed to a continuing trend: the August index was down 0.3 per
cent year-on-year, and the July figure was 0.2 per cent lower, it said.
There were no price increases worth mentioning, it added, while some
products were markedly cheaper than a year ago. The price of electrolytic
copper was down 8.3 per cent, while reinforcing steel matting for the
building industry was almost 5 per cent cheaper.

The resignation marks a further deterioration in relations between the

failing to control Italy's intelligence services.
Gen Canino's action was prompted by the dismissal on Tuesday of General

STRIKING Air France workers sprayed firehoses (see above), smashed vehicles
and battled with police at Orly, the main domestic airport in Paris,
yesterday, in protest at planned cuts in bonuses and jobs, reports David
Buchan from Paris.
After a morning of violence strike leaders opened talks at the ministry of
transport, but there was no word of what progress had been made, if any.
Aeroports de Paris, which runs Orly and the Charles de Gaulle international
airport, said that by the early afternoon flights were back to normal for
all airlines except Air France, and the runways and roads in and around the
two airports were clear. Continued calm in the industry largely depended on
the outcome of the talks at the transport ministry, officials said.
Earlier some 3,000 strikers had attempted, in their fourth day of industrial
action, to march out on to Orly's runways, but had eventually been stopped
by French police using teargas. The strikers had caused a considerable

Mr Marc Blondel, leader of one of the two striking unions, had sent an
appeal to President Mitterrand to intervene.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Russia may restrict aluminium exports

<TEXT>
RUSSIA may temporarily restrict its aluminium exports in an effort to stop
the European Community from taking tougher action against what the EC
considers 'unfair competition.'
Mr Maxim Medvedko, a senior official at the foreign trade ministry, said
yesterday a conference of officials from major producing countries in Moscow
this week had agreed to continue consultations next month or early December.
But he said that while a multilateral solution could take months to
finalise, Russian and European Commission officials would meet in Brussels
next week before EC ministers decided whether to extend the European
Commission's temporary restrictions on imports of Russian aluminium.
If the EC ministers failed to restore free trade in aluminium, Russia might
agree to some self-limitation in return for generous access to EC markets in
what Mr Medvedko said would be 'a very difficult compromise'.
Meanwhile, Interfax news agency reported that a tender scheduled for
November 15 would offer 20 per cent of a major aluminium plant, at Irkutsk
in eastern Siberia, to western and Russian investors.

MR FIKRET ABDIC, a local Moslem leader in Bosnia's northwest, yesterday
signed a peace agreement with Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic in an
attempt to undermine Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia.
In Belgrade for the first time since war erupted 18 months ago, Mr Abdic and
his one-time rival Mr Karadzic signed a joint declaration which Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic said 'brought peace to half of former
Bosnia-Hercegovina' and could be a step towards the endorsement of the
Geneva partition plan.
Mr Abdic yesterday celebrated the 'recognition' of Western Bosnia, even
though he controls just one quarter of the self-proclaimed autonomous
region. Bosnian Government forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic hold most of the
region, surrounded by Serb rebels in Croatia and Bosnia.
Mr Abdic appears to be holding out hope that yesterday's signing will pave
the way or military support from his Serb neighbours.
Mr Mate Boban, head of the Croat statelet in Bosnia, on Thursday signed a
similar agreement in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, with Mr Abdic.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Bloc Quebecois stirs fresh fears: Pro-independence party
could become main opposition
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S latest opinion polls suggest that the Bloc Quebecois, whose main
purpose is to pull Quebec out of Canada, could become the biggest opposition
party in parliament after next Monday's general election.
Two polls published yesterday, one by Gallup and the other by the Angus Reid
group, show that the Bloc, which currently has eight seats in the House of
Commons, enjoys the support of 50 per cent of decided voters in Quebec.
With the Liberal Party supported by about 30 per cent of voters in the
francophone province and the Progressive Conservatives by less than 20 per
cent, the Bloc is expected to win the vast majority of Quebec's 75 seats in
the 295-member House.
The polls agree that the Liberals are well ahead in the country as a whole.
But they differ on whether the Liberals, currently the main opposition
party, will win enough seats to form a majority government.
The Angus Reid poll suggests the Liberals will win 150-160 seats. But Gallup
said the strength of the Bloc and the populist Reform Party in western
Canada could cost the Liberals a majority.
The two polls were among the last to be released before the election. Under
election rules, a blackout came into force last night on publication of poll
results.
The prospect of a separatist party becoming Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition
has already stirred controversy. The official opposition is entitled to
numerous parliamentary privileges, including the right to ask the first
question in the daily Question Period, a substantial research budget and a
taxpayer-funded official residence for its leader.
The Reform party, based in western Canada, has questioned the
appropriateness of using taxpayers' money to finance a group whose goal is
to break up the country.
Mr Lucien Bouchard, the Bloc's leader, has indicated he may not claim all
the perks. He said earlier this week the Bloc would use its position to
prepare the rest of Canada for Quebec sovereignty. 'English Canada doesn't
know who we are and they don't know what we want,' he said. 'We have to
clarify the situation.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / French market hits high after rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France yesterday announced the first cut in its key interest
rate since the summer's European exchange rate crisis, strengthening the
franc and pushing the Paris stock market to a record high.
The central bank said that the intervention rate, which acts as a floor for
money market interest rates, would be cut by 0.3 percentage points, from
6.75 per cent to 6.45 per cent, with effect from Monday. The five to ten-day
borrowing rate was cut by 0.5 percentage points to 7.25 per cent with
immediate effect.
The cut in the two interest rates is consistent with France's cautious
policy of gradually lowering borrowing costs while shadowing the Bundesbank
and maintaining the stability of the Franc. It comes at a time when the
French government is under pressure to stimulate the recession-hit economy
and cut the level of unemployment, now 11.7 per cent and rising.
Economists in Paris said France would continue with its policy of gradual
reductions in borrowing costs but could cut the intervention rate by a
further quarter of a percentage point within the next few weeks following
Thursday's half point cut in German interest rates. The CAC-40 index of
leading French shares increased by almost 2 per cent, to 2230, as investors
digested yesterday's cuts and anticipated further moves by France's monetary
authorities.
The Bank of France said that yesterday's action 'takes into account the
general downward movement in rates in Europe and the objective of internal
and external franc stability.' The French financial authorities have sought
to maintain a stable franc/D-Mark rate since the franc was forced out of its
narrow fluctuation bands within the European exchange rate mechanism by the
summer's currency crisis.
The French franc strengthened in response to the interest rate cuts, rising
above FFr3.50 to the D-mark, compared with last week's all-time low of
FFr3.548.
The rise supported the view that foreign exchange dealers and investors are
concerned principally with the need for lower borrowing costs to help lift
it from recession. Economists said the modest cut could have an important
psychological effect. Several commercial banks quickly responded, with the
Banque Nationale de Paris, lowering base rates from 8.40 per cent to 8.15
per cent.
Figures released yesterday showed housing starts increased by 8.4 per cent
in the third quarter while industrial production for July and August showed
a strong rise of 1.3 per cent over June. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, said 1994 would see GDP grow by 1.4 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAULO Cesar Farias, Brazil's most wanted man because of his allegedly
corrupt fund raising for disgraced former president Fernando Collor, was
yesterday relaxing in a London appartment after four months on the run.
Brazil's most wanted politician probably wished he was with him.
Instead Mr Joao Alves, accused of masterminding a huge corruption scheme
involving the government's budget, was giving evidence to a special
congressional inquiry.
The scheme, which was made public last weekend by a former government
official, allegedly involved nearly 30 politicians. Money allegedly diverted
to the individuals - probably several million dollars - is still being
counted.
Mr Alves, one of the 'seven dwarfs' who controlled Congress's budget
committee until last year, denied all the allegations.
Mr Farias's reapparance now was probably not entirely coincidental. After
remaining silent since fleeing Brazil in June, he chose to give an interview
to Brazil's main television station and even rang the leading Sao Paulo
newspaper from London to confirm his whereabouts.
His message was: Congressmen who found him guilty of corruption last year
were themselves corrupt.
Although the two corruption schemes appear unrelated, Mr Farias said he had
further information on the budget scam which could be revealed 'at the right
moment,' according to family members.
Brazil is seeking Mr Farias' return through the British courts, although the
abscence of an extradition treaty between the two countries is complicating
matters. The 'great train robber' Mr Ronald Biggs, who escaped extradition
in 1974, yesterday had some advice for Mr Farias: Don't miss Madame
Tussauds, 'where all the world's villains are'.

FT  23 OCT 93 / VW to close Seat plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car group, yesterday formally told unions that it
intended to close down the Barcelona plant of Seat, its troubled Spanish
subsidiary, and shed 9,000 jobs.
The closure of the sprawling Zona Franca factory, on Barcelona's city
outskirts, has been widely expected as Seat tumbled into losses which are
expected to reach Pta100bn (Pounds 505.05m) this year.
At the end of last month Seat's chairman, Mr Jose Antonio Diaz Alvarez,
resigned when Volkswagen rejected as inadequate his scheme to cut 5,000 jobs
at Zona Franca. Over the past three weeks the German group has been
unsuccessfully lobbying the Spanish government in the hope that the
administration would ease its burden through an injection of public money.
Union leaders are due to meet in Barcelona today to co-ordinate what are
likely to be big protests. Volkswagen's job cuts represents the biggest
single labour shakeout in Spain's industrial history, as well as one of the
most emotive.
The Zona Franca plant, where Seat began producing cars in 1951, is held as
emblematic of Spain's post-war economic recovery.
Unions were told that the German group intended to shift production of the
Toledo model from Zona Franca to Martorell, a Pta244bn plant that opened
earlier this year and which will now become the main production centre of
the group's Spanish unit.
Production of the Marbella and the Terra models, which are also built at the
Barcelona plant, would be transferred to Volkswagen's subsidiary in Mexico.
Under Volkswagen's plan 1,700 Seat employees on short term contracts, will
be made redundant with immediate effect, while 3,000 workers over 55 years
old will be offered early retirement schemes. Jobs will be suspended for a
further 4,300 Zona Franca workers.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Steady growth eases pressure on Clarke to cut rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut interest rates ahead
of next month's Budget eased yesterday with the release of figures showing
that the UK recovery did not falter in the third quarter.
Contrary to the expectations of many economists who were forecasting a
slight slowdown in the pace of recovery, the economy expanded steadily in
July-September, growing 0.6 per cent on the previous three months. However,
the figures show the recovery depends heavily on consumer spending and
energy output rather than manufacturing, which declined over the quarter.
The 0.6 per cent seasonally adjusted rise in gross domestic product in the
third quarter left output 2 per cent up year on year. The quarterly rise was
the same as the improvement between the first and second quarters of the
year.
Output excluding oil and gas production slowed, rising a seasonally adjusted
0.4 per cent in the three months to September compared with increases of 0.6
per cent and 0.5 per cent in the first two quarters of the year. Compared
with a year ago, non-oil GDP in the third quarter was 1.8 per cent higher.
The economy has now expanded in five successive quarters. The growth
compares favourably with other European Community countries, many of which
remain in recession. But the latest figures show that energy production -
boosted by a cool summer - and the services sector, are spearheading the
recovery.
The Central Statistical Office figures, which are provisional and
incomplete, show that output from service industries rose 0.5 per cent on
the previous quarter, and was up 2.7 per cent year on year.
Manufacturing output, however, has been declining. Although no September
figure is available, earlier CSO statistics showed that manufacturing output
fell 0.7 per cent in the three months to August, as recession in continental
Europe hit exports.
In the service sector, distribution, hotels and catering grew 0.8 per cent
quarter on quarter to stand 2.9 per cent up on a year ago. There were no
figures for the other service sectors, but the CSO said transport sector
output was up about 0.5 per cent while banking and financial services growth
was 'robust'.
Earlier this year, many economists described the recovery as 'perfect' with
manufacturing output buoyant, inflation subdued and consumer activity
relatively restrained.
However, the recent drop in manufacturing output in the three months to
August, three successive monthly rises in inflation and the latest
provisional estimates of GDP suggest the pattern of demand has shifted.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Rowland calls haltto long-running feud with Fayeds: Harrods
handshake ends House of Fraser row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TINY ROWLAND and Mr Mohamed Fayed made peace yesterday. Their surprise
settlement ended nearly a decade of feuding, during which Mr Rowland branded
Mr Fayed 'the hero from zero' and Mr Rowland, in turn, found his own name
given to a stuffed shark in Harrods food hall.
Lonrho, the trading company where Mr Rowland has been the guiding light for
30 years, and the Fayed brothers, announced they were abandoning their
long-run ning legal battle over the Fayeds' 1985 takeover of House of
Fraser, owner of Harrods and other UK department stores.
Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland said their 'long-standing relationship' of almost 20
years provided a stronger basis for a 'constructive future' than
disagreement.
Mr Rowland said the peace deal had been brokered by Mr Hassan Yassim, a
Saudi businessman who is related to the Fayeds by marriage. Mr Yassim
suggested a settlement earlier this week at a lunch at Lonrho's City
headquarters.
Also at the lunch were Mr Adnan Kashoggi, the Saudi arms dealer, and Mr Abu
Sharif, number two to Mr Yassir Arafat in the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
On Thursday, when he met Mr Fayed for the first time in years, all the
bitterness melted away, said Mr Rowland. 'We are now in partnership and we
will easily make up the costs we have spent on this dispute.'
After several years of a ferocious legal and propaganda campaign against the
Fayeds, Mr Rowland last night drank champagne with them at Harrods.
Afterwards, the brothers removed the stuffed shark which they had christened
'Tiny'.
Mr Rowland first bought a stake in House of Fraser in 1977 and made a
takeover bid for the company in 1981, which was blocked by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
He was furious in 1985 when the Department of Trade and Industry put no
obstacles in the way of the Fayeds' Pounds 615m bid for the company. Since
then, he has spent tens of millions of pounds trying to wrest control of
House of Fraser from the Fayeds and obtain compensation for Lonrho.
Mr Rowland said that he alone negotiated the peace on behalf of Lonrho.
'None of my colleagues knew, and were surprised when it was signed.'
On Wednesday Mr Yassim had been brought to lunch at Lonrho's headquarters by
Mr Kashoggi. At this lunch, Mr Yassim had said to him: 'If Mr Rabin and Mr
Arafat can make peace, surely you can end your war with the Fayeds.'
On Thursday, Mr Rowland met the Fayeds at Mr Yassim's apartment in
Kensington. That evening they returned to their homes and drafted a
statement announcing the peace treaty.
'Faxes were whizzing between our houses till one in the morning,' Mr Rowland
said. 'We kept the lawyers out of it,' he added. 'Between us we must have
spent Pounds 40m or Pounds 50m on the dispute and we had been advised that
the legal battle would last another 2 1/2 years.'
Yesterday, both Mr Rowland and Mr Fayed signed the statement which was
released to the press in the afternoon. Mr Rowland has now instructed his
solicitors to end all legal proceedings.
The main court action was Lonrho's case alleging fraudulent
misrepresentation and conspiracy to injure Lonrho by theFayeds and their
former financial advisers, the merchant bank Kleinwort Benson. Lonrho is
also dropping its legal action against Kleinwort and Mr John MacArthur, a
former Kleinwort director who now has his own financial advisory business.
An action against Lord Tebbit, trade and industry secretary at the time of
the bid, is also being dropped.
Mr Dieter Bock, who acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho and then
became joint chief executive with Mr Rowland, has been working hard to end
the dispute.
A DTI inspectors' report into the takeover, published in 1990, said that, in
the course of their estly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their
business interests and their resources to the secretary of state, the Office
of Fair Trading, the press, the House of Fraser board and House of Fraser
share holders, and their own advisers'.
The two companies yesterday said the time had come to 'recognise that there
is nothing to be gained by prolonging a costly battle'.

FT  23 OCT 93 / Howe gives damning account of Thatcher's last term at No 10
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOWE has given a damning indictment of Lady Thatcher's last years in 10
Downing Street, accusing the former prime minister of governing as if her
personal interests were automatically identical with those of Britain.
In a detailed and caustic review of Lady Thatcher's memoirs published in
today's FT, her former chancellor and foreign secretary says she came to
regard criticism of her views as 'unpatriotic'.
He also accuses her of offering a 'comic' account of the 1986 Westland
affair, the row which set the stage for Mr Michael Heseltine's challenge for
the leadership four years later.
Lord Howe, whose resignation from the cabinet provided the trigger for that
challenge and Lady Thatcher's subsequent resignation, stresses that the
'triumphs' of her first two administrations should not be overlooked. But he
adds that he has 'no regrets whatsoever' about his damning resignation
speech after he left the cabinet in the autumn of 1990.
Characterising her style and approach to government in the period after
Westland, he says: 'For Margaret Thatcher in her final years, there was no
distinction to be drawn between person, government, party and nation . . .
Any criticism of her was an unpatriotic act.'
Reinforcing an attack yesterday by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, Lord
Howe adds that collective cabinet discussion became for Lady Thatcher an
'irritating inconvenience'.
In his review of The Downing Street Years in the London Evening Standard,
Lord Lawson said that in Lady Thatcher's mind: 'The problem with her cabinet
was that at least some of its members had views of their own.'
Recounting the battle over the European exchange rate mechanism in which he
sided with Lord Lawson against Lady Thatcher, Lord Howe says the issue
became 'the epitome of Margaret Thatcher's 'I must prevail' syndrome'.
Lord Howe said: 'She was breaking with Europe . . . I had to break with
her.'

FT  23 OCT 93 / American Express offers reward scheme for cardholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN EXPRESS opened a new front in the battle for British credit and
charge card customers yesterday by launching a rewards programme for its
card-holders.
The scheme, which will offer members points towards air travel or hotel
accommodation, was announced in the same week that Vauxhall, a General
Motors subsidiary, became the first UK manufacturer to launch a mass market,
general purposes credit card.
American Express said yesterday that work on its 'membership miles' scheme
had begun more than a year ago, and that the programme was not a response to
Vauxhall's card. It said the timing of the launch had been determined by the
end of its negotiations with its six partners in the programme.
The programme has run in the US since June 1991, and was launched in France
during the summer.
Membership of the programme is free for the first year, but the second year
fee in the UK will be Pounds 20.
Under the scheme, a return trip from London to Paris would, for example,
require the card to be used for Pounds 10,000 worth of purchases. Schemes
which reward customers' use of a credit or charge card by awarding points
have generally proved successful in raising the number of transactions.
American Express has 1m cardholders in the UK. Some 280,000 are the frequent
travellers at whom this scheme is aimed.
The press advertising campaign will run this weekend, and again from
November 1 when the scheme becomes available.
American Express has allocated Pounds 20m over the next three years for the
scheme's marketing and administration. Its partners in the programme are
Virgin Freeway, Frequence Plus Air France, Continental OnePass, Forte Crest
Club, SAS EuroBonus and Qualiflyer, run by Swissair and Austrian Airlines.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Forestry helps Repola to profits

ANOTHER strong performance from its forest operations helped Repola,
Finland's largest industrial group, achieve profits of FM86m (Dollars 15.1m)
in the first eight months, after sales grew 12 per cent to FM16.8bn.
The result compares with a FM415m loss in the same period in 1992 and
reflects the benefits of the weaker Finnish markka and increased production
at its main unit, United Paper Mills (UPM).
Operating profits more than doubled to FM1.79bn from FM818m. However,
financing costs rose to FM1.7bn from FM1.23bn partly because foreign
exchange losses increased to FM408m from FM109m.
UPM saw sales rise 21 per cent to FM10.8bn and pre-tax profits increase to
FM725m from FM133m.
Sales fell 3 per cent to FM5bn at Rauma, the group's metals and engineering
unit, although the division's pre-tax loss fell sharply to FM15m from
FM238m. Rosenlaw, the company's packaging unit, lifted sales by 7 per cent
to FM910m as it swung to a FM21 pre-tax profit from a FM27m loss last time
round.
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry company, said it is considering selling
part of its 21 per cent stake in Repola.
The holding, a hangover from a failed bid attempt in 1990, has a total
market value of FM2.8bn (Dollars 491m) and a book value of FM2.1bn. Morgan
Stanley International and Alfred Berg have been retained as advisers.
The group declined to comment on a market report that suggested it planned
to sell half of its holding of 31.6m shares for FM84.5 per share to raise
FM1.38bn.
Repola's share price has doubled this year to FM88 per share in line with
the improved performance of the Finnish exporting sector.
Mr Timo Poranen, Metsa-Serla's chief executive, said recently that the stake
was not essential for Metsa-Serla's business co-operation with UPM.
The group also has a stated strategy of strengthening its balance sheet.
Metsa-Serla swung to a FM112m profit after financial items in the first
eight months from a FM169m loss in the same 1992 period.
It is expecting a stronger performance in the final four months and 'a clear
profit' for the full year, after 1992's FM290m deficit. Sales rose 7.2 per
cent to FM5.34bn from FM5.03bn, with full-year sales expected to exceed
FM8bn.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kymmene announces bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday announced sharply-reduced
losses for the first eight months and plans for a FM600m (Dollars 105m)
convertible bond issue.
Losses after financial items amounted to FM337m for the period, compared
with FM849m last time.
The group said productivity gains and higher sales volumes had assisted the
recovery, but it acknowledged that it was lagging behind its competitors.
The group's exposure to the highly-depressed fine papers market, and the
volume of its production in hard currency countries, has held it in the red
when its main domestic rivals have returned to profit.
Sales climbed to FM10.5m from FM8.42m, while operating profits rose strongly
to FM1.0bn from FM243m.
The group expects a better performance in the final four months, because of
productivity gains, falling interest rates and increased exports to markets
outside Europe.
The convertible bonds, which will be offered to shareholders and the public,
have a 50-year maturity but can be called by the company at par from the
year 2004. Proceeds will be used to reduce net debt, which stood at FM17.9bn
at the end of August.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Switzerland heads for big deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND'S public sector will run up a deficit of over 3 per cent of
gross domestic product this year, the finance ministry forecast yesterday.
'We must recognise that Switzerland is in danger of losing its reputation as
an island of stability in public finance,' the ministry said in a statement
supporting plans to cut spending and raise taxes. The federal deficit alone,
originally forecast at SFr3.5bn (Dollars 2.44bn) this year, was expected to
surpass SFr6bn and rise to SFr7.1bn next year.
Revenues have slumped and social security spending soared during the
three-year-long recession, but roughly half of the deficit was attributable
to structural factors and would not disappear with a recovery.
The government hoped to boost revenues with the introduction of a modest 6.5
per cent value added tax in 1995.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Ukraine to keep Chernobyl plant open
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UKRAINIAN Parliament decided to continue nuclear energy production at
the Chernobyl power plant yesterday, reversing its order to shut down the
power station by the end of this year.
Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, which
was responsible for 8,000 deaths and radioactive contamination in Ukraine,
Russia and Belorussia.
The decision to keep Chernobyl open is part of Ukraine's policy to develop
domestic energy production and reduce reliance on its main energy supplier,
Russia, with whom Ukraine has had difficult relations since the break-up of
the Soviet Union. Cash-strapped Ukraine is plagued with energy shortages and
has a Dollars 2.5bn oil and gas debt to Russia.
Atomic energy currently accounts for 35 per cent of the nation's electricity
consumption. Although public opinion is strongly against nuclear power,
Ukraine's energy crisis has swayed the parliament into overturning the
popular 1991 order to close Chernobyl.
However, many western and Ukrainian scientists have questioned the long-term
safety of the Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, which are not used in the west.
More than 115 nuclear safety violations have occurred at Ukraine's five
power stations since the beginning of this year.
Only two of Chernobyl's four reactors are in operation. A third reactor was
shut down two years ago after a fire. The fourth reactor, where the
Chernobyl explosion took place, is encased in a cracking concrete shell. A
replacement shell is to be constructed.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (30): After market
dissonance equities are hardly top of the pops / Serious riches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN A pop celebrity offers you a glass of champagne at 11am, you think he
is acting true to form. But in all other respects, Geoff Stephens, pop
songwriter extraordinaire, does not fit the stereotype.
There are no flashy cars, no multi-chambered mansions dotted across the
world, not even a swimming pool at his modest house tucked away quietly in
suburban Berkhamsted; and his wife is the same one he married 36 years ago.
The modesty is not for lack of success. His songs, some of them co-written,
have been recorded by a constellation of stars  - Elvis Presley, Cliff
Richard, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jnr, Tom Jones, Olivia Newton John, The
Hollies.
Perhaps the reason is that Geoff Stephens, who was born of working-class
parents, appears to be a cautious man only too aware that money is easy
come, easy go in the music business. As a boy, he had wanted to be a writer,
and that is the temperament which appears to define him more easily than the
exhibitionism of the pop world.
He was already married with two small children when he had his first big hit
in 1967, and his family responsibility seems to have inhibited any
temptation to blow his new winnings.
'Winchester Cathedral' knocked Diana Ross and the Supremes off the the top
of the charts in the US, and it won Stephens an Ivor Novello award for best
pop song of the year. In the same year, he had another hit with 'There's a
Kind of Hush all over the World,' originally sung by Herman's Hermits, and
later revived by the Carpenters.
'The success of those songs in the same year turned my life around,' said
Stephens. 'It was like winning the pools, except pool winnings are tax-free
and in that era tax rates were over 90 per cent.
'I had a young family, and knew that the music business is very speculative.
Songwriting is not a steady job, and there was no guarantee that I could
repeat the success; so, after advice from my accountant, we finally decided
that the only way to get around this was to emigrate,' recalls Stephens, who
appears to have agonised hard over a decision he was aware could attract
criticism.
The idea of Jersey was abandoned in favour of Geneva; and he lived up a
little more to the stereotype when he moved there in 1969, buying a house
with a swimming pool and tennis court. 'The original intention was to rent
and stay there a couple of years, but we put down roots. Many of my
collaborators were happy to come and stay with us, and I also travelled to
Nashville and Los Angeles to promote my songs.'
He deposited funds with a reputable stockbroker in Geneva, to manage a
portfolio for him on a discretionary basis, but after losing money in the
1974 crash, the experience left him feeling shy of equities. 'I became a
building societies man, and had deposits on the money markets.' He also
invested in his own publishing company  - Tic-Toc Music  - which is still in
existence.
In 1977, Stephens returned so that his children could finish their education
in England, and the family settled in Berkhamsted. 'Graham Greene used to go
to the local school here and his father had been headmaster.'
In the early 1980s, Stephens decided to venture back into equities, but when
the portfolio started to suffer losses, he decided to pull out. 'Again, I
went to an investment adviser, and he handled a portfolio for me on a
discretionary basis, but I managed to come out of that with a loss, too.
Timing is very important. If I had not got cold feet, I should have stayed
in the market.'
Stephens also had safe investments, such as National Savings, but did not
think about a pension until a few years ago.
'I always thought my songs would be my pension, but my accountants, Arram
Berlyn Gardner, suggested an executive pension plan, which I am delighted
with. They also proposed that I retreat to the sanctuary of the building
society and the money markets, where I enjoyed a period of high interest
rates in the 1980s.' One of their other suggestions was to place money in
Rothschild Old Court Guernsey funds, which offer the flexibility of
deferring a tax liability since they are offshore roll-up funds.
'When interest rates started coming down, I wondered how to protect myself
against inflation, since most of my money was held on deposit. My
accountants suggested insurance-based products, such as with-profits bonds
and back-to-back investments, which can achieve better rates of return and
are a further way of deferring tax liabilities.'
Having decided that there must be more to financial planning than insurance
products, Stephens also consulted Chamberlain de Broe, the London-based
fee-charging financial advisers.
He does not need investment income, because his earnings meet his needs, so
the portfolio is oriented towards capital growth, while taking account of
his cautious attitude towards equities and reluctance to speculate. The bulk
of his portfolio is still on deposit and in managed currency funds. These
have been heavily oriented towards the dollar, but, since his expenditure is
in sterling, the cash portion of the portfolio is being eased back into
sterling whenever the dollar shows any strength.
Tax-efficiency is a priority, so National Savings certificates, a personal
equity plan, the executive pension, and the full use of his wife's personal
allowances once independent taxation came into force in 1990, have all been
the obvious investment choices. There is a measure of speculation in
equities through investment and unit trusts. Stephens currently has holdings
in Mediterranean investment trust, Exeter Warrant fund and City of London
Emerging Markets.
A range of tax-planning opportunities is also presented through his
ownership of a company. 'My accountants, who had previously recommended a
dividend policy as a tax-efficient way of extracting company funds, are, as
I approach retirement, now proposing salary increases, to enable me to
provide maximum funding to my executive pension scheme.'
The pop world has changed in the past decade, as more and more stars have
eschewed the songwriter in favour of penning their own tunes and lyrics.
Stephens has turned towards writing for musicals instead, but many of his
old hits return to haunt him, and to provide an unexpected source of income.
His song, 'The Crying Game', for example, written in 1965, was recently
revived for an Oscar-winning film named after the song.
His favourite investment now is his publishing company, and the bruising
experiences with equities are still evident. 'In principle, I still believe
in investing in your own company and your own children  - that is the way
for me. My son Paul has started a recording studio/production complex  -
Bury Farm Studios, in Bovingdon  - and Tic-Toc Music is investing in that.
In that way, you are relying on your own expertise, rather than that of
others.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (29): How to make
sure they do it your way - The cost of your funeral / There are sound
reasons for pre-payment. Burial-cost increases have exceeded inflation, and
relatives may be saved further stress when they are already under emotional
strain
</HEADLINE>

ONE'S OWN funeral is not a subject most people like to dwell on. Planning
and paying for it years in advance could seem a little morbid, but funeral
directors have been working on changing public attitudes, with signs of
success.
Death is inevitable, and everyone expects friends and relatives to mourn
them, but comparatively few people in the UK choose to make arrangements in
advance. This is in contrast to the US, where up to three-quarters of
funerals are pre-paid.
The large undertaking groups are now offering schemes that allow you to
choose the type of funeral you would like  - burial or cremation, church
service or simple crematorium ceremony, one limousine or a whole fleet  -
and pay for it at today's prices.
The money goes into an independently administered trust fund, where it is
invested in a mixture of low-risk index-linked gilts and some equities. When
you eventually die, be it three years or three decades afterwards, the
funeral you have chosen is provided, no matter how much prices have gone up
in the meantime.
One of the main arguments for paying for your funeral now is that, in recent
years, the price of funerals has risen faster than the general inflation
rate. According to a survey by Chosen Heritage, one of the largest sellers
of funeral plans, the average funeral in England and Wales cost Pounds
867.29 in 1990, but Pounds 1,048.24 in 1992. In addition, there are
considerable regional variations in the cost of funerals, but some plans
offer the same price all over the country, which could be a good deal for
people in the south-east and south-west of England.
Companies that offer such plans say the other reason many customers choose
them is to save their relatives the stress of having to organise a funeral
when they are already coping with the emotional strain of a death.
'It's what he would have wanted,' is a phrase often heard on the lips of the
bereaved, explaining their choice of funeral arrangements. But how many
people really know what the dead person would have chosen? With pre-payment
plans, you can leave instructions with the funeral directors for every
detail of the proceedings in advance, even down to which hymns should be
sung, the choice of readings, and the route of the funeral cortege.
As soon as the owner of a pre-payment plan dies, relatives can call a
24-hour number, and the funeral directors take over, organising everything
from the removal of the body from the home or hospital to contacting a
minister for the funeral service. The more expensive plans even place an
obituary notice in a local paper, and provide acknowledgement cards for
senders of flowers.
The market for pre-paid funerals is dominated by a few large operators:
Chosen Heritage, run by Great Southern; the Co-operative Wholesale Society's
Funeral Bond; Co-operative Retail Services also has a funeral bond and
pre-payment certificates; Dignity in Destiny, owned by the Plantsbrook
funeral group; and Golden Charter, which uses small independent funeral
directors. Most of these offer a choice of three or four package deals,
ranging from very simple to more ostentatious, but some can be customised to
individual requirements.
Package prices range from Pounds 825 to Pounds 1,450 with Chosen Heritage,
and from Pounds 784 to Pounds 1,395 with the Co-operative Wholesale Society.
The cost can often be paid in monthly instalments over one to three years,
but that may involve a charge for finance. Such packages will not include
extras such as embalming, headstones, flowers or catering.
Three-quarters of funerals in the UK are cremations, so most pre-payment
plans use this as the basis for costs. Burials are more expensive. If you
choose to be buried, some plans allow you to pay for this in advance, others
contribute a fixed amount and will expect your family to make up the
shortfall at the time.
The plans can be implemented only by funeral directors belonging to the
organisation running the scheme  - most have several hundred branches or
affiliates, so finding one locally should not be a problem. However, if you
move abroad, or to an area in the UK where there is no affiliated funeral
director to hand, most of the plans will return your money.
The alternative to picking a group of funeral directors and paying in
advance is the traditional option of a funeral insurance plan, offered by
many life insurance companies. Many of the companies offer 'guaranteed
acceptance' schemes for people aged over 50 or 55 and under 80, with no
medical needed. Insurance policies of this sort are generally of the
whole-of-life, without-profits type, so there is no cash surrender value,
and the sum assured does not increase. Whether or not it is good value
depends on how soon the policy holder dies.
Most policies are taken out by people over 60, who may well live for another
25 years. By that time inflation will have eroded the value of the sum
assured, and they may have contributed in premiums more than the final sum
paid out.
For example, with the Norwich Union, a 65 year-old man would pay Pounds 19 a
month for a sum assured of Pounds 2,500, while a woman of the same age would
pay Pounds 16.58. For a pair of 75-year-olds, the same level of cover would
cost Pounds 34.55 and Pounds 28.28. If death occurred within two years of
the policy's start, the company would only pay out 1.5 times the premiums
paid, rather than the sum assured.
By comparison, Chosen Heritage's mid-range Traditional plan, spread over two
years, costs Pounds 45 a month for a person of either sex and any age. Once
the full amount (Pounds 1,080) has been paid, provision of a funeral at the
required standard is guaranteed. If the funeral service is needed before all
of the instalments have been paid, the guaranteed price still applies, but
the balance due must be paid by the family.
The main advantage of insurance over pre-payment is flexibility in the
choice of funeral directors: the money is not tied in any way. However, the
full burden of planning the funeral does fall on the family with this
system.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (28): A bond to
provide an income from property - What's new? / In spite of good capital
growth prospects, investors may have to delay cashing in if the fund's
assets are not readily saleable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WITH COMMERCIAL property currently yielding more than equities or gilts,
property investment appears to be edging back on to the agenda for financial
managers designing new products for personal investors, writes Barbara
Ellis.
In launching a property income bond recently, Hill Samuel brought together
its investment portfolio bond and the property fund run by the group since
1969.
The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000, and the charges are an initial 5.5
per cent and an annual 0.75 per cent.
Starting with a yield of 5.9 per cent, net of basic rate income tax which
cannot be reclaimed, the property income bond will pay out at the intervals
investors choose: monthly, quarterly, four-monthly, six-monthly or annually.
The Pounds 49.9m Hill Samuel property fund, ranked 11th out of 59 insurance
company property funds tracked by Micropal over the 10 years to October 1,
turning Pounds 100 into Pounds 224.28, against the sector average of Pounds
186.87. Over five years to the same date, the fund ranked 35th out of 90,
with a 14.85 per cent gain, against a sector average of 11.31 per cent.
In the past year, the property fund has ranked 68th out of 98, gaining just
0.73 per cent, on an offer-to-offer basis, compared with the 11.07 per cent
average gain for the sector.
Hill Samuel emphasises what it sees as excellent prospects for income and
medium to long-term capital growth for the bond, but warns that neither the
income nor the value of the bond is guaranteed and may fall as well as rise.
The group also cautions investors that they may not be able to cash in the
bond when they want to: because property held by the fund may not be readily
saleable, Hill Samuel is reserving the right to impose a six-month delay on
switches or encashments of units in the fund at any time without notice.
SAVE &amp; PROSPER's Monthly Income Portfolio Pep has its main selling point in
its title. As the estimated 4.5 per cent gross income comes through a
personal equity plan, it is tax free.
The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000, and the maximum through a Pep is
Pounds 6,000. Ninety-five per cent of each investor's money buys units in
four of Save &amp; Prosper's unit trusts, with the 5 per cent balance held on an
interest-earning account, which will also take in dividends from the unit
trusts. Investors are to receive level monthly payments, reviewable each
year, from the account, but S&amp;P emphasises that capital will not be run down
to keep up payments.
The charges are those on the four unit trusts, ie an initial 5.5 per cent
and an annual 1.25 per cent, with no extra charges for the Pep or the cash
account.
The Pep will hold fixed percentages of its investments in the four unit
trusts selected: 30 per cent in Scotyields, 25 per cent in S&amp;P Income Units,
20 per cent in S&amp;P High Return and 20 per cent in the S&amp;P Smaller Companies
Income Fund.
Scotyields and S&amp;P High Return ranked 74th and 92nd respectively out of 93
unit trusts in the UK Equity Income sector over the five years to October 1,
according to Micropal. Scotyields gained 52.97 per cent over that period,
while S&amp;P put on 29.74 per cent against the sector average gain of 67.64 per
cent.
S&amp;P Income ranked 24th out of 26 unit trusts in the UK Balanced sector over
five years, showing a gain of 41.03 per cent, compared with the sector
average of 66.66 per cent. S&amp;P Smaller Companies Income ranked 25th out of
49 trusts in the UK Smaller Companies sector over the same period, gaIning
35.01 per cent, slightly ahead of the sector average of 34.08 per cent.
A UNIT trust launched by Foster &amp; Braithwaite this month caused something of
a stir among fund management groups by seeming to circumvent regulations
previously imposed by the Securities &amp; Investments Board (SIB).
The F&amp;B High Income Portfolio Fund, the unit trust concerned, was structured
so that the annual management charge of 1.25 per cent would be deducted from
the capital account, boosting the amount of income available to
unit-holders.
Other unit trusts have long wished to take management fees out of capital
instead of income, in the same way as investment trusts, and used to be
allowed to do so. But for the past three years, they have been obstructed by
a standard of recommended practice from the SIB.
F&amp;B chairman John Vintcent explained that it had taken his firm about a year
to persuade SIB to approve the new unit trust: 'The statement of practice is
not binding as long as the trust deed allows the management fee to be
charged to capital and everything is disclosed to investors,' he explained.
But even before F&amp;B's trust had come on to the market, SIB appeared to have
second thoughts and wrote to the Association of Unit Trusts &amp; Investment
Funds saying that it would be recommending a change in the regulations
preventing fees being charged to capital.
'They may well take away our opportunity to run the fund in the way we
want,' said Mr Vintcent, 'That would leave investors no worse off than they
would have been with any other unit trust.' However, he added that his
firm's move had a lot of support within the unit trust industry, and
forecast determined lobbying to allow it to continue and be copied by
others.
IN NOVEMBER, Kleinwort Benson is to launch its second investment trust
specialising in second-hand endowment policies. The Kleinwort Endowment
Policy Trust, launched in July 1992, raised Pounds 30m and has traded at a
premium of between 5 per cent and 8 per cent to net asset value since then,
indicating good demand.
The new trust, with the same managers and advisers as the first, will aim to
raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m, and will have a life of 12 1/2
years.
Managing director Simon White explained that this life-span would enable the
trust to avoid head-on competition with the BZW trust, which is buying
policies with shorter-dated maturities. He said KB would be able to buy
policies with 15 years to run and shorten them to 10 years on good terms.
LLOYDS BANK has launched a treasurers account, aimed at small clubs,
charities, societies and trustees. The account provides current facilities,
including a cheque-books and statements.
All credits and the first 10 debits in each month are free. Debits beyond 10
in a month are charged Pounds 2 each.
The account pays interest at tiered rates, starting at 1 per cent gross for
balances between Pounds 1 and Pounds 500 and rising to 3.2 per cent on
amounts over Pounds 25,000.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Seek advice
and be wary of mailshots - The choice / Trusts are useful for many
objectives, but unsuitable for short-term needs, because of their charges
and markets' ups and downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

<TEXT>
POTENTIAL INVESTORS, faced with the ever-expanding choice of unit trusts,
could be forgiven for adopting the blindfold-and-pin selection method. More
often, this takes the form of dashing off a cheque to the first company
whose advertisement or mailshot catches the eye.
After all, you may reason, if the warning that 'past performance is not
necessarily a guide to the future' is true, how can you be expected to make
a more informed decision?
Chance can sometimes throw up the ideal investment opportunity, but
frequently it does not. A little research, and some unbiased advice, can
make the difference between choosing a poorly performing investment and an
above-average one.
The first task is to formulate a clear idea of your investment objectives.
Do you want income or capital growth, or a combination of the two? Over what
period are you looking to invest? Can you tolerate a high level of risk for
the chance of greater returns, or are you depending on getting your money
back?
Once you have answered these basic questions, narrowing down the choice of
trusts becomes considerably easier: if you want income, you can cross off
all the low-yielding funds; if you want a low-risk investment, you can throw
out all the emerging-markets prospectuses.
The next stage is to look more closely at the funds in suitable sectors.
Although past performance is not a reliable guide to how a fund will do in
future, it can give some indication of a fund manager's skill, particularly
in funds with a wide spread of investments.
This does not mean just picking the fund that is top of its sector over the
past month or year. If you look for funds which are consistently in the top
25 per cent of their sector over a number of years, your chances of getting
a reasonable return are probably higher than if you pick a fund which has
bounced around from top to bottom over the years.
Very specialised trusts  - investing in one small country or a single
commodity, for example  - are more volatile, so past performance is not a
good guide to their prospects.
A useful source of information on unit trusts for small investors is Money
Management, the monthly sister magazine of the Financial Times, which
publishes comparative performance tables in every issue.
Other published sources can be too expensive for individuals, but financial
advisers often have access to them. David Harris, of Chantrey Financial
Services, swears by Fund Research, which provides detailed information on
each fund, assigns it a rating, and publishes regular updates, such as on
the movements of fund managers between groups. If a star fund manager is
poached by a rival company, it is as well to know that before choosing to
put your redundancy pay-off into his or her old fund.
Hugo Pring, investment adviser at Fraser Marr, says that the strength of the
management group and the size of the fund are also factors to be taken into
account.
'It is not an exact science, and there is always a gut-feeling element to
the choice you make,' he says, 'but I think you are never going to go too
far wrong if you stick with good companies with strong records, and the
resources to keep good fund managers.'
Sudden success can be problematic for small funds, he says. 'With a very
small fund with one or two good stocks, as soon as money starts pouring in
in any quantity, the fund manager loses control.'
Once you have narrowed your choice down to a handful of funds, it is worth
looking at the level of charges, and the charging structure. Unit trusts
generally have higher charges than investment trusts: often 5-6 per cent
initially, and 1-1.5 per cent annually. A difference of one or two
percentage points in the initial charge, and half a point in the annual
management charge, can make a noticeable difference to the size of your
investment after a few years. All else being equal  - type of fund,
investment strategy, strength of the company  - most advisers would plump
for the fund which charges less, but the appeal of low charges should not
override investment considerations.
'I would argue very strongly that, while administrative charges are
important, if you just go for the cheapest, it is a bit like the old adage
 -if you pay peanuts, you are likely to get monkeys,' says Harris.
Another decision you will have to take is whether or not to spread your
money between a number of funds. Picking a loser is less of a disaster if
only a portion of your money is in it. Pring usually recommends his clients
divide their unit trust investments with half in UK funds, and half shared
between Europe and the US, for a relatively low-risk portfolio suitable for
school fees planning. However, if you only have a couple of thousand to
invest, it may not be worth splitting your money between funds, as the
paperwork could be out of proportion to the sums involved.
Unit trusts are an easy vehicle for many investment objectives, but advisers
emphasise time and again that they are not suitable for short-term needs,
because of their charges and the regular ups and downs of equity markets.
'You must view collective investments generally as at least a five-year
investment,' says Pring.
One of the most common specific uses for unit trusts is in school-fees
planning, if parents or grandparents can start to save five or 10 years in
advance. A useful feature for this type of planning is that most unit trust
management groups allow investment either of lump sums, or of small amounts
through regular savings plans, so monthly contributions can be topped up
with any gifts or windfalls.
Unit trusts can also be used as an alternative to an endowment policy to pay
off an interest-only mortgage. Costs are lower than for endowments, and the
investment is more flexible: contributions can be varied, and if the
investment grows fast enough, the mortgage can be paid off early.
In both these cases, it may be more efficient to invest in unit trusts
through a personal equity plan (see page 19 of this Review).
Cash unit trusts are rather different from other sectors, but are growing in
popularity. They are mainly used either as a place to park your money
between selling out of one trust and buying into another, or as an
alternative to a building society account. The income paid is based on money
market rates, and charges are lower than for other unit trusts  - commonly
no initial charge and 0.5 per cent annually.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Young climbers
show promise - Emerging markets / Investment in the economies of developing
countries is becoming easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE developed economies of the US and Europe continue to record low
economic growth after a prolonged period of recession, investment houses are
turning to some of the world's 'emerging' stock markets for higher returns.
The main emerging markets are in South America, the Far East, South Asia
(especially India and Pakistan) and central and southern Europe. Some of
these markets, such as China, have recorded spectacular growth over a short
period.
China's growth rate for the first half of 1993 was 14 per cent, according to
GT, compared with expectations of only 1.5 per cent growth for the developed
world over the same period. GT expects the Chinese economy to slow to 6-8
per cent growth in the first half of 1994, which is still high by most
standards.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank affiliate
devoted to private sector investment in the developing world, has been
particularly active since the late 1980s in fostering the development of
capital markets and privatisation in developing countries, which has made it
easier for investment houses to invest in emerging markets.
Emerging stock markets, which are found in Asia, Latin America and parts of
Europe, appear therefore to hold out the prospect of more attractive
investment opportunities over the next few years than those in developed
nations. This has prompted a spate of emerging-market unit or investment
trust launches over the past year.
For many private investors, risk and emerging markets go hand in hand, and
these are not markets in which to place savings you could not afford to
lose. A worldwide fund is less risky than a regional fund, because of its
increased diversification. Moreover single-country funds are likely to be
highly volatile, because the stock markets involved are so illiquid.
Enthusiasts argue that, far from being risky, adding an emerging markets
element to a general portfolio will lessen its volatility, because, unlike
developed stock markets, emerging markets are not closely correlated.
'Falls in the equity market of Mexico tend to be related to conditions in
that country and do not lead on to a collapse in Taiwan,' says Framlington's
Simon Key. 'Similarly, a coup in Thailand will not have an impact on
investments in Argentina. Also, emerging markets tend to be less affected by
developments in the major capital markets of the US, UK and Japan.'
Many of the recently launched emerging markets funds have been investment
trusts. What is the advantage of using a unit trust instead? In the
investment trust world, emerging markets can go in and out of fashion. When
markets are fashionable, trusts often trade at a premium to net assets; that
is, investors must pay, say, 105p to buy 100p of assets. But when markets
fall from grace, funds can slump to wide discounts. Many emerging market
investments trusts are now trading at a premium because of their popularity
at the moment.
An investor in a unit trust does not face this problem; units trade at asset
value. Instead, the disadvantage which unit trusts face is that the illiquid
nature of emerging markets may force the manager to sell his best holdings
at the wrong time if the unit trust needs cash to meet redemptions.
Unit trusts are also subjected to the restriction that they cannot invest
more than 10 per cent of the fund in an unapproved market. 'This is not a
major consideration for us,' says Maurice O'Shannassy, fund manager of
Mercury Asset Management's Emerging Markets fund, launched in August. 'The
major markets are approved, but we can access the unapproved markets through
ADR listings and by buying country funds, especially if they are at a
discount.'
Emerging-market unit trusts are included in the international equity growth
sector. There were eight worldwide funds in existence in September, managed
by City of London, Framlington, Gartmore, Martin Currie, Mercury,
Prosperity, Schroder and Stewart Ivory.
Framlington, Mercury and Schroder do not yet have a one year record, but of
the rest, City of London and Prosperity have been shown consistently good
performance. City of London is top of the whole sector over one, two and
three years to September 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright, and 10th
in the five years to September 1. Prosperity is top of the sector over the
five years to September 1, and in the top five over the one, two and three
years to September 1.
City of London is unusual, because it invests in emerging markets through
closed-end funds and not directly. Richard Carswell, director of City of
London, says: 'We buy into country funds domiciled offshore and managed by
reputable organisations, which trade on a wide discount to asset value
because they do not receive the same kind of publicity as onshore closed-end
funds.'
Roger Bade, fund manager at Commercial Union, which is the investment
adviser to Prosperity, says his approach is bottom-up stock selection in a
country which has growth opportunities. 'I steer away from countries which
are losing control over their inflation, so Brazil or Turkey are
unattractive to me.'
Charges are in line with other unit trusts, and most have savings plans. The
initial charges are: 6 per cent at Prosperity and Martin Currie; 5.75 at
MAM, 5.25 per cent at Gartmore; 5 per cent at City of London, Framlington
and Stewart Ivory. Annual fees are: 1.5 per cent at City of London, Gartmore
and MAM; 1.25 per cent at Stewart Ivory, Martin Currie, Framlington and
Prosperity.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Postpone the
bill until it's smaller - Offshore funds / A 40 per cent taxpayer, about to
retire, could roll-up cash offshore and then withdraw it when he drops into
the 25 per cent tax bracket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
SLOWLY BUT surely, Europe is developing a market in offshore funds which may
one day represent a challenge to the UK unit trust market.
It is a challenge which the industry recognises only too well. Earlier this
year, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds finally persuaded
the Treasury to agree to remove a competitive disadvantage. UK unit trusts
will be allowed to pay income gross of tax to non-UK investors (a measure to
this effect is expected in the Budget). Without that concession, fund
management business which might have come to London would simply have headed
to Luxembourg.
For the domestic UK investor, the attractions of offshore funds are actually
quite limited. Although such funds can pay income gross, taxpayers are
obliged to declare that income to the Inland Revenue.
Non-taxpayers may still find it a lot more convenient to use an offshore
bond fund, for example, than to use an onshore fund and wait to claim their
tax back. But for taxpayers, the only real advantage is the ability to
postpone tax. So-called roll-up funds accumulate income, rather than pay it
out; UK investors are only liable to pay tax when they withdraw their money.
So a 40 per cent taxpayer, who is about to retire, might find it convenient
to roll-up cash offshore and then withdraw it when he drops into the 25 per
cent tax bracket. Similarly, someone who is planning to work overseas, or
emigrate, might roll up cash until he moves out of the UK tax net. Since the
fund is rolling up gross, rather than net, there should be some enhancement
to performance.
The danger, however, is that tax rates may rise in the future and you could
end up with a higher, not a lower, tax bill.
The second question is that of regulation. Investors with memories of Barlow
Clowes, or indeed Bernie Cornfeld, might be suspicious of any offshore
investment. The safest bet is to stick with those funds which are recognised
by the Securities and Investments Board; ie the UK's chief regulator has
accepted that regulation in the offshore centre is equivalent to that in the
UK, and that the funds are run in the proper manner.
When it comes to investment performance, there are many well-known UK names,
such as Fidelity, GT and Henderson, which run offshore funds. And the UK
investor who ventures offshore can gain access to the expertise of some US
groups which have yet to set up in the UK; for example, Scudder Stevens
operates a range of bond and equity funds out of Luxembourg.
A lot of funds are managed within 'umbrellas', in which a variety of
different types of fund are lumped together. Investors can switch between
the different funds at low cost, and there is an enormous variety to choose
from. Some funds, such as the currency deposit funds, are not available
onshore. But they should be aware that, since 1988, switching may attract a
capital gains tax liability.
Charges are an important factor to watch. Offshore funds operate on a single
price system, in which investors buy and sell units at the same price, with
the charges thrown in on top. The performance figures quoted by groups such
as Micropal do not allow for the effect of initial charges, which inevitably
flatters the performance of offshore funds by comparison with their onshore
counterparts. Furthermore, some offshore funds have been criticised for the
scale of their charges, which can be considerably higher than those onshore.
September saw a welcome development in the market when Charles Schwab, the
US discount broker, launched its International FundSource service. This
offers to sell investors offshore funds with no initial charge.
Only three fund management groups are taking part in the service at the
moment: Guinness Flight (for currency, equity and bond funds); Rothschild
Asset Management (for currency funds); and Wright Investors' Services (for
equity funds).
In fact, there is no initial charge on the currency funds of either Guinness
Flight or Rothschild Asset Management. So the real benefit of the service is
the ability to buy the bond and equity funds without the upfront charge.
Schwab, which runs a very similar service in the US, earns its profit by
getting a proportion (around 0.3 per cent) of the manager's annual fee. It
says the cost is not passed on to the investor. The manager is willing to
pay Schwab because of the increased funds under management the broker can
generate.
Investors must open a Schwab account to use the service, and the minimum
investment in each fund is Dollars 2,000. As the system is dollar-based,
sterling investors will face a currency risk and the cost of conversion
(around 0.2-0.3 of a percentage point). UK investors interested in the
service can call freephone 0800 526027.
The day when the average UK investor regularly sends cheques to Luxembourg
may be some way off. But enough fund management groups are convinced that
they need to tap the market of wealthy international investors to ensure
that the offshore funds market is set to grow for some years to come.

TO THE casual observer, there would seem to be too many unit trusts. At the
end of August, 1,537 funds were available from 160 management companies,
giving the first-time investor a bewildering choice.
Every year, the number of funds on offer seems to increase remorselessly. In
the bull market of 1987, there were just 1,137 funds from 139 companies on
offer. Even allowing for a slight expansion of the definition of a fund in
June 1993 (following the Unit Trust Association's redesignation as the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment funds), this represents a
substantial advance.
It is not as if fund management companies were making much money out of all
this diversity. Take the example of the international equity growth sector,
where the investor had 158 funds to choose from at the start of September.
Just over a third of those funds (54) had less than Pounds 10m under
management. Not only is it hard to offer a truly international spread with
that kind of sum, it is also hard to see how the manager can be making a
profit. Even on a 1.5 per cent annual charge, a Pounds 10m trust would bring
in just Pounds 150,000 of revenue a year. By the time you have paid the
manager, and allowed for the costs of running the fund, you will be left
with loose change.
Consumers could certainly have a more than adequate choice with a much
smaller range of funds; every sector could have its index fund, a selection
of 'value' or recovery managers, growth stock players and small-company
specialists. Add in a few funds with different charging structures (some
with low front-end charges and exit fees, others with high initial charges
and a low annual fee), and you could probably get by with 20-25 funds in
each sector.
Despite the apparent need for the industry to rationalise, there is little
sign of change. The problem is that history has shown that it is much easier
to raise money by launching a new fund than it is to generate interest in an
existing trust. 'It is much easier to get press coverage for new funds,'
says Judy Delaforce, product development manager at fund management group
Fidelity. Peter Emms, group marketing director at M&amp;G, says that new funds
give intermediaries a chance to arouse the interest of their clients.
There have also been good reasons to launch many recent funds, argues
Delaforce. 'With the recession, it has been appropriate for some more
cautious funds to be launched, such as money market trusts, balanced funds
(those which include both bonds and equities) and controlled-risk funds
(those which use futures and options),' she says.
But investors face the problem of choosing a fund that turns out to be last
year's fashion. If the fund shrinks, as investors move on to the latest fad,
it becomes difficult for the manager to produce a strong performance,
because he is forever having to sell investments to meet redemptions.
Furthermore, fund management groups have a natural incentive to put their
best managers in charge of their largest funds, so investors in a small fund
can lose out.
So what scope is there for an industry shake-up? Some managers may be happy
to carry on as they are. 'Many of the small trusts are managed by
private-client stockbrokers and portfolio managers who have set them up for
their own clients,' says Delaforce. 'Brokers find it more profitable to run
their own unit trusts than to sell someone else's'
For the moment, most groups in the unit trust industry are enjoying the good
times, as funds flow in at the rate of around Pounds 1bn a month. The
pressure to rationalise, which must have been intense in a bear market like
that of 1990, has eased.
But some companies have given up the ghost, as when insurance group Aetna
sold its trust range to Thornton fund managers. The most substantial recent
reorganisation occurred when Henderson merged with Touche Remnant. The
combined group quickly produced plans to streamline its trust range from 35
to a more manageable 21.
Although mergers require the approval of unitholders, there is normally no
reason for them to object. Most mergers are conducted on an offer-to-offer
basis, to leave a unitholder no worse off. If fund A, with an offer price of
100p, merged with fund B, with an offer price at 50p, then a unitholder with
1,000 units in fund A would find himself with 2,000 units in fund B.
However, there is a potential cost from government stamp duty, which is
deemed to be payable when trusts merge. This can discourage some managers
from rationalising their ranges.
What will probably halt the flow of fund launches is if managers achieve
success in selling the trusts that they have already. There are some signs
of this happening. 'Promoting your existing funds is becoming more
acceptable to clients, if you can show them a solid performance,' says
Fidelity's Delaforce, who in September launched a marketing campaign based
on the group's European fund.
M&amp;G has long used advertising campaigns which emphasise the success of some
of its long-running funds, such as the Recovery unit trust. It is currently
relaunching an old campaign  - 'The only three funds you'll ever need'  -
based on its Recovery, Managed and European Dividend funds.
A large fund can afford to spend more on marketing and attract more
investors. It will be perceived as a less risky choice, on the 'no-one ever
got fired for buying IBM' principle. It can also, once the annual management
fee has grown sufficiently, afford to attract investors by cutting the
initial charge. So by the year 2000, the industry may yet be leaner, more
efficient animal than it is now.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): More popular
now inflation is down - Bond and cash funds / There's a prospect of capital
growth, income or both. But high yields may eat up capital, so investors
should know what they are buying

UNIT TRUSTS in the UK have been dominated by equities, with bond and cash
unit trusts accounting only for a small proportion of the industry. The
reverse is true in the US, where the mutual fund industry is weighted in
favour of bond and money market funds.
The reasons for this are largely historical. 'The UK unit trust industry was
started with an equity fund,' explained Victoria Nye, of the Association of
Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF). 'The public in the UK has been
able to find low-risk savings at the building society, and could in any case
buy gilts directly.'
The advantage of buying gilts  - UK government bonds  - directly is that the
charges are lower than for unit trusts. The commission on a gilt purchase
bought through the Post Office is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250, then
50p for every extra Pounds 125 or part. Those who buy large amounts through
a stockbroker are also likely to pay less than for a unit trust, where the
usual charges are a 5 per cent initial fee and a 1 per cent annual
management charge.
There is also a tax disadvantage to buying gilts in a fund. Gains are liable
to capital gains tax, whereas gilts bought directly are CGT-exempt. The
AUTIF is lobbying to end this discrimination and, in its Budget submission
this year, has called for gilt funds to be made exempt from CGT.
It has also succeeded in securing a change which will make UK-based bond
funds more attractive to non-UK taxpayers. UK-based unit trusts do not pay
income gross but, from the start of the 1994 tax year, they will be able to
do so to non-UK taxpayers.
For those who do not have the time or the expertise to manage a portfolio of
gilts or other bonds, bond funds offer to take the hassle out of tricky
investment decisions. They have been increasing in popularity during a rally
in bond prices in the UK, thanks to low inflation and low short-term
interest rates. Net sales of UK and international fixed-interest funds
totalled Pounds 332.4m in the first half of the year, compared with Pounds
95.3m in the first half of 1992.
The trigger for the rally in the UK was sterling's departure from the
exchange rate mechanism, which led to a spate of interest rate cuts and to a
rise in bond prices. Interest rates have also started to fall in Europe,
again leading to capital gains for those holding international bond funds.
With UK base rates at 6 per cent, long-term gilts now yield more than cash,
a factor which has not been overlooked by income-seeking investors. Analysts
such as BZW do not expect the difference in returns between equities and
bonds to be as great in the 1990s as in the 1980s, and expectations are that
inflation will be lower in the 1990s  - factors which are favourable to the
sale of bonds.
Bond funds offer investors income, capital growth, or a combination of the
two. Some offer a high yield, which is achieved purely by eating up capital.
That might be attractive to some investors, but they should know what they
are buying. There are three main types of fixed-interest fund: UK gilt and
fixed interest, international fixed interest and offshore bond funds.
UK gilt and fixed interest funds: Most of these are dominated by gilts, but
some also invest in the fixed-interest shares of companies. Since a company
is more likely to go bust than the government, the increased risk is often
reflected by a higher yield.
The top two performers in the three years to September 1, according to
Micropal, were: Abtrust Fixed Interest (84 per cent growth with net income
reinvested; current yield 7.1 per cent) and Aetna Preference (69 per cent;
7.7 per cent). These invest heavily in preference shares, which pay a fixed
dividend and rank ahead of ordinary shares in terms of dividend payment and
capital repayment in the event of a wind-up.
International bond funds: These are not confined to investing in UK-issued
fixed-interest bonds, but also deal in those issued by foreign governments
and corporations. They are considered to be riskier than UK bond funds,
because of the added currency factor.
European bonds are currently regarded as attractive, because interest rates,
which are higher on the Continent than in the UK, have begun to fall, and
this should lead to capital gains. Managers of a high-income fund are likely
to be heavily invested in the high-yielding bond markets such as Italy and
Spain.
The highest performing funds in the one year to September 1, according to
Micropal, were: Guinness Flight Global High Income bond (44 per cent growth
with net income reinvested; 7.6 per cent yield) and Invesco International
bond (38 per cent; 5.5 per cent).
Offshore bond funds: Their main advantage to UK investors, particularly
non-taxpayers, is that income is paid gross. A UK-resident non-taxpayer does
not need to reclaim tax from the Inland Revenue, which is what they would
have to do if they invested in an onshore bond fund.
Even resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may find offshore bond
funds attractive, because the tax payment can be delayed. Investors worried
about risk should look for offshore bond funds which are recognised by the
Securities and Investments Board  - the chief regulator for the financial
services industry in the UK.
Performance figures for offshore funds are usually quoted on an
offer-to-offer basis. This is because some funds have a single price but add
on an initial charge, so if all funds were ranked on an offer-to-bid basis,
the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. However, the
effect of quoting in this way is that the performance figures are better
than the returns which would actually have been achieved by an investor.
The highest performing sterling fixed-interest offshore bond funds in the
three years to September 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright, were:
Hypo F&amp;C RA Sterling bonds (72 per cent growth, no yield and Barclays
Sterling bond (72 per cent growth; 8.5 per cent yield).
Cash unit trusts: Unlike the bond funds, these do not invest in
fixed-interest securities but in the money markets, where money is bought
and sold for short periods by institutions and rates change daily. Yields
are quoted net of charges.
The main advantage is that a higher rate is paid on a lower minimum than can
easily be found at bank or building societies. Speed of access is similar to
a postal account.
The fund with the highest return in the year to September 1, according to
Micropal, was LAS Maximum Distribution, with growth of 5.85 per cent. The
second best trust - Lazard Money Market  - grew by 5.84 per cent.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Performance
takes priority over cost - Charges / A good fund manager will be able to
make up the initial charge to investors over time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CHARGES that investors have to pay when they put money into a unit trust
are relatively transparent  - particularly when compared with insurance
products, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Ironically, it is partly because of this transparency that many investors
think they are too high; and, in the past few years, some providers have
responded by cutting some of their charges. The element of competition that
they have introduced into the market has fed through into an existing debate
about how it ought best to structure its charges.
The charges an investor faces are:
THE ANNUAL CHARGE
Since a unit trust is a managed fund, it charges an annual fee for the
manager's services, which is usually in the region of 1-1.5 per cent each
year. The higher the annual fee, the greater the chunk of the investment
taken out by the manager to pay for research costs, software and the
manager's salary. Investors must also pay ancillary charges for services
such as trusteeship; in total, these are normally well under 1 per cent.
THE INITIAL CHARGE
This covers the costs of setting up the investment, which includes
administration, paperwork and the commission paid to the intermediary
selling the trust. The last is in the region of 3 per cent. The initial
charge is usually between 5 and 6 per cent. So, from an outlay of Pounds
1,000, only Pounds 950 would actually be invested if the initial charge were
5 per cent.
For many unit trust companies, the problem in reducing the initial charge is
how to sell the product without paying the 3 per cent commission to an
intermediary to do it for them.
The alternatives are an expensive advertising campaign, strong performance
to attract investors (which most members of the public are unlikely to be
aware of without the help of their financial adviser) or building up a
sufficiently large fund so that costs can be covered by the annual
management fee.
A handful of investment houses have managed to reduce their initial charge.
Lazard cut the initial charge on its unit trusts altogether in 1988. Last
year, Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund manager, reduced its initial charge
from 6 per cent to 1 per cent. However, it partially compensated itself by
increasing the annual management fee from 1 to 1.5 per cent. Lazard also
charges an annual fee of 1.5 per cent.
Bond funds usually have a much lower initial charge  - in the region of 3
per cent  - because the cost of dealing in gilts and bonds is lower than
that on equities. Cash unit trusts often have no initial charge at all.
THE BID/OFFER SPREAD
Investors buy units at one price (the offer) and sell at another (the bid
price). The offer price is always higher than the bid price.
The difference between the two prices is known as the bid/offer spread, and
is expressed as a percentage of the offer price. A typical bid/offer spread
is usually about 6 per cent, but it can be wider. The cancellation price,
which applies when the fund is shrinking and the manager is forced to sell
investments, is the minimum bid price.
Many investors think the initial and annual charges are the only ones to
worry about and ignore the bid/offer spread, which is the true cost of
investing in the fund.
The spread includes the initial charge but also the costs of buying and
selling the underlying investments (which will often have their own
bid-offer spreads).
Offshore companies have a single price (ie no bid-offer spreads) but the
investor pays their initial charge separately. This is known as single
pricing. Many in the industry, particularly those with plenty of offshore
funds, have argued that single pricing would be a simpler and clearer way of
quoting charges, and would bring the industry in line with the rest of
Europe.
The advantages of single pricing are not clear-cut for investors. Some argue
that the true costs of creating new units are not passed on to new
investors, imposing a burden therefore on existing investors. Under single
pricing, existing unitholders would have to meet the costs of shrinking or
expanding the fund when demand and supply do not match. Under the current
system, new and departing investors pay those costs through the bid-offer
spread.
'Single pricing would favour short-term investors at the expense of those
investors taking a longer-term view, not something that the industry should
be seen to encourage,' said Alan Maidment, managing director of Martin
Currie unit trusts.
The single-pricing debate is far from resolved. More pressing is the
question of changes to the rules to permit unit trusts to introduce exit
charges  - a well-established US practice which could enable funds to reduce
their initial charge and would encourage long-term investment.
The regulations do not stop this method of charging for unit trusts held
within a personal equity plan.
Fidelity was the first to do this by cutting its initial Pep charge from
5.25 per cent to 2 per cent, while imposing an exit fee of 3 per cent in the
first year, declining steadily to zero after three years. The move was
followed by Gartmore and Scottish Equitable.
Although charges are important, performance takes priority. A good fund
manager will be able to make up the cost of the initial charge to investors
over time, while a fund with low charges but weak performance will make far
less money for the investor.
However, by investing in a fund with low charges, the investor should be
tilting the odds in his favour.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): The easy route
can take you into Europe - Personal Equity Plans / Peps were meant to
encourage private investment in UK equities, but the rules have been widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF unit trust Peps have boomed since collective funds were made fully
eligible for personal equity plan investment. They are an easy way for small
investors to get exposure to a spread of shares, and their tax advantages
have provided an extra incentive, writes Bethan Hutton.
Every adult in the UK is allowed to invest Pounds 6,000 in each tax year in
a general Pep, and an additional Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep.
Income and capital gains from these investments are tax-free. A general Pep
can be used to invest in individual company shares, unit trusts or
investment trusts, but a single-company Pep cannot be used to invest in a
unit or investment trust.
When the government first introduced Peps, in 1986, the stated aim was to
encourage private individuals to invest in UK equities. That has now been
widened to include the rest of the EC, but investments still have to be
equity-based. This means that at least 50 per cent of the fund must be
invested in equities, which rules out most specialist bond funds. A ruling
on this point, earlier this year, has led to a mushrooming of funds which
generate as much income as possible by investing up to the maximum
permissible 49 per cent in bonds or other fixed-interest securities, in
addition to a base of equities.
Another limitation is that Peps cannot be used to invest more than Pounds
1,500 in collective funds that have a majority of their assets outside the
EC. 'You are restricting yourself in terms of geographic areas,' warns
Graeme Farquharson, investment director at Hill Martin. Some of the most
popular and best performing unit trusts invest in the US, the Far East or
other emerging markets.
The easiest route into a unit trust Pep, and the one chosen by the majority
of investors, is through one of the schemes offered by the large unit trust
management groups, which allow you to invest in one or a selection of their
funds. However, if you want to split your investment between trusts from a
number of different groups, you could use a self-select Pep, managed by an
independent third party, but this can be an expensive option as you also pay
the manager's charges.
Unit trust Peps are frequently used as savings vehicles for school fees
planning, particularly through the monthly savings schemes offered by many
unit trust groups. Pep mortgages are also an option that is catching on, as
doubts about the universal suitability of endowments spread.
Farquharson favours the phased-investment option offered by some unit trust
groups: a lump sum is entrusted to the managers, who then drip-feed it into
the fund over a period of six to 12 months. This avoids putting the whole
lot in at the what might be the top of the market, and so offers some
protection from one of the perennial risks of investing in equities.
A tax-free label on a financial product always attracts investors, but in
fact basic-rate tax payers would hardly notice the difference between a Pep
investment and a normal unit trust holding for the first few years.
'I am slightly concerned that Peps are being sold to people for whom the
advantage is so small that it is almost not worth it, bearing in mind that
you are restricting your choice,' says Farquharson.
If the full Pounds 6,000 allowance were invested in a trust yielding 5 per
cent, ie Pounds 300 a year, the total tax saving for a basic-rate taxpayer
would be just Pounds 60. Higher-rate taxpayers see more worthwhile savings:
Pounds 120 in this example, though of course many funds yield considerably
less than 5 per cent. If the fund you choose is eligible for a Pep, and does
not charge any more for it, then you might as well take the tax-free route.
However, if there are additional charges, or you would otherwise have
invested in a non-qualifying fund, you need to think carefully about whether
the tax savings will outweigh the disadvantages.
The real benefits of a Pep only become obvious over the longer term,
particularly if the income is reinvested, as growth can roll up tax free.
Funds with very low yields  - for example, with a high proportion invested
in overseas equities  - will not benefit so much from the tax-free rolling
up of income, and so will not perform noticeably better through a Pep.
Capital gains tax is not an issue for the majority of small investors - and,
in any case, it would take a long time for most unit trusts to build up more
than Pounds 5,800 of capital gains from a Pounds 6,000 investment. However,
if the full Pep allowance is used every year, and the investments are left
untouched for several years, or the Pep is part of a wider investment
portfolio, then it can be a useful CGT shelter.
The potential flow of investors' money through the Pep route has inspired
unit trust groups to develop new products to attract Pep investors.
Innovations have focused on reducing the impact of charges, and maximising
income at a time of low interest rates on cash deposits.
Fidelity was the first unit trust group to introduce a unit trust Pep
charging structure that combines lower front-end fees with exit penalties if
the money is withdrawn in the first three years. Other companies have now
followed this route, which is intended to encourage investors to stick with
the unit trust over the long term.
Fidelity charges 2 per cent initially for Pep investments, whether lump sums
or monthly savings, compared with an initial charge of 5.25 per cent if the
investment is not made via a Pep. An exit fee of 3 per cent is levied if the
investment is withdrawn in the first year, 2 per cent within two years, and
1 per cent within three years. After three years, there is no exit penalty.
If the money is withdrawn by the executors of an estate, no exit fee is
charged. Investors also pay the standard annual management charges of 1-1.5
per cent.
Other companies offering similar charging structures for Peps on some of
their funds include Guinness Flight and Gartmore.
Several Pepable unit trusts have been launched this year which aim to
provide a high yield for investors looking for an alternative to building
societies, as interest rates have dropped. The Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial
Higher Income personal equity plan aims to offer a 10 per cent yield through
a complicated structure, which also uses derivatives to boost income.
The Cazenove Utility and Bond fund, also aiming for a high yield, has a very
low 0.2 per cent initial charge, and 0.5 annual charge, though Pep investors
pay an extra Pounds 35 up front.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Be patient if
you buy at the top / Alarm bells ring when private investors pile in. But
the industry believes this sales boom will be different, because it is
fuelled by those seeking income rather than capital gain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SEPTEMBER 16, 1992, may be known as 'Black Wednesday' to some, but it proved
a golden day for the unit trust industry.
Sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism led to the
ideal conditions for unit trust sales: a sharply rising stock market, and
falling interest rates.
The two factors are, of course, closely connected. Falling interest rates
relieved the pressure on corporate balance sheets, battered by years of
recession; they also, by reducing financing costs, promised an increase in
profitability. Add in the potential boost to exports from a devalued pound,
and there was scope for a sharp increase in earnings.
Lower mortgage rates also gave rise to hopes of a revival in the previously
moribund housing market, generally seen as the key to consumer spending.
Most important of all, lower interest rates made cash much less attractive
as an investment. Institutional funds accordingly flowed into bonds
(particularly, in the light of the subdued outlook for inflation) and
equities.
Crucially for the unit trust industry, private, as well as institutional,
investors, reacted to this trend. Once base rates had fallen to 6 per cent,
unit trusts were able to offer income returns which, when held tax-free
within a personal equity plan (Pep), were able to match and beat the best
returns from a building society, with the hope of capital growth thrown in
on top.
Furthermore, the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index and the even greater jump in
the share prices of smaller companies, have allowed unit trusts to produce
performance statistics which should impress even the most cautious small
investor. Over the year to September 1, the average UK equity growth fund
returned 40.96 per cent (offer-to-bid with net income reinvested: source
Micropal) and UK equity income funds returned 44.73 per cent.
All these factors have duly had their impact on both unit trust sales and
funds under management. In July 1992, gross sales of unit trusts were Pounds
600m, and net sales were minus Pounds 142m (ie companies repurchased more
units than they sold). By July 1993, gross sales were Pounds 1.63bn and net
sales were a positive Pounds 948m. Net sales for the first seven months of
the year were Pounds 5.25bn.
With the help of the impact of rising stock markets, the industry's funds
under management rose from Pounds 53.9bn at end of July 1992 to Pounds
78.8bn at the end of July 1993.
Alarm bells start to ring with seasoned stock market observers whenever
private investors start to pile into unit trusts. The previous sales peak
was in 1987, immediately before the stock market crash of October that year.
It is easy to see why private investors may be doomed to buy at the top of
the market. In part, it is because of their natural caution, which is often
overcome only by greed; temptation comes when your neighbour tells you he
has just doubled his money in shares. A sudden widening of investor interest
can create a surge in the market, by introducing additional demand. An old
US adage is to sell the market whenever your elevator boy starts passing out
stock tips.
But the unit trust industry seems to believe that this latest sales boom
will be different, because it is fuelled by investors seeking income, rather
than, as it was in 1987, by those chasing capital gain in ever more
speculative areas.
Dividends are much less volatile than share prices. In theory, therefore, an
income-seeking investor should be able to disregard a sudden fall in share
prices, provided he is satisfied that his dividend stream will be
maintained.
In practice, it remains to be seen whether investors will be sufficiently
stoical in the face of, say, a 20 per cent fall in share prices. In the US,
where interest rates fell both further and sooner than in the UK, there has
been an immense flow of savings from cash into mutual funds (the American
equivalent of unit trusts). Commentators are expressing great concern that
these new equity investors could have a destabilising influence on the
market.
However, there are grounds for hope that recently-recruited UK investors
will be more patient. The main reason is the popularity of Peps, in which
capital gains and income accumulate without tax. Net sales of unit trust
Peps were Pounds 1.6bn in the first half of 1993.
The phrase 'tax-free' has always had a seductive appeal for British
investors. Now that the tax-cutting 1980s seem to have given way to the
tax-raising 1990s, investors will be all the more keen to seek out tax
shelters such as Peps.
It is a UK tradition that tax changes are not retrospective. So, even if
some future government were to abolish Peps, money already invested in plans
would continue to accumulate tax-free.
Furthermore, the advantages of a Pep are much more apparent in the long term
than in the short term. It takes a while for dividends to grow sufficiently
for the income tax saving to be worth much more than pocket money (for
basic-rate investors, at least), and for profits to grow enough for the
investor to gain much from the capital gains tax exemption.
According to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, someone
who had invested Pounds 1,000 in the median UK equity income fund would have
seen his money grow to Pounds 21,945 over the 25 years to July 1; but had
the same fund been available in Pep form for 25 years, the investment would
have grown to Pounds 38,073.
All in all, there is a strong incentive, once Pep money is invested, not to
withdraw it. Provided the Pep regulations remain in place, therefore, the
unit trust industry can face the future with some confidence.
One area which the industry would like to exploit further is bonds. Bond
funds are a substantial part of the mutual fund industry in the US, but have
failed to catch on in the UK, perhaps because of inflation, perhaps because
of the impact of high initial charges on investor returns.
With inflation now low and long-term interest rates above short-term rates,
bond funds may have a chance to develop. Some managers, such as Fidelity,
have cut initial charges to attract investors. But the Association of Unit
Trusts and Investment Funds wants the chancellor to help out in next month's
Budget by allowing a Pounds 3,000 Pep-style allowance for gilts and
corporate bonds. A tax-free bond income would undoubtedly be attractive to
many retired investors.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): A mature
person's pursuit - Alternative investments, Starting in stamps, 1 / The past
10 years have seen a recovery in a stamp market that is still dominated by
serious collectors. On these pages we start a quarterly series of articles,

STAMP COLLECTING is cyclical, and the circles seem to be ever-decreasing.
Once upon a time, most boys, and a few girls, collected stamps. Then came
the teenage years and the stamp album was discarded.
In later life, with most of the major bills paid, some early enthusiasts
rediscovered the appeal of stamps and became serious collectors.
This is still the pattern, although today there are fewer young collectors.
Stamps are not the passion they were in the past but, fortunately for the
stamp trade, there are still enough new mature collectors to make this a
thriving activity. And in certain parts of the world, particularly the Far
East, stamp collecting has become a very big business.
It is not so much the shortage of collectors that has be-devilled the stamp
world in recent years as the blight of speculation. In the mid-1970s, stamps
 - traditionally a hobby, which incidentally happened to provide a safe,
solid, investment opportunity  - were taken over by aggressive marketing
men, who managed to persuade a gullible public that stamps, virtually any
stamps, were a rapidly appreciating commodity. The fact that they could be
taken legally out of the country at a time of exchange controls fed the
fever.
Prices roared ahead. The true collectors could not compete but the greedy
tumbled in. Then in 1980, inevitably, the bubble burst, and prices fell like
a stone. Many stamps, and in particular British stamps, are still fetching
less today than they were at the 1979 peak.
But since 1983 the market has been slowly recovering. It is dominated again
by serious collectors. And when something rare and exceptional appears,
competition is keener and prices are exceeding the estimates set by the
auction houses.
At Sotheby's last month, a fine, fresh, collection of British stamps,
estimated at up to Pounds 40,000, sold for almost Pounds 70,000,
significantly to a Singapore collector.
One consequence of the recession was that many stamp dealers, faced by
rising overheads and declining revenue, gave up their premises, and now work
from home, buying and selling through fairs, working for a group of regular
major clients, and using the salerooms. The auction houses are now the major
force in the stamp market, although, of course, leading dealers, such as
Stanley Gibbons and Harmers, are still active.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): When the penny
was black and Britain great
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ANYONE interested in starting a stamp collection, there could hardly be
a better time, writes Antony Thorncroft.
The instability is over; a slow upward trend is discernible, though prices
are still modest, especially for British stamps. For Pounds 2,000, or even
less, a year, a good collection could be assembled.
British stamps are the obvious field for the British collector (in the main,
nationals favour their own postal heritage). They also have the advantage of
attracting foreign collectors, because it was Great Britain, in 1840, which
issued the first stamp, the Penny Black, and got the whole enterprise going.
Most serious collectors specialise, and Great Britain offers myriad choices.
You could spend a lifetime investigating the Penny Black, collecting stamps
from the 12 printing plates (Plate 11 is the rarest, and a single Penny
Black from here could sell for well over Pounds 500), or multiples, or used
examples, or stamps in mint condition, or particular cancellation marks, or
Penny Blacks on letters, and letters to particular destinations. (These
days, there is much more interest in stamps on envelopes: they should never
be removed.)
A Penny Black on a letter posted on May 6, 1840, the first day of the new
postal system, is extremely rare and would fetch over Pounds 20,000. The
first Penny Blacks were issued in sheets of 240, each stamp bearing
different letters. You could spend years assembling such a complete sheet  -
and then sell it for up to Pounds 30,000.
In all, 68m Penny Blacks were issued in the nine months before it was
replaced by the Penny Red. The price of a single Penny Black depends on its
condition and its margins, but can range between Pounds 40 and Pounds 150,
moving up to Pounds 1,000 for a perfect uncancelled stamp. The average price
is perhaps Pounds 50  - still below the level of 1979. A pair of Penny
Blacks would be at least Pounds 150. One used after they were officially
withdrawn from circulation in 1841 would be valued at Pounds 1,000. In
stamps, the key factors are always condition and rarity.
The Penny Black was for letters weighing less than half an ounce. Anything
between that weight and an ounce needed a Twopenny Blue. These are much
rarer, and offer an even better investment opportunity. Their scarcity is
not yet reflected in their price  - Pounds 150 for a good example. Then came
Penny Reds (each worth around Pounds 1 today); the appearance of
perforations in 1854 (which eliminated the need to cut out each stamp with
scissors); and the later Victorian period which, according to Sotheby's
stamp specialist, Richard Ashton, has hidden potential.
He is especially interested in the Penny Reds issued over many years from
1858 on over 150 plates. You can buy 10 Penny Reds of this period for Pounds
1 at a stamp fair; but if you succeeded in acquiring a stamp from every
plate, your collection could be worth thousands of pounds. A word of
caution: some plates are rare and their stamps might cost Pounds 300.
In the 20th century, apart from freak oddities, the highest prices are paid
for the attractive Sea Horse Pounds 1 stamp of George V's reign, which can
sell for upwards of Pounds 800, and the Postal Union Congress stamp of 1929,
which sells for up to Pounds 350. Relatively few high-denomination stamps
have survived  - even an Edward VII or George V half-crown (12 1/2 p) stamp
is worth Pounds 50  - and they are collected. Stamps issued in the Channel
Islands during the German occupation in the second world war are much sought
after, as are the stamps those used by British consuls abroad, especially
those posted in South America.
But the really exceptional prices are reserved for aberrations. In 1988, for
example, the price of stamps was raised just before the decorative Christmas
issue went on sale. A few priced at the old 13p escaped on to the market and
are now valued at Pounds 3,500. A genuine error, with the Queen's head
printed upside down, can tempt Pounds 1,000 from some collectors, and stamps
missing a colour sell for up to Pounds 100. Everything depends on buyers'
fanaticism.
Stamps have been collected since 1840, and there is no shortage of
information, or advice, for the new enthusiast. Stanley Gibbons produces a
catalogue listing all the stamp issues of Great Britain. One word of
caution, though: the prices listed against stamps by Gibbons are their
retail selling price. Many stamps at auction go much more cheaply.
Anyone seeking to acquire each stamp variety (Gibbons reckons there are
three distinct versions of the Penny Black) is hunting down 1,666 stamps at
the last count. This complete representation of the British postage would be
worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if it ever came on to the market, an
unlikely eventuality.
In recent years, the government has attempted to raise revenue by issuing
numerous sets of colourful commemorative stamps each year. They are worth
collecting, especially for, and by, children, if only to give them a feel
for the game. Most of the sets issued in the past 30 years are currently
priced by dealers at up to 80 per cent of their face value, but over time
they might show a modest appreciation.
Speculation ruined the stamp market in the 1970s, and no one wants stamps to
become again an object of pure investment. They should only be collected by
genuine enthusiasts. As knowledge grows, they offer a fascinating, unending
hobby. And history, apart from the few rogue years, suggests that
intelligent and discriminating collecting will, over time, prove a sound
investment.
In the next issue of the Review, Antony Thorncroft will look at the area of
collecting that has provided most price excitement in recent years: the
stamps of Hong Kong, China and the Far East.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Alarm starts a
strategic withdrawal from the US - The professionals / The four also remain
gloomy about the grip of recession on Europe's economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALARM BELLS are ringing over US bond and equity markets, as far as our
professionals are concerned. As they edge money cautiously back into
Europe's equity markets, it is only in the markets of south-east Asia that
confidence rings through.
The gloomiest view came from Newton's Howard Beaufort  - perhaps not
surprisingly, since he has often confessed to a pessimistic tendency: 'We
retain a higher than normal bond weighting, favour the Far East, and
consider many of the other equity markets of the world to be approaching
boiling point.'
Even more pungently, he warns: 'When financial analysts, brokers and
investors begin to justify equity investment on the basis of 'where else do
I put my money?' the alarm bells are beginning to ring. It may not be 1987,
but I have checked under my seat for the life jacket.'
Already, a price has been paid for maintaining high levels of exposure to
the US market: it was the poorest performer of all the equity markets over
the past quarter, offering sterling gains of just 0.1 per cent. This
compared with 15.8 per cent in Germany and 9 per cent in France.
No wonder Paul Myners, at Gartmore, commented that the size of US holdings
in the portfolio was 'the one decision that mattered' in the past quarter:
despite a 5 percentage point cut in June, his investor had 17.5 per cent of
the portfolio in the US markets  - the largest share of any of the
portfolios. Mercifully, US equity holdings were in small companies, which he
says outperformed the market by 4 per cent.
Each of our professionals plans further dilution in the US, with Baillie
Gifford and Gartmore disposing of their entire US bond holdings, Newton
trimming bond holdings, and Singer &amp; Friedlander paring its equity stake.
They also remain gloomy about the grip of recession on Europe's economies.
But, with the exception of Newton, they are more sanguine about prospects
for equity markets. The conviction remains strong that interest rates must
fall  - even in France: 'We are surprised by the slow rate of interest rate
reductions in Europe, and believe that the pain is now such that significant
future falls are likely,' comments Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander.
Our professionals are also beginning to concentrate their bond holdings in
the UK, where yields match those in Europe, without the currency risk. With
US interest rates now as low as they can go, and long bond yields lower than
they have been for 30 years, the consensus is to get out of the market.
At Baillie Gifford, Douglas McDougall continued to benefit from holding no
US equities, and from concentrating holdings in south-east Asia and Europe.
His only change ahead of the year's final quarter is to unload his 7.5 per
cent holding in US bonds, and build his UK long-bond holding to 17.5 per
cent.
'The interest rate cycle is at its most advanced stage in the US and long
yields, below 6 per cent, are the lowest for 30 years,' he notes: 'With the
continuing favourable outlook for inflation in the UK, and the prospect of
further cuts in short interest rates, long gilt yields should have scope to
fall.'
In equities, he sees the US market as 'very fully valued', sees no reason to
re-enter a Japanese market where companies face 'a serious loss of
international competitiveness' as the yen has strengthened, and points to
the dynamic markets of south-east Asia as offering 'superior' performance to
those in the old industrial world.
At Gartmore, Paul Myners has restored his usually bearish view of gilts by
disposing of his US and UK bond holdings. He believes US bond yields 'have
overshot', and prefers to hold US dollar cash in expectation of a rally in
the currency in the quarter ahead.
In the UK, his decision is coloured by a conviction, not shared by his
fellow professionals, that interest rates have bottomed: 'There seems little
left to go for in the gilt market,' he says.
A boost in European equity holdings to 10 per cent is to be funded by the UK
gilt sale. He feels the recent relaxation of the constraints on the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism should enable much more relaxed monetary policies to
be adopted: 'This should lead to considerable appreciation,' he says.
Rather than confine European equity stakes to specific markets, he will in
future merge the holding, now up to 10 per cent of the portfolio. This will
allow him to pursue a policy of stock selection, since he feels growth will
come from individual equities, rather than from broad markets.
At Newton, Howard Beaufort proposes 'no major changes in a defensive
portfolio'. He has switched his 5 per cent holding in French bonds into UK
gilts, in view of better yields and no currency risk. He has trimmed his US
bond holding by one percentage point to 4 per cent, and pared cash back to 1
per cent. Bonds account for 21 per cent of the portfolio, and are likely to
continue to do so while prospects for low inflation remain good and equity
markets so fully valued. He has added 1 per cent to his 8 per cent Swiss
equity holding, in spite of a conviction that the European economies are 'in
a mess', with the expected recovery 'a long time coming'.
He has added 2 per cent to his equities in Hong Kong and south-east Asia,
lifting this stake to 8 per cent: 'There will inevitably be periods of
consolidation, but we remain convinced that this area will produce
attractive equity returns.'
Singer &amp; Friedlander's Tim Howe rues the fact that his bond holdings were
concentrated on the continent of Europe  - where earlier interest-rate cuts
had been anticipated  - rather than UK gilts, where performance has been
stronger. But he felt that his overweight exposure to equities should have
resulted in outperformance: 'A scenario of improving growth and loose
monetary policy suggests equities as the most rewarding investment.'
He continues to favour Asia's smaller equity markets, but suggests taking
profits in Hong Kong, and concentrating on Singapore and Malaysia.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Regions will
diverge as the rally slows - Bonds / The US is out of recession, but Germany
hasn't bottomed. And European markets should be assessed on an individual
basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR, it has been a bumper year for international bond investors, and
while the three-year global bond rally appears to be slowing, most observers
say it is still far from over.
Bond yields worldwide have slid sharply, and, amid sluggish growth and high
unemployment, continued disinflationary policies in most countries are
expected to pressure real and nominal yields further, keeping bond prices
firmly supported.
Moreover, given the high valuation of most equity markets, the
attractiveness of fixed-income investments remains intact. 'If you don't buy
bonds, what are you going to buy?' asks Philip Saunders, fixed interest
investment director at Guinness Flight Global Asset Management.
However, increasing regional divergences  - with the US economy well out of
recession, while Germany still hasn't bottomed  - will affect global bonds
and currencies very differently in coming months.
While the the end of the easing cycles in the US and Japan is in sight,
European bonds are likely to benefit from further easing. However, Europe's
markets should be assessed on a more individual basis since August 2, when
the fluctuation bands for most currencies in Europe's exchange-rate
mechanism were widened to 15 per cent.
In many countries, the effective suspension of the ERM brought to light the
fundamentals that the old-style system had masked. A case in point is
Belgium, which was considered a hard-core currency thanks to its peg to the
D-Mark, but whose bond market has come under increasing pressure as its
underlying problems  - spiralling debt and political uncertainty  - have
become more apparent.
Nevertheless, 'Europe still has considerable mileage, partly because real
interest rates are still quite high by historical comparison,' says Mr
Saunders.
For unhedged sterling-based investors, currency considerations indicate that
'they couldn't do much better than by staying in the UK,' says Julian
Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. For one, gilts
offer attractive yields compared with most European core markets. In early
October, the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 yielded some 97 basis points over
Germany's 6.5 per cent Bunds due 2003.
Moreover, Mr Jessop says that, despite higher-than-expected August RPI,
underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued. Lastly, he notes that the
currency is undervalued.
'With economic recovery under way in the UK and most continental economies
in recession, sterling has scope to appreciate against most European
currencies on a three- to six-month view,' agrees Nick Henderson, head of
fixed interest at Gartmore Investment, which manages about Pounds 1.4bn in
its bond funds.
Gartmore's Henderson favours gilts with maturities between seven and 10
years, which, he says, stand to benefit most from further interest-rate
cuts. Although the bulk of issuance is being done at the intermediate part
of the yield curve, the fact that roughly two-thirds of this year's
estimated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is already funded
indicates that the market will absorb further supply with relative ease.
For those investing in currency-hedged funds, other European bond markets
may offer even better returns, however.
Many fund managers are still keen on high-yielding Italian bonds, which have
been Europe's star performer in the past two quarters. The combination of a
weak economy, improving inflation prospects and fiscal tightening is
expected to lead to substantial interest-rate cuts, further boosting bond
prices and narrowing Italian bonds' yield gap over other markets. At the
beginning of the month, Italian 10-year bonds currently yielded some 310
basis points over German bunds and 215 over 10-year gilts.
The only cloud on the Italian horizon is political uncertainty amid the
current budget debate and ahead of national elections, expected next spring.
However, the market is widely expected to recover from any sell-off,
supported in the long term by its solid fundamentals.
Some 25 per cent of Guinness Flight's Dollars 25m European bond fund is
invested in Italy, says Mr Saunders. Another quarter is invested in Ecu
bonds, which 'trade in a similar fashion to French bonds but offer a
reasonable yield pick-up.' Some 40 per cent of the fund's currency exposure
is in sterling, 40 per cent is in Italian lire and 20 per cent in Swedish
kronor.
TO INVESTORS shying away from Europe's higher-risk high-yielders, French
bonds still offer an attractive alternative among the hard-core markets.
Bond strategists at UBS expect French bonds to outperform Germany, with the
yield on French 10-year bonds seen falling as much as 30 basis points below
its German counterpart as the Bund rally stalls.
In many markets, the absence of inflationary pressures, prospects for a
sustained period of low short-term rates andinvestors' desire to boost their
returns will act as powerful incentives for moving along the yield curves,
note economists at SG Warburg Securities.
Meanwhile, many investors are reducing their bond exposure to the US and
Japan. The two markets make up only 20 per cent of Guinness Flight's global
bond fund, with European bond markets accounting for the remaining 80 per
cent, though the fund's currency exposure is dollar-oriented, with 65 per
cent exposed to the dollar bloc, 10 per cent in yen and the rest in a mix of
European currencies.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): I'm tempted to
convert the lot into cash / With political uncertainties and record p/e
ratios, the past two years' progress cannot be sustained. But interest rates
offer a poor alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON

<TEXT>
THE PORTFOLIO is now two years old. It was started with Pounds 10,000 in
October 1991, when I was given instructions to 'aim for capital growth,
without being too speculative'.
That aim seems to have been achieved. But I feel it will be difficult (if
not impossible) to maintain a similar rate of growth over the next two
years. With continuing uncertainties in Russia and elsewhere in the world,
and with price/earnings ratios of UK and US companies approaching record
levels, I am very tempted to convert the entire share portfolio into cash.
However, bank interest rates are currently at very low levels, so the
portfolio would not derive much growth from being purely in cash. There are,
no doubt, short-term gains to be made from foreign currency speculation, but
this has to be ruled out, due to the modest size of the portfolio and the
need to avoid the highly speculative risks that will be required to make any
really significant profits.
The portfolio will therefore protect itself from any sharp drop in the
market by setting revised stop-loss levels for all its equity holdings. It
will also seek to take advantage of any buying opportunities that might
arise in the event of a general market downturn.
The portfolio originally bought 8,000 Burlington shares in October last year
when they were only 11.5p each. It then sold 4,000 shares in March when the
shares reached 27p. Thus, the initial Pounds 920 invested in Burlington has
already produced cash of Pounds 1,080. The portfolio's remaining 4,000
Burlington shares can therefore be regarded as a purely speculative holding,
in the hope that a takeover approach might be made for this small company.
Even at 22.5p, the company is only capitalised at Pounds 3.33m. In its
interim report for the six months to the end of June, the company revealed
net assets per share of 18.78p. These were mainly a portfolio of equities,
gilt-edged stock, convertibles and cash. The portfolio will therefore retain
its earlier stop-loss level for Burlington of 20p.
Although the shares would be sold if they fell to that level, consideration
will be given to buying up to 20,000 Burlington shares if they fall to
around 12-14p, in the hope that, one day, a takeover may happen. (My
personal pension scheme has been buying and selling Burlington shares since
1989).
Norcros, too, were originally purchased on takeover hopes. When MB-Caradon
sold its stake in Carnaud Metalbox for Pounds 473m in April this year, I had
hoped it would use some of the proceeds to launch a bid for Norcros, because
the two companies had many interests in common. Instead, Caradon paid Pounds
800m to purchase RTZ's Pillar subsidiary. I feel Caradon is unlikely to pay
much (if any) attention to Norcros until it has digested Pillar. Although
Norcros still has much to recommend it, I feel the takeover potential has
faded, and the shares will be sold if they fall to 168-170p which, in
current market conditions, seems highly likely. It is this anticipated sale
that will realise cash for future purchases of shares in other companies.
Pentland's performance has been rather better than the table would appear to
indicate  - since, in April, the company paid its shareholders a special 12p
per share dividend in order to distribute to them the majority of the Pounds
47.3m exceptional profit which it made from currency gains associated with
its aborted bid for Adidas.
I still regard Pentland as a good long-term hold, although if the shares
fell to 80-85p they would be sold in the hope of being able to buy them back
at lower levels.
My personal pension scheme has a holding in Pentland. It also has a holding
in William Ransom, which I still regard as a well-run company with excellent
long-term prospects. But, for the portfolio, I will set a stop-loss level of
50-53p  - again in the hope of being able to buy back at lower levels.
I remain equally impressed with chemicals group Allied Colloids and
engineering group EIS, despite tough trading conditions. However, the
portfolio would sell its holding in Allied Colloids if the shares fell to
205-210p and its holding in EIS if the shares fell to 365-370p.
What would the portfolio buy? Nothing, at current levels. The portfolio has
benefited in the past by being patient and waiting for shares in certain
companies to fall within its desired buying range, and it hopes to repeat
that process.
In earlier articles, I have mentioned Meggitt, an engineering company which
I feel still has many attractions, desite its rather disappointing recent
results. Although the shares have not yet fallen within the earlier target
range of 75-80p, I feel a general market downturn could eventually push them
to that level, at which point the portfolio would consider purchasing 2,000
shares.
In the spring issue, I mentioned Renishaw, a manufacturer of precision
metrology and inspection equipment, as a potential buy if the shares fell to
240-250p. Again, they have not fallen to that level, despite recent results
showing a 21 per cent drop in pre-tax profit and difficult trading
conditions. Bear in mind that the shares were only 208p earlier this year.
The portfolio will therefore consider buying 1,000 Renishaw shares if they
fall to around the 205-210p level.
I particularly like OIS International Inspection, and was fortunate in that
a friendly stockbroker recommended them to me when the shares were placed on
the stockmarket last year at 50p each, and my personal pension scheme
acquired a modest holding.
OIS provides technical inspection services to industrial clients to assist
them in meeting regulatory requirements regarding safety, environmental
risk, and component and systems failure. This seems to me to be a major area
for growth, and the shares have already reached 79p this year.
Despite such a rise in price, I feel OIS still has further potential, and
the portfolio will consider purchasing 3,000 shares if the price falls to
60-65p.
OIS might also have takeover attractions to a company like Inchcape, which
operates the world's second largest testing and inspection service.
There are many other companies in the UK and abroad that have considerable
appeal, from Dole Food Company of the US and Hi-Tec (sports footwear and
leisurewear) to a number of small, relatively unknown companies. But I feel
the time is not yet ripe for further purchases, and it will be the next
issue of the Review before I feel able to offer a more detailed strategy for
the portfolio.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Quarterly Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary

suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too
speculative. The opinions expressed are his own.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): US markets
remain listless in the heat of summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS sweltering 90-degree weather in New York for most of the summer, and
US stock markets seemed to wilt in the heat. While bond prices surged in the
third quarter, because of low inflation and weak economic growth, the
markets' leading equity securities stood virtually still.
Between July and September the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 1.1
per cent to 3,555.12, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced only 1.8
per cent to 458.93. Smaller company stocks, however, enjoyed a better run  -
the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 8.3 per cent to
762.28.
The pattern of trading and the state of investor sentiment were little
changed from the previous quarter. The fundamentals of the stock markets
were neither especially good nor bad  - the economy, which grew only
modestly in the period, continued to perform poorly by historic standards.
Inflation remained unthreatening, and corporate earnings improved, but not
particularly impressively.
Equities, however, were again supported by low interest rates, which
continued to force investors to shift money out of low-yielding short-term
assets in a search for higher returns. Much of that money flowed into the
equity markets via mutual funds.
The period started with investors in an extremely skittish mood. Prices
gyrated wildly amid uncertainty about the economic outlook, and growing
unease about the immediate future for stocks and bonds. Speculation about a
possible sharp downward correction in financial markets cast a cloud over
trading for the first few weeks.
By late July the second quarter reporting season was in full swing, but the
picture of corporate profitability was not clear enough to provide stocks
with a substantial lift. There was good news from the likes of Sears
Roebuck, Citicorp and Merck, and bad news from IBM, Apple Computer and
Procter &amp; Gamble. IBM's share price fell to the lowest point since 1975 as
the ailing computer giant announced further redundancies and plant closures.
By the time the reporting season ended, the Dow had managed to reach new
highs. This was particularly impressive, considering the background noise
created by turmoil in Europe's managed currency system, an overheated gold
rally and the last-gasp victory in Congress for President Clinton's
deficit-reducing budget.
The fact that the tax increases in the President's budget did not unduly
damage stock market sentiment was mostly due to the positive response the
budget received from the bond market, where yields dropped to new lows. This
decline in interest rates was enough to keep investors' minds off having to
pay higher taxes to tackle the deficit problem.
By late August, the Dow had pushed through 3,600 for the first time, aided
by buoyant stock markets in Europe, where the currency crisis had given way
to widespread reductions in interest rates. Investors, however, failed to
build on the new highs. Cyclical and consumer goods stocks suffered as
economic concerns resurfaced, while fears about what President Clinton's
healthcare reform plan might do to the medical industry's profits undermined
pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks.
In September, leading share prices seemed stuck in a narrow trading range,
while secondary issues, somewhat neglected earlier in the year, staged a
comeback. As the quarter drew to a close, a rash of billion-dollar mergers
(in the banking, entertainment and health industries) lifted spirits, but
political unrest in Russia and slow economic growth at home kept prices
rooted.
In Canada, the market held its ground reasonably well despite disturbing
news on the economy and the autumn general election campaign. The TSE 300
composite index broke through 4,000 for the first time in the quarter, but
like the Dow, it fell back from its peak, ending at 3,990.6, up 0.6 per cent
on the quarter.
Mexican equities surged back from the disappointing second quarter, as the
Price and Quotations Index climbed 10 per cent to end at 1,840.72. Low
interest rates, low inflation, improved corporate earnings and the news that
Mexico, the US and Canada had reached various side deals on the North
American Free Trade Agreement all contributed to the market's advance.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Lufthansa's
take-off helps Germany to overfly Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MOST of the third quarter, continental Europe was the place to invest
big money, though its gains were checked in September.
During July and August, the summer holiday 'lull' was not in evidence.
European share prices, measured by the FT-A Europe ex-UK index, showed a
rise of 10.7 per cent in sterling terms for the three months to September
30, compared with gains of just 1.7 per cent in the US, and 3.7 per cent in
Japan.
On figures compiled by NatWest Securities, bourse turnover (including the
UK) followed a 20.3 per cent month-by-month gain in June with one of 20.8
per cent in July, and a further 5 per cent in August. Germany's equity
market showed share price gains of 16.7 per cent over the three-month
period.
There was a surge of international investment enthusiasm for the Continent,
and for Germany in particular. The slow descent in Germany's inflation and
interest-rate trends did not always move shares when it was expected to do
so; but, along with a perceived need for institutions to increase their
market weighting in the country, it defended the market against disillusion
and formed a background for special situation stories which lifted a number
of market leaders.
Among the top performing constituents in Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index,
Lufthansa, up 37.1 per cent in D-Mark terms, rose on its privatisation
prospects and on effective domestic political support. This produced an air
pact between the US and Germany, and saw Lufthansa announce, in the early
days of this month, a co-operation deal with United Airlines.
Other German leaders included: Schering, up 23.6 per cent on prospects for
Betaseron, a new drug to treat multiple sclerosis; Viag, the energy-based
conglomerate, facing what looked like a highly profitable merger with
Bayernwerk, the third biggest German utility; and Daimler-Benz, in its
approach to the New York share price quotation, which allowed it to disclose
earlier this year that up to DM4bn of profits, hidden away in provisions,
were due to be unveiled.
The general market enthusiasm did not continue into September. German
equities rose again, but only by 0.5 per cent in sterling terms. France fell
by 1.4 per cent in September and Italy by 6 per cent, while the Europe ex-UK
index fell by 0.5 per cent, resisting still-powerful performances from
Switzerland, and the Nordic bloc.
Hoare Govett, in an October, 1993 review, says that profit-taking was much
in evidence between July and September, along with interim reports focusing
investors' attention on corporate fundamentals  - which often meant losses
at a time of deep recession. Germany, in tandem, was troubled by a weaker US
dollar, threatening the profit-margins and recovery prospects of its
powerful exporting companies, and by concern over events in Moscow.
France was aware of the upcoming BNP privatisation issue, and a spate of
rights issues; indeed, the combination of governments raising money by
selling their stakes in major companies, and companies raising money by
rights issues, was beginning to haunt strategists at the end of the quarter.
Italy had seen a L5,000bn (over Pounds 2bn) cash-raising package from Fiat,
mostly in the shape of rights issues which, together with Mediobanca and
Italmobiliare share capital operations, represented the drainage of 'massive
liquidity' from the Milan equity market.
The December quarter opened just after the German metal industries employers
organisation had cancelled wage contracts for 1994 and provoked strike
threats from the labour union, IG Metall. At the same time, divisions of the
Russian army rolled into Moscow to put down the uprising, and gave bourses
the excuse to rise again.
However, there were still doubts. Most global strategists still favoured
some part of Europe at the end of September, and most of these liked France;
but Marcus Grubb, of Salomon Brothers, cast doubt on the French selection;
and Nicholas Knight, of Nomura, was moving his followers at the same time
into Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea and the Philippines.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): South Asia's
continued revels fail to awaken Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEAP ASIAN stocks became a rare commodity during the third quarter, as most
stock markets on the Pacific rim surged on rapid economic growth and low
interest rates, writes Emiko Terazono, in Tokyo.
However, while markets in southern Asia saw record levels, with Jakarta and
Manila rising around 60 per cent and Singapore and Kuala Lumpur also
soaring, the enthusiasm failed to spread to northern Asian markets, where
Tokyo posted a marginal rise over the quarter on the prolonged economic
slump, and Seoul lost ground on tightening of trading rules.
The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei index, which rose a mere 2.6 per cent over
the quarter to 20,105.71, despite a discount rate cut and a government
fiscal package, was plagued by weak economic figures, the high yen, and a
spate of corporate downward earnings revisions.
Share prices withstood the political turmoil and the end of the 38-year rule
by the Liberal Democratic party. However, investors were increasingly
depressed by a 0.5 per cent fall in real GNP growth during the quarter, and
leading blue-chips, such as Nippon Steel, revising downward earnings for the
current business year.
The new government's fiscal package, announced in September, mainly
consisted of a list of deregulation measures, and failed to excite
investors. And a 75 basis point cut in the official discount rate, to a
record low 1.75 per cent, also failed to move funds into the stock market.
Domestic support for shares has remained dull, and the quarter ended on a
gloomy note, with jitters over a plunge in stock prices spreading among
investors.
Seoul's 1.5 per cent fall to 718.87 over the quarter was due to the
government's anti-corruption campaign and the real-name system, implemented
this month. Over 30 per cent of the country's money supply is seen to be
supported by investments made in false names, to avoid taxes, and the
government's determination to stamp this out has depressed investor
sentiment.
While the rise in the yen against the won will help Korean exports to Japan
in the short term, uncertainty over the effects of the real-name system may
dampen consumer spending and capital expenditure.
The rest of the region saw increased buying by foreign investors, especially
US funds, which were encouraged by the continued economic growth of the
region. Singapore's Straits Times index rose 11.4 per cent over the quarter,
amid the government's 'Invest Singapore' campaign, which aims to get more
retail investors into the market.
The government wants the country's high savings to be shifted into the stock
market, ahead of the list of privatisations of state owned companies,
including Singapore Telecom.
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, which rose 18.3 per cent, may weaken during the
first quarter of next year, as the governments will be forced to tighten
credit during the period.
Nick Allan, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong Kong,
sees both Bangkok, which rose 10.7 per cent, as still having further to go,
as it has underperformed relative to other south-east Asian markets, and
monetary tightening is not expected to be implemented till the second or
third quarter of next year.
Jakarta, which gained 16.8 per cent, is also expected to be supported by
lower interest rates, after two years of tight monetary policy, and by
strong corporate earnings. However, he advises investors to take profits on
Hong Kong, which rose 8.1 per cent in the quarter. The market has
underperformed, due to the slowdown in China and political concerns. A
further increase in stock prices poses too much risk, says Mr Allan.
Firm corporate earnings supported the Sydney market, which jumped 13 per
cent over the quarter to 1,964.40. For the year ended last June, earnings
per share at industrial companies rose 20 per cent, while resources-related
companies saw an 8 per cent rise.
While capital investment remains weak and unemployment high, at 11 per cent,
widening profit margins due to restructuring efforts will support corporate
earnings, says Mr Ian Wenham, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Sydney. He
expects the All-Ordinaries index to rise to 2,250 over the next year.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Poised to take
the 'tidal wave' / Low returns on cash helped propel world stock markets to
record highs. Now come signs of a sharp increase in foreign investment by US
fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS another good quarter for well-placed fund managers, especially those
who went underweight in the three big markets of Wall Street, Tokyo and
London. For sterling investors in those markets the total return was,
respectively, 2.4, 3.9 and 6 per cent. The big action was elsewhere.
All but one (Canada) of the 24 national constituents of the FT Actuaries
World index ended the third quarter in positive territory, with continental
Europe doing particularly well. France reversed the negative outcome of the
second quarter, producing a total return of more than 10 per cent, as did
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The German market,
also negative in the April-June period, produced a gain of more than 17 per
cent.
These strong performances gave Europe, excluding the UK, a return of 11.5
per cent  - roughly in line with the Nordic countries, where Finland showed
an impressive 18.7 per cent return.
Elsewhere there were big advances in: New Zealand (20.5), Malaysia (28.4)
and Singapore (19.7). The overall world index, with its heavy weightings in
the US, Japan and Britain (more than half of the global 2,166 share
constituents), produced a modest total return of 4.8 per cent.
Japan, having powered ahead in the second quarter, returned just under 4 per
cent in the third, but on September 1 the Nikkei average had closed above
the 21,000 mark for the first time since early June. (But, for perspective,
it is as well to recall that the Nikkei stood at 38,915.87 on the last
trading day of 1989, a continuing burden for many fund managers.)
One seven-day trading period, at the end of August, produced record
headlines, with the Dow Jones industrial average, the London Footsie index
and the Paris CAC-40 hitting all-time closing highs. In Hong Kong, the Hang
Seng reached its record high on September 30, a rise of more than 40 per
cent on the year since January, and evidence that, for the moment at least,
political factors and the 1997 Chinese takeover of the colony are not
unnerving investors.
Much of the explanation for these records, and for the general advance
across most markets, lies in the weight-of-money argument. Lower interest
rates in the main economies meant lower returns on cash, and prompted savers
to switch into equities. Lower rates, at least in theory, should act as a
stimulus to economic growth, and stock markets are supposed to be adept at
anticipating better times ahead. Hence, the established investment adage to
buy on the rumour and sell on the fact.
Certainly, the news of economic recovery is patchy. Things are looking up in
Britain, while the US has been throwing up mixed signals, though generally
positive ones. Continental Europe is still looking rather bleak,
particularly in Germany and France, while the new Japanese government's
pump-priming of the economy (and an official discount rate cut to a mere
1.75 per cent in late September) is not expected to show any real results
until next year. The Tokyo stock market greeted both moves with little more
than a yawn.
Immediately more positive for the markets are signs of a sharp increase in
foreign investment by US fund managers  - a 'minor tidal wave', according to
the Connecticut consultancy, InterSec Research Corporation. American funds
have traditionally been very conservative about investing outside North
America, but many US analysts see a change in this strategy.
Yet bullish markets can often cloud reality, which is why the small punter
is usually investing when the big boys have taken profits.
Fundamentally, it is improving corporate profitability that underpins share
prices, and without rising profits there can be few increased dividends to
justify higher equity prices. The company reporting period has so far not
been encouraging in most markets.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Waiting for
the 'avalanche'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED OPTIMISM during third-quarter trading in London was based on
confidence that interest rates and inflation will remain low, while economic
recovery boosts company profits and dividends for the rest of this year and
next.
Investor confidence, displayed in high levels of volume in equities and
steadily rising sales of unit trusts, has survived a recovery in corporate
earnings that has in fact been disappointingly slow, as well as more obvious
shocks, such as the turmoil in Russia. If domestic interest rates have been
reluctant to fall, this has in no way dimmed belief that they will be cut
early in the final quarter.
The FT-A All-Share index gained 5.2 per cent over the period, compared with
a rise of only 1.7 per cent in the previous quarter. But the performances of
other market indices shows that, once again, the smaller stocks outpaced the
blue chips, as investors sought to maximise their benefit from the recovery
in company profits  - when it comes. The FT-SE 100 index, covering the top
100 stocks, added 4.7 per cent; the FT-SE Mid 250, adding a further 150
stocks, gained 6.1 per cent; Hoare Govett's Smaller Companies Index rose by
7.1 per cent.
By the end of the quarter, the London market, encouraged by strength across
other European bourses, was attracting strong demand from US institutions,
and clearly girding its loins for a fresh assault on the peak levels.
As investors waited for economic recovery to come through, the best gains
came in capital good shares, with the engineering, aerospace and
metal-bashing stocks all leading the way.
Interest-rate expectations continued to benefit the financial sector, where
merchant banks and property shares advanced. But investors shunned consumer
stocks, where stores, hotels and brewers have yet to disclose any great
improvement in consumer spending.
The third quarter corporate reporting season proved disappointing  - not
particularly poor, but not good enough to sustain market optimism.
Confidence in the profits outlook has now transferred itself to the fourth
quarter season, which will begin to unroll in January, apparently without
undue strain. Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London merchant banking and
securities firm, has assured clients that 'an avalanche' of profits
improvements is about to appear.
On the international front, the effective break-up of the original ERM
network has worked against the UK market, by increasing the likelihood that
interest-rate cuts in Germany and France will make their stock markets more
attractive. On this basis, US funds switched their attentions away from
London during September, and this could happen again.
Domestic investors believe base rates will be cut again before the end of
the year, but fund managers suspect they could move up again next year.
Pressures to cut rates this year owe a good deal to political pressures on a
UK government struggling with electoral unpopularity.
Rights issues in London totalled Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter,
confirming expectations and perhaps restraining the stock market. By the end
of the quarter, cash calls for the first nine months totalled more than
Pounds 10bn, and more calls are expected before Christmas.
Most forecasts for market performance in the final quarter are optimistic.
Nicholas Knight, of Nomura Research International, leads the field with a
prediction that Footsie will close at around 3,500. Other London firms
cluster around 3,200, with SG Warburg still cautiously holding to a forecast
of around 2,900.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Still
vulnerable to political upheaval - Investing in the Far East / The best
route is through a collective fund. But be wary, and seek growth rather than
income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARGUMENTS for investing in the Far East appear to be very clear to UK
investors, judging by the reception given to regional funds launched this
year.
The economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Phillipines are among the most dynamic in the
world. The marketing brochures spell it out with charts that show growth
rates in the region to be at least two or three times higher than in Europe
or the US, and forecast that they will continue that way. They speak of the
entrepreneurial spirit of the people, and how they are at the vanguard of
new technology, while keeping wages low.
Healthy economic growth is usually accompanied by equally health stock
market growth, and this has been the case in most of South East Asia. Stock
markets in the region have been buoyant this year  - several, including
Singapore, the Phillipines and Hong Kong, have been hitting all-time highs.
Funds investing in the Far East have been among the best performing in
recent years. If five years ago, on a hunch, you had put Pounds 1,000 into
the Gartmore Hong Kong unit trust, it would have grown to Pounds 3,332 by
now.
However, if, after hearing those arguments, you start to wonder why anyone
would want to invest in boring old developed countries, it may be time to
point out some of the downside. It is well known that high rewards do not
come without some level of risk  - and there are plenty of risks associated
with investing in the Far East.
For a start, there are the repercussions of political upheaval. When Chinese
troops went in to put down the student protest in Tiananmen square in 1989,
the Hong Kong stock market plummeted, as did several others in the region.
They rebounded in time, but Chinese political events and rumours can still
make the Hong Hong market jittery, and that is unlikely to change before
1997, when it reverts to Chinese rule. China is not the only problem; the
Phillipines still suffers political instability, there are occasional coups
in Thailand, and so on.
Because many of these economies are export-led, there is a knock-on effect
when the west goes into recession. The home markets are also developing very
fast, but they cannot always take up the slack when overseas sales fall off.
The currency exposure involved in investing in the area is also a risk - the
strong yen has contributed to the good performance of many Japanese funds,
but it can work the other way. For example, inflation in China, currently
running well into double digits, could force a devaluation of the renminbi,
which means that assets held in the Chinese currency would lose value for
foreign investors. Foreign investors can also face complications due to
currency exchange controls.
Another feature of even some relatively developed markets in the region is
that accountancy standards, information disclosure and insider trading
legislation are not quite what UK fund managers are used to. There are also
structural constraints on foreign investment in some countries. For example,
Korea allows a maximum of 10 per cent of any one company's stock to be held
by foreign investors, and Taiwan has similar rules. Sometimes there are ways
around this, for example locally registered funds can buy the stock, and
their shares are then bought by foreigners, but this can add to costs.
If you are looking for income, you would not be well advised to look East  -
dividends from south-east Asian markets are low or non-existent. Rather,
this is the place to put some of your money if you are not likely to need it
for a good few years. Managers of funds concentrating on the smaller markets
in the region tend to take a long-term view, and it is sensible for
investors to do the same. Short-term gains are possible, but not guaranteed,
as the markets can be volatile; however, the prospects for fundamental
economic growth are indisputable. If you ride the dragons and tigers for
long enough (and are not put off by the occasional tumble), you should come
out with substantial capital gains.
For the average UK investor attracted by the idea of devoting a corner of
the portfolio to the Far East, the easiest way is through a UK authorised
unit trust or investment trust. It is possible to buy shares in some
companies directly, but this is not a commonly-used option for private UK
investors.
UK authorised unit trusts are limited by law as to what proportion of their
funds they can invest in unrecognised stockmarkets  - this can be a
disadvantage for China funds, for example, as neither of the mainland
Chinese exchanges are recognised. There is also the risk of becoming trapped
in illiquid markets when investors start cashing in units.
Investment trusts are closed-end funds, ie investors buy and sell shares on
the open market rather than selling them back to the manager. This means
that the manager has more freedom to invest for the long term, without
worrying about whether enough of the portfolio is in very liquid stocks
which can easily be cashed in if investors panic and withdraw their money.
Charges are lower on investment trusts than unit trusts, but investors also
have to cope with fluctuating discounts to net asset value. Also, if a trust
falls very heavily out of favour, you may have difficulty finding a buyer.
As at September 1, there were 89 Japanese unit trusts, 46 in the Far East
including Japan, 62 in the Far East excluding Japan, and five in
Australasia. The funds had a combined total of Pounds 10bn under management.
The investment trust industry is slightly less prolific: there were 30 funds
covering the region, with a combined market capitalisation of Pounds 3.2bn.
Six funds invest in the whole of the Far East including Japan, eight exclude
Japan; seven invest in Japan alone; and nine invest in other single
countries in the region.
The current popularity of the area can be seen from the number of specialist
unit and investment trusts launched recently. This year's crop includes the
Fleming Chinese Investment Trust, the S&amp;P Asian Smaller Companies fund,
Rothschild's Five Arrows Asia Fund, HTR Japanese Smaller Companies, Dunedin
Japan Investment Trust, the Perpetual Japanese Investment Trust, the Govett
Greater China Fund and Jupiter Tyndall's China fund.
As the Japanese economy has matured, it has lost its dragon-like
characteristics, and is now settling down to more western-style growth rates
of 2 or 3 per cent, or even negative growth at times. Japan has regained
favour this year, as the strong yen has combined with a stock market
recovery from last year's low point of just over 14,000 to more than 20,000,
although the economy is still stagnating. However, anybody who put money
into Japan at the height of the stockmarket boom, when the index hit 38,000,
may feel less positive about the current state of the market.
China has been this year's favourite with many UK fund managers, despite
worries over whether its economy has been overheating out of control. Money
has been pouring into all the East Asian stockmarkets on the back of the
Chinese investment boom. Fund managers see the folly of trying to invest
large quantities of money in the miniscule mainland Chinese exchanges at
Shanghai and Shenzhen, so they have been scouring the lists of companies on
nearby exchanges  - particularly Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan  - looking for
'China plays'. The idea of precisely which stocks can be defined as a China
play varies from manager to manager.
Some have strict criteria: the company must derive a minimum of its profit
or turnover from China. Others take a more relaxed view, regarding almost
any stock on those exchanges as a China play, on the grounds that market
sentiment responds to events in China, and the economies of those countries
are becoming increasingly dependent on doing business with China.
The choice between single-country and more general funds investing in the
whole region is essentially one of risk levels. The former are far more
speculative  - they can do very well one year, but the next they could also
be found floating around the bottom of the performance tables, as there is
little fund managers can do if the market in their chosen country crashes.
Regional funds have the freedom to pull out of markets when they scent
trouble, and so can avoid the depths, but it is also difficult for them to
take full advantage of spectacular growth in individual markets, because
their funds can only put a minority of their money into any single country.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Regular savers
lend stability - Investment trusts / Discounts are at a 20-year low,
reflecting trusts' popularity with private investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUSTS passed another milestone during the third quarter of 1993.
In August, the average discount to net assets touched a 20-year low of 8.7
per cent. That represents an enormous improvement on the 40 per cent
discount at which trust shares traded in 1977, and indicates how far trusts
have succeeded in winning back the affections of private investors.
A good contrarian will naturally ask whether this represents the high point
of investment trust fortunes. Could a sudden reversal in the stock market
clobber investors with the 'double whammy' of falling assets and a widening
discount?
There have certainly been some signs of overheating in the trust market.
Many emerging-market trust shares, benefiting from being the investment
fashion of the moment, have traded at premiums to net assets; at one stage
in August, Templeton's emerging markets fund reached a 17.6 per cent
premium. Such a premium creates a lot of scope for disappointment.
However, there are reasons to hope that investment trusts will not return to
the wide discounts they suffered in the 1970s. The first is the existence of
savings schemes, which provide a steady drip of demand for trust shares.
Figures from Henderson Touche Remnant indicate that trusts with savings
schemes trade at around a 2 per cent smaller discount than trusts without
such schemes. Savings scheme investors, by their nature, tend to be more
willing to ride out the market's peaks and troughs.
Another factor is personal equity plans. The evidence seems to be that Pep
holders are more stable than other private investors, perhaps because they
want to use the tax shelter for long-term financial planning.
Finally, the trust sector has become increasingly specialised over the past
decade. Although the big international generalist funds still dominate the
industry, recent fund launches have either had a split-capital structure
(designed to attract private investors via tax efficiency) or been
geographical specialists (designed to attract institutional investors by
offering a service they cannot easily duplicate themselves). Such funds
tend, by targeting investor demand more closely, to trade at smaller
discounts than general funds.
FLEMING TARGETS CHINA THROUGH HONG KONG
IN THE Middle Ages, European merchants would dream of the riches they could
obtain by trading with the Orient. In the late 20th century, fund managers
dream of the returns they will make from investing in China, the world's
most populous country which some predict will soon be the world's biggest
economy.
There are plenty of statistics one can cite in favour of the Chinese option.
GDP growth was 12.8 per cent in 1992, well ahead of most other so-called
emerging markets, let alone the developed economies. The average factory
wage in China is Dollars 35 per month, compared with Dollars 950 in Hong
Kong and Dollars 1,919 in the US, giving the Chinese tremendous cost
advantages.
The origins of the investment trust industry lie in the opportunities
presented by such markets, so it is unsurprising to see Robert Fleming
launch a Chinese trust. The problem for such funds is that the onshore
Chinese stock market is tiny; there are only 30 listed companies with a
market capitalisation of Dollars 1bn.
Initially, therefore, the Fleming fund will have to invest a large
proportion of its assets in Hong Kong companies which derive their earnings
from China.
Some commentators are worried by the current investment fashion for China;
there are signs that the Chinese economy is overheating, with inflation
rising rapidly. But Fleming had little difficulty in raising Pounds 60m for
the trust, which will be available via its savings scheme.
F&amp;C CASTS ITS BREAD UPON THE WATER
JOHNSON FRY was the first financial services company to launch a utilities
investment trust earlier this year. Now Foreign &amp; Colonial has followed suit
with Suit  - the Special Utilities Investment Trust.
This unusual fund specialises in the former 'statutory water companies',
such as South Staffordshire and Bristol. These companies are not the
privatised water groups (such as Thames Water); they are responsible purely
for water, not sewage, and, until recently, their profits and dividends were
set by statute. Around 55 per cent of Suit's portfolio is in water stocks;
the remainder is in shares of other utilities.
The idea for Suit was formed when Duncan Savile, a substantial investor in
water company stocks, approached F&amp;C with the idea of swapping his holding
for investment trust shares. He has acquired capital shares in the trust,
which has a split-capital structure (the first time F&amp;C has launched such a
fund).
Private investors will probably be more attracted by the income shares,
which had an initial gross yield of 7.75 per cent and which are Pepable. As
well as the capital and income shares, there are package units, which can be
converted into one capital and one income share at any time.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Your capital
may look safer - but is it? - Distribution bonds / The point is that nervous
investors are reassured, because income does not reduce the number of units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRECIPITATE fall in base rates, from 15 to 6 per cent, has caused many
British investors to search frantically for new sources of income. The
current fashion for distribution bonds is accordingly no surprise.
Distribution bonds are single-premium, unit-linked investment bonds issued
by insurance companies. The manager can invest in a mix of shares, bonds and
property in order to generate income and capital growth.
The 'trick' of a distribution bond is the clear distinction between capital
and income. On a normal unit-linked managed investment bond, investors
generally take a 5 per cent income (usually described as tax-free although
that may not eventually be the case for top rate taxpayers).
This income is achieved by cashing in the requisite number of units. But if
the bond has not grown sufficiently (either through earning income, or
through capital gains), the investor could be eating into his capital. In a
prolonged bear market, this could become a serious problem.
appears to be eliminated. The income is distributed as a dividend, rather
like a unit trust, and is kept separate from the capital. 'We like
distribution bonds, because income can lose its identity within a
conventional managed bond,' says Clive Scott Hopkins, marketing director of
financial advisers Towry Law. 'In a distribution bond, the distinction
between capital and income is clear.'
But the benefit could be more psychological than actual. If you start the
year with 1,000 units at 100p each, and your fund grows at 5 per cent, it
makes no difference to your wealth, whether you have at the end of the year:
1,000 units at 100p, plus a Pounds 50 distribution cheque; or
952 units at 105p each, plus a cheque for Pounds 50 from selling 47.62 units
for 105p each.
Nevertheless, many investors get worried when they see their number of units
diminish, even if the value of their fund has gone up. The distribution bond
allows them to keep the same number of units, and, if they reinvest their
income, the number of units could actually rise.
Those who buy distribution bonds should not be deceived into thinking their
capital cannot fall. There will naturally be pressure on a distribution fund
manager to pay and maintain a high income. In order to do so, he might
invest in the kind of high-yielding investments which are, by their nature,
more risky, thus increasing the danger of capital loss.
However, Clive Scott Hopkins argues that distribution bonds are likely to be
a more stable form of investment. 'The success of Sun Life is due to its
fund's high fixed interest content, which has made it a more secure
investment than the average managed fund.'
Sun Life is generally accepted to be the leader in the distribution bond
market. The Sun Life bond was ranked second out of all managed insurance
funds over both the seven- and 10-year periods to September 1. Over the
latter period, it had produced a return of 292.5 per cent (offer-to-offer
with income reinvested: source Hardwick Stafford Wright).
That record means the distribution bond has built up nearly Pounds 1.4bn
under management, making it the second largest managed bond on the market
(behind Allied Dunbar with nearly Pounds 1.9bn). Richard Needham, of Sun
Life, says: 'The bond's success has been that it has managed to deliver what
it set out to achieve  - consistent and increasing income, with capital
appreciation.' The fund's annual distribution has been cut only once, in
1981.
The minimum investment in the distribution bond is Pounds 5,000; the initial
charge is 5 per cent. Extra units are allocated for those who invest over
Pounds 15,000, effectively reducing the initial charge by 1 per cent. Sun
Life has now launched companion bonds  - deferred distribution (where income
is automatically reinvested) and retired distribution (designed for pension
contributions).
Other managers have followed Sun Life into the market. Skandia, which offers
a bond run by Schroder, says the unit price on its bond has risen by 16 per
cent since the launch on June 1. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000.
There is no initial charge on the fund, but there are early encashment
charges which start at 6 per cent in year one and dwindle to nothing in year
six.
Allied Dunbar's distribution bond pays income monthly, quarterly,
half-yearly or yearly. Investors can take withdrawals as a fixed percentage
each year, as a fixed amount of cash each year, or simply the amount (as
with other bonds) distributed. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and
the initial charge is 5 per cent.
The Prudential's distribution bond, launched in August, also requires a
minimum investment of Pounds 5,000. The initial charge is 5 per cent and
there are extra allocations of units for investments of Pounds 10,0000 and
above.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Before looking
round, check what your company has to offer - Going early, The health factor
/ The cost of retaining the protection of private medical care, just when
you may need it most, is high, and the choice of schemes is bewildering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE MEDICAL insurance is part of many remuneration packages. But if you
have never needed to use it, it may be easy to overlook its value by the
time you are offered early retirement.
However, this is likely to happen at just the age when premiums start to
rise steeply and you are increasingly likely to need to make a claim.
Adjusting to the changed lifestyle of retirement can be stressful  - some
newly retired people find their health collapses in the first few months.
So how can you ensure that you do not lose the protection of private health
care just when you may need it most?
When you are negotiating your leaving package, avoid being so taken up with
cash sums that you forget the fringe benefits. The annual premium for
comprehensive private medical cover can be up to Pounds 1,000 for a
55-year-old, and Pounds 1,500 or more for a 65-year-old  - quite a chunk out
of your pension if you have to find the money yourself. If your spouse also
needs to be covered, premiums will be even higher.
One bright spot is that private medical insurance premiums attract tax
relief for UK residents aged over 60, though, to be eligible for this, the
policy may need to be adapted  - for example, any cash benefits for stays in
NHS hospitals are ruled out.
When faced with early retirement, the first thing to do is check what your
company can offer by way of continuing the medical cover that you have
received during employment. Most employers should be able to continue cover
until the annual renewal date for the corporate policy, giving you several
months to look around for an alternative.
Some companies will continue to provide health cover for pensioners in the
group scheme, and pay for it throughout retirement, though this is an
expensive option which only a few employers still offer. Changes to
accounting standards will soon mean that companies have to allow for future
health costs for pensioners on their balance sheets, which may make them
more reluctant to extend cover.
Other companies include pensioners in the company scheme, but only if they
pay their own contributions. This can work out cheaper than arranging cover
individually.
The big advantage to staying with a company scheme is that the older you
get, the more likely you are to have existing medical problems. If you join
a new scheme, most insurers will exclude existing conditions, while one or
two will cover some existing conditions but premiums will rise. Staying with
the same insurer means that any problems will still be covered, at no extra
cost  - this may be the only feasible option if you have made many claims in
the past.
A third possibility is that employers may have negotiated special terms with
their insurer for former employees, but you have to arrange an individual
policy. Check whether cover is treated as continuous, or you are treated as
a new applicant and underwritten from scratch. If you have had any health
problems, this could make it expensive.
Company-arranged schemes can be good deals if you don't want the effort of
shopping around, and the type of cover is what you want. However, if you
suspect the premiums are higher than for comparative policies, or you think
you would be happy with a more basic (and cheaper) level of cover, this
could be the time to start looking elsewhere.
If you have a husband or wife still at work, check whether it would be
possible to get health cover through their employer. If the scheme is
non-contributory, this would obviously be worthwhile. However, if your
partner is also due to retire soon, you could just be postponing the
problem.
Going into retirement, you may be more interested in the peace-of-mind
aspects of private medical insurance than the luxury hospital rooms and fine
food offered by top-of-the-range policies. If you are mainly worried about
long NHS waiting lists for non-urgent surgery, such as hip-replacement
operations, you may be interested in the many low-cost healthcare policies
on the market.
However, low-cost policies come in many different guises. The two principal
devices for reducing costs are cash limits: ie medical expenses are only
covered up to Pounds 15,000 or a similar figure every year, or by limiting
private treatment to cases when you would have to wait for more than six
weeks for treatment under the NHS.
Jan Lawson, of specialist advisers Private Health Partnership, says that
both systems have their drawbacks. If there is a cash limit, it can be
worrying to think that funds may run out half-way through your treatment
should it be more complicated than expected, or that some major surgical
procedures may not be covered.
The six-week rule should mean that you will always get treatment within six
weeks, whether on the NHS or privately. However, the six-week wait is
usually counted from the day that a consultant says you need the operation.
You may have to wait months, or even more than a year, for a consultant's
appointment for some specialities in the NHS. If you opt for a six-week-rule
policy, you may have to be prepared to pay for a private consultation
yourself, or be faced with a long initial wait.
Before you sign up for any policy, make sure you know that what is really
necessary is covered, and don't be distracted by extras which aren't really
necessary but make a policy look more comprehensive than it is.
Jan Lawson gives a final word of warning: if you are choosing a new policy,
don't just base your decision on the premiums for your age now. Look at the
premium table for people five or 10 years older than yourself. Premiums can
rise very steeply after the age of 60 with some insurers, almost doubling by
the age of 65, so the best buy now may not be a good deal at all in a few
years' time. You could be better off going for a slightly more expensive
option now, with premiums which rise much more gradually.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Nothing till
you're 65 or 60 - Going early, State pensions / Moreover, early retirement
can seriously reduce your state entitlement  - but all is not lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE assume that they will automatically receive the full basic state
pension. But this is not the case.
Your pension depends on several factors, including the number of years you
have paid National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the length of your
working life. Early retirement can seriously reduce your state pension if
you do not take preventive action.
For the 1993-94 tax year, the full basic or 'old age' state pension is
Pounds 56.10 a week for a single person. To qualify for this rate, you must
have paid Class 1 (employee) NICs for about 90 per cent of your working life
(minimum 27 years). Class 2 (self-employed) and Class 3 (voluntary) NICs
also count. If you have paid less than this, your pension will be reduced.
The minimum state pension is 25 per cent of the full rate, and for this you
need at least nine qualifying (full) years. Incomplete years do not count.
Women who pay the reduced-rate NIC  - the 'married woman's stamp'  - do not
build up a right to the state pension. However, both men and women who do
not qualify can usually claim the spouse's pension under their husband's or
wife's NIC record. The married couple's pension (single plus spouse's
pension combined) currently is worth Pounds 89.80 a week.
If you want to find out what your state pension will be  - and this will be
particularly important for those planning to retire early  - the Department
of Social Security (DSS) operates a 'pensions forecast' service *, which
provides a detailed breakdown of your entitlement. If you give up work
early, or have previous contribution gaps, you should find out whether you
can pay voluntary NICs to protect your pension. Men aged 60 or over, in
retirement and earning less than Pounds 2,800 a year, and therefore not
liable to pay NICs, should receive NI credits up to age 65. Your local DSS
office will advise on these points.
Early retirers should note that the state pension is not paid until they
reach 65 (men) or 60 (women). The spouse's pension is not paid until the
main claimant reaches pension age. Some company schemes make good this
pension shortfall  - such a 'bridging pension' is usually equivalent to the
single state pension, and paid from the date of retirement until state
pension age.
In addition to the basic state pension, there is an earnings-related pension
known as Serps (State earnings-related pension scheme), which was set up in
1978. Employees who have spent part or all of their career with companies
that do not offer a 'contracted out' occupational scheme automatically would
have paid in to Serps through their NICs.
Unlike the basic state pension, a right to Serps builds up from day one. The
total value, however, will again depend on the contribution period, and
these details will be given in your DSS pension forecast. Serps is also paid
from age 60 for women and age 65 for men. If you worked between 1961 and
1975, you may also qualify for a graduated retirement benefit.
* For a pension forecast, ask at your local DSS office for form BR 19. Each
forecast takes between three and six weeks to process, longer if you are
widowed or divorced. The DSS publishes several useful leaflets. Ask for 'A
guide to retirement pensions' (NP46), 'Retiring' (FB6) and 'NI voluntary
contributions' (NI42). There is also a free telephone advice service: ask
for Freeline Social Security on 0800 666555.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): A time to play
safe - Going early, Investing the lump sum / Anxiety may follow the thrill
of commuting part of your pension for tax-free cash. Three professional
advisers suggest ways to regain peace of mind

ANYONE WHO takes a proportion of their pension scheme benefits as a lump sum
faces a hard choice: how best to invest it for retirement? writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
We asked three independent financial advisers what their prescription would
be for a couple, Mr &amp; Mrs FT, aged 60 and 56, who had Pounds 100,000 to
invest as a result of Mr FT's having commuted part of his pension for
tax-free cash.
They have few other assets, apart from capital in the building society. In
retirement, Mr FT will remain a higher-rate taxpayer, but Mrs FT has no
sources of income.
John Edwards, consultant at Berry Birch &amp; Noble says: 'There are no hard and
fast rules about the best way of investing the lump sum when taking a
pension. It all depends on individual circumstances.
'For some people, the best bet is a 'negative' investment. By reducing
expensive borrowings, particularly credit-card debts, and reducing a
mortgage to at least the Pounds 30,000 level, you are taking full advantage
of the tax-free lump sum, because you pay tax on most investments.
'The amount of income which has to be generated will obviously be a key
consideration. But this has to be balanced with long-term protection against
inflation. You should also take into account the terms of the pension you
are receiving. How well are you protected against inflation? Most
final-salary company pension schemes these days have some form of
index-linking, but the annual increases awarded by the trustees is seldom
sufficient to cover 'real' inflation.
'Taxation also has to be taken into account. Your investment strategy should
recognise that there is no way round paying tax on pensionable income.
'Finally, there is the level of risk. You have to bear in mind that your
life savings are at stake, so spreading risk is a key ingredient. You always
need an emergency short-term cash reserve, which these days is best provided
by a building society postal account. Other risk-free investments include
National Savings products, and possibly guaranteed income bonds, as well as
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas).
'Gilts and permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBs) can provide a high level
of income, but they are taxable and there is a real danger of a fall in
capital value. Index-linked gilts, and also National Savings certificates,
provide good protection against inflation. However, they might be left
behind if interest rates rise sharply in the years ahead.
'Single-premium investment bonds can be flexible in providing income and/or
capital growth, because of the freedom to withdraw 5 per cent of the
original investment 'tax free' over a period of 20 years. However, the
current low interest rates make the traditional annuity-backed income or
capital growth plans less attractive at present.
'At the top end of the risk scale, personal equity plans have the great
advantage of being tax free. Investment or unit trusts help spread risk, as
do managed portfolios.'
Richard G Boyton, managing director of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'I
continually stress to clients that it is total return that counts; that is,
both income and capital gain. Mr and Mrs FT are not in a position to take
unnecessary risks.
'The majority of the portfolio would be Mrs FT's name, producing income of
Pounds 2,742 which is still within her single person's tax allowance, and
the income in her hands will remain tax free. I suggest Pounds 20,000 in
GT's Dublin-based International Bond Fund; and Pounds 12,000 in each of four
large well-known solid investment trusts, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Alliance,
Electric &amp; General and Murray International. All have impeccable pedigrees
and currently stand at a discount to their net asset values.
'Another Pounds 7,000 should be invested in Henderson Strata, which is a
smaller companies trust, and a further Pounds 7,500 in the ECU investment
trust.
'I would invest Pounds 17,500 in Mr FT's name, by placing Pounds 7,500 in
zero-dividend preference shares, through the Exeter Zero Dividend Preference
Fund, which is a unit trust of zero-dividend preference shares, and Pounds
4,000 in the capital shares of the Fulcrum split-level investment trust,
which could prove to be particularly beneficial as the UK market continues
to move ahead, due to the underlying gearing.
'The balance of the portfolio is invested in a Killik self-select Pep, using
Morgan Grenfell's Equity Income investment trust, giving Mr FT income on a
tax-free basis, since he is a higher-rate taxpayer, but I can see no point
in recommending one for Mrs FT, as her single person's tax allowance remains
under-utilised.
'With this strategy, 73 per cent of their assets would be invested in
equities, and 28 per cent in gilts, bonds or zero dividends. There would
also be a good geographical spread: 50 per cent in the UK, 21 per cent in
the US and North America, 7 per cent in Japan, 16 per cent in Europe, and
the balance (6 per cent) elsewhere.
'The total overall gross income, including the Pep, amounts to Pounds 2,904,
being a gross yield of 2.9 per cent. If they want more 'income', they should
be aware of what I call 'vertical segregation'. If, for instance, a client
has purchased 10,000 Pounds 1 shares and saw them grow to Pounds 1.20, the
growth would amount to 20p per share. Spending of capital is therefore not
necessarily detrimental.'
Mark Bolland, of London-based Chamberlain de Broe, fee-based independent
financial advisers, says: 'The first question is: what is their target
income, taking into account the income provided by the annuity which they
will have had to take out if they had a personal pension? An escalating
joint life annuity will offer protection against inflation, so we can look
for an increase to the overall income throughout the lives of the FTs.
'At some stage, independent taxation has to be brought into the frame. There
is no problem with age allowances at the moment, but when the couple reach
65 they will need to be careful not to lose allowances unnecessarily.
'It would be sensible, at this stage, to have part (or all) of the tax-free
cash invested in Mrs FT's name, to make use of her personal allowances and
maximise the net income. While the pension itself (during Mr FT's life) can
only be taxed in his hands  - he cannot appoint any of the income to his
wife  - he can, if he wishes, have all of the tax-free cash invested in her
name.
'Since annuity rates are low at the moment, we would be looking to generate
an income with as much capital protection as possible. The 'generator'
concept of improving the yield from a portfolio is the most pragmatic way
forward.
'Basically, the idea is to split a fund into two parts, one of which would
be responsible for income; the other, growth. The income part would normally
use ordinary deposits or temporary annuities, depending on the interest
rates available. It is a 'sinking' fund being fully depleted by the end of
the term. The growth part is then given the job of growing and providing
long-term capital protection.
'The reason for working like this is that there are a number of vehicles and
investments that cannot really be used for income because of their
structure; for instance, National Savings, the BES and indeed anything that
requires a particular term of investment. These vehicles, though, are often
ideal for a 'portfolio', because of the returns offered and tax-efficiency
 -but they are five-year investments. Therefore, to make the most of these,
it is necessary to gear up the income being generated elsewhere.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Can you afford
to retire? - Low interest rates have introduced a new hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF WORK was such a wonderful thing, someone once said, the rich would keep
it to themselves. Many people are only too eager to give up their daily
stint at the office. A Norwich Union survey found, for example, that two out
of three workers want to retire before they are 60, writes Philip Coggan,
Personal Finance Editor.
Early retirement brings its financial headaches, however. Someone retiring
at 55 could easily live for another 35 years  - longer than the time they
had been in work.
They could find that they spend more, not less, after retirement; after all,
being at work stops you spending money. According to Norwich Union, four in
five people expect to spend more on holidays once they retire. Three
quarters expect to move to more comfortable surroundings.
With a greying population, the state is not likely to be able to afford very
generous retirement benefits: most people expect the government to opt for
an equalised pension age of 65 for men and women. Furthermore, the number of
people who work all their lives at one company, and retire on two-thirds of
their final salary, is extremely limited; Laurentian Financial Group puts it
at 1 per cent. In any case, final-salary schemes, where the employer bears
all the risk, are gradually giving way to money-purchase schemes, where the
eventual pension depends on the investment performance of the fund.
In short, those who want to retire early may need to depend on their own
savings efforts. But how many realise this? Laurentian found that 35 per
cent of workers (including 31 per cent of those over 55) had no idea what
their pension would be.
Even those who have been assiduously saving over the years may have a false
idea of the amount of income they can earn on their capital. Too many people
have a mental '10 per cent' rule, and expect that kind of return on their
money. But earning 10 per cent these days probably requires you to eat into
your capital.
Now that base rates have dropped, and we appear to be in an era of low
growth and low inflation, 5 per cent net may be the best that savers can
expect to earn without eroding their capital. In other words, for every
pound of income you expect to earn from your savings in retirement, you need
to have 20 in capital. To earn Pounds 10,000 a year from savings, you must
build up a capital sum of Pounds 200,000.
Those who have built up adequate provision through a personal pension may
still find the timing of early retirement a bit of a gamble. Most of the
pension fund must be used to buy an annuity, which will provide income for
the rest of the individual's life. Annuity rates are set with reference to
yields on long-term gilts; if you lock in while yields are low, your income
suffers. And if you die one day after buying the annuity, the capital could
be lost.
These drawbacks have led to the concept of staggered vesting, the pensions
buzzword of the moment. It allows receipt of pension benefits to be phased
over several years. But staggered vesting is not a cure-all and, as Eric
Short explains below, its suitability depends on circumstances.

FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Check what you
lose for years not worked - Going early, The pension choice / And before
taking a cash sum, consider carefully whether your reduced pension will be
adequate
</HEADLINE>

AS MORE employees, particularly men, stop work early, either voluntarily or
through redundancy, they inevitably wonder whether their pension will be
adequate.
The early-retirement benefits available from occupational schemes are set
out in the trust deed and rules. In final-salary schemes, the
early-retirement pension is usually based on a formula which takes account
of the number of years' service to retirement and the employee's earnings at
or near retirement, less a reduction which is related to the number of years
between the early and normal retirement dates.
The reduction may be made on an actuarial basis, to allow for the pension's
being taken early and for a longer period on average, and because fewer
contributions will have been paid and fewer years will have been available
to build up the fund.
The reduction could be as high as 6 per cent in respect of each year  - a 30
per cent reduction for an employee with a normal retirement age of 65 but
who retires at 60.
Many schemes make a less severe reduction  - 3 or 4 per cent for each year
year  - even though this means that each early retirement will cost the
scheme a substantial amount of money. Some may even make nil or nominal
reductions for retirement taken within two or three years of normal
retirement, usually to encourage early departure.
But, as a typical example, an employee in a scheme that provides a pension
of 1/60th of final earnings for each year of service, and who would attain
30 years' service by age 65, would receive a pension of half (30/60ths) his
final earnings at 65. But if he takes early retirement at 60, then his
pension would be 25/60ths of his earnings at 60, less a reduction which
could vary between 5 per cent and 30 per cent of the pension.
If employees take early retirement as a result of being made redundant, then
many schemes provide more favourable benefits through lower reductions and
the crediting of additional years of service.
Employees have the option to convert part of their pension to a tax-free
cash sum, up to the limits set by the Inland Revenue. The benefit statement,
available on request for early retirement, would set out the alternatives of
a full pension or a cash sum plus reduced pension.
Employees need to consider carefully whether the reduced pension will be
adequate before they take the cash sum; or, if they do take it, they must be
prepared to invest the money to boost their income.
Remember that there are no provisions for state pensions to be paid on early
retirement before the state pension age, though employees taking early
retirement may no longer need to pay National Insurance contributions.
This has financial implications for those who take early retirement under
schemes which integrate their benefits with state pensions  - that is, the
pension is based on earnings less a deduction in recognition of the fact
that they will also receive a state pension.
Consequently employees in schemes with integrated benefits, and who retire
before reaching state pension age, face a pension shortfall until they do
reach that age and receive the state pension. This shortfall is more likely
to affect men, who have to wait until they are 65 to receive their state
pension, than women who receive it at 60.
However, many schemes now provide an additional 'bridging' pension,
generally based on the single person's state pension, for employees affected
by this shortfall, until the state pension becomes payable.
Bridging pensions are usually paid only if retirement is taken on or after
the employee reaches 60. Therefore women in these schemes do not receive a
bridging pension  - a fact which has led to complaints about discrimination.
However, the Advocate General's opinion, on a case before the European Court
of Justice, is that schemes could pay bridging pensions to men and not
women, because the combined pensions would be equivalent.
If an employee is taking early retirement because of ill health, then the
benefits, set out in the trust deed, are likely to be more favourable than
normal early retirement benefits.
Meanwhile, employees who take early retirement do have an alternative course
of action. They can opt for a deferred pension (the benefit available when
an employee leaves the scheme), and, if there is more than a year to normal
pension age, take a transfer value to another, personal pension,
arrangement. Some schemes may be willing to pay a transfer value during the
year before normal retirement.
There is no normal pension age with personal pensions. The benefits can be
taken at any time between the 50th and 75th birthdays (both inclusive), and
between the 60th and 75th birthday on retirement annuity contracts. However,
the earlier that benefits are taken, the smaller will be the cash sum and
the lower the annuity rates (which are related to age) at which a pension is
bought.
Individuals taking the benefits have to decide what type of annuity to buy:
level; increasing; on the individual's own life, or with a spouses's
benefit?
Provision of a spouse's benefit or an increasing annuity means that the
annuitant must accept a starting value lower than that provided by a
single-life level annuity. He must compromise between the initial payment
from the annuity, the level of future increases and provision of a spouse's
pension.
However, an alternative approach is available: it is known as 'staggered
vesting', or a phased annuity. The individual uses the flexibility of
cash-in on personal pensions and the facility to take tax-free cash sums.
He decides on the level of net income that he will require in the first
year, then cashes in enough of the personal pension to ensure that some of
the tax-free cash, together with the after-tax value of an annuity purchased
with the balance, provides that income. In this way, the tax-free cash sum
provides part of the income requirements.
This process is repeated each year, with the income from an increasing
number of annuities, plus the tax-free cash sum and the new annuity,
providing the target income.
If investment conditions and annuity rates have been favourable, by the time
the individual reaches 75 and has to cash in what is left in the personal
pension, there should be sufficient value to provide a substantial cash sum
and annuity.
However, staggered vesting needs to be operated on an individual basis each
year, with financial advisers taking a fresh look at clients' requirements,
rather than used as a package, which is the present method of marketing the
concept.
Employees who take early retirement from an occupational scheme can make use
of staggered vesting by taking the transfer option and investing in a
personal pension. The protected-rights element of the personal pension will
have to be taken at normal pension age. But the individual can apply
staggered vesting to the remainder.
